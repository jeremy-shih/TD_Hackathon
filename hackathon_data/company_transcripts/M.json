Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead, Ma'am.","Karen M. Hoguet","Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.","Sales in the first quarter were $6,387,000,000 or up 4% over last year. On a comp basis, sales were up 3.8%. Given the unusually cold weather in the quarter, we were very pleased with our sales performance. Our business was weakest in the quarter with our most budget-conscious customers, as well as our upscale customers at Bloomingdale's. On the other hand, sales in the core of the Macy's business remained quite strong in the quarter as reflected in our overall comp performance.","Remember also that as we transition our athletic footwear business to become a licensed department operated by Finish Line, this will negatively impact our reported sales performance throughout the year. This was particularly relevant in the year during which the businesses converted because sales of athletic footwear were obviously included in last year's sales numbers, but are not in this year's.","In addition to Finish Line, as you know, we have also licensed some of our apparel and accessories space at Bloomingdale's, and we have added licensed shops for a few luxury vendors here at Herald Square. So if we calculate comp sales, including the sales of licensed businesses in both years, our comp sales performance would have actually been 6\/10 higher or 4.4%.","Our strongest merchandise categories continued to be handbags, watches, active apparel, men's, home textiles, luggage, furniture and mattresses. Cosmetics and shoes both had a good quarter, but not as strong as the other businesses mentioned. Women's apparel and our Millennial business remained challenging in total, but we have seen some encouraging signs in parts of these categories. For example, we did see strength in opening price point apparel, suits and dresses, junior dresses and in many of our major market and private brands.","Geographically, our business continued strongest in the South. We believe this in part resulted from the unseasonably cold weather in the northern half of the country. Our Internet and omnichannel businesses also continued to fuel added growth. As you know, we are no longer breaking out online sales because of the integration in our business between online and in-stores. The more we collaborate between our channels and utilize inventory across the company to satisfy customers, the more opportunities we are finding to improve our overall performance.","Average unit retail in the quarter was up 2.5%, with transactions up 1.7% and units per transaction down slightly. Gross margin rate in the quarter was flat with last year at 38.8%, with merchandise margin up slightly. Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 3% over last year, consistent with our expectations.","SG&A in the quarter was $2,041,000,000, up 2.3% over last year. And as a percent of sales, SG&A was 32.0%, reflecting 0.4-point improvement versus a year ago. We are continuing to invest in the growth of our dot-com businesses, store fulfillment and other omnichannel strategies. These investments were offset in part by stronger-than-expected credit performance.","Credit income in the quarter was $166 million or roughly $23 million over last year, due primarily to lower losses, particularly bankruptcies. This increase is in fact above what we had expected for the full year. We now expect the credit income to be up over last year by a similar amount in the second quarter, and up but by a whole lot less in the fall season.","Our penetration of our proprietary card was 45.3% in the quarter, which is flat to a year ago. Operating income in the quarter was $435 million, up 11% over last year and 40 basis points as a percent of sales. Interest expense was $97 million, $15 million below a year ago, and pretax income was 21% above a year ago. The tax rate in the quarter was 35.8%, up slightly over last year. We still expect that the effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 36.95%. But as you know, the rate in any quarter is going to be impacted by the timing of settlements and other discrete items.","Net income in the quarter was $217 million, up 20% over last year. Average diluted share count was 30 -- 394.5 million shares, which is 30 million or 7% below last year due to our ongoing repurchase activity. During the first quarter, we bought back approximately 8.4 million shares for a total of approximately $360 million. So earnings per share were $0.55 on a diluted basis, which represents a 28% increase over a year ago. We are very pleased with this result because it combines a strong operating performance, driven both by increases in sales and in profitability, along with the benefits of utilizing excess cash to buy back shares. We believe this quarter demonstrates the power of the Macy's story.","Cash flow continued strong as well, and in the quarter, we generated $191 million of cash from operating net of investing activities. This compares to $63 million last year.","Because of our strong results and our confidence in our future, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, up to $0.25 per share. And in addition, we increased our buyback authorization by $1.5 billion, which is added to the $1.1 billion remaining at the end of the quarter from our prior authorization, so a total of $2.6 billion.","As we look forward, we are not changing our outlook for the year. We are still expecting comp sales of 3.5% for the year and EPS on a diluted basis of $3.90 to $3.95. I would add, though, that while we still expect the second quarter sales to fall below that in the first quarter, we now expect the spread between the first and second quarters to be by less than the 200 to 300 basis points we had mentioned in February. We believe we will get a benefit in the second quarter as the weather finally begins to get warmer.","As I said during our last conference call, we are confident and determined. We are a company that excels at multitasking. We are structured and aligned to improve our performance simultaneously on a number of fronts. So when you think of the potential for us to continue to outperform, you shouldn't just look at one element of the business. Our potential spans categories, stores, online and mobile, Macy's and Bloomingdale's, private, exclusive and market merchandise brands. We are engaging with customers no matter how they shop us; reaching out to diverse multicultural customer groups, whether they are Millennials or part of other demographics; and of course, we continue to manage expense very carefully, optimize our inventories, invest capital wisely and work hard to maximize cash flow. We have so many great assets and so many opportunities for further improvement. I am very proud of our unfolding story of growth at Macy's, Inc. Thank you all for your interest. And now, what questions can I answer?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, could you speak to online growth and the progression of the omnichannel effort as you move closer to 500 doors by year end, just what you're seeing today in the overall progression?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, what we're seeing is obviously the store fulfillment has been a huge success and has allowed us to greatly increase the amount of online orders that we're able to fulfill and satisfy customers. And it's also enabling us to satisfy demand in stores as we do the Search & Send we've talked about, where we utilize store fulfillment to satisfy orders in different stores. So it is a huge success, and is for sure helping fuel the sales growth we're seeing.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then second question, can you just talk a little bit about the mindset as it relates to capital allocation, particularly when I look at your 2.4 to 2.7 debt-to-EBITDAR target, sitting at the low end, and your actions today raising the dividend and buyback. What's the best way to think about this going forward?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think as we've said, maintaining a strong investment-grade rating is important to us. We think we're right about there, sort of in the mid-BBB category, and that's the ratings that we're going to aim to maintain as we go forward. Possible, we may go a bit higher, but I don't think you're going to see any dramatic change in our behavior as it comes to using excess cash. We believe that paying a competitive dividend is important. You saw that this morning with the increase in the dividend, and excess cash beyond that will be used to buy back shares.","Operator","And we will hear next from Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of inventory growth, I was impressed in terms of your management even with the very difficult quarter from a weather perspective. Can you talk about tools, processes, people you have in place in terms of how you were able to manage that so well?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I mean, that's been a strength of ours, particularly since the reorganization. Our merchants are constantly forecasting and re-forecasting the business, and making sure we're taking the markdowns we need to keep the right age of inventory. Because the key to running a retailer is keeping the flow of fresh receipts. So if you're not maintaining the right inventory level, you get backed up, particularly in periods like we've seen with the unseasonably cold weather. So I think our merchants have done a terrific job managing the inventories and keeping fresh goods coming into the stores.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then can you talk about the timing of the launch of the 13 Millennial brands, and I think the expansion of the existing 11 as well?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes -- no, I think we're probably midway through those launches. I haven't actually counted which ones, but having seen some of them in the stores last week, they look terrific, and so far so good in the stores where we're testing them.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, can you talk about the licensing opportunity and how it's changing your model and access to product?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, where there's a category or a vendor, but let's speak category for a minute, where we don't think we can get the best product for our customers, a license deal like Finish Line makes a huge amount of sense. If you think about it, they have access to shoes that we couldn't get as Macy's. And so, it's obviously greatly enhancing our assortments, which as you know, is the key in our mind to being successful in retail. Also, they have a great selling model, which I think will also benefit us. So should there be other categories or parts of the business where those -- that situation exists, another one by way is obviously Sunglass Hut. We might license something else, but I don't see it becoming a huge part of the business.","Operator","And we will hear next from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","If you could just speak to a little bit Q1 and if there was any sort of improvement as you worked your way through the quarter and we got some warmer temperatures, or if you can speak to the way Q2 started? And then, we're just trying to figure out how to think about Q1 and Q2 sales relative to one another. I know you expected less of a delta relative to the 200 to 300 basis points, but if you could give us any guidance on that, that would be helpful.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, everyday we see warm weather the business gets stronger in those categories that are impacted by weather -- things like apparel, sandals, things like that. So we're fairly confident that when it gets warm, business will improve. At the end of the first quarter, we had expected first quarter sales to be increased to be higher by 200 to 300 basis points than the second quarter. We don't now think that delta will be as great. We still think the first quarter will be higher than the second quarter, but not nearly by that amount, again, because of the weather shift.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Karen, just 2 questions. One, the weakness that you spoke of at the low end as well as the high end or with the Bloomingdale's customer, I'm wondering if that showed up as a traffic issue, perhaps conversion, maybe both, or was it more about the ticket size? And then second, you've talked in the past about your view of SG&A and credit and how you look at those 2 and manage expenses based on what credit is doing. And I'm wondering which specific buckets you feel that you can flex, as you look to the back half of the year where you expect credit to be less of a tailwind, what are the buckets that you can flex most easily?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, in terms of -- Bloomingdale's did have a challenging quarter. I can't speak to the question specifically that you asked. In part, because Bloomingdale's is a more contemporary fashion retail, they have been hurt more by the general weakness in the feminine apparel area. I think also the fashion today is quite a bit younger, which may be less appealing to the broader Bloomingdale's customer. That may be a piece of it. So again, we're not sure, but they did have a more challenging quarter. On the other end of the spectrum, we are seeing some weakness amongst our more budget-conscious, what we call deal-hunting customers. But the truth is, you really should be focusing on the overall strength of the Macy's business, because obviously we had a great comp in spite of this. On the SG&A side, we're constantly managing expense, and obviously the good news in credit helped us quite a bit in the quarter. But we would expect to continue to have good SG&A performance as well in the back half of the year.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Are there specific buckets, though, that you look to first to flex up and down as you see credit come in better or worse?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't -- we wouldn't -- we don't change the SG&A because of  credit going up or down. I mean, I -- we just are constantly trying to manage SG&A as aggressively as we can, but not in response to what we're seeing on the credit side.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Karen, just kind of curious how your private labels performed during the quarter, and if the weakness that you saw at the low end was more in private label or in branded goods?","Karen M. Hoguet","No -- well, actually, we had a very good quarter in private label and interestingly, particularly the opening price point. But often, the opening price point doesn't necessarily mean the lower-end customers. So you've got to be careful. Because again, our opening price point goods are really just giving great value to every customer, but private brands had a very good quarter.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. And your new collections in Millennial, I think you spoke very briefly to that, but just wondering if you can talk about some of the early reads and feedback you're getting? And if and when it has been positive, would it possibly affect or change your view of orders for fall, perhaps increasing the waiting in that category or...","Karen M. Hoguet","No, I don't think so. I mean, we feel good about the brands. They look great on the floor, really bringing life both to the mstylelab or the junior floor. And the Impulse areas that we're creating look terrific, largely because the new product, and even the older products that we're buying differently, really making progress. But as we've said, don't expect it to have a big impact on growth until next year. This year, we're just rolling it out slowly and testing and learning.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. Got it. And final question, number of Finish Line departments at the end of the quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's a tough question. Jeff, I don't know the answer. We'll get back to you. I think it's around 20, but I'm not positive.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Swinand with Morningstar Investment Research.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess as you look out, just maybe a couple of years, 3, 4 years on the online investment, do you feel like you're in a heavy investment period and then eventually that should start to slow down? Or do you feel like the way the business is going now, this is just kind of the ongoing run rate and you'll continue to invest online [ph], it will leverage with the sales growth, but not in a step or in a lumpy fashion?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, there are lots of lumpy investments being made, but I don't anticipate the total to come down into the future. As we model out our CapEx going forward, we are not assuming a reduction in investment in the online omnichannel world. Now, some of that investment goes into the stores, though, because it's increasing the use of technology within a store. But I don't believe it's going to go down as we move forward.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. But do you think it will leverage a little faster as the sales pick up? Or is it just kind of a steady state...","Karen M. Hoguet","No, I think it's more dollars-related, I mean, how much we're spending. So I mean, again, as we look at our capital budget, we're going to spend about $925 million this year, and I would encourage people to model $925 million to $1 billion for the next couple of years.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And then I feel like I've asked this question a number of times before, but it's always interesting to hear the incremental tactics that you're doing with the My Macy's or some of your operating strategies, and I know you in your prepared remarks said there are new things that you're finding. Can you give us more color on what we have to look for in the future?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, it's interesting. We've been out in stores recently in 3 very different regions, 1 Northern California, 1 Southern California and San Diego, and then McAllen, Texas, last week. And in each region, the amount of opportunities each of the teams is finding to fine-tune their offering, whether it be inseams of pants, colors, size offerings, and even some brands and products, it just gets better and better each year as we go to visit. So continue to focus on that. In other parts of the country, there's other strategies going on. But I think the whole process and the way we're trying to localize what we offer is going to continue to help us drive sales growth as we go forward.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So in essence, it's just smart, local merchandising that you're still finding new ideas on?","Karen M. Hoguet","It is, and we learn more and more about the customers. And by the way, sometimes the customers change. If we look at the number of stores that are Latino-influenced, it's growing significantly since we started 4 years ago. So we also have to be nimble as customers change.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Interesting. And then this is, I admit, maybe a little bit of a soft poll [ph], but I've talked to some people in your team about how this structure is hard to copy and how your competitors probably wouldn't be able to do it. Could you kind of elaborate on that a little for us?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. There's 2 key reasons. Remember, we put the My Macy's planning organization and structure in place at the time we eliminated our regional divisions. So at the time, we were cutting significant expense and what we did is we reinvested part of the savings into building this organization. Had we not had the expense savings that we were generating, I don't think most companies would now add that much expense to their structure to bring this new organization online. More importantly, though, is as we eliminated these divisions, we had access to incredible talent that had been merchants, literally who had worked with vendors in New York no matter where they lived, and having this merchandise and merchandise planning experience going out into these district positions has allowed them to know how to localize the assortments. If we had started from scratch to hire these people, we never would have been able to get the talent that we have in the field.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Karen, I was just hoping to get your updated thoughts on gross margin for the rest of the year. Did you see anything in the omnichannel rollout that made you change your views on either where the shipping pressure would come in or -- and then secondarily, merch margins, do you think they will continue to be flat to up?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, at this point, I really don't see anything changing there. The guidance we had given at the beginning of the year was flattish to down slightly. I'd say the same thing today.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then we saw the total inventory number, but with these -- with the warmer weather in the first quarter, are there any pockets of inventory that you've carried over that you weren't expecting to?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, on any given day, there's pockets of inventory I wish we didn't have. I mean, that happens always regardless of the weather. But there is nothing that we're concerned about in terms of big pockets or major liabilities as we go into the second quarter. We're taking care of those on a timely basis.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on your ratings comment. I really appreciate the thoughts there. But as we think about your leverage target and you've now been trending sort of at the low end of that 2.4 to 2.7, is that where you're comfortable operating? I know in the past you've alluded to the possibility of adding debt, particularly as EBITDA grows, but could we see you in the market to help fund some of your share repurchases? And then just secondly...","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, you could, but we would stay within the ratios.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Should we see the potential for you to trend towards the higher end? Or do you want to stay at the mid to low end of that?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think all I can say is, you know I've said what ratings we'd like to have, we've talked about no dramatic change with what we're doing. But beyond that, I think that's all I really can say.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just one administrative question. Where do you need your cash balance to be to run the business on an ongoing basis?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't even know how to begin to answer that. It changes based on the season and the time of year. Maybe call Matt, and we can take you through it on a month-by-month basis. It's just different.","Operator","Then we'll go to our next question from Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. On -- in the first quarter, the promotional event that moved from the second quarter, was that -- did that trend as expected? Are the consumers still responding to the big promotional events that you're running?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. This was Friends and Family, and it was very successful.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- I guess back to the low-end weakness or even the high-end weakness, are you seeing any competitors be irrational around the weather-risked -- in the categories that have weather risk in them?","Karen M. Hoguet","I can't speak to anything major that we've seen.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question is just, on the women's business, like within women's apparel, just elaborate a little bit more there around the trends that you're seeing, any changes in the trends and sort of, I think, within the suit business, anything that you're doing differently there?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, the suits and suits separates is a category that I think we're finding better product for, that's more appealing to a working woman, which I can attest to myself. So that looks a lot better. So it's -- I think it gets to better assortments. The opening price points are looking better and better, giving value out of the private brands. Active has been very strong, which is part of our Millennial strategy. And some of the major brands, in addition to the private brands had great first quarters. So I say this with some trepidation, but there is some hope that perhaps there'll be improvement in the apparel business as we go through the year and the weather warms up, which obviously would be very helpful.","Operator","And moving on, we have a question from Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","The omnichannel investment, I'm wondering if you can fill us in a little bit about its evolution beyond store fulfillment and what you might be expecting later in the year to help move along omnichannel in relation to the store business and a peek into your plans for 2014?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's a tough question to answer easily. There's a lot of things we're doing to keep growing the omnichannel business. If you think about the fulfillment side going to the 500 doors, will be huge for helping that business. We're also doing a long, long list of things to improve the site itself because having a robust and competitive website is critical to helping with the omnichannel effort. And then the third area, we are beginning to invest more in-store technology to bring some of the best of what we know online into the offline environment. So there's a lot going on and will continue to be as we go forward.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","And how are you blending the omnichannel strategy of merchandising with Facebook, your loyalty program, communicating in that way?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I mean, obviously, the marketing team is operating from an omnichannel perspective. And our merchandising teams are collaborating more and more each day. So everything that marketing does is looking at digital marketing, as well as some of the more traditional forms of direct mail or ROP.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess my first question is, are you seeing any pressure from added promotions at the higher end? It seems like Saks was maybe a little bit more promotional this quarter. Is that impacting your Bloomingdale's business at all?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't know. Without the reporting of monthly sales, we're not quite sure yet, and with us reporting first, we'll see more. It could be. I don't know for sure.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then as a follow-up to Bernie's question, in terms of your sort of social media and the ways that you're reaching out to customers digitally, where are you in terms of specializing that content? And I ask this, I just -- I get a lot of e-mails about things that -- from Bloomingdale's, in particular, but also from Macy's, that I don't feel are particularly targeted to me. Where do you find yourself in that evolution?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we have made enormous progress. However, we're still right in the beginning phases and getting better and better at doing that, both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's, clearly a high priority for both sides.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just one final one. Any update on how you're thinking about concession shops? I know there are a couple at Herald Square that have been rolled out. How does that impact, or does it have any impact on the rest of the chain? Are you  thinking about concession shops for the rest of Macy's or Bloomingdale's?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think you heard me say sort of from an administrative accounting perspective, as we convert, it does hurt the comp sales, so we talked about the fact that comps would have been 60 basis points higher had we kept everything as own business. But more importantly, what we think is that these leased businesses or licensed businesses are enabling to offer our customers better assortments, and that's really the key. As you've heard me say repeatedly, it all starts with product. And any way we could give the customer a better offering, we will do it.","Operator","And we will go to our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So a question on the full year guidance. You mentioned that the credit benefit was better than expected and you expect that to continue in 2Q. I mean, from my just quick calculation, that was probably a benefit of about $0.06 to earnings, kind of relative to the initial view that you provided. Is there anything we need to be thinking about or aware of, that is kind of offsetting that flowing through?","Karen M. Hoguet","I can't comment on that specific calculation, but it's the first quarter. There's just no reason to be changing estimates at this time.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then could you provide just an update on the Bloomingdale outlets and what you're seeing there? Is the expectation still just for, I think you said 4 new stores this year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, no, it's not 4. It's just Rosemont and Chicago. And I would say, the results are doing better. As you know, we're trying to refine the formula, get it right before we roll it out more aggressively, and we're still in the progress of doing that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit -- I think in February you gave us some good metrics on your RFID efforts, but as you think about that longer-term, can you talk a little bit about how that will impact some of the inventory metrics we see outside of the company?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I mean, if you think about RFID, there is a couple of places that it can be particularly helpful. One is going to be in terms of item accuracy for replenishment, and that's, obviously, a big deal because we'll be able to take inventory on a realtime basis and constantly replenish where we don't have the inventory. So that should be a big deal and again, we'll have the capability in all stores this summer, late in the summer. And as the vendors begin to tag the goods, we'll be able to roll that out more and more. The second place is in terms of where we can find goods on the floor, which will help in terms of the store fulfillment that we're doing. It will make that a lot easier to do than today. And as you know, we're also using that technology to help us, what we call, display audit on our shoe floors. So that at the end of the day -- how a woman or actually a man shops for shoes, picks up the sample shoes, wanders with it and puts it down some place. And so, getting the shoe floor back with all of the right shoes in the right places is very cumbersome without RFID. And with the RFID, we've greatly simplified that process and sped it up, so it's really helping our business. And now, we're planning to roll it out not only to men's shoes, but also to luggage. So we're pretty excited about that. So it really helps in 2 ways: on the replenishment side, it should help us grow sales more aggressively; and on the identification, it should help us with some of our store operations.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Interesting. And then can you -- if I could ask you about AUR for a minute. Obviously, we see pretty tough comparisons from last year and that extends into the second quarter. I don't know -- I mean, if the 2.5 you said in the first quarter was where you thought it would be, or does that maybe dovetail to the comments about the low-income consumer being a little weak and maybe you had to get a little more promotional? Or I guess, maybe just where is AUR versus where you thought and is that something that you expect about 2.5 again next quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it's a little bit lower than we had expected, but the answer is really in mix as opposed to the implication that we had to get more promotional. We didn't, or our margin wouldn't be where it is. So I think it's more just a question of the mix of the business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go next to David Glick with Buckingham.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So I had a question about the comp cadence for the year, the 4 5 4 calendar is making it hard to understand. Clearly, you've given us an updated sense of Q1 versus Q2. But in Q4, obviously, the 1 less week between Thanksgiving and Christmas has historically been a negative. In addition, the extra week last year was supposed to be a positive, which really didn't turn out to be. But how can  -- how should we think about kind of Q3 versus Q4 from a higher level? Would you see Q3 above Q4? Or is maybe the opportunity in November from all the disruptions you had a year ago?","Karen M. Hoguet","Wait. Are you talking about comp or...","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Comp, yes.","Karen M. Hoguet","We're not giving guidance by quarter for the fall. We have talked about the impact on total sales in the fourth quarter, but we're not giving a split now between the third and fourth quarter.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Do you have any general comments about kind of how the calendar sets up for Q4, whether you think it's a positive or a negative?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't have any comment.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Felipe Gusons [ph] with Mitsubishi Securities.","Unknown Analyst","2 questions, if I may, this morning. The first one, can you refresh my mind again how much of an overlap you have with the typical Kohl's and JCPenney customer? And then I have a question on liability management.","Karen M. Hoguet","It's a pretty wide question to be asking. I can't quantify the overlap. It's not that high. People tend to think we compete more directly with them than we do, and it varies greatly by family of business.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So it's fair to say that if JCPenney were to be able to stabilize the business and maybe even improve it at some point in time, that you would not see a meaningful impact on your performance, correct?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, there's 2 things that happens. One is the impact of the Penney sales, but also to the degree that they drive more traffic to the mall, that often can help us.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then the liability management question, Karen. Last year, if I recall correctly, you did a tender for some of your higher coupon debt. Given your strong cash flow and the fact that you still have some of that higher coupon debt outstanding, what is your thinking for this year? Might you still launch another tender? And then kind of as a subsequent question, what is your average cost of debt right now?","Karen M. Hoguet","I can't comment on that, on our plans. Sorry.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rob Wilson with Tiburon Research.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","I guess last quarter, you talked about a 30 basis-point impact from the licensing of athletic shoes. And today, you've stretched that to 60 basis points. Can you let us know maybe what changed in the last 3 months?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think it's a different definition actually. The 30 basis points was, if we took athletic shoes out, and it was only athletic shoes, the 60 basis points includes all of the licensed businesses and also includes them in the calculation. So it's just a different calculation.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rick Snyder with Maxim Group.","Rick L. Snyder - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","The gross margin being flat, I thought was a pretty good performance because you moved the Friends and Family back, and your comments on shipping, I was expecting it slightly down. Was there something that gave gross margin in the quarter a boost to get it back to flat? And if so, is there an offset in a future quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","I hope not. I agree with you, it was a good performance. But I think it's -- we're expecting it. As we said for the year, flat to down slightly. So I don't mean to imply it will be flat each quarter. We hope so, but we'll see as we go. But I think it really was a terrific performance on the part of the company.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As online continues to become so important, how is mobile integrating into online? What are you learning? And is it different from Bloomingdale's versus Macy's? And just lastly, how does the loyalty programs fitting in and what are you seeing there?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. No, the mobile question is quite interesting because in the old days, you would think online and stores. Today, we've got tablets, we've got smartphones, there's sort of a continuum between a smartphone and a desktop we're thinking about. So how we build our sites and how we think about our marketing program, how we think about search technology, we now have to vary for the various different types of devices -- and clearly, becoming a very important part of our strategy on the mobile and particularly, the smartphones. Tablets are huge, but the smartphones are really what's different because that tends to be with the customer wherever they are, even more so than the tablets. So very exciting. And yes, a lot of what's happening will be different for Macy's or Bloomingdale's, but as you know we try to leverage as much as we can of the infrastructure so that we get the cost benefits across Macy's and Bloomingdale's. On the Loyallist program, I'm -- Dana, is your question the Loyallist program?","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","That's exactly.","Karen M. Hoguet","I think it continues to get better and better. I think the customer has responded very well to it at Bloomingdale's. But we continue to make modifications to make it simpler, easier to understand, easier to track. So it's work-in-process, but we feel very good about it thus far.","Operator","And it appears that there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Hoguet, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks. No, I just want to thank you all for your interest, and if you have any follow-on questions, feel free to call me, call Matt, and we'll do what we can to provide the answers. Thanks.","Operator","And again, that does conclude the call. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation today."],"13771":["Macy's (NYSE:M) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August 14, 2013 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Karen M.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks, Lorie. Good morning, and welcome to the Macy's conference call scheduled to discuss our second quarter earnings. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.","While we are pleased to have reported a 7.5% increase in earnings per share for the second quarter and a 16.5% increase for the first half of the year, we were disappointed with our sales performance in the second quarter. Remember that we had originally planned sales growth 200 to 300 basis points lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter due to the shift in the timing of the Friends and Family event at Macy's. But the trend did end up worse than what we had expected.","We believe that much of our weakness is due to the health of the consumer and the fact that consumers seem to be choosing to make purchases in non-department store categories such as cars, housing and home improvement. Since we're the first to report sales and earnings, it is frankly hard to judge how much of a role the economic conditions played, but we think it was significant.","We also believe, however, that we could have produced a better sales performance, and we are discussing what we could have done differently, both so that we can improve the trend in the third quarter and also so that we can have a great second quarter next year. I'll address this more as we go through the call, but the good news is that we believe we have reacted appropriately and our fall plans now reflect increased marketing, as well as greater recognition, that in today's environment value matters a great deal. So we are turning up the volume on that message for the remainder of 2013.","We believe that the changes we have made will result in improved sales performance this fall. And while it has only been a few weeks, we are encouraged by our early August trends across the country and, particularly, in the back-to-school categories.","I'll now summarize some of the key aspects of our second quarter results, as well as our guidance for the back half of the year, and then I will take your questions.","Sales in the second quarter were $6.1 billion, down 0.8% from last year on a comp basis. Remember, the comp sales do not include any amounts attributable to licensed businesses. If sales and licensed businesses were included in both years, our comp sales would have been up 0.3% or 1.1 points better. As we have discussed, this is the most comparable measure to last year because of the conversion of our athletic footwear business to Finish Line and also the introduction of some new brands at Bloomingdale's and at Macy's Herald Square that are licensed departments.","Sales at Macy's were disappointing in the quarter across the country, although less so in the Southern parts of the country and Hawaii, where weather was less of a factor. Macys.com continued to be strong relative to last year. Bloomingdale's had a very strong second quarter, both in stores and online. This performance was much improved in comparison to the first quarter, which is very encouraging. If we look at the performance by family of business, trends softened relative to the first quarter, pretty much across the board, with businesses that had been strong remaining so on a relative basis. Business in Center Core, especially handbags, continued very strong, as did key home categories, including furniture and mattresses. We also saw strength in key back-to-school categories, including kids and active, although juniors continued to be weak.","Impulse, which is geared to our older Millennial female customer, is beginning to gain traction as we continue to add more new brands. Our 2 most recent launches, Maison Jules, a private brand, and QMack, an exclusive brand by Jones, have both started off very strong.","What was most encouraging in the second quarter, however, was the strengthening in feminine apparel. Sales of career and modern wear to work merchandise were strong, and this bodes very well for the fall. We also did very well in opening price points in the women's apparel area.","Moving on to the areas with weakness. In addition to juniors, we had a tough quarter in shoes, driven by a weak sandals season. We are hoping for a strong boots season, which would improve our overall shoe trend this fall. Cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry and watches all softened in the second quarter relative to the first, but we do feel better when we look at the overall trend in the first half of the year in those categories.","Average unit retail was flat in the second quarter, with transactions down approximately 1.6% and units per transaction up just short of 1%. This is a very different picture than what we had experienced earlier this year. The average unit retail was hurt by the promotions needed to clear through the warm weather inventory, as well as mix, for example, the opening price point of apparel being strong, with jewelry being weak. What was more concerning, though, was the drop in the number of transactions, which is a proxy for traffic. This is in part why we decided to add to our marketing for the back half of the year.","Gross margin in the second quarter was 41.8%, down 10 basis points from last year. This was partially due to additional markdowns needed to clear the seasonal merchandise, given how long it took this year for the weather to turn hot. Also pressuring margins in the quarter were the ongoing costs associated with free shipping. These negative factors were offset in part by higher licensed income.","Inventory at the end of the second quarter was up 6%. This is consistent with what we had expected and reflects the acceleration of back-to-school receipts and receipts of merchandise in our key brands. Planning the timing of receipts is very complicated this year. Because of the 53rd week in 2012, every week on the fiscal calendar is essentially 1 calendar week later. We believe that bringing these goods in fiscal July was right for driving the sales since customers shop on certain calendar days, even if it falls differently on our retail calendar.","SG&A dollars in the second quarter was just short of $2 billion, $10 million less than last year, although up 20 basis points as a rate of sales due to the lower sales. We are very pleased with our expense performance and our ability to minimize the impact on the bottom line of the weaker sales.","In the quarter, we benefited from continued good results from our credit business, which generated $31 million more income this year than last year in the quarter. The credit profitability continues to be driven by low losses and the strength of the portfolio, but we do continue to be challenged by credit penetration, which fell versus last year by 70 basis points in the second quarter. As we look to the fall, we are not anticipating big increases versus last year in credit income. The benefit from credit was offset by our added investment in omnichannel, which we're funding to support the continued growth.","Interest expense in the quarter was $96 million, $9 million lower than last year. Our tax rate in the quarter was 35.8%. As we have discussed, our tax rate will vary by quarter based on the timing of settlements and other discrete items.","Net income in the quarter was $281 million, up $2 million over last year. Average share count on a diluted basis was 389 million shares, down 7% from last year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $0.72, which is 7.5% over last year's $0.67.","For the first half of the year, comp sales were up 1.5%. And if sales of licensed businesses were included, comp sales would have been up 2.4%. Operating income for the first 6 months was up 2.5% over last year and up 10 basis points as a percent of sales. Net income was up 8% over last year, and earnings per share on a diluted basis was $1.27, up 16.5%. While we were disappointed by our second quarter sales, we were pleased that we were still able to produce 16.5% earnings per share growth during the first half of the year.","The cash flow also continued strong during the first half of the year. Cash flow provided by operating activities, net of investing activities, was $348 million, up $103 million over last year. Some of the major variances versus last year were: one, $38 million higher net income; two, $20 million more cash generated from inventory net of payables; and $103 million lower CapEx. We do still expect CapEx for the full year to be approximately $925 million.","Also, the combination of the current income taxes, deferred income taxes and the long-term tax liability, which is in other liabilities, was essentially a wash.","During the quarter, we utilized $446.7 million to buy back 9.2 million shares, so for the first half of the year, we have bought back $806.5 million worth of stock or 17.5 million shares.","As we move on to the fall, we recognize that we are not entering this season with the sales trend that we had expected. However, we have taken actions that we believe will result in stronger trends this fall. We are very excited about the value and the assortments we will be offering our customers, with strengthened marketing to drive customers to our stores and to our websites. Our guidance for the fall is to have comp sales in the 2.5% to 4% range. This would translate to an annual comp increase of 2% to 2.9%. The top end of our guidance is comparable to our expectations at the beginning of the year, with the lower end more reflective of the recent trends. We don't anticipate being able to make up the second quarter shortfall in the back half of the year. And with this lower sales expectation for the year, we are also lowering our earnings per share guidance to $3.80 to $3.90.","Our management team is viewing the second quarter as a speed bump. We do not see this as a change in the momentum that we have accumulated over the past 3 years. Our MOM strategies, My Macy's, omnichannel and Magic Selling, are alive and well. And just last week, we saw a huge amount of excitement at a senior management meeting for the new ideas being developed and executed in the My Macy's localization, omnichannel integration and Magic Selling.","As noted, we have learned from our shortfall in the second quarter in a manner that we believe will improve our trend, not only in the upcoming holiday season, but next spring as well. We realize the environment in which we're operating will continue to be challenging, but we have made appropriate adjustments and have complete confidence in our MOM strategies and in our team's ability to execute at a very high level.","And now, I'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question about the cadence of the sales trends throughout the second quarter, was it weak like from the very start or softened more towards the end?","Karen M. Hoguet","No, it was weak throughout the quarter. May was impacted by the shift in the Friends and Family, so it was a little bit hard to judge. But it was weak throughout the quarter.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And you mentioned that you are encouraged about the August sales today, particularly in back-to-school categories. Could you give a little bit more color? Specifically, is the quarter-to-date trend within your 2.5% to 4% range?","Karen M. Hoguet","I can't comment on the numbers for a couple of weeks, but we are doing significantly better than we were doing in the second quarter in back-to-school, but frankly, across the country and across all the categories. So it really does feel like we're onto a new trend. But again, 2.5 weeks does not make a season.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And lastly from me, you spoke about the marketing approach, the change you're going to have in the second half. Could you just give a little bit more color on what we should expect? Are these sharper discounts across multiple categories? I mean, what should we -- what difference should we see in the marketing and promotional cadence?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, obviously, being sensitive to not sharing data to our competitors. Really, what we're trying to do is communicate more broadly and be more clear and crisp in the communication in terms of how we're offering value. And we're obviously also trying to be very sensitive to the fact that in this environment, price matters. So -- but we're trying to do things in a balanced way, both in terms of brand marketing and also what we call demand. But it really is just stepping up, making our voice louder.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I am wondering if you can just help us think about the second half of the year, and are there any shifts between Q3 and Q4 that we should be thinking about as we're modeling out revenue, gross margin, SG&A? Just help us with the way to think about Q3 versus Q4, if you can.","Karen M. Hoguet","There aren't any significant shifts between the quarters. There's lot of shifts between months within the quarters, but not a lot across the quarters.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So are you expecting a relatively consistent trend in both Q3 and Q4 as you look out to the back half of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, but it is hard to forecast at this point. So we'll provide more insight as we get at the end of the third quarter.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sounds good. And then just lastly, if you could just help us think about inventory levels, both at the end of -- well, particularly at the end of Q3, just given the change in the fiscal quarter end date, that would be great.","Karen M. Hoguet","I think I would focus sort of on year end, which is when the calendar flushes out and it's the same weeks. Q3 could be a similar situation as Q2 given when the fiscal calendar ends versus the regular calendar. But again, our inventory at the end of the second quarter was actually below our plan. So we feel fine about the inventory levels.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And your outlook for year end on inventory?","Karen M. Hoguet","You know what, I don't have that in front of me, but my guess is it's keeping in what we would expect sales to be in 2014.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As we head into the second half, can you speak to any merchandising initiatives that we should watch for in stores? And also, any categories or changes that you think contributed to the upswing in Bloomingdale's that you talked about?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think in terms of what you should see in stores, there's going to be a lot of new brands, as I said, rolled out in the Millennial world, particularly in Impulse, Maison Jules, QMack are the latest. Bar III still looks terrific, that's something I would point to. Looking through ready-to-wear, the assortments are looking better and better. But there's newness in every part of the store, particularly as we head to fourth quarter, and our gifting strategies. I had the chance last week to see the setups of the assortments for the fourth quarter, and there's lots of newness, lots of new items that just look terrific. So we're actually quite excited about holiday for this year.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then secondly, in relation to the overall aggregate comp, anything you saw as it relates to door to store? I think you have 500, is that -- are you at 500 today? And how do you think this can help as we get into the holiday, having 500 stores up and running on door to store?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think what's happening is having increased ability to fulfill demand has been great for the website. It's also great for the stores who can offer inventory that perhaps they don't either carry in that store or that they've run out of. So I think this is a terrific sort of weapon in our arsenal to help grow business this fall, and having 500 doors just increases the probability of satisfying the customer's demand.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As you lap some of the benefits from last year, am I right in thinking that the lower productivity doors, that's where the multiyear opportunity is and that you can basically offer more fashion without taking the inventory risk? Am I right in thinking about that?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, absolutely. One of the good things that has happened from store fulfillment, to your point, Matt, is that we have been able to give some of the smaller doors more fashion, so that if it doesn't sell at the same velocity that we would like, we can use it to satisfy either Internet demand or demand from other stores. But what this is doing, people often talk about downward spirals, this is actually the opposite. And it's making our offerings in our smaller stores more attractive, and that is beginning to gain some momentum. So we think this will help over time. It's still early, but we think this could be a big benefit.","Operator","And we'll go to Steve Kernkraut with Berman Capital.","Steven J. Kernkraut - Berman Capital Management LP","I just wanted to get a bit of sense on some of the e-commerce strategy. You're spending a lot of money in terms of putting the inventory -- having the inventory in store, having a direct shipment, all that kind of stuff. But it's the type of thing where -- what is the return that you're really getting from all that? You're not measuring your dollars, you're not providing the dollars to the investment community in terms of how much your sales have done on e-commerce -- this is probably double-counting, but how do you measure the return on investment of what you're spending there?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we know that the sales growth we're getting is significantly greater because of what we are able to do, not only on the Internet, but with what we're calling these omnichannel transactions, satisfying demand significantly greater. So we know that that's a benefit significant to us. And by the way, if we weren't doing it on the Internet, people would be shopping elsewhere. So...","Steven J. Kernkraut - Berman Capital Management LP","Right, but it's the same rationale. Do you build a new store that's cannibalizing another store or do you rehab an existing store? If you didn't do it, the sales of the store would've gone down. But I mean...","Karen M. Hoguet","Correct, but the key thing is, Steve, we're...","Steven J. Kernkraut - Berman Capital Management LP","You're very comfortable you're getting a return on investment that you desired.","Karen M. Hoguet","Absolutely.","Operator","And we'll go next to Charles Grom with Stern Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Given the comp shortfalls, surprised that the gross profit margins held in as well as they did. I was wondering if you could speak to some of the positive areas that you saw in the quarter. And also, what your expectations are for the back half on the gross profit line.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think the key thing is that the licensed business income is additive to the gross margin and that helped offset not only the lower merchandise margin, but also the added costs associated with the free shipping. So those are really the key components. As we look to the back half of the year, I think we'd still expect gross margins to be flattish, maybe down a touch. And that's consistent with the guidance we've provided all year.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then my second question, on your call in May, you spoke to the budget shopper as an area of softness, and I was wondering if that was a factor here in the second quarter...","Karen M. Hoguet","Kind of what area?","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","The budget shopper, the low-end shopper being an area of softness, I was wondering if that was a factor again here in the second quarter.","Karen M. Hoguet","You know, it probably was. We're trying to dissect that, and that information comes to us a little bit later. But that's my suspicion.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And then just to play devil's advocate, if there's a crowding out effect from housing and from auto sales, just what gives you the confidence that, that really changes in the back half of the year? Or is it just your expectation in some of the things you're going to do on your own can offset that?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we have dealt with what I would call shifting consumer moods many times in our past, and I frankly think we can manage through this as well. So we'll see, but I think you're going to see enough newness in our assortments as we head towards holiday that I think if weather cooperates this year, that could be an added plus. But we feel confident that we'll be able to manage through it. But -- yes.","Operator","We'll go to Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Could you give us a clue or 2 about what exactly created the exciting response at the management meeting?","Karen M. Hoguet","Probably not. But I think what I would tell you is that when we went through all of the offerings, particularly for the holiday season was the focal point, because at this point, back to school is already on the floor in the fall -- the third quarter inventories, it's very exciting. We learn and we get better and better every year with the gifting strategies.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So gifting is part of it. With regard to the e-commerce portion of the business, I know you're not breaking it out, and I'm not asking for that. But could you see a slowdown in e-commerce sort of parallel to your overall sales weakness?","Karen M. Hoguet","With Macy's, we did. It's was still extraordinarily strong, but it also weakened from the first quarter. Bloomingdale's was equally strong as the Bloomingdale's stores. So it's really the brands that had the movement.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","And I'm sorry, in your comments, I really didn't pick up, I wasn't listening closely enough, I guess, about the weakness in budget, and you said you -- in your answer here that you really weren't quite aware of what might have been the cause. But you did say that in women's apparel, the lower price points were selling well. So could you amplify a little bit about the budget price points?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it wasn't budget price points, it was the budget-conscious customers, and they can be at all price points.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. You're seeing value-conscious customers in a way?","Karen M. Hoguet","Correct. Correct.","Operator","We'll go to Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research Investments.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Question on the Finish Line in-line store -- a store within the stores, I'm wondering if those are performing better than expected because it seemed to me at the beginning of the year, you were expecting those departments to have perhaps a 20 or 30 basis point headwind to comps, and it looks like, at least in the second quarter, the impact was over 100 basis points. So I'm wondering, is it the improved performance of the Finish Line departments relative to plan, or is it some of the other licensed departments that you've added at Macy's and Bloomingdale's, Herald Square, you mentioned specifically? And if so, if you could just call out what those departments are?","Karen M. Hoguet","Finish Line is doing extraordinarily well. I have a feeling -- I'm not sure what that 20 basis point reference is to, so I'll have to go back and check and see what that is. But we feel very good about Finish Line, as well as the other businesses.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","And how many departments -- Finish Line departments do you have currently?","Karen M. Hoguet","I'm not sure I know that number specifically. I think at this point, by next year, we're expecting to have 450. But at this point, I think the number is approximately 100.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay, terrific. And one final question real quickly. Can you talk about the drop in credit penetration and what might be the cause there, and if you have any strategies in place to try to bump that up in the back half of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think part of it has been related to some of the new regulations, limiting credit lines and limiting our ability to offer credit to customers. And I think part of it is just related to the overall weakness in the business in the second quarter. So our hope is that we will begin to also improve penetration as the overall marketing increases and the business strengthens.","Operator","We'll go to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just really quickly, as we think about the back half and last year, we were talking about how favorable the calendar was between Black Friday and holiday with the extended, I guess, the extended holiday shopping days. And this year, I think, it's a much shorter calendar. Could you help us to think about what the impact that may have on the holiday outlook as we look to our fourth quarter modeling?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. The truth is, I've heard people argue that it will hurt us this fourth quarter, and I've heard people say that it doesn't hurt us. I think I fall more to the \"it won't hurt us\" because people are going to spend a certain amount of gifts and they'll just have fewer days to do it. Last year, the Christmas season felt like it went forever, and I think the compression may add to more excitement and frenzy, which could help business. But we'll have to see as we get through the fourth quarter.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then you -- I think you called out weather as a potential plus. You've obviously had 2 bad winters in a row here.","Karen M. Hoguet","Two in a row? I'm not sure, but yes.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. And so, can I assume that you're planning the outerwear categories fairly conservatively? And if so, if weather plays ball, maybe some comments on what your big outdoor vendors are telling you as far as being able to help you guys chase\u00a0-- I mean, they've also, obviously, had inventory pressures the past few\u00a0years as well and will probably want to be conservative.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. No, I can't comment on the vendors because I haven't had those conversations. We are planning it conservatively, and we're also talking about what if it goes back to the old days of a typical cold weather and making plans accordingly with the vendors. But I can't comment on any of the specifics.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe finally, just on your saying that\u00a0-- your guess is that you're going to find at the budget-conscious consumer has been your hunch is to what's been sluggish. And as you're adjusting the plan, just so we think about it, is the plan to flow in maybe a higher mix of lower opening price points or is it maybe more to keep the merchandise more consistent, maybe hit the coupons a little heavier which would line up with your step up in marketing comment?","Karen M. Hoguet","Honestly, it's a little bit of both. And part of it is just that we may have moved away too far from some of the opening price points in women's apparel. And so part of it just may be we're finding our strategy in terms of key items.","Operator","We'll go to Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess with the second quarter results and the uncertainty that persists into the back half of the year at this point, what is your appetite for share repurchase, and how has it changed over the first half of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Hasn't changed at all. I mean, we don't see anything changing in terms of the underlying value of the company. And our cash flow continues to be very strong.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And when you look, I guess, in dissecting the business, would you attribute competitive pressures to any of the shortfall?","Karen M. Hoguet","I'm not sure how to answer that. As we moved into the second quarter, we may have waited a bit too long to start marking down the warm weather goods. And I think some of the competition started doing so sooner than we did. That may have caused us to lose some sales in the quarter. I'm not sure. But frankly, as we looked back on the quarter, we were more concerned with things we did or didn't do ourselves as opposed to what competitors were doing.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then the last question is, I think you said broadly speaking, the sales results of Macy's were disappointing. But geographically, either in the second quarter or, I guess, for the last few weeks, in early back-to-school, are there any geographic callouts that you would make for us?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I had said that in the second quarter, the South continued to be stronger than the North. So that's been a continuation, but the South weakened as well in the second quarter. And as we moved into August, everything has gotten significantly better. And it's hard to judge by geography given some shifts in the tax-free weeks. But my sense is that everything has risen in terms of the level of performance.","Operator","And we'll go to Paul Swinand with Morningstar Investment Research.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the -- kind of all the Internet and analytical tools that you're using. I noticed, for example, on your website you've got things that are trending. There's also some talk in the industry about using weather analytics. Are there any callouts or is this just still too early to tell? Are you getting any\u00a0--\u00a0can you give us any color on the effectiveness of some of the Internet and online analytics that you're using and how that might affect sales and markdowns?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we think that having the online analytics helps us to better understand our customer in what we call a 360-degree view, which is very helpful in trying to fine-tune our marketing and how we're sending e-mails. And we're trying to get better and better at personalization. So we do think it's helping, but we're really at the very early stages of utilizing that data.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So it's really first inning?","Karen M. Hoguet","Oh, absolutely.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then real quick, I know you talked a little bit about the outlets and you said transactions are a proxy for traffic. You thought the outlets were a little stronger, but I know in one of the conferences you said your were opening sort of a hybrid in Gurnee here in Illinois. Can you comment any more broadly on the long-term trends? Do you think that the outlet areas are going to continue to drive traffic off mall, still getting more general traffic? Do you think that's going to continue, or it's just a blip in the second quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I didn't comment at all about the outlet business, so let me take a step back. Macy's, we don't have an outlet business. We did open a new store during the quarter in Gurnee Mills, which is an outlet mall that also has some regular retail as well, so let's say regular Macy's store that's opened at Gurnee and has opened incredibly strongly. And if it does well, it's possible that we would open regular Macy's stores in other outlet malls across the country. Bloomingdale's does have outlets, and as I've said on prior calls, we're still refining that strategy. We did open one in the quarter in Rosemont in Chicago, which I've not seen yet, but people who have seen said it's absolutely spectacular and hopefully bodes well for the strategy going forward.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I thought in your\u00a0-- maybe one of the responses to the questions, you said that the traffic to outlet malls was better or you were losing share more to outlets.","Karen M. Hoguet","I didn't say that.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry.","Karen M. Hoguet","No, I'm not even sure what I said. I did not say that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You had talked about some things that you could have done differently in the second quarter. Was that around product, specifically, timing, marketing? What would you attribute that to?","Karen M. Hoguet","Honestly, yes, yes and yes. We've got -- we're very self-critical and we're all perfectionists. And so, even though we can point to lots of things in the economy, in the environment that hurt the business, we are all determined to do whatever we can to improve it. So we looked at things, said, \"Did we have too much reliance in the quarter on regular priced promotion? Should it have been more, what we call, demand promotion? Did we have too much fashion and not a lot of core seasonal merchandise? Did we have enough opening price product to fuel the second quarter? I mean, we went on and on and on, looking at all the things we felt we could do better. And we've made notes for next year in the second quarter and we immediately began fine-tuning our plans for the third and fourth quarter for this year.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then as you look at your inventory balances coming into the third quarter, have you cleared through all of the summer goods that were liable?","Karen M. Hoguet","We have not cleared through it all because, as you know, the weather is still quite hot. But we're where we had expected to be in terms of the clearance. So we are working through that inventory as we had expected.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But we shouldn't expect any carryover gross margin impact into the third quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. Not any different than what we had planned.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at the marketing plans for the back half, are you elevating your spending levels, or are you just changing the marketing message?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. We are spending more. And we, again, started working on this a while ago, and so we were able to offset the added marketing costs in other parts of the business. So it shouldn't be an SG&A issue. But yes, we are accelerating the spend.","Operator","We'll go to Liz Dunn with Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess I'll start with just the improvement that you've seen in the last few weeks. Is that improvement in fall goods, or is that selling through some of the spring summer carryover?","Karen M. Hoguet","Both, but the encouraging part is the new goods. You'd expect us to keep selling summer goods at great values. But the new product has been selling well also.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. In terms of looking at some of these kind of inflection points in the quarter, or maybe they're not inflection points, maybe just anomalies, but as you think about the flattening out of AUR and sort of the slowing in performance of shoes, cosmetics, fragrance, jewelry, watches, can you see sales accelerate in the back half without a change in that trend from the second quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","We can, but we also expect a change in that trend.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. How much is the Center Core as a percentage of your business?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't have that in front of me, but you can find it on the website.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then finally, in terms of those categories that were a little bit softer in the quarter, was that still\u00a0-- was that a factor at Bloomingdale's as well or did those categories perform strongly and consistent with where they had been at Bloomingdale's or even accelerate?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think Bloomingdale's was similar in terms of the change in trend in some of these businesses. But again, other than juniors, which has continued to be weak, we're not overly concerned about the trend change in the second quarter in those businesses as we look at the whole spring season.","Operator","We'll go to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you talk a little bit more about the licensed business opportunities? It seems like it's becoming more important and it seems like it's doing well and adding. How do you see that progressing? And then just lastly, the timing shifts of the event into the first quarter from the second quarter, are there any other timing shifts of events that we should be watching?","Karen M. Hoguet","I'll answer the second question, which is no, as we go through the fall season, so there's nothing -- no major shifts between the third and fourth quarter. In terms of the licensed businesses, I think they provide a great opportunity for us to offer really compelling assortments and categories, where either we can't get the product or we don't have the right selling model. And they've been very successful, whether it be Sunglass Hut or now, Finish Line. In the case of Bloomingdale's and also Herald Square, it enables us to bring in some designers and brands that we can't -- couldn't get on an owned basis. And they're working very well. So we do feel good about it. Will we continue to find opportunities? I think so, and I hope so. Because again, our mission is to provide great assortments of wanted product to our customers any way we can. And if we can't do it ourselves, we love finding partners like Sunglass Hut or Finish Line to work with to bring the best that we can to Macy's and to Bloomingdale's.","Operator","And we'll go to Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions on the credit opportunity, with more advertising or more marketing being front-loaded in the second half, will some of that be directed to signing up more credit customers to try and build the credit card portfolio and the credit card income in the second half?","Karen M. Hoguet","We always invest a lot in doing so, but there's not an increase versus what we had planned originally.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And so your outlook for the credit contribution in the second half is...","Karen M. Hoguet","We think it will be up over last year, but not by a lot.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So at a rate less or above than we saw in the first half?","Karen M. Hoguet","Probably significantly less.","Operator","And we'll go to Stacie Rabinowitz with Consumer Edge Research.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","You had talked a little bit about maybe wishing you hadn't bought quite so many fashion items or maybe I'm misinterpreting you. Could you talk a little bit about how sort of fashion versus basics performed during the quarter, and also, maybe own brands versus some of the labels?","Karen M. Hoguet","Private brands had a terrific quarter. Obviously, always we have some that perform better than others, but we've had terrific success with our private brands in the second quarter, as well as for the spring season in total. And I don't have the data on true fashion versus basics, but we're always fine-tuning that balance. But fashion is obviously very important to the Macy's customer, but also obviously, he or she also needs basic items. So you've got to get it balanced right.","Operator","And we'll go next to Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wondering if you could update us on your thoughts around adding more debt to your balance sheet over the remainder of this year. And then whether there's any change in your sort of thought process around where you want to maintain the leverage target within your range, and whether it's more prudent to keep a little bit more cushioned just given the uncertainty around the remainder of the year.","Karen M. Hoguet","I mean, as you know, we're currently at the very low end of our range in terms of leverage. And as I've said in the past, there's a good chance that we could issue some more debt this year and, again, it will depend on market conditions.","Operator","And we'll go to Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two\u00a0quick questions for you. Number one, Bloomingdale's was very early to see a slowdown in the organization, and now you're saying that it's probably seeing an improvement in its business. Do you think it's acting as an early warning to your organization? And secondly, what are your plans or how are you positioning Macy's to sort of ride improving home-related good sales and to hopefully offset some of the slowdown elsewhere in the mix?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, home has been a strong category for Macy's for the last couple of years, and we continue to build on that success, both in terms of the assortments, adding Millennial products throughout, for example, textiles, even some in housewares and furniture and mattresses\u00a0-- less mattresses, but more furniture. And we continue to build on that strength and expect it to continue. So that's been a strong category all year, and we think that will continue throughout the fall season. In terms of Bloomingdale's, as you know, they had had a weaker first quarter, strong second quarter, the opposite of Macy's. But we do hope it bodes well for Macy's as we go through the fall.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is there any history of it, sort of being an early warning or a canary in the coal mine in terms of business?","Karen M. Hoguet","Not really. I'd like to believe so today, but we'll see if we get through the third quarter.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Well, we're all looking for something.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, no, I think what's interesting, though, Michael, as we look at, again, it's only been 2.5 weeks, but the whole back-to-school area has been doing well, and that makes us feel good. And the fact that new merchandise is selling has to be a positive versus what we've seen during the second quarter.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","How influenced has the selling been by any changes in the sales tax holidays?","Karen M. Hoguet","Don't think it has been. I mean, we've been tracking where there haven't been those. It's harder because, as you know, every state seems to change them.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, every year.","Karen M. Hoguet","And different -- so we've been focused on versus planned versus looking at it versus last year because of all of those shifts. But I don't think that's the reason.","Operator","And we'll go to Filippe Goossens with Mitsubishi Securities.","Filippe Goossens","Another follow-up on the credit card performance. You made reference to changed regulations. Can you just clarify a little bit more what you meant? And then, kind of the second part of my question is, if you look at your terms, are they at all any more restrictive than any of your competitors, even including the banks that may perhaps limit somewhat the upside in the amount being charged on your cards?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, it's a good question. I don't know the answer relative to the granting of credit. As you know, Citibank owns our credit business, so they're really the ones who make all the risk decisions. And I can't speak to how Citi makes those determinations versus others as to whether it's tougher or not. I'm not sure about that.","Filippe Goossens","Okay. And then my second question, Karen, you made reference a couple of times to competition. Can you at all comment on whether the return of promotions at JCPenney had an impact on the performance in the quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","I really can't comment on that.","Operator","And we'll go to David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Most of my questions have been answered, but just wanted to get an update on what you're seeing at Herald Square. Did that\u00a0--\u00a0is that progressing as you would expect it? Obviously, it's a\u00a0major capital investment for the company. And did the disruption there have any impact on your overall business? And in tourist cities, in general, did you see any changes in your trend in Q2 versus prior quarters?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't think there was a particular trend in tourist cities. As I said, every place sort of got worse except the Southern parts of the country. But I don't think there was a big difference tourist versus not. Herald Square is doing very well in terms of our own sales relative to plan. And if we include the license sales, they're doing better versus last year. Once we get through this fall season, we'll be through, I believe, the worse of the disruption, meaning the main floor. And for those of you in New York, I'd urge you to come and watch the changes. By November, we should be reopened on the first floor, and it's looking terrific. And we feel very good about how the business has responded. The shoe business, while overall shoes hit a tough quarter, Herald Square did very well. And we feel really good about the areas as we reopened them.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Great. And just a follow-up on marketing. At what point in this past quarter did you decide to kind of strengthen the marketing in the second half? And did it have any impact on the back-to-school business that you're seeing now? Or should its impact just kind of given marketing lead times be more focused on later in the fall season?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. I think we started making the changes earlier in the quarter. So it is helping in terms of the August business and will keep going as we go through the fall season.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And also, just a clarification. I'm assuming your comments about the last 2.5\u00a0weeks are on a kind of apples-to-apples calendar basis, shift-adjusted for the 53rd week.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, I mean, it's relative to what we had expected.","Operator","We'll go to Gregory Chwatko with Goldman Sachs.","Gregory J. Chwatko - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the flexibility with regards to issuing a bit more debt, could we consider uses of capital there? Could you give us an idea of what the uses would be? And then as part of that, would you consider potentially paying down some more of the higher coupon debt as you've done in the past? Or do you feel comfortable with the levels where they -- those maturities are as far as size and such?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, where we had to issue debt, it would be to either prefund maturities next year and also fund the buyback program that we've talked about. In terms of refinancing higher coupon debt, we're always doing the analysis to see if it makes sense. But obviously, we've done those issues that made the most sense. And it just depends on the economics in any given point.","Operator","And we'll go to Rick Snyder with Maxim Group.","Rick L. Snyder - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Could you give us some sort of an idea how much the licensing is benefiting gross margin and sales during the second quarter? Was it a steady decline, or did we see choppy sales like we've seen in the past?","Karen M. Hoguet","No, we had seen choppy sales throughout the quarter, I mean, all the way through. And we don't comment on the specific components of gross margin.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]\u00a0We'll go next to Harry Ikenson of Ikenson Research and Consulting.","Harry Ikenson","Karen, you mentioned that you're excited about the new trend, and you said in women's sales going forward. I was wondering if you could comment at all on some of the excitement, if you can't be specific on anything on colors or is it a new silhouette, just give us something that you can comment on that you feel comfortable with.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we talked about the modern wear to work, suit separates has been very strong, as well as some of the opening price point, more key items have done well also. Active has been very strong, which is pretty much a new category for us over the last year or so. And we're beginning to see traction for the younger feminine customer or the older Millennial customer in the Impulse area. Some of the new brand launches are doing extraordinarily well, and we're building business there also.","Operator","And we'll go next to Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.","Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of questions. One, I just wanted to deep dive a little bit more into how you express in the marketing message your value proposition, because just looking at this past weekend's back-to-school flyer, I mean, you're in there with Levi at $39.99\u00a0and JCPenney's at $40. So if you look at that, there's really not much difference in the value proposition other than you're emphasizing more styles, size and colors. So as you think about how your message evolves, is it going to be more about price, or you leave that alone? Or you just emphasize the style, size and color differences between you and others on key brands?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't think I'm going to comment on this, Wayne. You'll have to wait and see.","Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. The other thing kind of related to this, if we were to enter a period where the consumer was beginning to buy the opening price point goods at a more sustained basis, what does that do as you think about your comp rather than being 3, it might be 2 or 1 to 2 rather than 3, and what does that do for your leverage metrics if we do get into a period like that from an expense standpoint?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, remember, I don't mean to imply that opening price point is taking over the store. It's still going to be very balanced, and it's just been slightly stronger in the second quarter, but it's not the pendulum going completely to the other direction. And all of these factors were taken into consideration when we gave the guidance of the 2.5%\u00a0to 4%\u00a0for the fall season. Don't overreact. It sounds like you're overreacting.","Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. My final question, back to credit then, like everyone else, I guess, if you were to push Citi to go deeper into the file to try to drive traffic, would you be willing to incur less credit income for that increased traffic and anticipating that losses might grow into 2014, so therefore, that we might begin to think about 2014\u00a0where credit income could actually be down year-over-year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, first off, Citi makes those decisions in terms of the risks. But having said that, if it were\u00a0--\u00a0if I were making those decisions, I probably would push farther. But again, that's not within my control.","Operator","And we'll go next to Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So\u00a03, hopefully, quick questions. So as we look and dive into the Millennial strategy, which I think you've been incredibly effective, if you look at the Impulse strength versus juniors, and I know you still have a lot of brands rolling out this year and next, can you maybe talk about some of your early wins at this point in the game?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think the early wins have been both in active, which has done extremely well, both some of the market brands, as well as their own private brand, Ideology, which is terrific product at a great value. On the Impulse side, the new brands, Bar III, which was the first big private brand in Impulse, has done very well, some of the market brands. And again, the launch of Maison Jules last week went extraordinarily well. So we think that it's product and assortment is first and foremost for that Millennial customer. Juniors has taken us a little bit longer and not as optimistic that we're going to have it turned around this fall. But hopefully, for spring of '14, that will begin to strengthen.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then I had an unusual amount of time to spend on your website, but I went and revisited Everyday Value and just wanted to know some additional insight in terms of how you're utilizing that as an opening price point, especially as you look at your strategy in the back half of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't think there's any change with that, Deb, in terms of what we've done in the past.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. And then in terms of the improvement at Bloomingdale's, just wanted to know how kind of the Loyallist program fit into that as well?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think the Loyallist program, as it continues to get refined, is becoming more important to driving the Bloomingdale's business. So I don't know the specifics, but I have to believe that's been a factor.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. And then, lastly, as we think about MOM, with Magic Selling training kind of going into the back half of the year, as we think about kind of maybe more of a value message, will the associates on the selling floor also have that as part of their training?","Karen M. Hoguet","Absolutely. And again, our sales associates are taught to engage with the customers, and one of the things that Peter Sachse, who is running the stores now, says to them, sell from the heart. All of that training, I think, really is paying off, and they are very sensitive to the messages of the company in terms of the importance of communicating value. So I believe that will be done very effectively on the selling floor.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to Karen Hoguet for any additional or closing comments.","Karen M. Hoguet","Great. Well, thank you, all, for your interest in the company and your support. And as always, if you have other questions, feel free to call me, Matt, Sara, and we'll do our best to get them answered. Thanks.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. This is Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Jeff Gennette and I would like to welcome you to the Macy's call today to discuss our fourth quarter earnings and our outlook for 2018. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.MacysInc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes.","Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning. Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","I'm now going to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the call. So Macy's had a solid fourth quarter, capped with a strong January, and we finished 2017 in a good position. We've created momentum and we are taking that momentum into the new year with a commitment to returning Macy's, Inc. to comparable sales growth in 2018. We're headed into 2018 with an improved base business, healthy inventories, a focused and engaged organization and a clear path to return Macy's to growth.","So this morning, I'm going to give you some perspective on our 2017 performance and then give you a sense of how we're looking at 2018. And then Karen will take you through the numbers in detail.","So to start; the fourth quarter positive comp sales of 1.4%, which was owned plus licensed, was a significant trend change for us. Looking at the quarter, consumer spending was strong and the cold weather was a benefit.","As anticipated, the initiatives that we launched earlier in 2017 kicked in during the fourth quarter. And we delivered improved execution across the brand and across all three of the sub-brands, Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. We had great merchandise in all categories. Our holiday strategy was solid, from gifting to self-purchase.","Importantly, we saw an improved trend shift in beauty, driven by strong fragrance sales, gift sets and prestige skincare. We maintained a healthy inventory position, which meant we did not need additional discounting to clear inventory. And this sets us up well heading into the first quarter of 2018.","We were disciplined with our promotions. We offered great values throughout the holiday shopping season, while sticking to our promotional plan. And when we hit glitches, the team pulled together. When we saw an opportunity to fine-tune a strategy and pick up additional sales, we took it.","We saw a trend improvement in our brick-and-mortar business, particularly as we moved from third to fourth quarter, which is encouraging. And we experienced continued double-digit growth in our digital business. So this is all good for us. Macy's recipe for success is a healthy brick-and-mortar business, combined with robust growth in digital. So all-in-all, we're pleased with the fourth quarter performance.","Looking at the full year, we exceeded our expectations for both earnings and sales guidance. We've seen an improvement in the base business since we launched the North Star Strategy earlier in 2017. And I'd love to take a couple of minutes to walk you through points of the North Star Strategy where we made progress in 2017 and give you some perspective on our plans for 2018.","So the first point of the strategy is the Macy's brand. And in 2017, we began the reengineering of the Macy's marketing machine. And this will be a multi-year effort, but we're off to a good start. We strengthened our brand position through a greater emphasis on fashion. We reduced complexity in our promotional calendar, and we're beginning to tackle pricing simplification.","Importantly, we launched our new loyalty program, Star Rewards. And our customers are responding enthusiastically, particularly at the Platinum level, which is our most valuable customer. In 2018, we will continue to strengthen our brand. We feel good about the next phases of our loyalty program, which will launch mid-year, including a tender-neutral option.","So the second point of the strategy is about product leadership. In 2017, we made good progress on improving merchandise assortment through our Edited, Elevated and Exclusive strategy. Our customers have responded well to the increased focus on fashion and enhanced quality of the merchandise. And we're seeing an uptick in AUR, our average unit retail, of about 3%.","In 2018, we will continue to improve both merchandise assortment and experience in all doors. We are on track on increasing exclusivity, and we are putting some extra weight behind a number of merchandising initiatives. This includes our beauty reinvent, where we are transitioning from a brand-centric to a customer-centric model.","In 2017, we expanded Macy's Backstage, our on-mall off-price offering, to 45 stores. We saw a lift in performance of almost seven full points per store, and we believe there is more upside. We feel good about the model that we've landed on for Backstage. And in 2018, we're planning to expand by another 100 stores, including locations in some of our premium malls.","The third point of the strategy, customer experience. In 2017, we put a strong focus on improving customer experience through new service and delivery models, an expansion of Buy Online Pickup in Store, enhancements to our mobile experience and the use of AI to improve customer service. In 2018, we'll further scale a number of these, including the rollout of Mobile Checkout, At Your Service Centers across most of our doors.","We know that we have an opportunity to offer our customer more product selection, curated and personalized to her taste, and we will expand her options on how and when to both explore and transact. One important step of that is going to be the expanded vendor direct fulfillment model that we will launch mid-year.","And also in 2018, we have a very important initiative called the Growth 50 As we said, healthy stores mean a healthy business, so we're taking 50 stores, a mix of size and geography, we're looking at everything that we tested last year in our Woodbridge store and we're accelerating the rollout of what best worked for us in what we learned. This includes revenue-generating actions such as proven merchandising strategies, the expansion of Backstage and Big Ticket, more fashion and localized product and a focus on leased business, like food and beverage.","We're improving fixtures and facilities. We're expanding in-store technology. We're developing top talent. We're also ramping up local marketing and community engagement. We plan to come out of 2018 with these 50 stores on an accelerated growth track and with the model to scale more broadly across our stores' portfolio in 2019.","Our fourth point is innovation. In 2017, we began to think more broadly about what and how the Macy's brand allows us to innovate in new categories and channels. We launched a number of pilots and new programs aimed at creating compelling experience in our stores to increase traffic. This includes Beta, the Samsung Experience and the new Market @ Macy's.","We're particularly excited about The Market @ Macy's, which is our pop-up retail boutique within the store, which we believe will drive customer traffic and customer engagement. We just launched in 10 stores earlier this month and the early signs are positive. In 2018, we will continue to innovate and test ways to drive traffic, increase engagement and potentially create new revenue streams.","Our fifth and last point is cost management. In 2017, we finished ahead of target on our cost reduction efforts, which is key to funding investment in the business. We are operating with a mindset of continuous improvement. And in 2018, we will look for ways to reduce cost, work smarter and move faster.","In 2017, we also had a very productive year with our real estate strategy, and totaled $411 million in cash proceeds. While the number and size of transactions may moderate over time, real estate will remain a very important part of our strategy.","So in 2018, we will continue to execute our North Star Strategy. We'll accelerate the rollout of initiatives we tested in 2017 and we'll queue up new growth ideas for the future. We feel good about the year ahead.","When looking at 2018 and our commitment to return to growth, several primary factors to keep in mind. The first, we do anticipate continued good customer and consumer spending. We know consumers are out there and it's up to us to win with them. The second, we will continue to improve our execution. Thirdly, we're accelerating the strategies that we tested in 2017. And the fourth factor, which we think is a key to our success, is our people. Our people are competitive and they want to win. And we need every associate to be all-in to get back to growth. That is why we announced to our teams today that all Macy's associates will be part of an incentive plan in 2018. The plan is designed to support our growth strategy. And this is part-time, full-time, hourly, seasonally, every associate has a role to play in our performance and a stake to win in our success.","Today's consumer is discerning and they have many choices. We are committed to being competitive and winning her business. The investments we will make in 2018 are focused on our customer and what she expects of us. They are strategic and directed towards the areas where we believe we can get the best return. We are rolling out things that work.","And the benefits from tax reform gave us some additional flexibility and allow us to accelerate scaling initiatives we tested in 2017. This includes the employee incentive plan that I mentioned, which we tested in 2017. These investments are the right thing for us to do for the company and our shareholders as we chart a path to sustainable profitable growth.","In summary, we head into 2018 with momentum, with an improved base business, healthy inventories, a more focused and engaged organization. And we have a path to return Macy's, Inc. to growth.","And with that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Karen, who will talk about our financial performance and outlook for fiscal 2018.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. Sales in the fourth quarter were $8.666 billion, up 1.8% from last year, including the impact of the 53rd week. On a comp 52-week basis, owned plus licensed sales increased 1.4%. This is better than we had expected due to improvement in the store sales trend, as Jeff discussed. Digital continued very strong in the quarter, as we anticipated. Our strongest families of business were fragrances, dresses, fine jewelry, men's tailored clothing, coats, children's, shoes and home textiles. We were also pleased with improvement to trend in beauty, handbags and housewares. Juniors was weaker than expected.","We exceeded our expectations across the country with particularly strong sales in the hurricane-impacted areas that experienced a rebound from the third quarter. In addition, we were very pleased with the improvement in the trend at our Herald Square store in New York, our flagship store. Tourist sales were still below last year, but did improve versus the trend in the third quarter. The number of transactions in the fourth quarter was flat to last year in the fourth quarter on a comp basis, much improved from the 7% drop we experienced in the third quarter.","The average unit retail was up approximately 3%, similar to the increase in the third quarter. Units per transaction were down 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin in the quarter was 38.2%, down 10 basis points versus last year and better than what we had expected. And the merchandise margin was higher than last year in the quarter. The strong sales helped and we continued to benefit from our inventory being in better shape than a year ago.","We ended the year with inventory 3.5% below last year on a comp basis. This good inventory position should help drive sales in early 2018, due to the available open-to-buy and resultant ability to bring in fresh merchandise receipts.","SG&A in the fourth quarter was $2.279 billion, down $56 million or approximately 2% below last year. For the full year, SG&A was down $343 million below last year, which is better than the $305 million reduction we had set as an objective at the start of the year and updated for the merchant restructuring completed this fall.","SG&A in the quarter, as well as in the full year, benefited from the restructurings, the closed stores, lower depreciation and amortization, as well as higher credit income. It was offset in part by the 53rd week, costs associated with the growth in our digital business, as well as investments to grow Backstage, Bloomingdale's Outlet and Bluemercury. We also increased selling expense relative to plan in the fourth quarter when the trend in the store business improved.","Credit income in the quarter was $244 million, up $36 million over last year. This was due to higher credit sales due, in part, to the extra week in January, as well as continued good profitability of the program. For the full year, credit income was $768 million, or $32 million above last year.","Credit penetration was 46.2% for the quarter and for the year, 90 basis points below last year in both time periods. We booked $368 million of gains associated with the real estate transactions in the fourth quarter. This includes $234 million for the Union Square Men's building, $21 million related to Brooklyn and $113 million associated with other transactions. And for the full year, we booked a total of $544 million in gains.","In the fourth quarter, operating income, excluding pension settlement, restructuring, impairments, store closing and other costs, was $1.397 billion, up 32% versus last year or up 10% versus last year, excluding the gain on the Union Square Men's building.","In the quarter, we booked restructuring, impairments, store closing and other costs of $152 million, of which approximately $57 million was non-cash. We also booked in the quarter $32 million of non-cash settlement charges associated with our retirement plans.","Earnings per share on a diluted basis for the quarter was $4.31. For comparability to guidance and to prior years, we would back out the following two items, as seen in the table in our press release: one, a $1.86 benefit from the remeasurement of deferred taxes due to federal tax reform; and two, $0.37 of after-tax impact of the settlement charges, restructurings, impairment store closing and other costs. Net of these two items, earnings per share in the fourth quarter was $2.82 versus $2.02 last year.","Remember, included in the fourth quarter is the $0.48 per share gain associated with the sale of the Men's building on Union Square. Excluding that gain, earnings per share increased 16% over last year.","So that's a summary of our fourth quarter performance, and now I'll just make a few comments about the year. So for the full year, our comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis were down 1.9%, slightly better than the minus 2% to minus 3% guidance provided at the start of the year. The earnings per share for the full year, excluding the deferred tax adjustment as well as the restructuring, impairments, store closing costs, pension settlement and debt premium cost, was $3.77 or 21% above last year. And this compares to our latest guidance of $3.59 to $3.69 provided on January 4.","Cash flow in the year was also stronger than expected in 2017, some of which is related to timing. We under-spent our expected $900 million in capital spending by $140 million. Some of this shortfall is due to under-runs, but most is due to intentional delays in projects and will be spent in 2018. This has been factored into our guidance for 2018.","In addition, the 53rd week impacts the timing of some payments, favoring 2017 cash flow relative to 2018. We utilized our excess cash to repurchase debt of approximately $950 million during the year, including $247 million in the open market, a $300 million maturity paid in July and $400 million in the tender we completed in December.","This demonstrates our continued commitment to delevering and having a strong balance sheet. So as a result of the EBITDA improvement and debt reduction, our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 2.7 times, as compared to 3.2 times last year. Excluding the gain on the Union Square Men's building, the leverage ratio was 2.9 times, still a significant improvement versus last year. And remember, our target range is 2.5 times to 2.8 times.","So before moving on to 2018, I want to update you on our real estate strategy. As Jeff said, we've accomplished a great deal with our real estate strategy over the past few years, bringing in close to $1.3 billion in cash in 2015 through 2017 from these transactions. We continue to look for opportunities to create value through our real estate as we go forward.","We have three specific updates in particular to discuss this morning. One, we have now signed an agreement to sell the upper seven floors of our State Street store in Chicago to a private real estate fund sponsored by Brookfield Asset Management. We expect to receive a total of $30 million, which includes a $3 million contribution towards our redevelopment cost.","In addition, we will receive a percentage of profit earned over and above a threshold internal rate of return. This transaction will have a small impact on the retail square footage in this store. And we're hoping that by creating great office space above our store, in combination with investments that we'll make in the store, we can make this location a more vibrant shopping environment.","Number two, we continue to work with Brookfield as part of our strategic alliance. You will recall that we originally put approximately 50 properties into this alliance for further study. In August, we updated you and said that we expected that roughly two-thirds of these 50 would be more serious contenders for development. We have now agreed to certain terms on nine of these assets, which Brookfield will redevelop once it has received the necessary approvals.","Upon the completion of approval and entitlement, Macy's will either sell its interests in the individual assets to Brookfield or contribute them into individual joint ventures. If sold, the cumulative value of these nine properties is estimated to be approximately $50 million, plus a retained participation in the upside profits of the three largest assets.","These nine assets include a cross-section of projects, including one mixed-use densification of a store site, two redevelopments of furniture stores and six developments of pad sites to perimeter locations of existing mall assets. None of these assets, though, involve closing a location, although the two furniture store developments would involve consolidating furniture into the main box in those malls.","We expect that these redevelopments will add to the vibrancy and desirability of the site, thus again enhancing the shopping experience for our customers. We don't expect to transact on any of these this year, given the time required to receive approvals and other predevelopment work. Hopefully, we will begin to transact on these nine assets in 2019. We also continue to work with Brookfield on understanding the potential opportunities from the remaining assets in the pool.","And three, we have continued to look at how best to create value from our Union Square real estate in San Francisco, while improving the retail vibrancy of the area. For those of you familiar with San Francisco retail history, there used to be an upscale retailer called I. Magnin, whose flagship store sat on the corner of Geary and Stockton streets.","In the late 1980s, I. Magnin became part of Macy's. And in 1999, Macy's combined the buildings with the Macy's West flagship store. We are now planning to separate it again and sell the space. The building is roughly 243,000 square feet. If this transaction is completed, the remaining Macy's store would still be approximately 700,000 square feet. We believe we can create an even more terrific shopping experience in this very important, strategic location. There are a lot of details to be worked out, but we expect this to be a significant transaction that we hopefully can complete in 2018.","So let's talk about 2018. Let me first remind you of the changes as a result of the new FASB guidelines regarding revenue recognition and pension accounting. As you know, there will be changes in 2018 to our financial statements, as we discussed on our conference call on January 31. We have posted our preliminary and unaudited recast numbers for 2016 and 2017, by quarter, on our website. Our guidance for 2018 will be given relative to these recast numbers.","So, as you can see on our website, the recast fiscal 2017 has $104 million higher sales, $10 million higher adjusted EBITDA and $0.02 per share higher adjusted earnings than what we reported. In other words, the $3.77 that I just discussed for 2017 is $3.79 in the numbers recast for the new accounting standard. The two changes impacting the annual EBITDA and earnings are: one, the accelerated recognition of breakage for gift cards associated with certain returns; and two, the recognition of digital sales to when the merchandise is shipped.","So with $3.79 as the comparison for 2017, we are guiding 2018 earnings per share to be $3.55 to $3.75. Included in this guidance is $300 million to $325 million for asset sale gains as compared to $544 million last year. So excluding asset sale gains, earnings per share is expected to grow in 2018.","Let me just talk about some of the key assumptions behind this guidance, one, comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis are assumed to be flat to plus 1%. Our initiatives will be rolled out through the year, so we expect the back half of the year to be stronger than the first half. We do expect the first quarter sales to benefit from a partial shift in the timing of our Friends & Family event from the second quarter into the first.","Comp owned plus licensed sales for the first half of the year are assumed to be approximately flat to down slightly. Total sales for the year are assumed to be down 0.5% to down 2%. This has a wider range than comp sales due to the variability with delivery revenue associated with our digital sales and the new loyalty program. And remember, that in 2018, we have one less week in the total sales than we did in 2017, which impacts the total sales trend.","Three, credit revenue will now be broken out on a separate line in our P&L. For 2018, it is assumed to be in the range of $645 million to $665 million as compared to $702 million for 2017. Keep in mind that both this guidance and the $702 million of credit income includes costs related to proprietary card fraud and the new account origination. In the past, these costs were not included in the credit card revenue.","Four, gross margin on retail sales is expected to be flat to up slightly, as compared to the 39.1% in 2017. Five, SG&A is expected to be flat in dollars, or up slightly, depending on sales. The approximately $300 million saved from the restructuring announced in January and last fall will be reinvested in the growth initiatives that Jeff discussed earlier, such as Backstage, digital and the Growth 50 stores.","Asset sales; we are expecting $340 million to $370 million in cash proceeds and, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, $300 million to $325 million in book gains for 2018. This does assume the successful sale of the I. Magnin building in this year, which represents a very significant portion of the guidance for both cash and the gains.","With the new pension accounting, retirement plan income will no longer be included in SG&A and will be a separate line on the P&L below operating income. We are estimating it to be approximately $40 million to $45 million in 2018. Interest expense is assumed to be approximately $255 million to $260 million, and DA is assumed to be approximately flat with that achieved in 2017.","Our new tax rate, 23.25%; and capital expenditures are now expected to be $1 billion per year on an ongoing basis, plus an additional $50 million in 2018 related to the work being done in conjunction with the Union Square and State Street real estate transactions. And the last key assumption relating to our excess cash and leverage, we will continue to utilize our excess cash to reduce debt in 2018. We remain committed to keeping our leverage ratio in the targeted range.","So, as I've said to you before, 2017 was a transition year for Macy's. We accomplished a lot, particularly in our efforts to test new ideas, which we now will begin to roll out in 2018.","There is a lot of work ahead of us, but we feel better about the business today than we have in a long time. Before opening the call for questions, I want to make sure you saw in our press release that beginning with the first quarter release in May, we will be moving our regular quarterly earnings date up one day each quarter to Wednesday, with our conference call on that day happening at 9:30 AM Eastern Time.","And with that, Jeff and I will both take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Morning. I guess the two questions that I have, the first one is on the Backstage piece. Can you talk about new customer acquisition and marketing plans around it? And then, the second piece is the talk about increasing exclusivity, where did you end 2017? And is 40% still the right way to think about the target and any specific brands that you could highlight for us? Thank you.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Well, let me start with, Bob, with Backstage. So just to kind of back up, I think that our Backstage strategy remains rooted in that the bulk of our core customer and the bulk of the new customer that we're interested in shop off-price today. And so how could Macy's take a piece of that?","And some of that we learned from our Bloomingdale's experience with their outlet strategy, so they have the only kind of off-price, full-price location within a store, was what we set out to do. So we tested that pretty aggressively. Starting in 2016, we went to 45 stores as a store-within-store concept in 2017. And what we're seeing is that our existing customer is spending more when you have Backstage in that building. We're getting incremental shopping trips from her. And when we talk about what we're doing in 2018 and taking this out to 100 more stores, it's going to give us the opportunity to start to market this. And with that, we expect to get new customers.","I think the headline on Backstage in-store is that it's lifting the entire building by seven full points. And what we're finding is its very limited cannibalization. And we're finding that with the more new categories we put, the better the experience is. And we're finding that having the same brand in different parts of the store is actually a good thing. So we're actually very encouraged by Backstage, and we expect to continue to learn from it and continue to grow in 2018.","The other sub-point I'd make about 2018 is we're going to start to experiment putting Backstage in-store into some of our premium locations, so wait to hear from us on how that performs.","To your question about exclusivity, we stated, as part of the North Star Strategy, that we wanted to take exclusivity from about 29% of our business to 40%, and we're on track. And it really is rooted in having very strong private brands. We continue to grow those. We continue to put more value in them. We're getting higher average unit retail. Our customer's responding very well to those.","And then, we're also working with our great wholesale brands on exclusive product; either that they produce exclusively for us, like Tommy Hilfiger, or capsules that they produce exclusively for us that are non-exclusive brands. And I would tell you that in all of those, our merchants are working very hard with both our private brand and our supply chain as well as with our wholesale brands, and we're on track. So exclusivity remains a very pivotal piece of our strategy, and we are on the path to grow it to 40%.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And congrats on the improvement.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Jeff, when you dissect your fourth quarter performance, I guess, can you speak to examples of company-specific execution that you think helped drive the improvement to-date? And as we move to 2018, I guess, what's the best way to rank incremental initiatives as the year progresses and, specifically, what Hal and his team are focused on today, if we were thinking about some of those opportunities?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah. So, Matt, what I'd tell you is that the fourth quarter gives us a lot of confidence and momentum as we walk into 2018. And I would tell you that I'd kind of bucket it into four reasons about why we have confidence. The first one is that the consumer is shopping and there's a high level of optimism from our consumer. She's out there. And it's our opportunity to win her business and get share. So that's the first one.","The second factor is that and, as Karen mentioned, the North Star Strategy, that we put a lot of new ideas in front of the customer in the beginning of the year, and we were able to iterate and scale those into the back half of the year and she responded. So this notion of testing and iterating and scaling is really working for us, and we roll out things that work. So expect us to take those learnings and roll that into 2018. That gives us confidence. We're also testing new things in 2018 that we believe will be the spine of the growth that we're going to expect in 2019 and 2020.","The third point of this is really what you mentioned, which is we're executing better. And I give a lot of credit to new players like Hal that are really helping lead us in new ways. And I think where Hal is really focused is the opportunity to execute our strategy, getting everybody in the same boat, focused on the same things. That really led to our whole strategy, which is number four, which is that we want everybody aligned. And this new incentive program that we're creating where every part-time, full-time, seasonal associate has a piece of the growth and they'll get a reward based on our achievement of that growth, was an important piece of the alignment.","So I think we're executing quite well. So we think these four things are what is going to help propel the momentum that we have now and translate into getting back to growth for the full year in 2018.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great. And then, just a follow-up, can you touch on any of the initiatives that Rich and his team are working on around price simplification and marketing? And I guess, more so, what exactly will be the change that your customer will see as the price simplification rolls out?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah. I think what you're going to see is, the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see less overlap in promotions. And we started that in 2017. We're committed to continuing that in 2018. So you're not going to have events within events. They're going to be much cleaner and clearer.","If you take a look at the event that we just finished, the price on the ticket is we're getting closer and closer to reducing the amount of promotional overlap that leads to confusing pricing and trying to keep the clarity of offer really clear. We saw that in Backstage. We see that in Last Act. You're starting to see us do that with a lot more of our promotional content and making it much easier for the customer to understand our great values.","So what you're going to start to see from Rich is having less of a promotional agenda is making sure that we're then balancing the marketing across other things that our customer cares about, which is that Macy's is a fashion authority and being able to talk about those headquarter businesses that we do great with or those new fashion capsules that we're launching. So we're going to come much more in balance in our marketing because we're really fine-tuning our promotional strategy.","As it relates to science on pricing, we made a big investment on analytics and pulling all of our pricing analytics together under one team. And our team is doing a great job with that. So we're really looking at what price we need to take something to. We look at what its weeks of supply is, what the out date is going to be, what we have to price that at.","And so we're saving lots of markdown dollars. It's giving us the opportunity to respond to those things that are slower moving. And so we're using our markdown budget much more strategically than in times past, getting to the right price sooner. And that's helping us clear out excess inventory.","And I think one of the big headlines of our performance right now is the fact that we have less carryover inventory of last season's goods. And that gives us the opportunity to really respond to what's working in-season, be that a hot vendor or a hot trend. And our merchants are ready to respond with having budgets because they don't have a lot of carryover inventory. So it all is interlinked, but the pricing science has been a big win for us, and I think we're in the early innings of that. We're just going to keep getting better at it.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, best of luck.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you so much. I wanted to just ask about the sales guidance here for 2018. And it looks like it's a nice level of acceleration relative to the full year 2017 result. On a same-store sales basis, I think last year it was down 2%. So is it the strategies that are sort of coming through that gives you the confidence in the 2018 trajectory? I'm just wondering if you could help us understand a little bit more about the step change there.","And then for Karen, just two small clarifications. One, it looks like credit income is expected to be down, round numbers, $45 million or $50 million at the midpoint. I assume that that's on like-for-like accounting, so perhaps a little bit more reserve there for bad debt. And secondarily on the AUR improvement, we are assuming that that is contained promotions and improved full-price selling on like-for-like items. But is there any piece of that, that would be, let's say, a category mix shift that would be driving that? Thank you so much.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, Kimberly, let me just start with the step change. So we accomplished a lot of going from what the year-to-date was at the end of the third quarter to what we accomplished as the 1.4% increase in the fourth quarter, and we expect that momentum to continue. But it really comes down to the four things that I mentioned earlier. So the consumer's shopping. We expect her to continue to shop with us and our competitors. That takes us into the new year.","The North Star Strategy is working. The key initiatives within that that we know are going to propel growth in the new year is the new loyalty program. And the loyalty program, we actually add a tender-neutral option to that in the middle of 2018. We've got Backstage giving us the growth that it's giving us in the existing doors, but going out to 100 more. We've got the Growth 50 that we have significant growth planned in 2018 based on the success that we had in the test in 2017.","We've got vendor direct, which is going to expand the amount of offerings that's going to be available to our customer. That's going to start, really in, you're going to start to see that come into play starting in the third quarter, but we have significant volume planned there. And then, we also have new fulfillment options that we know is going to improve overall sales, but also brick-and-mortar traffic, which is what we call Buy Online Ship to Store. So that's going to join its cousin, the Buy Online Pickup in Store. So all those are, we believe, is in the strategy piece.","Then there's the execution piece, which is, as I mentioned to Matt's question earlier, which is that we believe our team is more focused and more aligned than ever before. We massively simplified our organization in August by collapsing three merchandising organizations down to one. And I think if you talked our vendors out there, they would tell you that we're making decisions faster. Fewer people are touching the decisions. They have more confidence behind the decisions and they have the liquidity and the inventories to be able to respond to what is working in the business.","And then the last thing is that all hands are on deck. We're all rowing in the same direction and we now have 130,000-strong incentive plan that unites the entire fleet towards getting back to growth. So those are why we have confidence and momentum from the fourth quarter. We still have a lot to do and a lot to prove. Our head is up as much as it's down. And expect that what we'll test, we're going to iterate and we're going to roll out what works.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","On credit, part of the reason for the decline is, in fact, the bad debt, still at very low levels, but a bit higher than what we had booked this year. And also, the impact of next year being a 52-week year against a 53-week, we lose a week of credit income, in essence. So that's really the explanation on that. And the AUR increase, it would really be no different than the last couple of quarters. For the full year 2017, AUR was up 2%; the last two quarters, up 3%. And I think it has to do with the inventory being in such great shape, more so than any mix change.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And I'd say just to add to that, Kimberly, is that I think our merchants have done a nice job in putting more value into the goods and putting more make and embellishment and better fabrics. And the customer's noticing that. And, as Karen mentioned, we don't have that inventory carryover to the degree, so what we're really focused on is regular-priced sell-through. And we're finding that the regular-priced sell-through is better and that the AUR is higher in that based on the increased value that the merchants are putting into the products.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks, guys. Karen, just, I wanted to clarify, you mentioned the nine Brookfield properties where something that might happen in 2019. Should we assume that that means that nothing else is happening on the other 41? I know originally, you said that two-thirds were going to be considered, but where does it stand now in terms of the other 41 and what we should expect there? Also curious about the 23.25% tax rate, is that good to use in future years beyond 2018? Is there anything impacting that on a one-time basis in 2018?","And then, just last, Karen, can you quantify at all what you think the weather might have done in the business in the fourth quarter? I think you mentioned that the coats were a good category. Is there any quantification you can give in terms of how much the weather might have helped you, whether that be talking about regional performance or category performance? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","So if you start with the Brookfield question, we had said that we thought about two-thirds of the 50 could end up being redeveloped, and I would say that's probably still a good estimate. And, as I said in my remarks, we do continue to work with Brookfield beyond the nine. So, again, we've got nine to fruition and we continue to work on the others. Don't expect all 50 to get there, as we had said in August. But nothing's really changed in terms of the potential there.","In terms of the tax rate, there's nothing one-time in that. So, again, things could change, but I would not expect a major change in that rate going forward.","And in terms of the weather, it was a cold fourth quarter, obviously. We had snow storms throughout a big chunk of the country, which negatively hurt the business. So, on balance, I would say weather really was not a big factor in the good performance. Yes, coats did well, but I can't sit here today and tell you that a big chunk of the big performance had to do with weather.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Karen. Good luck, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Just trying to connect the dots on your fourth quarter performance and clear momentum, you talked about inventories being light and then comparing that to the first half guide, which I think you said is flat to down slightly, particularly given that comparisons ease. So I'm just wondering if you can help us frame it out.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes. I mean, I think, Chuck, remember, that we do get benefit in the fourth quarter from the increase in the digital penetration, that we've discussed. So that will have a negative impact on the first half. And again, could the first half be better? Absolutely. But sitting here looking from where we are today, we didn't want to get out ahead of ourself.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. Sorry.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And, Chuck, just to add, we also expect some disruption in these Growth 50 stores, which are a pretty significant piece of our business, as we get them ready. There's going to be capital spent on them. There's going to disruption in those buildings, so that we are ready at the beginning of third quarter in most of them.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, helpful. And then just any help on the Friends & Family shift, how you think that will play or if you could quantify for us?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I really can't. I just wanted to make sure because the first quarter will look a little better than what you would have expected, and then the second quarter would be a little worse.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","But I can't really give you a specific number.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. And then, just on the employee incentive program that you tested last year, could you just tell us what some of the learnings were from the test last year?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So what the learning was, we tested a number of things. We tested do you make that incentive seasonal, do you make it quarterly, what's the amounts that you play with. It was rooted, though, in that if that store makes its sales plan, that everybody in that building that worked during that timeframe is going to get some piece of a reward that is accorded by that sales plan achievement.","We also in the stores did it, if they exceeded their plan by X%, that that sack of money that was then divvied up amongst the hours of the associates was bigger. And that worked really well. And what we aligned on, based on looking at the six districts that played in this, was that quarterly was the best measure. And that it gave the associate, that front-line associate, a clear line of sight. And so we're basically picking what worked for us.","Those districts had a nice improvement in their business versus the comparable districts, so we know that it's meaningful in terms of having all associates then have a line of sight to how by that store doing well, how they can increase what they're going to get in their paycheck. So it gave those store managers an opportunity and rallying cry every day to talk about how they were performing versus their plan. So it just gets everybody going in the same direction.","So based on that, we knew that doing this in stores was the way to go. We then looked at, okay, let's talk about our call centers. Let's look at our warehouses. Let's look at our executives who work in the corporate offices that are not on a current bonus or incentive plan. And so we wanted to expand that so that as Macy's is in our path to growth in 2018, that everybody would have a play in that. And it gave us the opportunity to have daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly dialogue that gets everybody aligned.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","And Jeff, just one quick one, that gets rolled out here in the first quarter? Or is it...","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","That is. So we announced it this morning and the first quarter is the first quarter that we are measuring and we're going to reward people for. So, yeah, we're starting out this morning with this as a great opportunity for people to have a stake in Macy's returning to growth.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Corrine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrll Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the gross margin guidance being flat to up slightly, how you're thinking about the impact of the continued shift to e-comm, the new loyalty program and what the offsets are to those factors.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, I think much like what you saw in the fourth quarter, the merchandise margin has been stronger due to the inventory being in good shape, the pricing science Jeff talked about. And we would expect that to continue to enable us to offset the impact of the potentially lower delivery revenue.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I think the other point, Lorraine, just goes back to Kimberly's question about mix. I think we have a good line of sight that within an existing category or vendor mix, in a particular FOB, that we have a way of improving our margin because of pricing science and because of the fact that we don't have a lot of residual inventory. But as you start to think about new categories that we bring in that our customer wanted, they might have a very different margin mix, that all gets communicated in terms of the overall blend of AUR. And so there is a mix there.","So if we wanted to go after heavily in electronics or Apple products or whatever, it might carry a lower gross margin, but, at the end of the day, it drives a lot of footsteps. And what we start to measure now is really lifetime value of a customer. What's in their basket, what else are they buying during that trip, does it seed other visits into our store or on our site? And so we're not just looking at the margin of a particular item with a particular customer, we're looking at what the long-term relationship and how those mix of products affect that.","Lorraine Corrine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrll Lynch","Great, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for all the color on today's call. Just a follow-up on SG&A, just curious if you can quantify the amount of spend or overall impact to operating income from the accelerated investments that you've mentioned in stores and merchandising and digital. And separately, Karen, if you can just touch on cash priorities in 2018, particularly how you're thinking about further debt paydown or the return of share repurchase program and the dividend. Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, in terms of the investment, I think it's all taken into account in our total guidance between sales, margin as well as SG&A. So I think all of that is factored in. And I can't really give you a specific number.","In terms of cash priorities, they have not changed. Our first priority always remains ways of investing in the business to fuel profitable growth, and that hasn't changed. Secondly, we are committed to keeping within our targeted leverage ratios. So, as I mentioned earlier, excess cash this year, likely to go to debt repurchase. And obviously, as cash continues to build and performance builds over the next couple of years, obviously, we'll have more cash to discuss returning to the share buyback program and other things. Obviously, the one I didn't mention, which I should have, is the dividend, which obviously is very important to us as well.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Best of luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. Karen, regarding inventory, you've been in a great position. Next year, do you think that inventory will still be at a lower rate than sales in terms of what you can do there in the speed initiatives? And, Jeff, I would love your thoughts on the topic of experiential retail at large with the Growth 50. How are you balancing what are the best priorities in terms of tackling this? Are you seeing a favorable demographics in terms of an average age of the Growth 50 cohort of stores and what should we think about as you look at different expenditures associated with experiential retail versus the traffic and check size returns? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I think, Oliver, the easiest way to think about inventory is that we do expect the turnover inventory turn to continue to improve, as we move forward into 2018 and we think beyond that. So that will continue to be a high priority.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And, Oliver, let me take on the experiential retail. I think when you look at these top 50, there was a number of things that we really wanted to take on. The first one was hyper-curation. And think about it as kind of My Macy's on steroids. And I think one of the things that we learned in the test pilot in 2017 was how much kind of stuff was in the way of a customer really seeing what she wanted in that building.","And so we did a massive SKU edit, stock-keeping unit edit, in those buildings. And it was about 40%. And it gave us the opportunity to then take the things that remained and really amplify them, really play with additional fashion, play with, to the previous conversation, to about getting more value in the goods. And what we saw was, wow, she really responded. It also gave us the opportunity by doing all that editing, bringing in new vendors, new categories, bringing in things like food and beverage, like Backstage, like Big Ticket.","And so the first step, I'd say, would be that with respect to with content, that that is really where our journey was. Then when you get into it is, you get into what technology expansion you want to do. This idea about Mobile Checkout, about can she find a register, if she wants to get out of that building quickly, she wants to scan everything on her mobile device and get out of the building without interacting with a sales associate, we want to make sure these 50 doors, that she can do that. If she wants to let us know through the app that she wants to have Star service and a Platinum experience, then we're going to have an At Your Service My Stylist that's going to be ready for her.","So, making sure that we have that done. We have these At Your Service Centers that we learned in a number of our buildings in 2017. We've now expanded those across all the 50 doors and many, many of our other doors. So that if she wants to come in, she's at the number one door of the store, she wants to do a return, she wants to pay down her bill, she wants to pick up an item that she purchased online, very quick and efficient way of getting through that. So, we took through all of the friction points that she experienced in her journey. Everything that she's been telling us over the years, places where she was dissatisfied with her experience, and we made sure that we attacked that, either through technology or through assortment.","And the last I'd say is what we wanted to do with the human element, I think a lot of our customers say there's not enough people in Macy's. I want to make sure that when I do need help, that I can find them, that they're taking me through a pretty complicated assortment if I need help. And so we've really focused on making sure that we have enough census in these buildings and that they are trained appropriately and that they're ready to go where the customer wants them to go.","So, as an example, on the beauty floor, you see us evolving from a brand-centric model to a customer-centric model, where these particular beauty associates are cross-trained in the products that the customer may be interested in. So they know the best mascaras beyond the brand that they're taking a paycheck with us from. And so that has been a way of us deconstructing every single business, the way the customer is shopping and making sure that our service model is in concert with that.","And the last thing I'd say with respect to these 50 doors is what we're doing within this kind of hubs of the community. And we have a lot we can do with special events and trunk shows and then using really community outreach as an opportunity to get footsteps into the building and once there, take good care of them. So that's how we're approaching it. There's technology. There's just the human touch and there's great assortment.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Jeff. That's really helpful. Just one follow-up, your comments earlier were really helpful regarding customer-centricity. As we think about customer-based valuation models, what's on your mind in terms of balancing the customer acquisition costs versus the lifetime value? Do you have any general thoughts about where you want to head with that metric as you get more data to really propel your thinking about acquiring new customers and fostering existing customers?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, you know, Oliver, our loyalty program, our Star Rewards program, was designed to address that exact issue. And what we saw was that, take care of the customers that are in your tent first. And so, when you look at the way we structured the Star Rewards program of Silver, Gold, Platinum, the intent on that was to give them different levels of rewards based on how they shopped and spent with us versus it being just kind of arithmetic progression. And so that has worked for us. So we've done a lot of analysis on this to say, if you're a Platinum customer, you generally were always going to be a customer with Macy's in the next year. But in many cases, you were shifting down, you were spending less.","The Platinum customer, what we're finding is that we're holding those spends at those spend levels better. And we're going to be judging that program based on how you hold a customer within that spend bucket. You also then want to serve as an aspiration for customers that are below those spend buckets that, see, I'll get these additional goodies if I spend higher. So if you get a shift up, that's a real positive. And all of that was taking care of the existing base.","What we're going to launch in 2018 is a tender-neutral program because we have some customers that don't want a Macy's credit card, but they want to be rewarded for having some level of allegiance to us, that they like our goods and services.","So to have a tender-neutral option is what we're going to be rolling out in the second quarter. It all leads to this conversation about lifetime value and starting not just to look at a transaction, but to really look at what that customer's spending with us over time. And with what we can do with data analytics and personalization and customization and how we communicate with her, we have lots of opportunities to be able to seed new ideas and new things that she might be interested in based on her data trail. So lifetime value is really where we're going on this, as well as ultimately looking at are we bringing new customers into the Macy's tent, so looking at it on both ends.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for those comments. Best regards.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I'll add my congrats on the improvement as well. I was curious if you could talk a little about the bricks-and-mortar improvement that you and the industry, I guess, saw over holiday. What do you think were the biggest drivers to your improvement from the third quarter? And, Karen, what are you assuming bricks-and-mortar looks like in 2018? And then, on the expense side, I guess, there's been a lot of puts and takes the last couple of years, a lot of expense initiatives. Karen, what kind of sales growth do you generally need to get expense leverage? Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I'll take the first question and Karen will take the second. I think the key for Macy's in the third and the fourth quarters was the consumer was out spending, and that was great. I think our products that we have been working very hard on and where we had been testing, getting those leveraged into our buildings, our gift assortments for both self-purchase as well as for gift-giving were quite strong and customers, they transacted on it.","I think we've been working on experience with new loyalty programs, with having more friction-free shopping on both online and in our stores. And while we have a long way to go, we made nice improvements.","And I also think, as I've mentioned two other times, we're executing better. And I think that our team is more aligned on the fundamentals of running a good retail operation than ever before. And I think the team is operating strongly against that. And we look at every single day as an opportunity to make happy customers. And that's not lip service. We're focused on that.","So Macy's is its strongest and we have very robust digital growth and it's coupled with a healthy brick-and-mortar business. And while we've had very strong digital business, we had opportunity in brick-and-mortar, so expect us to double-down our efforts and take the momentum that we have from fourth quarter into the new year.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","And the second question has actually gotten harder to answer over the years. I think, as many of you know, we used to say originally, we needed a 2% comp. Then it became a 1% comp. Then we found a way of leveraging SG&A with flat. And even in 2017, we leveraged SG&A with negative comp. So we have been very good in finding ways of appropriately dealing with expense as we've gone forward and the world has changed.","But as you see in 2018, we're, frankly, taking advantage of the flexibility that the tax reform enables us. And so you really have to, frankly, look down at net income as you're looking at the company's profitability. But we are investing to return to comp growth. And over time, that payback will become bigger and bigger. 2018 is somewhat of a pivoting year, but we do think it's important to invest and utilize the tax savings to help the company accelerate its comp growth, even beyond what we're talking about in 2018.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Super. Thanks very much and good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Shayne Arcilla - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. This is Shayne Arcilla calling in for Omar. So would like to know more about The Market @ Macy's, how big are these formats and what they're doing in terms of sales so far. And also, what are your thoughts in terms of the pros and cons of converting current wholesale brand shop-in-shops into concession formats, whereby the brands would own the inventory and fixtures and maybe also the staff and pay a concession fee to Macy's in exchange? It's just something we've noticed many department stores in Europe doing lately. Thanks.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So The Market @ Macy's today is about a little over 1,000 square feet and we have that in 10 of our stores. And in each of these 1,000 square feet, we have six to eight vendors' brands that we're now showing their wares. And this is a rental model. This is an opportunity for these brands to get in front of a lot of traffic, a lot of our customers. And so, in effect, what we do is these brands pay a rent to Macy's and we expose those brands.","We have a common fixture package. We have a cross-trained associate population that is trained on all of these products that work these areas. And it's turned out to be really exciting. I mean, you can have things like pop-up cards to a promotion on Peter Rabbit to 3D soles that go into shoes. I mean, there's many opportunities that you have with different businesses. And so far, so good.","We have tremendous response from vendors that want to be a part of this or brands that want to be a part of this. And so we have a growing queue of interest to go into this, and these brands can be part of this for a month. They can be there for longer. But it gives us a flexible format to bring this kind of parade of newness for a customer that we believe will seed incremental visit, that customers will want to go out and check out what's going on at The Market @ Macy's.","We also then can provide back to these brands the consumer behavior. What did they look at? What were they interested in? If it's iPad technology, you can actually see where they went through the queue and where they stopped. So we're learning that with our relationship with Beta, which is right next door to The Market @ Macy's in Herald Square. So it's a very interesting concept. So far, it's been a great response and we'll keep you posted on that.","As for your broader question about the use of real estate in an owned versus licensed or another hybrid economic model, there's many examples of this. And I look to our Bloomingdale's brand who is I think, showing the way on the Macy's side to how this can be done. And we still have a relatively small piece of our overall business that's being done in licensed products. Bloomingdale's it's higher. And Bloomingdale's is more developed in certain families of business versus Macy's.","I think at the end of the day, it all comes down to what's the richer customer experience? What's the opportunity to get customers just really thrilled to be back in brick-and-mortar again? And so I think the lease model has a place in that strategy. And so when I look at a business like Sunglass Hut or Finish Line, where we have a much broader assortment than we ever provided when it was an owned business and we have dominance in vendors. It's a great model in that we're giving great service. There is application to take that into other pieces of the store.","The Market @ Macy's gives us, without having to make a commitment on a particular business or a particular brand for too long, it gives us this roving kind of newness that comes into these buildings. So I think it's going to be a combination for us. And we have space in our doors. We have the opportunity to monetize this space so it's more customer-centric and it's more profitable. And so that's the advantage that we have. Even in our most productive stores, we can be more productive. So expect us to continue to push the edges on getting the right content in these buildings and play with the economic models that we're testing.","Shayne Arcilla - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Todd, good morning.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Karen, congratulations on reducing your leverage to within your targeted range. There's a lot of hard work that went into that, I know. And I guess the question I have for you is going forward, you indicated that excess cash continues to be deployed towards debt reduction. Should we think about you reducing debt through a combination of open-market debt repurchases this year and then consideration of another tender at some point or can you give us any guidance along those lines?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No, I can't at this point. Sorry, Todd.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, that's fair enough. I guess the other thing then would be in terms of where you turn off the spigot for deploying cash towards debt reduction versus accumulating on the balance sheet. If you get down towards the lower end of your targeted range, should you be more inclined to accumulate cash than pay down debt?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, I mean, the key, as we've said, we want to maintain being in that target range. And as I gave you when we talked about 2017 results, excluding the Union Square gain, which is a big very large somewhat one-time event, when you exclude that, we're not quite in the range yet. So we need to use 2018's cash flow to get us into the range. And then we're committed to staying there. So I think that's really the key.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Fair enough. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Karen.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the improvement. With some of the new initiatives that you've done on the loyalty program so far, what are the key learnings from there and how do you think it influences the business going forward? And on private labels versus brands, given the increased fashion that you're bringing in, where do you see that penetration rate going? Thank you.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","You want to take loyalty?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes. And loyalty, I think the key, Dana, is I think customers that are good customers like to be rewarded as such. And I think we're finding, as Jeff mentioned for that Platinum level, our highest spenders, they are really appreciating the recognition as well as the combination of benefits we're giving them, which includes a giveback component in terms of Macy's Money as well as the free shipping on Macys.com every day. So I think that's doing well. But interestingly, the lower levels, that are getting less benefits, are feeling good as well.","So sometimes, I think just clear crisp communication does a lot. And we're going to continue to fine-tune what we give in addition to what I would call financial benefits, but also just feel good benefits that I think can be a part of sort of the Macy's experience. So I'm excited by the further refinements that we expect for the proprietary credit card customer. And, as Jeff mentioned, we're also rolling out a tender-neutral component, which we think will be terrific as well.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And then, Dana, to your second question about private label, it's going to grow. It's currently about 20% of our business. It's going to go higher. It's a piece of that growth of going from 29% to 40%. I can't tell you exactly where it's going to end up, but know that we've got very developed growth strategies in many of our private brands.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Callen with Bank of America.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thank you. Karen, just a spin-off of Todd's question, I guess, thinking longer-term and considering how quickly leverage gotten outside of your comfort zone in 2016, 2017, why is 2.5 [times] to 2.8 the right long-term target? Why not drive to 2.5 or even below to give you more cushion in the period of another point of sales weakness potentially in the future?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Look, we review these targets every year. We do believe it's the right target range for us. But obviously, we will look at it every year and see if we feel differently.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I guess, just remind us. Is there a credit rating target that you're trying to get to or are you, I guess, comfortable at the low BBB rating?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I think the key thing is we think it's important to be investment grade. What exact rating we get in there, it's harder to target that because we're not really in control. So I prefer to think of the leverage ratio target as the way we're operating the business because that is within our control. But clearly, maintaining an investment grade rating is very important to us.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood, thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, good morning. Jeff, you outlined the merchandising initiatives last year would incrementally contribute about $100 million, $125 million and then Backstage, maybe $25 million to $35 million. As you think about 2018, should those numbers on the merchandising side jump to $150 million to $200 million because you get a full year impact from them? And then, it looks to us like Backstage may contribute as much as $100 million, given the rollout you have. Can you ring-fence some of that so as we think about the year, what the impact would be the same way you did last year?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","We're not prepared to do that right now, Wayne, in terms of breaking that out. But know that logic is how we're looking at the overall plan. Backstage is going to contribute a more significant piece of our growth than it did in 2017. There's going to be a mix of these merchandising initiatives that you're going to see. It's going to be a little different than what it was in 2017 because things like fine jewelry, which we were rolling out, is now fully there.","So we're not going to see the same growth in that. You're not going to see the same growth in women's shoes that we had, but you're going to see new growth in areas where merchandising is in play. We're going to see growth again in handbags. You're going to see more growth in Big Ticket. You're going to see more aggressive growth in things like dresses.","Active, which has been on a very strong growth strategy for us, is basically planned at the same level in 2018. So the merchandising mix is going to change a little bit, but the growth expectation is similar. But you'll see Backstage is going to be a bigger piece. And then the Growth 50 we expect a nice increase with that.","And then, the last comment would be on vendor direct, because that was not part of our strategy in 2017. We had some. We're going to have a lot more in 2018, which is going to be a piece of our revenue walk.","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And what type of products on that? Go ahead.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","To start, Wayne, obviously, the opportunity is endless about what we could do with that. But the bulk of our initial focus is going to be on home store.","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And, I guess my final question comes back to Backstage. Have you been able to solve for the challenge around a seamless checkout? Because, I guess, some pricing, you have to go through that, in California, specifically, you have a separate checkout area, is what I may or may not understand correctly. But how do you solve for that to make it easier? And then, in these premium malls, where do you find the space in home and footwear where you might be able to really capture share there?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","We're working on the systems opportunity within Backstage. So we're looking at systems right now. We're looking at supply chain right now. So those are the two big fundamentals that we're looking at, at Backstage. So we're getting to a point where it's becoming a nice size business and making sure that we have the tech spend to make sure that our store systems and our supply chain systems are ready for that is what we're focused on right now. So we should have an answer to what you're questioning, Wayne, later in the year.","And then, with respect to the shoes and some of the biggest categories for us has been the growth of shoes in Backstage. That has certainly not cannibalized anything going on in the rest of the store. It's one of the real standouts in Backstage, as is soft home. They have been the two biggest standouts that we've seen.","And then, what we've done did that is in your most productive doors, we're starting to test Backstage in a smaller square footage. And that gives us the confidence that instead of Backstage being in 20,000 square feet, that we can do it really well in 10,000 square feet. So expect us to continue to test in that.","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Karen, just one final question for you, as you contemplate the real estate with Brookfield and maybe setting up JVs, should we be thinking about in 2019 and beyond, that there would be a capital contribution on Macy's part into the JV to redevelop properties? And how you're thinking about ring-fencing that, what that might or might not be?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, there could be, Wayne. But at this point, that is not something we're contemplating.","Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thank you so much for squeezing me in. Karen, I was just wondering if you might be able to shed some light on sort of how you think about open market debt repurchase versus sort of broader-based tender. And what are some of the benefits that one provides versus the other?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, I think we're obviously trying to maximize the economics of the transaction and take advantage of situations where there might be bonds available in the open market.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And to the extent that those aren't available, then the tender makes more sense. Is that fair?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","It may, even if they are. So, again, we make this decision based on the facts at the time.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And it's an NPV economic decision. Is that fair?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","That's a factor, sure.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session as well as today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","Karen M.

Just a reminder, today's call is being recorded. And now it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Karen, please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet","Great. Thank you, and good morning. And welcome to the Macy's call scheduled to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance and to outline our key planning assumptions for 2013. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.","As you saw a few weeks ago, we ended 2012 very strongly with an outstanding January sales performance, which was far ahead of our expectations. We actually made up much of the November, December shortfall and achieved a 3.9% comp growth in the quarter, just short of our original guidance. It was a good quarter and a very good year. In fact, it was the third year in a row in which we've produced very strong sales, profit and cash flow. We are clearly operating on all cylinders.","When we reorganized the company in 2009, we began instilling much more of a growth culture that is now beginning to take hold, and our strategies are being executed very successfully. Our 3 key strategies are still what we affectionately call MOM. I'll talk more about each of these later on the call, but just to list them now, the first, My Macy's. This was actually our fourth holiday season since putting the My Macy's structure in place. We continue to build on our success and find new ways each year to satisfy customers through greater localization. This is so critical and frankly, it cannot be emulated by the competition.","The second key strategy, the O in MOM, omnichannel. This strategy offers so much opportunity for us. We have been building these capabilities for years and yet, there is so much more to come on this subject.","And three, the last M, MAGIC Selling. We are improving the selling capabilities of our store associates while also empowering more local decision-making. The momentum continues to build, and we have a very long runway in front of us.","Sales in the fourth quarter were $9,350,000,000, up 7.2% over last year. But remember, part of this is due to the extra week in the 2012 calendar. On a comp basis with the same number of weeks, the fourth quarter sales were up 3.9% over last year. The categories of business that were strongest in the fourth quarter were handbags, watches, shoes, women's suits, active, men's overall, home textiles, luggage and furniture and mattresses. And the weaker businesses were housewares and junior's. Private brands also had a good quarter, with particularly good growth coming from the Millennial classic apparel and home textile brands.","Geographically, we performed best during the quarter in our southern markets, as well though at some markets in other parts of the country such as western New York, Oregon and Colorado.","Bloomingdale's had a decent quarter, especially considering the fact that the Bloomingdale's stores were disproportionally hurt by Sandy given their geographic footprint. Average unit retail increased approximately 4% in the fourth quarter, with transactions up about 1% and units per transactions down about 1%. As anticipated, the increase in AUR did moderate in the back half of the year, and we were very pleased though to see the number of transactions increase.","Sales transacted over the Internet were very strong, up 48% in the quarter on a comp 13-week basis. We are very pleased with how both macys.com and bloomingdales.com are helping us to both grow our customer base and also to increase spend with existing store customers. We are benefiting from very large increases in traffic on the website but also in conversion. The increase in conversion is particularly encouraging given the growth in mobile traffic, where conversion does tend to be lower than on desktops. More on this later.","Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 40.6%, down 40 basis points versus last year. Merchandise margin was up slightly in the quarter, but the success of our omnichannel approach with the shipping costs impacts our reported gross margin.","Inventory at year end was up 3.3% on a comp basis. This increase is below our first quarter expected sales. It might, though, be a little bit higher than what you had expected. This is because of a conscious decision to bring in more transitional merchandise into our stores so that they would be fresh for post-Christmas selling. We believe in fact that this was a key factor behind the success in January.","SG&A expenses were $2,004,000,000 in the fourth quarter, or 3.7% above a year ago. We benefited in the quarter from higher credit income, which was $44 million favorable to last year. This was more than offset by increased spending to fuel omnichannel sales, the expense for the 53rd week and $16 million higher in pension and surf expense. But as a percent of sales, SG&A in the quarter improved 90 basis points, which more than offset the lower gross margin rate.","Operating income, excluding store closing costs and impairments in the quarter, was $1,396,000,000, or 14.9% of sales. This is up 11% over last year, or as a percent of sales, up 50 basis points. Store closing cost impairments and gain on sale of leases were a loss of $5 million this year as compared to an income of $25 million last year.","Interest expense was $106 million in the quarter, and we booked an additional $133 million in the quarter related to the debt tender that we completed in November.","The tax rate in the fourth quarter was 36.6%, approximately the same as last year. Net income, excluding store closing cost, impairments and the interest expense associated with the tender, was $818 million.","Average diluted share count was 399 million shares. And EPS on this basis was $2.05, up 21% over last year on this basis. Including the store closings, impairment and the tender premiums, EPS in the fourth quarter was $1.83.","The full year's results are actually quite similar to those in the fourth quarter. Comp store sales increased 3.7% for the year. We had a slightly lower reported gross margin rate due to the impact of free shipping. We had good SG&A rate improvement, lower share count due to the buyback, all similar to the fourth quarter. And when you put all of these factors together, for the full year, operating income was 12% above last year, excluding store closing costs, impairments and gain on the sale of leases. And as a percent of sales, EBIT on this basis increased 60 basis points. EBITDA as a percent of sales for the full year was 13.4%, up 30 basis points over last year. Return on invested capital was 21.2%, up 50 basis points over last year. Cash flow from operations net of investing activities was $1.4 billion. And we utilized $1.35 billion of cash to buy back 35.6 million shares in 2012. And we also doubled our quarterly dividend to $0.20 a share.","EPS grew 20% over last year, excluding store closing cost, impairments, the gain on the sale of leases last year and the debt tender. And our EPS on this basis was $3.46, which compares to our expectation that we said at this time a year ago of $3.25 to $3.30.","We are very happy with these results. The consistency of our strong sales growth combined with improving profitability over the past 3 years is something of which we're quite proud.","As we look back on 2012, it was a big year for the company. In addition to it being the third year of very strong financial performance, we made some big steps strategically that are positioning us well to continue our good performance in the future. Let's go back to those 3 key strategies, MOM.","First, My Macy's. In 2012, we instilled renewed energy into My Macy's by simplifying some of the processes and executing some very successful strategies, including warm weather, Latino, a small store prototype and what we call extreme growth stores. Each of these, and there are more, would convince you, I think, that we will continue to gain benefits in future years from this focus on localization. This organization and the processes we've put in place that enable us to localize our offering are truly giving us a sustainable, competitive advantage.","The second strategy, omnichannel. In the fourth quarter, we saw the beginning of the enormous opportunity in front of us from approaching our business from an omnichannel perspective. We are working to provide our customers with seamless experiences no matter how they choose to shop with us and to utilize the strengths of each channel to satisfy demand and service the customers' needs better than we could if we didn't operate multiple channels. It is really exciting, and our team is embracing the new possibilities and working very hard to improve our capabilities and maximize the opportunities.","One area on which we're focusing lots of resources is how to best optimize the use of warehouses and our stores in an ever-changing fulfillment environment. As you know, we are filling many items that are ordered in our stores from the inventory either from other stores or from our online fulfillment centers. At the same time, we began in 2012 to fill orders that are entered online out of inventory in our stores. We currently have 292 stores enabled to fulfill goods, up from only 23, a year ago. And by the fall of this year, we expect to have a total of approximately 500 stores for filling orders. We're finding that customers don't really care from where we pull the goods, as long as we fill the order accurately and the delivery is timely. We've built algorithms to help us determine from where to pull the inventory, and we are learning more each day about how we need to refine these formulas.","We are really just scratching the surface here. In fact, in the future, we expect these fulfillment locations will be key to offering faster and even same-day delivery, and also will enable the customer to buy online and pick up in-store.","And our omnichannel initiatives extend far beyond fulfillment. We are busy improving both our website and our mobile app to make shopping easier and faster. We are taking new approaches to marketing that utilize digital technology and benefit from utilizing a 360-degree view of our customers' shopping behavior with us, and we are collaborating on our merchandise strategies between the channels.","This is all very exciting. But remember, it all starts for us with great product and a great in-store experience. Our merchandise acumen and our ability to run great stores are central to our omnichannel success. The line between stores and the Internet is blurring so much that beginning in 2013, we are no longer going to break out our Internet growth when we report our results.","The third strategy, the final M, MAGIC Selling. We are focused on training and coaching our associates to improve our engagement with the customer and our selling skills. Our Net Promoter Score keeps improving, indicating to us that progress is being made.","We're also working hard to encourage our store associates to think omnichannel. This means selling customers merchandise that may in fact not be in that store, whether it be out of stock or not even carried in that particular location. It also means embracing the customer making a return. These changes aren't easy, but we're working hard to make them happen.","We also began in 2012 to formulate our Millennial strategy, which includes active. Active, as you heard me mention a few minutes ago, was one of our best-performing categories in the fourth quarter. And as we move to 2013, we believe that will continue to build.","The Finish Line partnership is bringing added credibility to Macy's as a destination for this category, and we're very excited about the very early results in our first store they converted. We are feeling very good about our strategy and the assortment that the Millennial customer is going to start seeing later in 2013. We are particularly excited about our product offering for the older millennial customer, what we call impulse, which is a customer for whom we frankly have not had as much to offer in the past.","By the end of 2013, we expect to have launched 13 new millennial brands at Macy's and expanded 11 existing millennial brands. We believe we're laying the framework to make this a very important source of growth for us in 2014 and '15.","So let's now move on to our outlook for 2013. As I have said repeatedly, we feel great about our strategies and the momentum with which we're entering the year. Our key planning assumptions for 2013 are pretty straightforward. One, we are assuming an annual comp increase of approximately 3.5% for the year on a 52-week against 52-week basis. And I should mention that it would be approximately 30 basis points higher were it not for the conversion of the athletic shoe business to a leased operation. While there are lots of calendar shifts by month this year resulting from the fact that 2013 follows a 53rd-week, there's really only one major calendar shift between quarters, but it happens to be between the first and second quarters. Due to the timing of promotional events and how they fall on this year's fiscal calendar, our first quarter is planned 2 to 3 points higher than the second quarter.","We are opening 3 Macy's stores in 2013: 1 in Gurnee Mills outside Chicago; 1 in Victorville, California, in Southern California; and a replacement store in Bay Shore on Long Island. We're also expanding our Las Vegas fashion show store from Macy's by adding a new box, which will offer an expanded men's offering. And we're also opening a Bloomingdale's store in Glendale in Southern California and 1 Bloomingdale's outlet store outside of Chicago.","Total store sales growth is expected to be approximately the same as comp growth for the first 3 quarters of the year. But remember, the fourth quarter will have 1 less week than it did in 2012. So as a result, the total sales growth for the fourth quarter is assumed to be approximately 330 basis points below the comp growth in the fourth quarter. For the year as a whole, that difference should be approximately 120 basis points. But again, it's all happening in the fourth quarter.","Net-net, we are assuming an operating income rate increase in 2013. But I have to say that it is getting more challenging as our profit level rises. Plus, building our omnichannel capabilities requires an investment, and these transactions do require higher incremental expense, which, as you know, goes into gross margin due to the shipping cost. We are still committed to and very much focused on exceeding the 14% EBITDA target rate in the near future.","We are assuming flattish to slightly down gross margin given again the expected growth in omnichannel transactions, but we assume that we will be able to continue to leverage our SG&A and improve as a rate, offsetting any reduction in gross margin rate.","Included in the SG&A are the following assumptions embedded for 2013. Credit income is assumed to be approximately $10 million to $15 million better than 2012 in 2013. We're expecting about $10 million less in depreciation and amortization than in 2012. And our retirement expense, including the 401(k) match, is assumed to be approximately $5 million higher in 2013 than 2012.","We're assuming interest expense of approximately $395 million and a tax rate for the year of 36.95%. We've budgeted CapEx for the year at $925 million and expect to make $150 million pension contribution during the year.","Embedded in our guidance is our ongoing stock buyback program. And as you saw, the EPS guidance is $3.90 to $3.95. This would represent a 13% to 14% increase in EPS over 2012.","So that's an overview of our 2012 performance and our outlook for 2013. Just to give a little bit of perspective, consider how far we have come over the past 3 years. Since 2009, we have added over $4 billion to top line sales. We've added more than $1.2 billion to operating income. And as a percent of sales, operating income increased 340 basis points to 9.6%. We've increased the return on invested capital to 21.2%, 630 basis points over the 14.9% in 2009. And our earnings per share grew from $1.36 in 2009 to $3.46 in 2012, or on average, 36% per-year growth.","And as we have said repeatedly, we have a very long runway ahead of us for further improvement within the strategic framework that has been so effective in revolutionizing our business. You see this reflected in our 2013 guidance.","If I was to pick 2 words to describe Macy's Inc. today, they would be confident and determined. Our very talented people continue to be very excited about what lies ahead. We hope that you too share our enthusiasm for the prospects in our vision. And now I'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Deborah Weinswig at Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you talk about how the Millennial strategy has changed the rest of your women's business and how you think about women's in the future?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think it's early, Deb. We're just, as I said, bringing many of these brands in this year. But we do believe this is a customer we didn't previously serve, and we think it will be very helpful. We also think, by the way, that some of us older -- or at least I won't speak for you, I'll speak for myself -- older customers may also like these Millennial assortments. So I think it's going to be very exciting additions to our ready-to-wear floor.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then we're seeing many of your competitors or other department store retailers making big investments on the technology side, yet you're guiding for SG&A improvement. And also, we're not seeing a huge step-up in CapEx or tech. Can you talk about how your approach has been different over the past few years and why you're positioned for SG&A leverage in the future?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we are investing just as aggressively than I think any of our competitors. We are trying to be balanced, and we think that, that's possible in this environment. And again, with the sales growth being so high, we are able to lever the SG&A.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, you've been one of the pioneers in RFID. Can you talk about how you're utilizing the technology and what we should expect going forward?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think our 2 priorities relating to RFID, the first would be replenishment. And by this -- by the fall, we're hoping to have roughly half of our replenishment business utilizing RFID. Our stores will all be enabled by early in the fall, and we're just waiting as the vendors come up and begin to tag the goods. But replenishment is roughly 30% of our business. So this could be very important as we go forward. The second key priority with RFID has related to our store display. We interestingly started this at Herald Square in the shoe department where we used RFID to be able to audit the shoes on display on the floor. Because as you imagine, they get moved a lot during a day. And it's been extraordinarily successful. We've rolled it out now to all of women's shoes across the company. And next up, to do the same -- utilize the technology the same way will be luggage and men's shoes, which will be up this summer.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go next to Jeff Stein at Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- again, going back to the Millennial strategy, reconcile kind of the weakness in junior's with your optimism that -- and I know junior's is only a piece of Millennial, but you're reconciling that with your optimism on the Millennial strategy. And wondering if you've tested any of these new brands that are going to be rolled out. And kind of -- what kind of reaction you've seen by the customer if you have tested?","Karen M. Hoguet","Jeff, we test most everything that we do, but I'm not up-to-date on specific tests, vis-\u00e0-vis the brands. But we did a lot of research and testing as we've developed them. So I'm sure that, that is happening as we speak. If you think about the Millennial strategy, as I said earlier, that older millennial is where we saw whitespace. So we're really focusing a lot of attention on that customer. That's also a customer who's going to buy lots of merchandise beyond apparel. As you know, we've rolled out our Impulse cosmetics areas. Also, Impulse is an important part of our shoe strategy and other accessory areas. So all of that is in play. And again, we've talked about active.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","And finally, with rolling out to store fulfillment from online to 500 stores by fall, do you feel comfortable that you've got the store labor situation under control? And are you able to still leverage your store payroll with the, I presume, the increase in hours required to service that omnichannel customer?","Karen M. Hoguet","The answer to that question is yes. Our store's team have done a spectacular job of doing this fulfillment very accurately, on time and budgeting accordingly. So we feel very confident of our store's organization ability to do this.","Operator","Our next question today is from Paul Swinand with MorningStar Investment.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to drill down a little on the online and the margin. I know you've talked about free shipping and some impacts to gross margin. But as you shift more to mobile and as it continues to evolve, could it actually be better for gross margins? I mean, are people buying more items? Is it higher AUR? And is there more full price, I guess?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, historically, that's all been true. But candidly, it's getting so hard to know what's a store sale and what's a mobile sale and what's Internet. But over time, we do hope to have a higher merchandise margin to offset some of those costs. But I think that's farther down the road.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Is the mobile customer accelerating some of those trends or loosening any of them? I guess, I would speculate that the mobile customer wants convenience and will buy quickly and maybe more at full price?","Karen M. Hoguet","I wouldn't speculate that.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Drbul at Barclays Capital.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is the -- the first question I have is in your assumptions for '13, I know you're going to stop providing the online growth. But can you just tell us how much online growth is assumed?","And will it be higher or lower than what you experienced this year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, as I said, it's getting harder to figure out the lines between them. So I really can't give you that number. I mean, I don't know it. But clearly, the growth is continuing very aggressively. But sometimes, it's being bought on a mobile device sitting in a store. So I'm not sure how to define that.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on the 292 stores that you have, omnichannel stores, can you just talk a little bit about some of the learnings from that and any changes being made as you go up to the 500 stores fulfilling orders?","Karen M. Hoguet","It's a lot of details, Bob, and I really don't know all of them. But clearly, the stores have compared best practices and are trying to do that. One of the early learnings was that we had thought we would have special-purpose people doing the fulfillment activity. And we discovered that we were better off using the support associates that we had, because they better understood the merchandise, and people who were putting merchandise on the floor are going to find it much quicker if they understand it. So we did change the staffing model some. But there's a lot of details that go into this, and our store operations group is just doing a terrific job as I said rolling out best practices.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question is can you just talk a little bit about the cold weather categories? Sort of how you've come through that and sort of your experience there over the last several months?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, January was good, as you recall, in cold weather. But for the fall season as a whole, it was another disappointing cold weather season. We thought that was impossible after 2011, but it happened again in 2012.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Your inventories -- I mean, is everything sort of cleaned up at this point as you move forward?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we've actually consciously held goods over because as you know, the cold weather is still here. We had done that last year, and it was very successful. Sometimes, we clear our floors too early. And so, we have kept some of the cold weather merchandise on the floor to continue to be able to sell now. But we don't see any liability in terms of future markdowns.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go next to Matthew Boss at JPMorgan. Matt?","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, about a year ago, we sat down at headquarters and talked about My Macy's, MAGIC Selling, door-to-store, all really in early innings. What would you say over the past year -- what's been your largest learning? And then looking forward, what do you think the largest opportunity is?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's a hard question. I think the learnings have just been there's so much more to learn. There's still so much more we can do with My Macy's. And every year, we find new things. We're working with our vendors and MMG to specialize product even more for customer groups, geography stores. Omnichannel, obviously, there's a huge opportunity in front of us as we integrate our strategic thinking more across channels. And MAGIC Selling, again, it's on a trajectory to keep improving the level of service we're giving to our customers. So I think the biggest learning is just how much more we have to accomplish.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Not a bad problem to have. As you look forward, the continued merchandise margin improvement this quarter was encouraging. Can you speak to where we're at today versus prior peak? And then how should we think about door-to-store and what this could be -- what kind of opportunity this could be to gross margin going forward?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, our merchandise margins are at historic peak. The question on the table is, through this optimization of inventory, is there more potential through -- and we have to see from there. So we do expect there to be some improvement in merchandise margin as we go forward. Unclear if in '13 if it's going to offset the added delivery cost associated with omnichannel, as I said earlier. It very well may, but jury's still out.","Operator","Our next question today is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First, just to clarify your comments earlier on the top line, the first quarter, we should expect same-store sales to be 2 to 3 points above the second quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's correct.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But roughly about 3.5% still for the first half?","Karen M. Hoguet","3.5% for the year, but I don't see a lot of deviation besides that first and second quarter.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then regarding your cash, certainly, you have a lot of cash. What should we expect from a share repurchase standpoint in '13? Should it be a similar amount to what we saw in 2012?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we don't comment on guiding to this amount of stock we're going to buy back. As we've said, that is what we use our excess cash for. But how much we actually buy back depends on the price of the stock, depends on the cash being generated from the business, market conditions, et cetera. But we've said that, that is what we're going to use our excess cash for.","Operator","Our next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Karen, I was just wondering if you could give us your updated thoughts on the capital structure and if there's an opportunity to perhaps borrow to further fuel the buyback program this year?","Karen M. Hoguet","There's always an opportunity. And I think, as we said in the past, our credit rating is very important to us. And we had set credit ratios a couple of years ago for debt-to-EBITDA and EBITDA-to-interest, and we still are living by those targets. So in 2012, we hit the low end of the debt-to-EBITDA target. So again, there is still potential to raise incremental debt in '13, given the improvements in the EBITDA. But we are working to maintain or even increase our credit rating as it is today. But that doesn't preclude increasing the debt level some.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then looking at your $925 million of CapEx guidance, is that a good longer-term run rate? Or will we see that taper off as you complete more of the flagship renovation in the out years?","Karen M. Hoguet","I would not expect it to taper off. And I think the unknown is whether or when we might build another mega center, which might cause that CapEx to go up over the $925 million somewhat in a year when we build that. But we don't know that yet. But I would not expect it to go down over time.","Operator","Our next question is Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I was wondering if you could just talk to us a little bit about the store-to-door, maybe ask the questions a little bit differently. But can you talk a little bit about the cost profile initiative and if it's a drag to margins beyond what we've seen in the past for e-commerce sales fulfilled from a warehouse? And has that profile changed as you started to scale the business up I guess?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think the key thing to focus on is the improving margins we're talking about. It's so hard to define profitability by these individual transactions and allocate everything. If I were you, I would just focus on the fact the operating income is expected to continue to increase as a percent of sales.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And is that a function of -- I mean, I think you're one of the only ones that we can clearly say it feels like as your Internet scales, it's really becoming a contributor to the profitability. But I mean, 9.6 operating margin is [indiscernible].","Karen M. Hoguet","It's always been a contributor to the business.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. And maybe, as you think about the comp guidance for the year and maybe the components that went into it as you built it, AUR has been coming down a little bit each quarter. Will 2013 be more about transactions and unit growth than 2012 was? And is there any changes to the way you plan the business differently with that being said?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think we expect the AUR increase to be similar to what it was in the fall.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Heather N. Balsky - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Karen, this is actually Heather Balsky on for Kimberly. I was wondering if you could just talk about some of your strategies and the progress you've made, in particular, price optimization. And also, your focus on sort of leveraging your store base to sort of do -- I guess showcase the items in the store but only ship from online?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, that's part of the omnichannel work. We've done a lot of experimenting this year with goods that are in the stores for which we don't have inventory backing it up. A lot of those initiatives have done very well. We've also experimented with putting merchandise online that we don't have inventory in the online warehouse, as the inventory is only in stores. In the fourth quarter, we had about 700 items that we tested this with very successfully. So we will continue to roll out and do more of showing goods online that we're not keeping in the online warehouses, which is a great thing for the customer, and also is good from a profitability perspective because these are typically goods whose economics don't do so well in big warehouses. So we continue to be very excited about that. In terms of price optimization, I think that's proven to be a lot harder than we had expected it to be, and we're still working on how to optimize pricing across the company. But that has not been as easy to do as we had hoped early on.","Operator","And we'll move next to Liz Dunn at Macquarie. Liz?","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess my question is about Bloomingdale's. Can we just have a little bit more information? I know you said that they did pretty well in the quarter, but how are you feeling about their specific merchandising strategies and their outlook for 2013? And then also, an update on Bloomingdale's outlet?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I would say Bloomingdale's is doing well relative to its peer group, and we feel pretty good about it. It was a tougher year in 2012, but it was a really strong year in 2011. And when you put it together, we feel good about their merchandise strategies and what's ahead for Bloomingdale's in 2013. They very successfully launched the Loyalist, the new loyalty program last year at Bloomingdale's. And again, they just continue to make progress. On the outlets, I would say they continue to -- or refine the strategy and work on it to improve it. That's why you don't see us adding a significant number of outlets yet. But we expect that to start happening very shortly.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Moving on, we'll go next to Dana Telsey at Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","So I can definitely tell the thought that's going into fulfillment and the channel convergence that's occurring. How do you think about the labor costs involved in fulfillment? And is there any update on mobile? Are the margins -- as you see long term, the margins as the combined business, do they have the opportunity to move higher with the labor costs that are involved?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, as we've said, we are marching up to exceed that 14% EBITDA rate, and a lot of that is being driven by these omnichannel transactions. So we feel very good about the profitability of the business going forward.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","And how many fulfillment centers do you think there can be over time?","Karen M. Hoguet","In the stores?","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yes.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we're going to have 500 up this year, which represents about 85% of our business. So a significant number, and we may increase it from there.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","And is mobile having an impact, Karen? Are you seeing that?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, mobile is clearly becoming more important, whether it be tablets or smartphones. And so we're spending a lot of time developing our mobile apps, working on those to make them easier to use, both to shop but also for information.","Operator","Our next question is from Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Could you speak a little bit about trends in women's apparel and amplify a bit on the success in activewear?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I would say, overall, women's apparel has continued to be tough. Every month or so, we see some light at the end of the tunnel, but it really hasn't overall produced that well. As you heard, we had a good fourth quarter in women's suits. Dresses has been improving. Some of the classic private brands did very well in women's approval. But overall, the numbers have not been as strong as the rest of the store. Now as I said, the Impulse business, which will be on our ready-to-wear floor as part of the Millennial, we think is going to be helpful. And hopefully, all boats [ph] will rise and women's apparel will do better as we get into the fall season.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Could you amplify a little bit on the success in activewear that you noted?","Karen M. Hoguet","I'm not sure what you mean.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","I thought you said that activewear performed particularly well.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, it did, both in men's and women's. We think that the Finish Line addition will also help drive that business even further.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Glick at Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just to follow-up on the category trends. Clearly, accessories has been a big driver for the last few years. Are you seeing any signs of any loss of momentum there? And are you still planning that as one of the key areas, i.e. Center Core? And then secondly, if you can give us a little more detail on how the CapEx breaks down? How much is going to be Herald Square and some of the learnings you have from the transition you went through this year and what you applied to maybe minimize disruption this year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. In terms of the accessories, Center Core business, is they continue to be very, very strong, and we expect that to continue in 2013. In terms of the CapEx budget, it's really very similar to this year. Remember, Herald Square was going to be about $400 million over 4 years. So it's still going to be a significant chunk of the capital in 2013. We are thrilled that parts of the store are now open, which are helping to offset some of the disruption. The women's shoe floor has been doing spectacularly, and the jewelry areas are doing better and better now that the first floor is -- the Luxe shop's open. But the first floor, if you've been over here lately, is still very disrupted, both in the cosmetic side and also the men's side. So that disruption will continue. I am not up to date, David, on all the learnings, but I'm sure that the Herald Square team learned a lot last year about how to minimize the disruption, and they're doing everything in their power to do that. But there still will be disruption this year.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Are you as pleased on the handbag side of that first floor as you are with the shoe area upstairs?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. The first floor has been a little harder to read because not everything is complete, and there's still disruption. The shoe floor is completely done, so it's easier to read. But we are pleased with all of the areas that have been completed so far.","Operator","And moving on, we'll go next to Wayne Hood at BMO Capital Markets.","Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of questions. Can you give us some sense of what percent of your sales are tied to free shipping and kind of what's embedded in the guidance? And is there any particular product classifications that are tied more to that?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't know the specific percentage, but it's -- those transactions are happening out of store and also the online orders. So it is obviously becoming a bigger percentage of the business.","But don't forget, the lion's share of our business is still what I would call plain old store sales. So a lot of the growth and the attention is on dot-com and this omnichannel area, which is absolutely helping us tremendously in terms of growth. But the lion's share of our transactions are still what I would call in old-fashioned retail sale.","Wayne L. Hood - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. And my last question I guess was just a discussion around credit. I think, coming into the year, you thought credit income would be about $610 million, and I'm just wondering where that landed and kind of what's embedded in your guidance for credit income in the coming year? And is there any nuances quarter-to-quarter as you adjust kind of the income coming in?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, credit this year, the income is about $663 million, which is obviously better than what we had expected at the beginning of the year. It was a combination of good performance of the portfolio, but also credit sales grew more than what we had anticipated earlier in the year. As we look to the guidance for 2013, we're expecting that income to still go up, but only by about $10 million to $15 million. So getting less help year-over-year in 2013, but still a positive.","Operator","And we'll go next to Priya Ohri-Gupta at Barclays Capital.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Was hoping you could speak a little bit more about your credit ratings objective? You discussed sort of holding ratings at the current level or looking to improve. Should we now think of high BBB as a potential objective? Or is it just getting to mid-BBB ratings across all 3 agencies?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we said repeatedly we'd like to be mid-BBB. But given the strength of the business and the cash flow, we could easily find ourselves above that. But our targeted has been to be a strong mid-BBB rating.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So if you find yourselves above the mid-BBB, should we expect that you would come back down to the BBB [ph] over time?","Karen M. Hoguet","I can't see that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Donald Palmer [ph] at Discovery Capital Management.","Unknown Analyst","Your primary department store competitors had a challenging 2012, with the most challenged competitor handing over about $4 billion in sales to Macy's and others. Can you give us a sense for how much that dynamic contributed to Macy's 2012? And if you could, just help us quantify or factor in how much of that you factored in, in terms of your 2013 guidance? Did you assume a similar competitive tailwind? Or something else?","Karen M. Hoguet","I really can't comment on that.","Unknown Analyst","On either the 2012 or the 2013 guidance?","Karen M. Hoguet","Either one.  I mean, as you know, it's obviously helped us in '12. But remember, the overlap between customers isn't 100%. And so there's a lot of our customers that are well above shopping at Penney.","Operator","And that is all the questions we have at this time. Ms. Hoguet, I'd like to turn the program back over to you for any additional or concluding remarks, ma'am.","Karen M. Hoguet","No, that's it. But thank you all very much. And if you have additional questions, just either call me, Matt or Sara, and we'll do what we can to be helpful today. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us and wish you a good day."],"14002":["Macy's, Inc.

Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead sir.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Great, thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Macy's conference call scheduled to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings. I'm Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company.","Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","As we announced in early January, we had a disappointing November\/December. Fortunately, with the cold weather in the new year, business did improve in January, and we did better than expected at the time of our January announcement and earnings were stronger as a result. Comp owned plus licensed sales declined 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year. EPS on a diluted basis excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges for the quarter was $2.09 as compared to our most recent guidance of $1.85 to $1.90. And for the full year, EPS on that same basis was $3.77, down 14% from last year.","During the fourth quarter, we've launched through our advisors the marketing of potential partnership and joint venture transactions for our real estate, both our mall-based stores and our four flagship stores. The demand has been very strong, which is encouraging, but it is premature to comment further at this point.","I will now talk about our performance in the quarter and highlight some of the bright spots in an otherwise weak quarter and year. I will then talk about our outlook for the next few years as well as provide guidance on our key planning assumptions for 2016.","So let's start with the fourth quarter. Sales in the quarter were $8.9 billion, down 5.3% from last year. And as I said a minute ago, on a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 4.3%. Similar to the third quarter, we had approximately a 4% decline in the number of transactions, a 1% decrease in the average unit retail, and units per transaction were up about 1%.","We've talked about overall weakness in our sales and particular weakness in the cold weather businesses, but we did have some categories that performed quite well in the quarter: cosmetics, fragrances, furniture and mattresses, as well as active. Geographically, our business was strongest in the West where weather was less of a factor. This was true both in-store and online.","Overall, our Digital business continued on a very strong pace. Digit continues to grow rapidly for purchasing, but it is also becoming even more important for browsing and researching. Best of all for us as an omni-channel retailer, customers are increasingly going back and forth between digital devices and stores. We continued to make progress this year on improving our mobile technology as well as optimizing fulfillment capabilities in the stores, including utilizing our BOPS, or Buying Online Pickup in Store, as a great way to satisfy demand.","Unfortunately, the decline in international tourist sales did not lessen during the fourth quarter and hurt our comp performance by approximately one point. This was less of an impact than experienced in the third quarter, but that is because international tourism is less important for us in the holiday period.","Bloomingdale's had a more challenging quarter than Macy's largely due to the geographic mix of locations with even heavier concentrations of tourist stores. And for Bloomingdale's, too, the digital growth was strong.","Gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 37.4%, down 290 basis points from last year. At the start of the quarter, you will remember that we expected a lower than last year gross margin rate. However, our actual rate was worse than expected as a result of the weak holiday sales and our desire to start 2016 with the right inventory level. We were pleased that we ended the year with our inventory up 1.6%, or on a comp basis, up 0.7%. We took the needed markdowns to make sure that we both cleared seasonal goods and priced what was left properly for February\/ March selling. For the year as a whole, the gross margin rate dropped 90 basis points versus the prior year.","SG&A in the quarter was $2.2 billion, down 5% from last year, and as a percent of sales, SG&A was flat to last year. Included in the SG&A were asset sale gains of approximately $114 million. This compares to $36 million last year. Included in this number is $84 million associated with the Brooklyn transaction, $18 million for the sale of one of our Mission Valley stores in San Diego, and approximately $12 million in other miscellaneous asset sale gains.","Credit income was $280 million in the quarter, up approximately $40 million over last year. As we transitioned to our new credit system platform in the fall of 2015, we benefited from stronger-than-expected portfolio yields. Going forward, we are closely monitoring a rise in delinquency levels that could generate some increase in losses in 2016, as I'll discuss later.","SG&A in the quarter also benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals and our flexing of expense with the lower sales. So the impact of the real estate transactions, stronger-than-expected credit results, and other expense reductions enabled us to more than offset the increases in other expense areas and our investments in growth.","Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $270 million or $4 million higher than a year ago. Operating income, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges, was $1.1 billion, down 23% from last year. And as a percent of sales, operating EBIT on this basis was 12.6%, down from 15.5% last year.","In the quarter, we booked $177 million of charges associated with store closings and restructuring. $37 million of this was for additional non-cash asset impairments. Interest expense in the quarter was $93 million. Booked tax expense was $300 million or 35.6% of pre-tax income. On an annual basis, our effective tax rate was 36.2%, flat with last year. This is a little better than expected, primarily due to state tax settlements.","The net loss attributable to the non-controlling interest, which was related to our China joint venture, was $1 million. Let me remind you how the accounting for China works. As you know, we own 65% of the venture, but we consolidate their financials and include 100% of the sales, margin, expense, et cetera in our statements. So on the P&L, we then break out the portion of the net income, or, in this case, loss, which Macy's does not own on this line.","Net income attributable to Macy's in the quarter was $544 million or $659 million excluding store closing and restructuring costs. This compares to last year's $793 million or $857 million excluding similar charges and last year's make-whole premium for the early retirement of debt.","Diluted share count was 314.8 million shares in the quarter, which is 10% lower than a year ago due to the $2 billion of stock repurchase during fiscal 2015. Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $1.73, or $2.09 excluding store closings and restructuring charges, and this compares to $2.44 last year on the same basis.","Cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, in 2015 was still $892 million, even in a disappointing year. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was just short of $2 billion, $725 million below last year. This was due primarily to lower net income. And net cash used from investing activities was $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than last year, but it would've been $90 million lower excluding the Bluemercury acquisition.","As a result of the EBITDA decline, our leverage ratio increased from 2.6 times last year to 3.0 times this year, assuming the same 9.3 times factor for rent capitalization and excluding the debt issued in the fourth quarter, which was raised to pay off 2016 maturities. This is higher than our target range of 2.5 to 2.8 times. As our EBITDA returns to levels achieved in recent years, we expect to get this ratio back into the target range.","So let's move on to the future. As Terry keeps telling our team, a setback is a setup for a comeback, and we are all focused on learning from 2015 to improve our results in 2016 and beyond.","Our long-term goals for financial performance remain unchanged. We are still focused on achieving an annual comp sales increase of at least 2%, with an EBITDA rate of 14% and an ROIC of 22%, both of which we achieved in 2014.","This will not happen all in one year, but we do hope that we are turning the corner as we start the new year. And while 2015 was disappointing, we did pilot some initiatives that are expected to help us in 2016 and beyond. I'll mention just five of them.","One, jewelry; as you know, we tested a new approach to our fine jewelry and watch business in 2015. It involves strengthening selling skills, including changes needed to talent training and compensation; also included improved associate availability, more direct supervision and a higher-quality product offering.","Fine jewelry serves as a backbone to our wedding initiative. And based on the success of the pilot, we are rolling this approach out across the country. 300 of our stores will be live this fall and the balance of our stores a year later.","Number two, Last Act and Backstage; as an outgrowth of our research behind the pilot of our off-price concept, as you know called Backstage, we decided to test a simplified pricing approach for clearance in our apparel areas in the Macy's stores. We took deeper price reductions on our second and third markdowns, but then excluded these goods from coupons and additional discounts. We also moved these goods to separate spaces on our apparel floors, generally one in the men's and one in the women's areas.","Customer reaction was very positive; sales were higher, sell-through faster and gross margin higher, with very few complaints from customers about not being able to use coupons. Based on this successful test, we have already rolled this out to all of our Macy's stores. We also opened our six pilot Backstage stores this past fall. We continue to learn from these stores and plan to continue our testing in 2016.","In addition to these freestanding stores plus one more that we will be opening in 2016, we will be testing putting Backstage stores within approximately 15 Macy's locations. We believe this could be an exciting way to drive traffic to our Macy's doors and to offer price points and categories, for example home d\u00e9cor, baby gear, toys, et cetera, that we don't currently carry at Macy's.","The third initiative is our Top Door strategy. We began executing this fall a strategy to accelerate and drive further growth in our top 150 locations. We are working to improve all aspects of these stores, from product to presentation, to customer service, to special events. We want to give customers more reasons to come to these stores that are located in the best malls and freestanding locations in the country.","Four is Bluemercury. Bluemercury has been part of the Macy's family for just under a year. We've opened 15 new stores in 2015 after the deal closed, including eight in markets where we either had no or limited market share before. This brought the total number of locations to 77. We also opened our first four stores within been Macy's. These shops bring to our Macy's customers new brands as well as new services. We are very excited about these.","We are also including the Bluemercury team, along with Macy's and Bloomingdale's, to strategize how to maximize the company's digital offering in beauty. As you know, we are very focused on this category as one of the company's significant growth opportunities, and we are happy having Bluemercury as part of our strategy.","And fifth is mobile. Mobile is a major priority for the company. Sales on mobile devices more than doubled in 2015, fueled by large increases in both traffic and also conversion. It is the fastest growing digital channel. We think mobile first and are very focused on making both customer facing enhancements and also improvements in functionality that will ultimately further improve the customer experience.","We believe all five of these initiatives that I just talked about will help performance in 2016 but are likely to have a bigger impact in 2017 and beyond. We are very focused on improving our execution in 2016, and at the same time we are evolving our M.O.M. strategy to meet the needs of our changing customer and competitive environment. I will talk about what we call M.O.M. 2.0 in a few minutes, but let me first summarize our key planning assumptions for 2016.","We are assuming that are comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis will decline approximately 1% in 2016, and with the impact of the store closures, this would lead to a total sales decline of approximately 2%. It isn't, though, until the fourth quarter that we expect our comp owned plus licensed sales to turn positive. We believe this to be the prudent assumption, given the environment and our performance heading into the year. We view this year to be one of resetting and rebuilding.","We are still expecting a modest increase in our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales in 2016, as we stated in our press release on January 6. This is assumed to be driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, although we don't expect the gross margin rate will get all the way back to the level achieved in 2014 all in one year. Expense dollars are expected to be flattish to the 2015 level, and as a result of the sales decline the rate as a percent of sales is assumed to increase. We have implemented the previously announced restructuring, and we've taken the other actions that will reduce expense by approximately the $400 million in 2016.","These actions that have been taken will enable us to offset increases in wages as well as the investments we are making to enhance our growth in the areas mentioned, such as digital, Top Doors, Bluemercury, Backstage and China. Included in the SG&A guidance, our asset sale gains of approximately $235 million, including estimated $86 million of the gain for Brooklyn. The remainder of the Brooklyn gain is expected to be booked in 2017.","The gain for Brooklyn will be booked quarterly based on the amount of construction we complete each quarter. We anticipate that about a quarter of that expected gain of the $86 million will be booked in the first half of the year with the other remainder in the back half of the year. But please note that it could change by quarter and even by year based on the construction schedule.","We are also assuming approximately $150 million for gains from other asset sales. We are not including in our guidance though, any impacts from the potential transactions related to Herald Square, Union Square, Downtown Minneapolis, Downtown Chicago, or if we do a more comprehensive joint venture structure, for the mall stores.","Credit profitability is expected to decline slightly in 2016 from 2015 as sales decline and the profitability of our portfolio stabilizes at a historic high rate or possibly declines slightly with higher interest rates and potentially higher delinquency trends.","Retirement related expense is assumed to decline by approximately $25 million in 2016 due primarily to a change using the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs. Depreciation and amortization is assumed at approximately $1.07 billion based on our capital budget of $900 million for 2016.","Interest expense is assumed at approximately $365 million, and our assumptions for the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest is approximately $10 million in 2016. But know that this is hard to estimate. Our assumed effective tax rate is 37%. So with all of these assumptions, our diluted EPS guidance is $3.80 to $3.90 as compared to the $3.77 for 2015.","As you model earnings per share by quarter, the first and third quarters are assumed to be with these assumptions below 2015 levels. As I said earlier, comp sales are expected to be below a year ago in the first nine months of the year. Also, gross margin rate is assumed to decline in the first and third quarters, in the first because of the lingering impact of the tough fourth quarter, and in the third quarter because of the strong 2015 performance.","Also asset sale gains are expected to be lower than 2015 in these quarters, although that easily could change based on the timing of transactions. We assume that the earnings growth in the second and fourth quarters will more than offset the declines in the first and third quarters, so that as you could tell from our guidance for the full year, earnings per share would exceed 2015.","One more item to mention. In 2016, we are expecting that settlement accounting relating to our retirement plans will begin to apply. This is not included in our guidance and will be broken out as a separate line item on our P&L. This occurs in a year when lump-sum payments associated with our retirement plans exceed a materiality threshold equal to the sum of the planned service costs and interest costs. If this threshold is exceeded, there is a non-cash charge that recognizes a portion of the plans deferred unrecognized losses. Recognition begins in the quarter in which the threshold is crossed and then continues for the remainder of the year. Freezing our plans has lowered this threshold materially.","We are assuming that we will exceed the threshold this year due to store closings, our voluntary separation program, restructurings, and small balance force outs, in addition to our regular distribution activity. Our current estimate is that we will have a charge in fiscal 2016 of approximately $135 million for the year, with approximately $15 million booked in the first half of the year and the remaining in the back half of the year.","As I said earlier, these non-cash charges are not included in guidance, but I didn't want you to be surprised when you see this new line item on our P&L as we go through 2016. We also hope that by year end, we will have executed some real estate transactions. But as I said earlier, it is impossible to predict what will be done, when it will be done, or what the financial benefit will be. And as I mentioned earlier, these transactions are not included in our guidance.","So while we are all disappointed about 2015, the team here is energized about improving the company's sales and earnings trends in 2016 as a foundation for growth in the years ahead. We are a very competitive team and no one is thrilled about how 2015 turned out, even if some of the factors of downward pressure were out of our control. And as I quoted Terry earlier, we're all believing that a setback is a setup for a comeback.","Recently, about 600 senior executives, including all of the Macy's district and regional store leaders as well as the heads of technology, digital, merchandising, planning, marketing and support organizations met to hear how we have refined our business strategy going into 2016. The presentation centered on M.O.M., which continues to be our guide. We are evolving the meaning of M.O.M. to coincide with where the customer is heading.","My Macy's is migrating from a focus on localization to one of personalization. Omnichannel today means providing omni choices for our customers in stores and digital, especially mobile. And MAGIC Selling is shifting focus to new techniques for building magic connections with shoppers. Under these redefined M.O.M. strategies, we have defined very specific initiatives for the future, each driven by a team of high-performing and creative executives.","They are grouped into five buckets. One, acquire new customers and deepen loyalty. Two, win with distinctive product. Three, push the digital frontier. Four, expand through new formats. And five, create signature experiences.","The response to this refreshed direction among our senior team is very enthusiastic. They can see that we are driving our company to where the puck is headed, not to where it is or used to be. We are thinking ahead and are confident we can return to the profitable growth trajectory you saw in the six years prior to 2015 and to the 14% EBITDA rate we posted in 2014.","Our primary focus today is on growing what we might call our core omnichannel business, and meanwhile, we are taking the early steps, testing and learning, toward longer-term growth vehicles including off-price and international. We think you will continue to find that Macy's, Inc. is a company to watch and that we are evolving as we position ourselves to be the customer's first choice for fashion, value and convenience in the years and decades ahead.","Thanks for your interest, and now I'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Good morning, Karen, and thanks for all the detail this morning. I'm wondering if you look back on the fourth quarter, what factors in the company's view contributed to the sub-standard performance relative to your peer group? And what, if any, changes are you making to your merchandising strategy as you look to spring of 2016? And then, I've got one follow up.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think part of the fourth quarter relates to our locations being more heavily skewed towards cold weather areas where there wasn't cold weather, and also our heavy reliance on tourist markets. So I think some of it is a mix issue, as opposed to our performance. But having said that, as you know, we are taking responsibility for some of the performance and clearly changing things as we go forward.","I would say from a merchandising approach as we look forward, I think we've talked about some of what we're doing, vis-\u00e0-vis product. I just mentioned the idea around winning with distinctive product, and I think that's a big piece. So if you think about some of the focus areas, weddings, health and wellness, active, again, beauty, we've talked about some of those things already.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. And a question on Backstage, did I hear correctly that you're only opening one store, one freestanding store this year? And if that's correct, were you disappointed at all with the performance of the six pilot stores?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It is correct that it's one store and I wouldn't say disappointed. We are trying to learn from these before we expand them more broadly. And again, part of the pilot is also testing in store to see where we think growth may make the most sense. So I would say 2016 is just a continuation of the learning.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Karen. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So on gross margins, prior to this year, the model was pretty consistent in the 40% range. I guess what provides you the confidence in some of the recapture that you're guiding to this year versus gross margins potentially just moving structurally lower for the space?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Again, I don't expect to get back to the 2014 level all in 2016, but we do think last year, 2015, was an anomaly given the weakness in sales, and particularly in the fourth quarter with the seasonal categories. I mean, obviously, it was an unusual weather year, or at least we think it's unusual, and it just caused a tremendous amount of markdowns given the sales decline.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow up, you mentioned monitoring this recent rise in credit delinquencies? I guess just any additional color on what you think some of the underlying drivers are? And have you seen any or heard about any tightening of potential approvals or any tightening in lending to potentially expect?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, one of the positives for Macy's is that with our conversion to a new system, we actually have greater capabilities of granting credit. So I think in our case the opposite will happen this year, and I think that was part of the fourth quarter results, that we're able to better monitor customer behavior, and, therefore, were able to approve more new credit than we had anticipated.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good Morning.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I wanted to follow up on the SG&A investments that you're making, maybe just some help with what the largest buckets are. Obviously you've done a very large restructuring and cost cutting, you have incremental real estate gains flowing through there, so it's a lot of investment for a year where sales aren't higher. So I was just wondering if you could just help us out with the magnitude of what those might be.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Yeah, I mean, the largest increases would be, in terms of the growth initiatives, would be in digital. As you heard me say, that business continues to grow very rapidly. And we not only need to invest in supporting that sales growth, but also looking forward, particularly, as I said earlier, on mobile. So I think there's a lot of investment being made in digital growth, which, by the way, is not all digital sales. Part of that is omnichannel investments, so the customers can easily go back and forth between stores and the Internet.","So that's the biggest chunk, but also Bluemercury, Backstage, China, which were very small numbers in 2015. Again, we're investing to grow those for the long term, which I think you'd expect us to do. So, those would be where the biggest investments are.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Renato Basanta with Sterne Agee.","Renato Basanta - CRT Sterne Agee","Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Renato Basanta - CRT Sterne Agee","Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to talk a little bit longer term here. So clearly some of the cost savings are a big driver of EBITDA expansion in 2016, but can you just help us think about the longer term 14% EBITDA target? Maybe if you can discuss the timeline to getting there that's sort of embedded in your plans. And maybe talk at a high level about comp levels, gross margin and SG&A progression over time that sort of gets you back to that 14% rate?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I'm not sure I can give you a specific year-by-year. As we said, this year is sort of the year for resetting, and we're hoping that obviously our comp sales return to positive territory, at least by 2017. And so as that happens, that helps the SG&A leverage. And depending on the sales growth, obviously, will have an impact on how quickly we get to the 14%.","Renato Basanta - CRT Sterne Agee","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Karen. How are you?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Paul. Good.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I'm just curious, on the Backstage opening, I'm just curious, what does it cost you open a standalone store? And what's the capital layout when you do one within a Macy's store? Also curious the amount of the comp base at base at any point to do that?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","So let me start with \u2013 is your question why are we opening one more?","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","No. I'm just curious the costs to open your Backstage stores on a standalone basis versus what it costs....","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","When you open it in-store the capital is less, but there's also more cannibalization of the existing store. So the equation is different than when you open a freestanding. Interestingly with the freestanding stores, we have found no impacts on nearby Macy's, but obviously if you take 25,000 to 30,000 square feet out of a Macy's store there will be some impact on the store as you shrink the remaining store. So it is a different calculus.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. And do those stores come out of the comp base when you do one within a Macy's store?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, because it's \u2013 no.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","No major disruption. And then just curious on the store closings that were done at the end of 2015, what's your assumption for percent of sales you expect to transfer to another store or move online? Or do actually think closing those stores hurt your online business, which I think you've alluded to in the past?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, it varies by market depending on the density of other stores around it. So I can't give you a specific number, but we do expect to retain some sales, but probably less than what people might expect. Dot com typically we do worse when we close a store because as I've said repeatedly, this omnichannel behavior is very important for our customers, and if they don't have the store to browse in or return to, they often don't shop as much on macys.com. So that's an offset in terms of the retention we get from closing the stores.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, Karen. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I apologize if I missed a few of the details earlier on real estate, so my first question will be to have you repeat it? Apologies for that, but just the details around the $235 million guidance for 2016, I believe you mentioned about $86 million or so of it is Brooklyn. And then could you talk about what the additional $150 million of asset sales, none of that is the bigger stores, is that correct?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Correct. Sounds like you heard it fine.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. I want to just clarify that. And in terms of your Top Door strategy, could you just speak to, at least at this point in time, how should we think about the comp performance of these stores that you are targeting now versus the rest of the store base? And how do you expect that to progress as you make some of these investments?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well as you might expect, these stores are important to our sales and profit. And so again, we're hoping that they outpace the rest of the company.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then just lastly, in terms of the tourism impact, you mentioned getting hurt by 1 point in the fourth quarter. How do you expect that to progress over the course of 2016?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We'll have to see. I don't know at this point, obviously what that's going to be. If it continues, we've been tracking it on a two-year basis so that we understand that better, and we'll just have to see what transpires on that front as we get into the year. It could continue to impact us by 1 point. I don't expect it to be more, but it is possible that that could continue to be a headwind we continue to face.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Karen, good morning. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good Morning.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Regarding next year, how are you thinking about inventories in terms of how you are planning them, relative to last year and what you're thinking there? And then also, as you have refocused these strategies to the next level of thinking about the customer and the environment, what are your thoughts on your speed and your supply chain and your relationships with vendors, and how you think about discounts and allowances, and just matching supply and demand as everybody gets faster and the customer gets faster, too, in terms of what they expect relative to when goods are shipped?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think the key thing is, obviously we also are trying to get faster and working closely not only with our private brands, but also with the market to make us respond quicker, be more agile, and make decisions faster. So obviously our private brand group is leading the way on this, obviously because we are they. So it's easier to move faster. But I think our vendors are responding as well.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Okay. Thank you. And are inventories also planned down throughout the year? Or is there a cadence in terms of potentially how you're thinking about it?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We are always trying to get parity between the inventory and the comp sales level, and obviously at the end of the year being up 0.7% is a little higher than what we're planning in the first quarter, so we'll have to see as the year goes on.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Okay. And we had a question on your comments about less couponing and the markdown strategy, why do you think that worked, strategically? Like, what worked in terms of the customer really responding to this, just trying to understand how you tested it (42:52)?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think what happens is, customers want simplicity. And when you are looking for deep clearance goods you could just see the price of the item and not have to do the math in your head, and it's easier. We've also segregated those goods and put them in a separate part of the floor, which I think that customer is responding quite well to also. And at the same time, the parent departments look even better and our hope is that regular price selling will improve because there's just less clutter on the floor by moving this clearance merchandise into a separate area.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Thank you. And just our last question, we do think you have a competitive advantage with bricks plus clicks. But what would you highlight as you compete against Amazon and other pure plays as your key competitive advantages in the apparel market?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think a lot of it is, as I said is the store base and having the ability for customers to interact with us in different ways. The second, I think is our talent in the whole fashion arena, from picking, editing the assortments, presenting it, and the vendor relationships. I think that is a huge competitive advantage to date, vis-\u00e0-vis, Amazon. But I think it starts with the store base, and our understanding of the fashion customer, which is different.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Comapny","Thanks, Karen. Best regards, and thanks for all the strategy in detail.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You bet. Thanks, Oliver.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Gregory W. Baglione - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. This is Greg Baglione on for Kimberly.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You don't sound like Kimberly.","Gregory W. Baglione - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a question, Karen, you mentioned the leverage is about 15% higher than it was last year. Looks like cash balance is at a low, since like 2008. That, in addition to some of the real estate initiatives you have going on, just wondering how that may dictate the future share repurchase activity. And then I have a quick follow-up.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, obviously it all goes into the mix. We do, as you know, want to remain an investment grade company, and getting our leverage ratio back into the target area is important to us, again, primarily through EBITDA growth. But all of that will factor into the buyback this year.","Gregory W. Baglione - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then you mentioned e-commerce was strong in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about the margin profile of that business in the fourth quarter. And as you think about longer-term, getting back to that long-term EBITDA margin goal, do you expect sort of a recovery in that margin profile of that business, or...?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, there's a misperception that digital growth comes at a lower margin. That's not really the case. And again, there's lots of different transactions, whether it's shipped from store, shipped from warehouses, et cetera. But that is not a negative drag on our margins as we go forward. We love digital growth.","Operator","We will take our next question from Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Could you talk a little bit about the comp guide, and I guess what categories you expect improvement in? And also the composition, in terms of transactions versus AUR in 2016.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I don't know how to answer that question, particularly the second part of the question. In terms of the comp, just because it's \u2013 my guess is there's going to continue to be pressure on traffic. But how that all works, I just don't know how to predict.","In terms of categories for growth, we do expect to keep focusing on some of the categories we've talked about before: beauty, active, big-ticket furniture and mattresses, health and wellness in total, the wedding-related businesses, dresses; I mean a lot of the businesses we have been focused on so far. I'm sure I'm missing something there, so I apologize if I missed something. And our hope is that the traffic improves as we get through the year.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then given the growth of online, how are you thinking about the right size of the store footprint longer-term, especially after closing these 40 stores recently?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think the key thing is we really do believe that omnichannel is the right answer. And so, by testing things, for example, the Backstage in-store as a way of driving traffic, some of the things that we're testing in the Top Doors in terms of incremental special appearances and makeovers, and all kinds of services that we can provide in the store \u2013 we are, again, hoping to build on that and make our store base even stronger.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just finally, we've heard this season a number of vendors beginning to talk about working to be less promotional and doing more full-priced selling, going forward. Has that changed the vendor discussion or relationship at all for you in particular?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No. We're having the same conversation.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Sticking with online, how much of the double-digit growth in the channel has been driven by broadening the assortment versus turnover of existing SKUs? And as a follow-up to an earlier question, how have you been approaching the profitability of online, on an item basis, as you have expanded the assortment?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","The assortment \u2013 sorry, has been only expanded to more closely parallel what's in the stores, so most of the growth is coming from comp categories as opposed to expansion.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, that's helpful. And then on mobile, you mentioned that this will be a big investment. I think you said earlier it would be for customer-facing enhancements and improved functionality. What are some of these changes that we should be expecting? Or asked another way, what are some of the key feedback you receive from customers that are directing you in those changes?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think a lot of it has to do with the ease of shopping when you are on a mobile device, whether it be the mobile-enabled Web, or on our app. So things like a natural language search, we are looking to add different filters and facets, as you navigate, is a big one. Also trying to, what we call, optimize the purchase funnel, things like adding bag to check out and all kinds of things that just cleans it up and makes it easier to use.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is it fair to say that it's all about conversion?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","A lot of it is conversion. Actually, most of what I just said is, but there's some other things also to help traffic.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue. Best of luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, Karen. Thanks again for all the detail on the call today.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Okay.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","I'm trying to marry together two comments you made earlier. You mentioned that you were happy with the early results you're seeing, as you separate the clearance apparel to its own section and tweak the pricing strategy. Then you said your hope would be that you would see better full-priced selling in the remaining apparel section. Can you just talk about whether that's a trend that you are seeing early on or did you mean that that's a dynamic that's lagging so far? And if so (50:19)?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, it was actually \u2013 well, we had a lot of debate and when we started testing it. I thought that regular priced selling would be much stronger, because it would be easier to see. Others thought regular-priced selling would get hurt, because the clearance customer would go to this clearance area and maybe not buy the regular priced while she was shopping for clearance.","So far, it goes both ways. And there are customers like me, and there's other customers, and it's really offsetting. And there's really been no impact. So, overall, the results have been very positive, but I'm still hopeful. But again, that's just my bias that I think that regular price may help as we go forward. But there's been no negative, either.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Interesting. Yes, some of the vendors, as Joan said, I think were talking about that a little bit. That will be interesting to see that roll forward.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It'll be very interesting, and that's why you test and you learn. And you try to just keep getting better at it.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","There was one mention in the press release that sounded maybe like some of the $400 million in cost saves started in the fourth quarter. Would you mind just talking to that $400 million of cost saves, and what the pace of that looks like through the year in 2016?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, no. The $400 million didn't, but the cost saves that we did last year were still rolling through in the fourth quarter. So, I would say the $400 million is probably three-and-a-half quarters where we will get that savings. For the first half of the first quarter, a lot of those savings haven't completely happened yet. But it will roll in, in full force sort of mid-quarter.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then if I could just ask one last one. A couple things you didn't mention is \u2013 would there be any potential benefit in the first half as you guys anniversary the West Coast port from a year ago? And then there was a bit of a blip with the buying reorg last year that caused some disruption; any chance that we see a benefit lapping that? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we have factored in some improvement in the first half as a result of the receipt disruption last year with the port strike. So we'll see if, in fact, that happens. But we have thought about that. And in terms of the impact of the restructure, that was something that we believe we felt through the whole year. So it wasn't just a first-half disruption.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So that's minimum. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks so much for taking my question. A couple quick ones for you, Karen, number one, any comments on the energy markets; a couple of your competitors have called them out. Secondly, you restated inventories in the fourth quarter. Can you give us the background on that? And finally, a strategic question: what's more important to the corporation, coming back to a 14% EBITDA margin or market share growth?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, in terms of the energy markets, they were not as weak as the West Coast, but obviously weather was less of a factor there. So weather was a standout for us, but we didn't do great in the energy markets either.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not sure what you mean on the restated inventory?","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The inventories on the balance sheet that you just published are slightly different than the one...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Oh, last year?","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes, exactly.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It was just a slight switch in our inventories between payables and inventory. So it's not a major factor.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","And this year and last year are now restated to be the same.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And then...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Your last one is a hard question. This is one where we always try to get balance. We do think market share, and particularly comp growth, is important. But we also think doing so in a sustained, profitable way, with high returns, is also important. So that's where balance comes in. I will say, though, without comp growth, it would be very challenging to get to the 14% because of the fixed costs in the business. So I think they have to go hand-in-hand.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Good luck, and thank you so much.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You bet. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Following up on Michael's question, actually, on the comp, the importance of comp growth, can you rank order what you see as the key factors to your comp guidance for this year getting back closer to that flattish level from the \u2013 I guess it came out to minus 3%, minus 4% in 2015. And it's okay to put weather; weather is \u2013 a seasonable winter is one of the key factors. But just how you think about the importance of the different things needed to get back to the level.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, again, you're going from the minus 2.5% to the approximate minus 1%. I mean, I think that's the appropriate comparison. There are lots of scenarios that get us to the guidance that we're talking about that rank things differently: tourist recovering, tourist not; weather great, weather not great; our strategies all hitting on all cylinders, some of them not. So I can't give you just sort of one arithmetic that got us to the guidance. As you might imagine, we look at all kinds of scenarios to get us there.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got you. And then if I could ask, you made a comment at the very beginning of your prepared remarks about the importance \u2013 the right growing importance of browsing and researching online and mobile. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you're incorporating some of the learnings there into the strategy, kind of the omnichannel strategy, and what are the key factors?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, well, I think the idea is \u2013 and we talked about mobile. As that becomes more important, how do we help customers get the information they need on their devices, whether it be product reviews, or even, in some cases, how to find their way through some of our bigger doors? So the better I think we make these mobile devices, the more we're going to get the interaction between stores and online to help our business going forward.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Do you find that the consumer who has spent a lot of time online researching and browsing behaves differently, once they are in the store? Do they...?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Some do, some don't. It depends. There's a lot of talk about people shopping and being more purposeful when they come in the store. Others are still doing sort of the old-fashioned shopping that we used to do, and often then going home and buying online. So there really isn't one answer. But we do find that, in our categories, having the store is a huge advantage, whether it be to check a color, check a size, spend an afternoon with your friends and shop. Or going for a service experience: a makeover, for example, or a special appearance.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Go you. Thank you, Karen. That's really helpful.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Dana.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi. Could you talk a little bit at the Plenti loyalty program, how that performed, what you saw there? And lastly, any update on private label and the initiatives for 2016? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Plenti is still early to really judge. As you know, we've got now over 11 million customers enrolled, which we think is very good. And we're beginning now to see people using their points, and coming into Macy's having earned their points in other retailers. But I think it's too early to really know how that's doing overall.","In terms of private brand, obviously this is a major strategy for us, and it has been historically a huge strength of the company. And we are obviously investing to, in certain categories, move faster and make decisions quicker, and take some of the complexity out of the processes between our merchants and our product designers; and for some of the fast-moving fashion areas, to do all we can to keep taking time out of the system.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. And the Millennials floor in 34th Street looks a very good. What are you seeing for Millennials? And will that be replicated in any of the other stores? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It's hard to replicate Herald Square in other stores. You're right; it looks fabulous and doing very well. But we are taking ideas from there and putting them in other markets. And part of it also is trying to mix experiences in with merchandise. So I think we learn from Herald Square, although you really can't replicate it, per se.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, David.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","A question \u2013 one of your strategic planks is to win with distinctive product. And I'm just wondering how that lines up with a trend that we're seeing in terms of a lot of the brands \u2013 some of which that are key for Macy's, and are moving and embracing doing business with Amazon. And obviously without being brand-specific, how do you combat that? Are you looking to have a more styles, more brands exclusive to Macy's? And how do you combat that along with \u2013 a lot of these brands are capitalizing on consumers' desire to use Amazon Prime?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think what you've heard us talk about for a long time is trying to have more exclusive products within our stores, whether it be brands completely or private brands, or exclusive products from some of the key vendors. And that continues to be the case. We also hope that our organization continues to be the best at curating these brands, and continue to give the best assortments that we can.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And I had one follow up. What's the share count embedded in your EPS guidance assumption for 2016?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We don't give share count.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So \u2013 and then the buyback level?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You'll have to sort through that.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good luck, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Callen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Given some of the downward movement in credit ratings in retail, and just the negative watch and outlook for Macy's, can you speak to some of the balance sheet limitations as you evaluate the partnerships or JVs with real estate? And then second, can we assume that your guided leverage range wouldn't be changing, and the intention is not have your rating fall to Baa3\/BBB- (61:38)?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes we have stated, last fall and again now, being investment-grade is important to the company. And as I mentioned, our leverage ratios have fallen above \u2013 maybe the word risen above \u2013 our target range, and that we are expecting, with EBITDA increases, to get back into our target leverage ratio range.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess back on the, I guess any limitations you're feeling as you evaluate these partnerships or JVs?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, if you are willing to take on a lot more leverage, obviously that would change the dynamic. But there is some limitation because of our belief that being a retailer is it is important to be investment grade.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions in queue at this time. I'll now turn our conference back over to our moderator for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen M.

Good morning. And welcome to Macy\u2019s Incorporated First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning. And welcome to the Macy\u2019s conference call scheduled to discuss our first quarter performance. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited.","A replay of the call will be available on our website www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company\u2019s most recently filed Form 10-K.","While sales in the first quarter were below what we had expected, we were pleased both with our earnings in the quarter and also with the momentum change towards the end of April when the weather finally warmed up in the northern part of the county. In fact, our year-to-date sales are already back well into positive territory.","While we aren\u2019t sure that all of the weakness in the quarter was weather-related, we continue to believe that the underlying customer demand is strong enough to enable us to achieve our annual guidance for comp sales of 2.5% to 3% and our earnings per share guidance of $4.40 to $4.50.","We are also pleased to announce that given the confidence in the company\u2019s prospects, our Board approved a 25% increase in our dividend to a $1.25 per share on an annual basis, as well as $1.5 billion increase in authorization to buyback our stock. We now have total authorization remaining of approximately $2.5 billion.","Sales in the first quarter were $6.3 billion, down 1.7% from last year. Comp sales were down 1.6% and on an owned plus license basis comp sales were down 0.8% versus last year. Looking at owned plus license comp is the right way to be measuring customer spending with the company.","We had expected sales growth in the first quarter to be well below that in the second quarter due to the shift in the timing in our Friends & Family event, with the last two days happening in May this year. We also knew that we were up against a strong first quarter last year, a plus 4.4% on an owned plus license basis making this year\u2019s comparison tough.","Having said that, we were expecting sales to be stronger than they were at both Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy\u2019s, and as I just stated, the weather clearly played a major role in the weakness.","As you would expect, geographically, the south did far better in the quarter in terms of sales performance than the north, a strongest families of business in the quarter were handbags, impulse apparel for a Millennial customers, active, kids and in Men apparel.","We also continue to see positive momentum in juniors or our younger Millennial customer, which is very encouraging. The license businesses performed very well in the quarter.","Some weather driven businesses such as shoes and apparel were weak overall in the quarter, but perform much better in the south than in the north, giving us confidence for the second quarter, now that the weather is finally warmed up.","The area of our business that was toughest in the quarter was home, which experienced weakness across the Board, including big ticket. We believe this is in part due to year rounding very strong performances over the past couple of years and may also relate to fewer housing starts and lower existing home sales and some of the weakness such as in outdoor furniture was in fact weather driven and interestingly like apparel the trend has improved in early May.","Average unit retail in the quarter was flat with average units per transaction up approximately 1% leaving transactions down about 1.5%. Our gross margin rate in the quarter was up 10 basis points over last at 38.9%. Merchandize margin was up by approximately the same amount.","At the end of the quarter, inventory was up 4.7% over last year or 4.2% on a comp basis. Although, stock levels are a bit higher than we would have like, relating to the weak first quarter sales, the builds include many strategic investments in customer favorites and summer essentials, it should pay dividends in the second quarter.","SG&A was $2 billion, 2% below last year and 20 basis points lower as a percent of sales. We are very pleased that we were able to accomplish this even with the ongoing investment we are making in our omnichannel strategy.","Some of the reasons behind this variance include. One, retirement expense was favorable to last year by $39 million. Two, benefits from the cost reduction initiative implemented at year end. Three, credit was $5 million better than last year, while usage of the card slipped 60 basis points to 44.7%, which in part actually was due to the Friends & Family shift the profitability of the portfolio continues to be very strong. Four, the flexing of expense in sales variable areas and five, from timing shift particularly in marketing which will impacts subsequent quarters.","Operating income in the quarter was $443 million or 7.1% of sales, up from $435 million or 6.8% of sales last year. It is worth noting that we were able to increase the operating income rate as a percent of sales by 30 basis points in a declining sales environment.","Interest expense in the quarter was $100 million, $3 million above last year. This is mostly because of the incremental debt issued last year, the $400 million that we issued relative to the $109 million that matured.","Tax expense in the quarter was $119 million. The tax rate in the quarter was 34.7%. We still expect the effect of tax rate for the year to be 36.4%. The rate in any quarter as you know will be impacted by the timing of settlements and other discrete items.","Net income was $224 million, up $7 million versus last year. Diluted share count in the quarter was 372.6 shares down 5.6% from last year and earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.60, up 9% over last year.","Cash flow provided by operating activities in the quarter was $212 million lower than last year, due primarily to the different timing of receipts in the quarter, which impacted merchandize payables, the change in retirement expense, the payout at cost associated with the year end restructuring and timing.","Cash used by investing activity was $96 million, slightly better than last year\u2019s $107 million and during the quarter we utilize $432 million to repurchase approximately 7.4 million shares.","As we look forward, we continue to believe that we can achieve our annual guidance of 2.5% to 3% comp sales growth and $4.40 to $4.50 in earnings per share. The second quarter will hopefully benefit from pent-up demand from earlier in the year, as well as our improved strategies for driving business.","Remember that we had a disappointing second quarter last year and we concluded at that time that our marketing support was insufficient. We then reacted with renewed and strength in promotional strategies in the third quarter. The customer responded very well to these changes and we hope we will experience the similar reaction as these same strategies are executed in the second quarter this year.","As you know, one of our philosophies at Macy\u2019s is to focus on what we know and what we can control. We cannot control the weather or the macroeconomic environment or where a major holiday falls in retail calendar. There has been a lot of talk about these subjects in recent months.","But we can make sure that we have the widest assortments, a customer-centric approach to omnichannel, the best talent training and coaching that energizes our associates and very compelling marketing. We spent a lot of time at Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s, thinking about execution, solid blocking and tackling to serve the customer everyday, managing the business with discipline and sensitivity to the perspectives of our associates, of vendors and our communities. This is how we are winning and we\u2019ll continue to win.","As I say quarter after quarter, our M.O.M. strategies, My Macy\u2019s Omnichannel and MAGIC Selling are a roadmap going forward. We do not tire of it. In fact, we are exploring and finding new ways to make M.O.M. better every day.","At a regional management meeting last week, one of our executives noted that M, O and M are the first three letters of the word momentum. And he is absolutely right. As we look forward into the remainder of 2014, we see a lot about which to be optimistic. We can see the momentum it work in driving results. And we will remain focused on what we can control.","I\u2019ll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question today comes from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Hey Karen. It\u2019s Chuck. How are you?","Karen Hoguet","Hi Chuck. Good.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","In February, you outlined at least 10, 11 assumptions to kind of hold our hands throughout the year in 2014. Just wondering if you still believe in those 11 assumptions, if there\u2019s any changes there to what you think?","Karen Hoguet","I confess I don\u2019t have the 11 in front of me. But I don\u2019t think there is any change. Tax rate hasn\u2019t changed. Margin expectation hasn\u2019t changed. Sales hasn\u2019t changed, depreciation, so I don\u2019t think there is any changes but I\u2019ll go back later and look at the 11 to be sure.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. And then just regarding the first quarter, Friends & Family shift, just wondering if you wanted to quantify that in any thing on gross margins in the second quarter that we should think about given the inventory levels being a little bit heavier at the end of the first quarter?","Karen Hoguet","Yeah. In terms of Friends & Family shift, we haven\u2019t quantified it but it is material which is why we had talked about it on the call in February because we want the people to make sure we knew from the beginning that our first quarter was going to be tougher than the second quarter.","And in terms of margins, our guidance for the year has been flattish to down slightly. So I would still hold that guidance as I think about the full year. Obviously, we outperformed that annual guidance in the first quarter. But I would not change the guidance for the remainder of the year. It\u2019s obviously hard to forecast quarter-by-quarter.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. Fair enough. My last question is on the $100 million in cost saves. How should we think about that flowing through the P&L throughout the year, pretty evenly by quarter or is it expected to be front-end loaded?","Karen Hoguet","No, it should be pretty evenly. Most of the changes that happened by the end of the year and therefore fairly evenly through the year.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks again.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you. Good morning.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning and welcome back.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","Just wanted to follow up on the comments you made about the stronger momentum in your younger millennial or juniors categories. Is that an area that you could envision turning positive during this year and what other initiatives you have planned for that important older millennial as the year progresses?","Karen Hoguet","The whole millennial strategy is working really well. As you know, a lot of the new brands in the impulse of the older millennial again began traction last year. And it\u2019s taken us a little longer on the junior business. But that\u2019s now doing very well and we feel much better about the total. And you combine that with the active strategy which is on fire both for men and women. And we are very excited about the prospects.","And when you think about that millennial customer, we tend to focus on the apparel sides of it. But there is a lot going on in shoes, handbags, cosmetics and also home. One of the strengths in our furniture business has been smaller scale furniture which is really appealing to the millennial customer. And we\u2019ve now got strength in kid\u2019s furniture. So there is just a lot going on for that millennial customer throughout the entire store, not just the apparel areas.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan.","Matthew Boss - J.P. Morgan","Hey Karen. Good morning.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Matthew Boss - J.P. Morgan","So last year\u2019s second quarter, when we all kind of started to talk about this durable spending shift and weaker trends in apparel. Can you just -- can you back up and kind of talk about your confidence in the consumer today and have you seen anything in terms of leading indicators from a category perspective. It really just gives you the comfort as oppose as just kind of what you\u2019re seeing out there. It really gives you comfort in the back half of the year?","Karen Hoguet","Well, I think it starts with when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the year. We were not expecting the consumer to be all that strong. So that really hasn\u2019t changed with anything we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter. Obviously, could make it a little more challenging but we still think that the consumer is okay but not great. And as we look at the second quarter last year, we do believe that a lot of the weakness was self inflicted and those are the things we\u2019ve tried to correct this year.","Matthew Boss - J.P. Morgan","Great. And then as we look at the competitive backdrop, clearly people talk about online a lot more. Off price is a stronger force. What do you think separates the winners and losers here as we think out the next three to five years? What do you think Macy\u2019s is doing to really kind of separate from the pack here?","Karen Hoguet","Well, I think we are doing a couple of things. One is the omnichannel approach. It\u2019s obviously really critical. I don\u2019t know how a retailer could compete going forward without a really strong online presence and investing heavily to keep up with all that\u2019s happening technologically in that world.","However, I also think we wouldn\u2019t be strong without our terrific stores. And so we\u2019re continuing to invest to make sure our assortments are right through My Macy\u2019s. Our sales associates are more engaged in MAGIC Selling. So I believe it\u2019s having great source but also having a fabulous internet presence, a digital presence whether it\u2019d be a mobile devices, smartphone or traditional laptop, desktop application.","Matthew Boss - J.P. Morgan","Great. Best of luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","And Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Good morning Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning Paul.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","You mentioned that retirement expense savings would be helpful to you guys this year. But is that front-end loaded or will that continue to be a benefit throughout the balance of the year?","Karen Hoguet","Well, no, we have said it would be about $150 million for the year. So I wouldn\u2019t change the annual forecast. And some of that is offsetting increases in healthcare, which we anticipate happening more towards the end of the year. So we got more net benefit in the first quarter.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. And then also last quarter, you mentioned that Bloomingdale\u2019s was better performer than Macy\u2019s. I know both were a little bit below expectations this quarter. But can you just give a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing out of Bloomingdale\u2019s?","Karen Hoguet","Yeah. No, Bloomingdale\u2019s had a tough first quarter as did Macy\u2019s and again did better in their Southern stores and the Northern stores. So that would be the case again.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","And then lastly, just the home comment that you made kind of stuck out with that being challenging. I mean, is there anything different that you\u2019re seeing from a competitive landscape or in terms of how others are discounting that worries you or do you think it\u2019s solely kind of weather and macro?","Karen Hoguet","Honestly, it stood out for us too because as you know, home has been so strong for so long. So I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just an outlier and by the second quarter that would no longer be the case. Early May is making us feel a lot better. But there\u2019s really nothing we\u2019re seeing on the competitive front that would lead us to be concerned about home longer term.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll move to Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Thanks. Karen, can you maybe quantify for us the difference in comp performance between the South and the North in the first quarter? And how much is that gap closed or has it closed entirely in these first couple of weeks of May?","Karen Hoguet","We don\u2019t split it out but the gap -- the South has been growing faster than the North, separate from the weather. So that\u2019s -- the gap has closed quite a bit but there\u2019s still going to be a gap as there was all last year. But the gap has closed significantly since late April.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then on the gross margin front, I assume that the first quarter benefited from the shift in Friends & Family. But please correct me if that\u2019s wrong, if you looked at the first quarter margins excluding that shift, what would things have looked like?","Karen Hoguet","No, I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s a big factor in terms of the margin.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Okay.","Karen Hoguet","I think that the 10 basis point improvement was real.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Okay, helpful. And just last, inventories, what do you expect -- how do you expect to end at the end of the second quarter and is there any change in plan for the second half of the year?","Karen Hoguet","No change in plan and do expect the inventories to be less of an increase relative to last year by the time we end the spring season.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Okay. Great. Thanks and good luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","And Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities has our next question.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","Good morning.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Bernie.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","Your management changes were internal. So I imagine there won\u2019t be anything great to say about it. But I\u2019m wondering if there are things that you\u2019d like to highlight as a result of the change?","Karen Hoguet","Well I think, Jeff\u2019s elevation to President is a good thing for the company and will, as you probably saw, he\u2019s picking up responsibility for the private brand organization. And I think that will help with the congruency of our merchandise strategies and allow us to make our private brands that are already very strong even stronger. So I think that\u2019s going to be very positive.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","And as regards to marketing, you said that you need to have it very compelling. We\u2019ve seen what happened in the third quarter. But could you remind us of what very compelling means and particularly the use of coupons?","Karen Hoguet","Yeah, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see a major change in coupons. But in the second quarter last year, we did a more regular price event particularly around the American Icon. And so we again are making it a little bit more promotional this year and tweaking some of the other promotional strategies in the quarter.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","All right. Okay. Thank you very much.","Karen Hoguet","Thanks Bernie.","Operator","Bob Drbul with Nomura will go next.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Hi Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Hi Bob.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","The first question is on -- you talked about the economics versus weather, just when you think about you think there is more play versus just weather, what really are you focused on or like, what are you concerned about that you guys were seeing within the customer base?","Karen Hoguet","Honestly, we are still focused right now on executing and as I said on the things that we can\u2019t control.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Yeah.","Karen Hoguet","So that\u2019s -- we are keeping our heads down and executing our strategies as we had anticipated and trying to get as much as we can.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Okay. And any inventory increase, are there any areas on the inventory side that you guys are uncomfortable with levels right now?","Karen Hoguet","Well, there is no major areas, but as you would expect at any point in the year, there is always glut somewhere within the inventory but nothing that we are concerned about it at this point.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Okay. And then my last question is just given how the quarter played out, when you look at the e-comm business like in the first quarter, omnichannel e-commerce, how did the profitability change during the quarter like this, or is there a big delta between the way it was a year ago versus the first quarter?","Karen Hoguet","I\u2019m not sure I understand what about the first quarter that would have led the profitability to change.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Just with like the slowdown in sales, like did you see a big difference on the e-commerce trends first quarter \u201814 versus first quarter \u201813 and did that impact at all the profitability?","Karen Hoguet","Weather impacts our online sales as well as store sales, but it doesn\u2019t impact the profitability. If anything, we are trying to get more profitable with every kind of transaction we do, so that\u2019s happening to some degree but I don\u2019t know how that relates to the first quarter in specific.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Okay. Thanks very much, Karen.","Operator","And our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","Karen Hoguet","Sure.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Just a couple of follow-ups. I guess the first is just as we think about the consumer, can you just maybe provide a little bit more color on any trends you are seeing among household to different income levels?","Karen Hoguet","No, we don\u2019t -- I mean, I can\u2019t really comment on that. We don\u2019t have great data on income levels. But as I said, both Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy\u2019s had tough quarters, if that helps you to get some insights into that and our weakness was across price points and our opening price points were better. So, again, that leads back to the weather discussion that was opposed to the consumer. So, I think until we see the second quarter with the warm-up in weather, it\u2019s going to be hard to really judge the answer to your question.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","That makes sense. Thanks. And then one other follow-up or just related to Bob\u2019s question on e-commerce, can you provide a little more color on how e-commerce momentum has been and maybe how the Millennial offering is fairing online versus in-store?","Karen Hoguet","Interestingly, the Millennial was doing well in both places. There is sort of assumption that many people have that it\u2019s all online, is actually not the case. Millennials love shopping in stores as well as online and browsing in one channel and shopping in another, so both have been doing well. And in terms of overall trends, it\u2019s really hard to measure now because we have so many people buying off smartphones on the selling floor. So it\u2019s, again, we don\u2019t talk as much about digital sales versus store, not quite sure where that line is drawn?","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","And next, we will move to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Hey. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Michael Binetti - UBS","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about -- obviously, the brick-and-mortar fleet has been -- for retail has been in news a lot lately and it\u2019s been a big topic with investors. Obviously, store closures from some competitors are the topic of the day. You guys have had a very calculated approach to how you look at fleet and any closings you might do. How do you think about some of the news we\u2019ve heard lately at some of the big boxes and malls you are in are going to stepping up store closures?","Karen Hoguet","I think we do the exact same thing. We\u2019ve always done, which is we are constantly analyzing our store base and analyzing which, if any, should be closed and I would expect that to continue. There is no question that there is some stores and perhaps some malls that won\u2019t be in existence in five years. But there is a lot of malls that are going to be invested in and be even stronger than they are today. So, yes, we will continue to close stores as we\u2019ve done and yes, we will continue to grow and invest in good stores, good malls.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay. And then just a follow-up, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of these specific omnichannel initiatives you talked about over the last few quarters with us. The first obviously would be store-to-door and then, you also talked about buy online and pick up in-store. Can you talk about -- how do you view the impact on profitability of those kinds of initiatives to stay versus where it could be going and maybe some metrics you could give us to get excited about pick up in-store?","Karen Hoguet","Yeah. Let me start with that. The buy online, pick up in-store that we just tested in Washington is going to be rolled out by the end of the summer across the country. And we are really very excited about this and finding the customers or using it in all different kinds of ways. In some cases, it\u2019s somebody working that wants to order something at the office and pick it up on their way home and doesn\u2019t want a package sitting on a doorstep. In other cases, it\u2019s wanting to browse online and be sure that what you want is in the store when you get there. Some cases its convenience, not having time to shop the whole store, so they shop online and pick it up.","And in other cases, it\u2019s same day, a way of getting something the same day, which again, people like as opposed to having it shipped. I do think we\u2019ll be doing same-day delivery at some point but for now, this is the way most customers will get things same day and it\u2019s very exciting. We\u2019re finding a lot of people like it. It hasn\u2019t even been marketed yet. So, we think the potential is huge and the good news is, is that when the customer comes to the store, they\u2019re usually buying other things while they\u2019re there and so obviously that\u2019s a good thing as well. The store-to-door or Search & Send as we call it, is also been very helpful, allowing us to get wanted goods to customers when either were out of a particular size or color at a store, or in some cases we don\u2019t carry that brand or that item in a store getting it to the customer easily also. And that just continues to grow and be a terrific source of customer satisfaction as we go forward.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Good morning and thanks for taking the question.","Karen Hoguet","Sure. Good morning. Just to follow-up on the last question, I know the store fleet has been pretty flat for a while and obviously, on the cash flow lines, the software and the investment in PP&E has been pretty flat too. Do you see that staying flat on a dollar basis over the long run, or have we come through some peak period with the software spending and maybe it\u2019s going to go down a little? How do you see that developing over the next five years or so?","Karen Hoguet","And in fact our CapEx this year is a little bit higher than it has been, is about $1.1 billion. So, I don\u2019t see the investment in software going down because there just continues to be new ideas that you want to invest in and grow with. Unfortunately, we have the size and scale to make that profitable. But we will continue to invest in technology quite heavily as we go forward. But we\u2019re also investing to maintain the store base, so it\u2019s doing both.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","So will that grow as the sales go up, or because you\u2019ve got a pretty fixed store base? Will it be more flat at growing just on a dollar basis?","Karen Hoguet","I don\u2019t know exactly how to predict it. My guess is that the $1 billion-ish is probably the right number for the next couple of years. Beyond that, it\u2019s hard to know right now. I don\u2019t anticipate a major increase.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then real quick on the licensed business, it sounds like you\u2019re pleased with the licensed businesses you\u2019ve had. Do you see that continuing to grow as other vendors approach you with the same type of situation?","Karen Hoguet","Well, we start with the objective of pleasing our customers and finding great assortments in categories that they want to find at a Macy\u2019s. So when you think about Sunglass Hut or Finish Line, both of those enabled us to bring product to our customers that we weren\u2019t able to do as Macy\u2019s alone. So, yes, there may be other opportunities. We\u2019ve been very successful. We\u2019re starting to rollout Locker Room by Lids, which will be for team apparel and accessories and we\u2019re very excited about that too. And so, yes, there may be other opportunities to do this.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Interesting. Thanks a lot and best of luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Hi. The merchandise margins were a nice upside this quarter. What are your thoughts going forward on that? And as you think about holiday, you are doing this prudent tweaking strategy in terms of ensuring you have the right promotional balance. What may be new this year versus last year now as we move forward throughout the quarters?","Karen Hoguet","I can\u2019t tell you that then the competitors would know it. But in terms of the margin, as I said a few minutes ago, we are expecting for the year still flattish to down slightly. So yes, the first quarter was great. But I don\u2019t change the annual guidance for gross margin at this point.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Okay. I\u2019m encouraged by your statement on pent-up demand. If you could highlight for us why you have conviction there and what you are thinking in terms of how that could play out?","Karen Hoguet","Well, in part, I say that because once the weather warmed up, there was a significant change in the trend. So, again, a couple of weeks doesn\u2019t a quarter or a year make. But it is encouraging to see that and particularly in the northern climate. So that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re feeling confident.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Got it. And my last question was just about traffic and traffic. If you could speak to what you\u2019re most excited about, about your traffic driving strategies and I\u2019m kind of curious about this as it applies to online as well as bricks and mortar or however, maybe most prudent to talk about?","Karen Hoguet","Our number of transactions, which is as close as we can come to traffic, we are down in the first quarter as I said. But, again, I think a lot of that was weather related, plus the shift in Friends & Family. We will be able to judge better as we get through the second quarter, but obviously our marketing approach is trying to drive traffic to our stores, but also to our mobile devices, to laptops, desktops, etcetera, and smartphones. So our traffic driving strategies today are broader than they used to be when we were completely focused on stores.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Karen, a final question is just about your brand portfolio, which is outstanding. Are you very comfortable with the current mix of national and exclusive brands? Or is there anything there in terms of how you are thinking about your strategy going forward?","Karen Hoguet","Well, as you know, we love our private brands and we love our national brands as well. And so, we will continue to build our business with those. And wherever we see white space or available customer demand, we will ask ourselves, are we better off developing it ourselves or is there a partner we can develop that with?","So if we look at for example the millennial businesses, Ralph Lauren, Denim & Supply has been a big part of that as has Maison Jules, which is a private brand or we are in the midst right now of building an enormous brand geared at the Latina customer, Thalia, and we are extraordinarily excited about that and this is one where we felt our team was better equipped to build it out. So we do make those decisions. But for Macy\u2019s to be successful, we need our very strong private brands, our exclusive brands to do well, and also the national brands.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","The Thalia innovation has been impressive. Thanks and congrats.","Karen Hoguet","Yeah, no, wait till you see the product, I got a glimpse of it a couple of weeks ago, it looks terrific. I think she is very excited about it and our team spent a lot of time down in Mexico making sure we get the size right, the coloring right, the fit right. And I think it\u2019s just going to be a huge success when it hits the stores next spring.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup","Thank you. Best regards.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Karen, thanks for question. Question on gross margins, so it\u2019s kind of been beaten to death here a little bit, but I\u2019m trying to understand how you improved your gross margins in the first quarter. Given the fact that, I think you came out a little bit heavy coming out of the fourth quarter; sales were not up to expectations, I\u2019m assuming your online may have grown a little bit faster than in-store, which is lower margin. So, how did you do it? And the follow-up would be, are you being conservative in your outlook for the balance of the year on gross margin given that you were able to show improvement in an extremely tough quarter?","Karen Hoguet","Well, I hope that I\u2019m being conservative, but I don\u2019t think that I am. And I think Jeff and the merchants did a very good job of anticipating some of the risk and managing it as they went through the quarter and did a terrific job. One of the great strengths of Macy\u2019s is our merchant organization and their ability to flex and forecast and anticipate risk, and at the same time, maximize what they see working. And it all played out quite well in the first quarter in terms of the margin performance, but again, it\u2019s one quarter. And maybe I will in the end, end up having being conservative, I hope so, but I don\u2019t think so in terms of the prospect for the year.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","How did your private label brands perform relative to national brands in the first quarter?","Karen Hoguet","They performed quite well. We had unbelievable strength with some of the big ones like INC, Alfani, Karen Scott; American BRAG, I mean, I could keep going, Bar III, Material Girl. We had a very strong quarter with a lot of the private brands.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","And finally, a question on your assortments online versus in-store. I guess how congruent are they at the present time and kind of what is your goal as you move through the year?","Karen Hoguet","Congruency is a very tough subject. What I would say is that most of what we carry online is covered in a Macy\u2019s store; but remember, we have lots of different assortments in different stores. So I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s congruent with every store, but we do try very hard to make that happen.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","And what areas would you say online are underpenetrated? And I guess, again, where are you kind of taking the online business from an assortment standpoint as you move through the year?","Karen Hoguet","Well, historically, home has been where online started first, and so now we\u2019ve been seeing outsized growth in the apparel areas. But again that\u2019s just because of where they started, but our strategies online are actually quite comparable in terms of growth plans to what\u2019s happening in the store. A key item tends to be a key item in both channels and also brands. So our strategies really have become omni as we look at the future.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next we will move to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Great. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Kimberly.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to just clarify what I think I heard in your prepared remarks, you talked about obviously Q1 sales were a little bit below your expectations. I think the total sales number was down about 1.5% or so, or just a little over 1%, but you said year-to-date sales are well back into positive territory, including May. That suggests in the first two and a half weeks of May, not only did you make up for the deficit in Q1, but that total revenue number had actually had a plus sign in front of it.","Karen Hoguet","Yes, that is okay with me.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Terrific, great. Thank you. I don\u2019t like calling a quarter based on a couple of weeks, but given the inflection point in the weather, I think it is relevant. So post that inflection point in the weather, obviously there were some categories in the first quarter that didn\u2019t meet your expectations. Many of them were probably impacted by the weather, what we\u2019ve got going on in the housing market. Now that you\u2019ve seen sort of four, five, six weeks of, I guess, we\u2019ll call it more normal weather, are there any categories that are still not performing to where you would expect them?","Karen Hoguet","Well, the truth is, most of the categories that had the weakness, home, a lot of the apparel, shoes, have strengthened a lot. I think, let\u2019s wait-and-see the quarter though. Again, I really don\u2019t want to make too much of a couple of weeks.","Kimberly Greenberger","Very fair. And then lastly, just how should we think about SG&A as we work our way through the year, because here in Q1, SG&A dollars on a year-over-year basis were actually down 2%, which we clearly didn\u2019t expect. And we have SG&A dollars growing in our model by a little bit over the next three quarters. But, did you think it\u2019s possible that you could hold SG&A dollars flatter, were there some anomalies in Q1 that just won\u2019t repeat?","Karen Hoguet","Well, one of them was the sales was below last year. So, in part, we brought expense dollars down and flexed the staffing in the stores in reaction to the sales. So I would not expect SG&A for the year to be down for sure or flat. I do expect it to be up as we go through the remainder of the year.","Kimberly Greenberger","Thanks so much Karen.","Operator","Next we will move to Richard Jaffe wit Stifel.","","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","Thanks so much Karen, and good morning.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","A question on marketing and some of the new -- relatively new opportunities to market online, the social marketing initiatives that we\u2019ve seen. And I am wondering what\u2019s your take on these new marketing opportunities; how much you pushed into those areas and how much we should look for in the balance of the year?","Karen Hoguet","Well, I\u2019m not really the marketing expert, but as you might imagine, we are spending a lot more of our budget on digital and all kinds of ways. Particularly, as you talk about the millennial customer, he or she is getting their information differently than perhaps I am. So there is a lot of change happening. But still much of what we spend is in the traditional media.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","Is there a way -- it\u2019s always tough to judge the impact of advertising, perhaps the e-commerce channel is a little bit easier. Are you seeing it working for you or encouraging to you to pursue more aggressively in the balance of the year?","Karen Hoguet","Well, I don\u2019t think -- I mean, we\u2019re pleased with how our marketing is working, if that\u2019s your question, both digitally and the more traditional media. Our team spends a lot of time analyzing media effectiveness and is putting our dollars where we are getting the biggest result, and we are fine-tuning that constantly.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","So we\u2019ll just have to wait and watch online and see how that progresses?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, correct.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","Okay. Thanks so much.","Karen Hoguet","You bet.","Operator","Next we will move to David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, David.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","The question on the second quarter, obviously your guidance implies a meaningful acceleration in sales trends and you are off to a good start. I am wondering as part of your plan for the second quarter, whether you added some sales promotion events. Obviously, last year, you had some takeaways from the quarter that you wanted to be harder hitting and that was preplanned. But, were there any things you had to react to earlier this year to add to your game plan for Q2?","Karen Hoguet","No, we have not changed our plans at all. We changed -- as we looked at the second quarter performance last year and moved into the third quarter, we did make changes and at that point started planning spring of \u201814. And so we have, as I said earlier, added some promotion into the second quarter, but that was purposefully done and done six months ago.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Great. And then in terms of the opportunities, clearly, Mother\u2019s Day, I guess you can check the box given the start to the month that you just described. Are there time periods where you feel like your -- where you have the biggest opportunity\u2026","Karen Hoguet","I think we have opportunity really throughout the quarter.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Thank you. And one follow-up, just curious the announcement by Federal Express to change to this dimensional pricing model versus pricing by weight. I am wondering what if any impact that has on how you guys approach filling e-commerce orders from a cost standpoint or an execution standpoint?","Karen Hoguet","Yeah, I don\u2019t know the specific answer on the FedEx change, but as you might imagine, we have a team of people doing everything we can to lower delivery expense. So understanding how those changes impact that, I don\u2019t know how, but I guarantee you, we have a team working on it.","David Glick - Buckingham Research","Okay, great. Thank you very much and good luck. Thanks, David.","Operator","And our next question comes from Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Hi, Karen, how are you?","Karen Hoguet","Good. I guess my first question is sort of another question on this brand versus private -- national brands versus private brands? I think, historically, there was maybe a thought that private brands and the exclusivity that you get there were really something special that maybe some companies were chasing for a bit and maybe I went too far? But in terms of your positioning now, is it fair to say that because of your dominance in the marketplace, you have a better assortment of the branded goods and so even if it\u2019s a broadly distributed national brand, you\u2019ll have a better assortment in that brand than maybe some of your competitors, is that part of what\u2019s working so well for you?","Karen Hoguet","I hope so, because that\u2019s the strength of our merchandising team. I mean, that\u2019s what Jeff and the team and then Julie Greiner, our Chief Merchandise Planning Officer, plus Jeff Kantor\u2019s team at dotcom, that\u2019s what they do. They curate the market and find the best assortments within national brands, as well as, obviously, helping on the exclusive brand. And we do also try to get exclusive items from our national brands to make the assortment of those even better.","And again, remember, part of our secret sauce there is not only finding the right items but it\u2019s assorting them appropriately, size, color, et cetera, store by store, which is the whole My Macy\u2019s strength. So even if, we theoretically had the same assortment from a brand as someone else, I think we would do better on the sales line because of what we\u2019re doing with My Macy\u2019s.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Understood. In terms of looking at some of these license like the Finish Line and sunglasses, those sort of areas, are you -- can you share any analysis that you\u2019ve done to suggest that the customer maybe cross-shopping other areas of the store and perhaps, that\u2019s part of the lift that you\u2019re seeing in the juniors area?","Karen Hoguet","Sure. Absolutely. And we obviously track that quite closely. In Macy\u2019s shop those areas just like they\u2019re part of Macy\u2019s, sometimes they don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re shopping in a licensed department. They come in to buy sunglasses. They just happen to buy them and may not even recognize that it\u2019s sunglass, yeah\u2026","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","But they are also\u2026","Karen Hoguet","Yeah\u2026","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","\u2026 selling over into\u2026","Karen Hoguet","Absolutely.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Okay. And then finally, just how are you and the Board thinking about the dividend, obviously, nice increase there, are you looking at it just kind of wanting to be competitive with other companies out there in terms of the yield or how do you think about dividends versus buyback?","Karen Hoguet","I think, the Board has been relatively consistent in terms of looking at yield as payout ratios and trying to keep the yield competitive. So, I think, you\u2019ll continue to see absent something changing. The Board making the same kind of decisions they\u2019ve been making for years between the dividend and the buyback.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Stacie Rabinowitz with Consumer Edge Research has our next question.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Hi. I actually had two and hopefully, they are relatively quick. Number one, you had mentioned thinking about same-day delivery and I know your, that eBAY now does one to two-hour delivery for you in some markets? So my first question was just, if you could comment on how successful that\u2019s been or what the impact has been in those markets that\u2019s causing you to maybe think about doing same-day shipping more broadly?","And then number two, just, I know it\u2019s hard with the shift to compare? But anything on how Easter did this year versus last year in terms of the holiday specific products or sales events would be fantastic?","Karen Hoguet ","Yeah. No. It\u2019s really hard to compare Easter given the weather change but that was a big factor. Obviously, we were quite pleased with our kids business which is a big Easter business. And also our dress business is pretty good given the weather. So as you think about Easter, I would say hard to judge because of weather. But clearly did a lot of business in those categories which tend to go with the holiday.","In terms of same-day delivery, I don\u2019t think we have done anything yet in terms of the test that gives us any sense of how big it could be. So we are beginning to think about, should we test, should we not, where, how, et cetera and probably will.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And next I move to Richard Church with Discern Investment Analytics.","Richard Church - Discern Investment Analytics","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Rick.","Richard Church - Discern Investment Analytics","Just a quick question for you that expands on earlier question about digital marketing. Beacon technology has been gaining some traction and some momentum. And I know you\u2019re testing this technology in your stores. I was wondering if you have any insights or learnings that you could share with respect to how the customer might be responding or accepting of beacons?","Karen Hoguet","Sorry, I can\u2019t comment on that.","Richard Church - Discern Investment Analytics","Okay. And then I think, you alluded this to an earlier answer but any mix shift with respect to in-store or Omnichannel online sales when you\u2019re in a quarter like the first quarter, which was somewhat disrupted by weather or whatever maybe disrupting traffic. Any mix shift that do you think is important to call out?","Karen Hoguet","No, not really.","Richard Church - Discern Investment Analytics","Okay. Thank you.","Karen Hoguet","You bet.","Operator","Rick Snyder with Maxim Group has our next question.","Rick Snyder - Maxim Group","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Hi Rick.","Rick Snyder - Maxim Group","I was wondering if you could go over those comp components again, because my numbers don\u2019t quite match. And also if I\u2019m not mistaken, you\u2019ve anniversaried the Finish Line licensed departments and are the LIDS also licensed? Did I understand that?","Karen Hoguet","Correct.","Rick Snyder - Maxim Group","Okay.","Karen Hoguet","So the gap between comp and owned plus licensed gap will narrow in the second quarter, third and fourth because of your rounding on the Finish Line.","Rick Snyder - Maxim Group","Okay. And could you just go over the AUR, UPT numbers again?","Karen Hoguet","Yeah, I mean and again, it\u2019s all tracking back to the comp of down 0.8 on an owned plus licensed basis.","Rick Snyder - Maxim Group","It\u2019s down point.","Karen Hoguet","Yeah. Because that\u2019s how we\u2019re evaluating our business internally.","Rick Snyder - Maxim Group","Okay.","Karen Hoguet","So I think that\u2019s probably where you were off.","Rick Snyder - Maxim Group","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll move to Steve Kernkraut with Berman Capital.","Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital","Yeah. Hi, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Hi, Steve.","Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital","I have one question that\u2019s more of a longer term rather than a short-term quarterly question. But Terry has talked in the past about how he\u2019s not interested in Canada and he\u2019s very interested in China. And I just wanted to know if you could kind of update us on what your thoughts are there, whether anything has changed, whether anything more aggressive is going to happen in China? And would Sears likely try to -- there\u2019ll be assets that they have in Canada, whether or not that\u2019s of any interest to you guys?","Karen Hoguet","I don\u2019t really think anything has changed Steve from that. As you said, Terry\u2019s not been interested in Canada and has been more interested in China. And we\u2019re continuing to explore international opportunities for both Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy\u2019s. As you know, Bloomingdale\u2019s has a license deal in Dubai\u2026","Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital","Right.","Karen Hoguet","\u2026which has been a very successful venture for both the partner and for us. And so we may broaden that kind of partnership as well. So, I would say, international is still something that\u2019s intriguing but nothing eminent in terms of significance.","Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital","It really is an intriguing thing and that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll see dollars put down and then trying to invest in China or something like that.","Karen Hoguet","Well, at some point, you may. I mean, it\u2019s obviously, if we ever decided to do it, there would be dollars involved.","Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital","Right.","Karen Hoguet","So, I would say, it continues to be interesting.","Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital","Okay. And with your e-commerce business so successful at this point, are you getting many international buyers along that line, has that been an avenue that\u2019s been working with the international customers?","Karen Hoguet","Some, but we really haven\u2019t focused on it. I would say that we\u2019re so focused on getting the omnichannel and the domestic business doing well plus tourists, that that\u2019s really where the focus has been and we do believe that there\u2019s more international growth to be done. It just has not been a priority.","Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital","This is not your priority. Okay. Thanks very much.","Karen Hoguet","You bet.","Steve Kernkraut - Berman Capital","Okay.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll hear from Margaret Moore with DuPont Capital.","Margaret Moore - DuPont Capital","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Margaret.","Margaret Moore - DuPont Capital","You called out Intimate as a positive trend and I was wondering if you could discuss whether that was a function of new product innovation, or the positive impacts of better sales associate training, because that has been an area where department stores in general have been losing market share historically and do you expect these trends to continue for the rest of the year?","Karen Hoguet","No. I think it starts with an assortment that was better edited and our in-stock position on key sizes was improved. And I think a version of My Macy\u2019s was executed there. ","Margaret Moore - DuPont Capital","Okay.","Karen Hoguet","In combination with improvement in terms of training and MAGIC Selling in terms of the store execution, but I think a lot of the strength started with merchandise strategies and we do expect that strength to continue through the year.","Margaret Moore - DuPont Capital","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Brian Rounick with BLR Capital.","Brian Rounick - BLR Capital","Hi, Karen.

Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2019 results and our full year 2019 outlook. With me on the call today are Jeff Gennette, our Chairman and CEO; Paula Price, our CFO; and Hal Lawton, our President. ","Jeff and Paula have several prepared remarks to share, after which Hal will join us for question-and-answer session. Given the time constraints and the number of people who want to participate, we ask that you please limit your questions to one with a quick follow up.","In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on the Investors section of our website, macysinc.com. The presentation summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our Form 10-Q will be filed in a few weeks and that too will be available on our website at that time.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call and it will be archived there following the call for one year.","Now, I'd like to turn this over to Jeff.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you saw in our press release this morning, after seven consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales, Macy's Inc had a tough quarter with comp sales down 3.5%. While we anticipated a negative comp, as we were lapping a very strong quarter last year, the sales deceleration was steeper than we expected. However, having cleared the excess inventory we faced earlier in the year, we were able to take a more balanced approach to sales and profit in the quarter. Versus the first half of this year, this resulted in a significantly improved margin compression on lower sales. ","Let me share some details on the drivers of our sales decline. Our third quarter sales were impacted by continued soft international tourism, weaker than anticipated performance in our lower tier malls and the late arrival of cold weather. Given Macy's status as a destination for cold weather apparel, we saw an impact in both cold weather merchandise and in the same trip purchases that our customers typically attend. Now that the cold weather has arrived, we're beginning to see those sales flow through. ","We also experienced a temporary impact on e-commerce business due in part of the work on the site in preparation for the fourth quarter. The team has completed that work, the site is updated and our customers can expect an improved experience this holiday season. ","Based primarily on the impact of our third quarter sales trend we are lowering our annual sales guidance to down 1% to down 1.5% and adjusted EPS guidance to $2.57 to $2.77.","On the call this morning, Paula will take you through the third quarter results and provide additional detail on our outlook for the year. After Paula's comments, I will take you through our holiday plans and give you a preview of what to expect from our Investor Day in February.","Hal Lawton, President of Macy's is also on the call today and will join me and Paula for the question-and-answer session. So I'm now going to turn the call over to Paula.","Paula Price ","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. So let's jump right in. Sales in the quarter were $5.2 billion, a decline of 3.5% on an owned plus licensed comparable basis. Jeff explained the key drivers behind this performance in his remarks. But while sales overall were disappointing, our 2019 strategic initiatives continue to deliver the results that bode well for future performance. During the quarter, we continued to make progress on each initiative. ","Within the Growth150 stores, we completed the work on the additional 100 stores. The Growth stores continue to outperform the rest of our store fleet, both validating our investments in this initiative and giving us great confidence in our outlook for this important segment of our store fleet. ","We achieved our full year goal of expanding Backstage to another 50 stores. We exceeded our Backstage expectations in the quarter and Backstage locations open for more than a year continue to perform well up mid-single-digits and have improved both margin and turn. ","Backstage continues to add recognizable brands that our customers expect in the off-price arena. This is offered through a lens for fashion and value and our customers are responding. The strength of our Backstage business is in ready to wear which is performing across all segments from sportswear in missy, contemporary and juniors as well as in active and intimate apparel. The kids category has also been a standout where our Backstage customer is responding to a mix of brand and classifications in apparel, as well as toys. We have seen strong improvement in the Backstage shoe business, which is always a major draw for our customers. ","Turning to categories across the broader business. We had strong performance in mattresses, fine jewelry, fragrances, dresses, men's active and men's tailored. The weaker businesses in the quarter included women\u2019s and men sportswear, especially the cold weather items, handbag, housewares and furniture. In terms of digital, as expected, we experienced the slowdown in growth from the second quarter into the third quarter as we lapped a very strong third quarter last year. ","Our online business also suffered from the delay in cold weather in addition to a temporary impact we saw some from significant site changes rolled out in time for the fourth quarter. These updates are critical for improving the customer experience and as Jeff said we are confident heading into holiday with an improved digital experience for our customers. ","So let me touch on a few of the many experience and feature improvements that we have made. We improved the speed and usability of our digital properties with the re-platform of our app and a redesign of our front end experience to a more modern, elevated design with improved user navigation. We also added numerous sites and apps features, particularly app features to help our customers with in-store navigation and shopping.","We continue to see our online growth fueled by Vendor Direct, omni pickup and the mobile app, all outpacing the overall digital performance. Mobile remains our fastest growing channel, outpacing overall online demand growth by nearly 4 times. We've seen triple-digit growth in our downloads year-to-date and significant growth in our mobile active users as we continue to improve the experience.","Vendor Direct is fueling online growth through increased selection with the addition of nearly 1,000 vendors and 1 million SKUs year-to-date across many categories, especially in home, men's and kids and Center Core. Omni pickup or BOPS and BOSS continue to grow as our customers love the security and convenience of picking up in-store. And we are pleased to have relaunched same day delivery to complement our same-day in-store pickup option.","Bloomingdales saw its strongest sales performance in its stores year-to-date, and experienced growth in both its digital business and outlet stores. Luxury fragrances, salon shoes and contemporary ready to wear led growth in the quarter. With only six weeks since launch My List is performing well. Its millennial penetration and its the subscriber base is currently more than double that of the total Bloomingdales\u2019 ready to wear millennial penetration. While still small, these are promising results. ","Bluemercury had another strong quarter with double-digit sales growth and we opened four stores in the quarter. Importantly, the brand also launched its first loyalty program BlueRewards and more than 30% of the customer base has already enrolled. With regard to our company sales transaction metrics, overall transactions fell 0.4% compared to the same quarter last year. Reversing a positive trend, this was the main driver of our sales comps performance reflecting the factors just discussed. ","Items per transaction were down 1.8% and in line with trend, average unit retail fell 1.4%, which represents a trend improvement. The decrease in AUR is in part due to the expansion of Backstage, which reduces AUR but increases transactions. ","Turning to credit revenue, we generated $183 million in the quarter, down 1.1% from last year. Credit card penetration was 48.3% in the quarter, slightly below last year's level. Gross margin in the quarter was 40%. While down 30 basis points versus last year, this represents a significant sequential improvement over the second quarter and indicates we are making progress in our efforts to combat margin compression and improve profitability. ","Merchandise margin also benefited from the traction we are beginning to get from our productivity initiatives, such as hold and flow. These benefits were offset by delivery headwinds of approximately 40 basis points. Comparable inventory was flat to last year representing an improved result versus the prior quarter. ","Within SG&A, we recorded $2.2 billion of expense in the quarter $53 million less than last year and up 90 basis points on a rate basis. The SG&A dollar reduction reflects both disciplined cost containment and lower variable costs associated with sales. ","Adjusted net income in the quarter was $21 million versus $83 million last year. Included in these net income figures is the impact of asset sale gains of $13 million and $31 million, respectively. Adjusted EPS was $0.07 in the quarter compared to $0.27 last year, of which asset sales gains represented about $0.04 and $0.10 respectively. ","Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $172 million compared to $429 million last year. The variance is due primarily to timing within accounts payable and also lower EBITDA offset by lower tax payments and is not indicative of the strength of our full year expectation. ","Capital expenditures were $812 million compared to $677 million last year. And we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures. ","Cash used by financing activities was $276 million less than a year ago, as 2018 included $344 million of early debt repurchases. We continue to expect to use excess cash to further reduce our debt in fiscal 2019 through voluntary debt repayment. We remain committed to paying an appropriate cash dividend to our investors and have paid $349 million year-to-date at the same per share amount as we've been paying. ","Let me now turn to guidance. For the full year we expect comparable sales to be down 1% to down 1.5% on an owned plus licensed basis. We continue to expect our sales performance in the fourth quarter to be sequentially better than the third quarter as we not only remain confident in our holiday plans, but also we will cycle the disruption caused by the fire in our West Virginia mega center and the underperforming pre-Christmas promotional event last year. ","Gross margin for the year is expected to be moderately down to a year ago and we continue to expect comparable inventory levels at the end of 2019 to be below last year. With a greater sales decline than previously anticipated we expect our annual SG&A rate to delever moderately. But as we continue our disciplined cost containment efforts in the business, we expect our full year SG&A dollars to be slightly below last year's level. ","Our real estate team continues to do its excellent job of monetizing our valuable real estate holdings appropriately and opportunistically. We now anticipate about $150 million of asset sale gains for the year well ahead of expectation. Taking everything into consideration, we expect 2019 adjusted EPS to be in the range at $2.57 to $2.77, or $2.20 to $2.40 when asset sale gains are excluded. Our revised guidance also includes our expectations for tariff, as we have been able to successfully mitigate nearly all of the $0.07 impact that we previously anticipated. ","While we had fruitful discussions with our vendors and suppliers and we're able to minimize the 2019 impact on our business and our customers, discussions are still underway for 2020. We'll be able to share more insights from those discussions when we provide guidance for next year. You can find our complete guidance in the slide presentation we posted on our website earlier this morning. ","In closing, while we anticipated third quarter comps to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter, due to the cycling of a very strong quarter last year, our sales performance was certainly weaker than we expected. That said, we navigated the quarter with discipline and we're confident in our ability to continue to moderate our gross margin compression to contain our expenses, and importantly to execute at a high level to deliver of strong holiday season and fourth quarter. ","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, Paula. So again, while our sales performance for the third quarter did fall short, we feel good about the improvement in margin compression and remain confident in our strategies for the holiday and our path to the updated annual guidance. So the team has been hard at work all year and we are definitely ready to deliver holiday in 2019 with the following. ","So we have an expanded gifting assortment at strong values. Our gifts and our strategy ensures that we will reach the breadth of our customer base with great brands and products at clear price points across all categories. ","We have a colorful marketing calendar that addresses the cadence of a shorter holiday season. Importantly, we are engaging with both our best and our occasional customers with targeted events. Our stores are stuffed for the holidays. The work on both Backstage and the Growth150 stores was completed by the end of October. Product and visuals are strong and our colleagues are ready to serve our customers. We've enhanced our digital properties including mobile to both promote online sales and drive in-store activity. ","We're on track with our seasonal recruitment and having improved our on-boarding and scheduling systems we are seeing lower turnover and our seasonal colleagues. And these strategies are underpinned with a strong operational plan. Our distribution centers and stores are ready to deliver flexible, secure and convenient fulfillment options whether our customers are shopping online, in-store, on mobile or across channels. ","We also expect Bloomingdales and Bluemercury hit their strike for holiday and both brands also have strong gifting strategies. Additionally, Bloomingdales is continuing to amplify the experiential edge its brand, with exciting events and personalized service for both customers and visitors this holiday season. Last week, we opened our 39th Bloomingdales. This new store in Norwalk, Connecticut, will help us build on Bloomingdales\u2019 strong presence in the Northeast. ","Holiday season officially kicks off for the Macy's brand next week, with the 93rd Annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. This is a time for us to engage with the more than 50 million viewers that tune in live for the parade. All eyes are on Macy\u2019s and the increased media weight we're putting around the parade is part of our strategy to drive consideration with occasional customers. ","As we announced this morning we will hold an Investor Day on February 5th to share our growth strategies and our three year plan. We remain intensely focused on areas of the business that are working and there are many but we are also taking a fresh and hard look at the things that aren\u2019t working. At Investor Day the team and I will take you through: First, a view of the Macy's customers franchise and actions we're taking to drive further engagement with our existing customers while we also bring new customers into the brand. This will include our merchandising strategies to deliver our quality fashion at affordable prices. Next, a detailed view of our omni-channel growth strategies built through the lens of our customer journey. This will include an update on our store segmentation. We will also share plans for our digital business both mobile and dotcom and the steps we're taking to further strength this engine of growth and profitability. Next, an update on the productivity program that we shared in September, we have seen positive early results and have a road map to significantly accelerate the savings. This will include detail on our supply chain transformation. And lastly, we will also share other actions we're taking to build a playbook to compete effectively in today's retail environment. ","Retail is evolving at a rapid pace. American consumers love the Macy's, Inc. brands; Macy's, Bloomingdales and Bluemercury. And while we have made good progress on how we do business, there is more work ahead. We are taking significant steps and decisive action to change our course and to return to profitability growth. Our brands are stronger than our performance reflects. We have a road map to close this gap, and we have a clear vision for our future.","With that, we're going to open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll now take our first question. It comes from Matthew Boss of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss ","So Jeff, maybe outside of your Growth150, what's the turnaround timeline for the remaining 50% of the business? And given your comment today regarding lower tier malls, any update to the fleet size over time or just how you're thinking about some of those lower tier centers?","Jeff Gennette ","Yes. Hi, Matt. So let's just -- I'm going to start with just when you look at the initiatives that we have employed that are driving our business right now. So destination businesses, Backstage, Growth 150, all those are working. And I'm going to have Hal add some color on the initiatives as well as one of the things that we've been under reinvest, which is really the ready-to-wear business. So I'm going to have him talk about that.","When you talk about the other opportunities that we have with our store fleet, we'll also give you a sense of where that is by tier. And so Hal is also going to address that about where our business is. What I would say about our malls is that, we're investing and our mall developers are investing, we're getting great outcomes. So when you look at the Growth150 strategy, which basically touches over 50% of our brick-and-mortar business, we're complete with all that work and we're taking these revitalized stores into the fourth quarter with us. And in most cases, you've also got mall developers that have also enhanced those mall properties.","So we're ready. I think our mall developers are ready. But the point I'd make on the rest of our stores is that we're all dressed and ready for a very successful fourth quarter. So I'm going to turn it over first really to Hal, he'll kind of give you some more color about some of the initiatives that we're working on right now as well as that we're building a ready-to-wear, and then also ask him to comment on some of the store segmentation, some of the malls that you're referring to.","Hal Lawton ","As Jeff mentioned, we remain confident in our strategic initiatives. Specifically on our Growth stores, we've completed 100 this year, and they're ready for the holiday season. The trend variance, the performance in our Growth stores continues to be strong and better than the rest of our store base with a nice uplift that we -- that is significant in nature.","As it relates to Backstage, Backstage continues to exceed our expectations and specifically exceeded our expectations for the quarter. And this is very much driven by locations that have been opened up for more than a year. Those locations are running up mid-single digits year-over-year. And the locations are also improving in margin in turn. And we remain very confident in our Backstage initiative, Macy's get stronger and stronger in off-price every single day.","On our destination businesses, while they did not grow in the quarter in aggregate, as our business trended below our expectations, they did outpace the rest of the business. And we did see outsized growth in parts of the business. Paula mentioned some of our strengths earlier in categories like mattresses and fragrances.","As it relates to our mobile initiatives, it very much remains our fastest growing channel. We continue to see very strong growth in downloads and users in the quarter, and we added a number of new features to improve the in-store experience, drive traffic and engagement onto our mobile website -- I mean under our mobile app, and also enable less friction in the e-commerce experience.","Finally, as it relates to our fifth initiative, Vendor Direct, it continues to be very strong and a meaningful driver of our digital business. We've exceeded, as Paula mentioned, our goal for new vendors and also SKUs on-boarded for the year. And in our minds, there's only upside for our Vendor Direct initiative as it adds sales and profits as well as increases customer satisfaction with very minimal capital and inventory investment.","Turning to ready-to-wear. If you look at our ready-to-wear business, while it did continue to underperform in Q3, we're very optimistic as we look ahead. As we mentioned on our previous earnings call, in the spring, we made adjustments to the structure and put new leadership in place. That team has been fast away working on fashion and trends and really rejuvenating our exclusive brands and working closely with our market brands and reestablishing our private brands.","While they will be able to influence a small portion of our buy in Q3, there were a number of bright spots and green shoots that really give us confidence in this business as we move forward. A couple of examples that I'll call out was our Animal Prints and Emerald Green INC fashion drops that had sell-throughs well above average. I'll also call out our Becca Tilley x bar III collaboration that was a very big success with our customers.","And then turning to Q4. They've been able to have a bigger influence on Q4. Those assortments had just hit the stores in the last few weeks, but we're really excited about the early performance. An example of which very high sell-throughs is our INC holiday party assortment.","So that's just a brief update on our initiatives and our ready-to-wear. The last thing that I'll just reference as Jeff's commentary on malls. As Jeff said, we've been investing in malls where developers are investing, and that's specifically with our growth strategy. And we feel really good about that initiative, and those stores continue to outpace the breadth of our fleet.","As we talked about before, we had very much in-store segmentation strategy that starts with our flagships, predominantly Herald Square, our national flagship, 10 regional flagships, our Magnet doors and then our Neighborhood doors. We've been watching the trend across our malls for quite some time, specifically in the C and D malls, which are Neighborhood doors. And we did see a steeper decline in these doors than we anticipated in the quarter.","As the majority of our business is in the A malls, we've talked about that several times, and again, that is where we're investing. And that's where our growth strategy is having a big impact. As we move forward, we -- as we've talked about on previous calls, we will be communicating our plan for our neighborhood stores and providing an update on our store segmentation strategy at our Analyst Day in February.","So just in summary, we feel really strong about our strategic initiatives and the impact they're having on the business. We are optimistic about our ready-to-wear business as we look ahead to Q4, and we'll be providing a more thorough update on our store segmentation at our upcoming Analyst Day.","Matthew Boss ","And then just maybe as a near-term follow-up, the change to your 4Q and holiday forecast versus three months ago, I guess, how much of this is Macy specific versus any change that you have on the U.S. consumer? And then just last, you mentioned commitment to paying an appropriate cash dividend. What do you see as an appropriate yield?","Jeff Gennette ","Why don't we start with the -- what we thought, Matt, on the third quarter to fourth quarter was really just to be prudent on what our current trends in third quarter looks like. And so when you look at that and take that into the fourth quarter, and then layer in the pieces that we know are incremental to what we had in the third quarter. So again, cycling through the things that Paula talked about in her comments about what happened to us in West Virginia last year and the warehouse fire, as well as the change that we made to the promotional events, we know those are additive.","We also have the benefit of the higher penetration of the dot com business going into the fourth quarter. So when you layer those known opportunities that we have on top of the third quarter trend, you get to the proven range that we are now directing on fourth quarter.","Paula Price ","So Matt, with respect to dividends. I always like to put that in the context of our capital allocation framework. And just began to remind, that really hasn't changed. And we start with investing in our business. And then the second priority is making sure that we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet. And then third is continuing to pay an appropriate dividend -- cash dividend to our shareholders. And then finally, the fourth priority would be to resume the buyback program.","So specifically to your question around dividends, our board approves our dividends quarterly. We review that with them. And we don't have plans near-term to change our dividend, but we continue to evaluated it in the context of our capital allocation as well as our strategic plans more broadly. And so we're well aware that with the drop in our share price, our dividend yield is now outsized. But having said that, dividend yield is but one metric that we think about when we're thinking about our dividends and our dividend policy, and it's not one that we wholly control.","And so when we think about what is appropriate, again we evaluate that in the context of our capital allocation framework and then our broader strategic plans.","Operator","Thank you. And we can move to our next question. It comes from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell ","When it comes to tourism, and that being softer, could you give any color on what kind of impact you saw from the softer tourism on a year-over-year basis? And maybe just juxtapose that against I believe you mentioned that Bloomingdales, actually maybe had its best quarter of the year. And then when it comes to the Growth investment model as well as Backstage, what is ultimately the percent of the store base, you believe those formats can be in? Thank you.","Paula Price ","Hi, Paul. I'll start with the first part of your question. So tourism was down 6.3% in the third quarter. And that was actually slightly better than we expected when we exited the second quarter, but it is still quite negative on an easy compare versus last year when tourism was down 4%. That being said, we're acutely focused on our holiday 2019, as we've heard Jeff and Hal talk about, and their ability to execute at a high level for all of our customers. And so when we think about it, we'll continue to use somewhere between 6% and 9% down as a run rate for the remainder of the fall season.","In terms of Bloomingdales, in the third quarter, it was impacted differently versus Macy's. Bloomingdales was down low single digits. So around 2.9%, which represented a significant improvement from the second quarter.","Jeff Gennette ","And then, Paul, we just set up the Backstage conversation. So we're obviously very optimistic about what we have been able to accomplish in Backstage since we opened in a freestanding format back in 2015 and have now brought it into Macy's stores and was now over 200 locations. So to answer your question, I don't think we see the limit yet in Backstage. We see Backstage could play in every single one of our Macy's mall footprints. And we're looking very carefully at freestanding as well. And I'll let Hal to give a little more detail about what we're learning about Backstage and what boosts our confidence.","Hal Lawton ","Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff said, we are very excited about the opportunity and the impact that it's already having on off-price at Macy's. This year, we opened up 50 stores in a store locations. That puts our total at 215 stores in a store locations, a significant growth over what we were two years ago, as Jeff mentioned. We have plans to open many more in the future. We also, this year, as we talked about on previous calls, opened up an 800,000 square foot distribution center in Columbus, Ohio. And I'd just say more broadly, we're now at scale in off-price with our Backstage business at Macy's.","And our -- as I mentioned earlier, our Backstage locations continue to perform very well in the quarter, ones that were opened up over a year, were up mid-single digits, and we continue to see improvement in not only our sales, but also our margin and turns that are associated with the business. Our customers really enjoy shopping Backstage. For example, our Net Promoter Scores in the business are very strong and well above a number of the other businesses inside of a Macy's store.","Jeff mentioned our freestanding Backstages. We opened a number of these in 2015. Those also remain quite strong with strong positive comps. Just stepping back and talk -- as we look at Q4 with our Backstage business, we are locked and loaded. We have some amazing holiday deals in our Backstage businesses, including things like Family P.J., slippers, wade boots, the access to inventory has been strong. We have great brands in our Backstage business, and we feel really good about that business as we head into Q4. And just in summary, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of runway for off-price at Macy's, and we're very bullish about the future of our Backstage business.","Jeff Gennette ","And Paul, just to add, we also have a lot of runway at Bloomingdales and Bloomingdales outlets, so we definitely found the right formula there. You see us adding stores there, and we're very satisfied with the results.","Paul Trussell ","Just one follow-up. And I know you're going to discuss this much more in February, but you did mention in the presentation that you saw some early positive results on the productivity program. Anything you could elaborate on in that regard?","Paula Price ","So what I would say there, Paul, is we have been very much hard at work on our productivity initiative. And what we are seeing is that the organization has taken both a cultural and a mental shift when we think about cost savings. So more -- we're looking at it more as ways to positively change the way we work, how we move our product and so forth.","And so as I said, in September, productivity savings -- we get productivity savings, and that's what we're seeing, which is an opportunity to really accelerate those savings versus the road map that we laid out at the conference in September. And then just to remind, we said that we would deliver $400 million to $550 million of savings on top of the $100 million to $200 million of savings that we do normally in sort of as part of our normal DNA. So that will impact gross margin. It will impact SG&A and working capital. And again, we see opportunities to accelerate that, and we look forward to describing that in more detail at the conference.","Operator","Thank you. We can now move to our next question. It comes from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson ","Paula, you talked about the free cash flow year-to-date not being indicative of what you expect for the full year. Can you walk us through some of the puts and takes there? And then just maybe share your expectations for what that free cash flow number should look like this year?","Paula Price ","Yes. Lorraine, as you know, we don't typically guide our free cash flow, but we expect it to be commensurate with the way we deliver EBITDA and so I'm just saying that it was a function of the timing of the payables that we saw in the quarter.","Lorraine Hutchinson ","And then just a follow-up on the gross margin this quarter, you mentioned 40 basis points of delivery headwinds. Is that the ongoing expectation? Or was that maybe a little lower because of some of the problems that you have in the e-commerce business?","Paula Price ","I would say Lorraine that the sales growth rate of our digital business slowed in the quarter. And so, commensurate with that, lower-than-expected growth, we had a lower-than-expected headwind from delivery expense associated with our digital business and loyalty program. So I would just look at it in terms of that.","Lorraine Hutchinson ","Okay. And then, is the fourth quarter expectation for gross margin, can you just share a little bit of detail behind that?","Paula Price ","Sure. I would just back up a little bit and say that we're pleased with our gross margin performance in the third quarter and how we navigated the environment from a margin perspective, and which resulted in significantly improved gross margin compression in the third quarter, as you saw -- down 30 basis points versus down 160 basis points in the second quarter, and 120 basis points through the spring, albeit on lower sales. And so our goal is to always to be able to balance sales and gross margin and profit performance similar to or better than the way we did in 2018 as we move forward.","Where we also are beginning to see some productivity come through, we expect that to come through even more so in 2020 and beyond. But in terms of our gross margin, we guided it to be down moderately on the full year, which would imply that in the fourth quarter, it would also be down moderately, as well. But not near the compressions that we saw in the spring.","Jeff Gennette ","Lorraine, just to give a little more color on that, I think there's -- when you're a fashion retailer, promotional retailer like Macy's, there's two things that we look at with respect to gross margin. The first one is that, we always want to be at the right stock to sales ratio because we're always flushing out the older fashions, we're bringing in the new. And then the second piece is that planning your promotions. And so I think one of the benefits that you saw in the third quarter for us was that, we didn't change some of our competitors' promotions, and we really held the line in those categories that frankly we're not perishable, that we're not fashion, that we're replenished based on sell-through.","When we look at the fourth quarter, we're locked and loaded, every single promotion has been planned, every special has been planned with our private brands, our market brands. So we have flexibility to respond to what is going on in the competitive environment, because our stocks are now in line, our stock to sales ratios are at the right balance. We recognize the importance of the gross margin opportunity that we have, and we are well positioned in the third quarter going into the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And then we now move to our next question. It comes from Alex Walvis of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Walvis ","My first question is on the inventory. Can you talk a little bit about the composition of inventory and the level of comfort that as we go into the fourth quarter and the holiday season with fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, is that the right level?","Hal Lawton ","We feel really good about our inventory position going into the holiday season, as Jeff just mentioned a minute ago. And then specifically on the inventory, we feel like we have a really strong gifting assortment, many of them exclusive. We've got excellent and strong values out there. As we've said several times on the call today, we work hard all year to put together a fantastic holiday set up for our customers.","As you've heard from others, it's a highly promotional retail environment. In Q3, we were able to take a much more balanced approach to sales and profitability, resulted in an improved gross margin rate compression, as Paula covered earlier. We were very deliberate on where and when we took promotional markdowns in Q3, and we'll take that same strategy into Q4. And the benefit is that we've been planning for Q4 all year. And we're going in with a very good inventory position.","And as we've said previously, we expect for comp inventory -- we said previously that we expect the comp inventory to be up entering the fourth quarter. And actually we ended with comp inventory flat at the end of Q3 here, so slightly better. And we've also said we expect inventory to be down at the end of the Q4. And our guidance takes all that into account, and that's still very much our guidance.","Alex Walvis ","One question on the home category. I think you mentioned that housewares and furniture underperformed in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? It seems like it's a pretty competitive category at the moment. So how is the business performing? And what's the plan going forward there?","Jeff Gennette ","So Alex, as you've heard very highly promotional environment in the quarter. And in particular, when you look at the home categories, housewares, in particular, so there was a lot of pricing that was going on of extra promotions, more affiliate spending. And we've made the decision basically to hold with our existing promotional cycle and not compete there. It did cost us some sales, but it also resulted in much less margin compression in the quarter overall.","So while that was a decline in the quarter, we are going to be very competitive as we go into the fourth quarter. We planned for that. But I think just as an aggregate, where do we need to be promotional and where don't we when we're responding to the competitive cycle. And again, we -- what I just mentioned earlier, we want to make sure that when you're in fashion categories, that are perishable, take your licks, go where you have to be, be at the right inventory level as you enter the new season. But in areas that are replenishable, many of the home areas are replenishable. These are evergreen products that continue from season to season. You're going to see us demonstrate more balance in the future as we -- you saw us demonstrate in the third quarter.","Alex Walvis ","And then, Jeff, maybe one more for me. You talked previously about the ability to take price in the event of tariffs. Can you talk a little bit about pricing on those categories that have seen tariffs so far? Any kind of updated thinking on how price might be used as a lever in the event that we see incremental tariffs?","Jeff Gennette ","Yes. So just to kind of ducktail on what Hal talked about. So if you look at where we put value in the products. And we have some opportunity, particularly in our fashion goods and our apparel goods and our exclusive products, to be able to put more make into these products, we can get a higher retail. That can absorb if there's a tariff impact.","As Paula mentioned in her opening comments, we worked very closely with our private brand and our national partners on mitigating costs. We had, obviously, a strong position in the market. And we were able to mitigate -- we had talked at the end of the third quarter or at the end of the second quarter call that we thought it could be up to $0.07 of overall EBIT impact. And for the full year, we were able to mitigate virtually all of that in the second -- in the third quarter, and Alex we're anticipating for the balance of the fourth quarter.","So right now, we're hard at work with all of our partners on the 2020 assortments. And where we will raise retails, it's because we're putting more making these products. We're having better fashion that the customer will accept that. As Hal mentioned earlier, like the INC brand, seeing how that's performing in the fourth quarter and higher average unit retail with more make, that gives us some confidence that our strategies will work. But in general, if the content is the same as the previous year, I don't believe customers will take a price increase with it. We're working with our manufacturing partners very carefully on that. And so far, we've been able to mitigate all those increases.","Operator","Thank you. We will now move to our next question, comes from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kimberly Greenberger ","I wanted to just follow-up on the discussion on your stores, in particular your neighborhood stores. I'm wondering why not close more stores, particularly in light of the underperformance or continued underperformance in C and D type malls? And then I wanted to just follow-up, if I could, Jeff, on the improvements that you've made to the e-commerce site. Could you just talk about the improvements you feel like you made that will matter to consumers here in the third quarter? Did e-commerce sales actually grow in third quarter? And then if you have any thoughts on one-day delivery, that would be super helpful. Thanks.","Jeff Gennette ","Okay. We'll take the three-part question in two-part lines. So the first one, I'm going to turn it over to Hal, to talk about the e-commerce enhancements on the site as well as an update on same-day and delivery in general. Let me just talk about the lower tier malls.","So as Hal mentioned in his comments, I mean, we are committed to ending the year with a plan for all of our neighborhood stores. They are important in the neighborhoods that they serve. They have a very developed fulfillment business that goes out of it. Customers are going in there for basics. We are very mindful of every one of our store footprints, about how it influences our digital business and the entire omni-channel ecosystem. So we are going to be very thoughtful about -- of how we deal with that and how we address that. And as mentioned, we will be talking to everybody about that at our February 5 Investor Day, about how we're going to go forward with that.","And Hal, why don't you talk take-on about e-commerce enhancements?","Hal Lawton ","Yes. Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff and Paula referenced earlier, we did experience a slowdown in our digital business, but it absolutely did grow in the quarter. We just did not achieve our customary double-digit growth. And some of the trends that Jeff mentioned, not only did they affect our brick-and-mortar business, but they also affected our line business, including weather and some of the promotional intensities we talked about earlier, particularly in the home category.","We continue to see very strong traffic to the site. But we really will resolve the softness with a conversion. And again, that was primarily due to some of the weather and the promotional intensity that we saw. But it was, in part, as Paula mentioned, due to some of the enhancements that we made for holiday. We released a number of enhancements in advance of holiday that have really had a big customer improvement experience, but it took us some time to work through these.","Now Paula gave you a strong list of these earlier. Some of them have included same-day delivery, which really increases our customers' fulfillment options. We just made several updates in our checkout process, including the addition of a save for later function, which improves convenience in checkout. And we also made a number of taxonomy updates that make the site easier to navigate and improve the customer shopping journey.","As we look ahead, the team has completed its work. The sites upgraded. The customers are already enjoying this, and our conversion rates are back in line with normal trends.","As we talk about same-day delivery, I'll just provide a little bit more color there. We offer same-day delivery to our customers in 33 markets. This covers about 40% of U.S. households and about 60% of our online volume. Just a brief -- if we step back, customers really expect a variety of fulfillment options. Sometimes they want things fast, sometimes they want things cheap, sometimes they want things super accurate. And that means we need to be offering our customers same-day delivery.","In Q3, we updated our -- as I've mentioned, all of our digital properties to make it easier for customers to identify, navigate and select items that were available for same-day delivery.","Additionally, in the month of October, we offered a limited time test for free same-day delivery for orders above $75. Our current price for same-day delivery in our typical price is $10. We were one of the first retailers to offer kind of this free same-day delivery over $75. The customers responded well to the test. But also just more broadly, the customers really responded well to same-day delivery. We're pleased that we've been able to make it more prominent to our customers. As I mentioned, they're adapting to it quickly. We're more excited about having it available for holiday as -- particularly as we get closer to the end of holiday.","Operator","Thank you. And we can now move to our next question. It comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom ","Just a few questions for me. Just, one, just wondering if you could speak to the cadence throughout the quarter and potentially speak to how November started off? Number two, just on the lower tier malls. I think it's the first time you've called that out. I'm wondering if you could quantify what you think that drag was.","And then third, and probably most importantly, you guys are pretty upbeat here. But your comp guide for the year, which implies about a down 2.5% comp in the quarter, looks pretty conservative on the stack. So given that you're cycling that 70 basis points of one-time items from last year, can you just frame out for us your thought process and where there could be some potential upside here in the fourth quarter. Thanks.","Jeff Gennette ","Paula, do you want to?","Paula Price ","Yes, yes. So I'll start with the first question or a few questions here. The first one on cadence. I would say our cadence in the quarter, was fairly consistent, August through October. And then -- since I'm speaking and I'm sure that either Jeff or Hal will come on to the malls, let me just take the Q4 guide. Certainly, Chuck, we're confident as we've been saying in our holiday strategies. But as we look at our year-to-date performance and the Q3 trends, which Jeff discussed in his remarks, we have to recognize that our strategies are being built on a weaker baseline and the trends are weaker. And so we're building on top of those. And also, just sort of, as Jeff mentioned, the sales in the lower tier malls slowed. We saw digital growth moderate. Certainly lots of strategies in place that should provide the opportunity there to reaccelerate. But we also want to be mindful of the uncertainty in the environment, the macro uncertainties. The consumer is certainly solid, but we want to be prudent in the sense of our full range of our guide.","Jeff Gennette ","And then, Chuck, to your question, it was about a 30 basis point drag to our overall comp, when you look at the lower tier malls versus what we had in the first half of the 2019 year.","Chuck Grom ","And then just a quick follow-up for Paula. When you take a step back and look at the overall operating margin structure, along with your targeted $400 million to $500 million of the annual savings, do you view these as offsets to future investments and, I guess, promotional actions? Or do you think that operating margins can begin to expand in 2020, assuming more of a stable top line backdrop? Thanks.","Paula Price ","Yes. I mean, the way I would think about our productivity savings is that we're looking at them as ways to mitigate headwinds, fund our investments and improve our profitability in time, so that -- we're looking for them to do all of those things. And again, we do see opportunity to accelerate those savings, and we're looking forward to telling you about that in more detail on Investor Day in February.","Operator","Thank you. We can now move to our next question, comes from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez ","Curious, how much Vendor Direct helps the comps this quarter, and what your expectations are for how that business can help you in 4Q? And also curious as the number of Vendor Direct SKUs grows, is there an opportunity to take inventory lower to make the business less capital intensive?","Hal Lawton ","I'll start with just customers have a really high bar for retail experience. And that's not only in our brick-and-mortar stores, but across digital and also the way they cross-shop in an omni way across that. And that means we need to have a compelling digital property that's easy to shop, offers fulfillment options, appeal to both, as we talked about earlier, the time and the cost-sensitive customer.","That also means we have to have a great product assortment on our site. We want to have all the best and we want to have all the rest on our site. And what we want to do is help curate our customers' selection, but also provide great personalization to allow them to quickly find the items they're looking for.","As you mentioned, the advantage of Vendor Direct is, it allows us to have a vastly expanded assortment without holding the inventory. It's a real win for us and for our customers. In the quarter, Vendor Direct made up about 13% of our digital business. As Paula mentioned, we added over nearly 1,000 vendors and over 1 million -- we'll be adding over 1 million SKUs to the site this year. And year-to-date, we have exceeded those goals in time for holiday.","When we look at our competitive set, we know that our peers have a much larger ratio of online SKUs to in-store SKUs. And that continues to make us feel like we have a meaningful opportunity to expand our Vendor Direct program, and we see our customers engaging with it. And we think our Vendor Direct program only has upside. It adds sales and profit, increases customer satisfaction, drives traffic to the site.","Just to your kind of part B of the question, what I would just say is, we're constantly looking at our assortment. We're looking at the assortment we have in our stores. We're making sure we've got it in the right stores, seasonally relevant, location relevant. We're also looking at the inventory that we have in our distribution centers and how that services online, and we're very focused on inventory productivity.","And where we could find ways to take inventory out of our distribution centers and ask our vendors to fulfill that, we are doing that. And where we find opportunity, sometimes when we have a Vendor Direct item that's selling really well, and it's more beneficial to bring it in-house, we\u2019re doing that as well. So it's something we're constantly looking at. It's something we're constantly assessing. And this is a muscle we have well developed.","Jeff Gennette ","And Paul, just on February 5, you will hear more detail about the transformation of our supply chain that Hal has given you some texture on.","Operator","Thank you. We now move to our next question, comes from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad ","A couple of clarifications. I think most of my questions have been asked. You mentioned a couple of times that the colder weather area of the store isn't doing as well. Obviously, there's been a turn of the -- turn in the weather. Is that one of the factors that gives you confidence in the fourth quarter and gives you confidence in where you're going to end the year in inventory?","I also wanted to kind of get a bit better understanding with the digital slowdown in the quarter, worse than the bricks-and-mortar side of the business? Or do they both kind of perform lockstep?","And then my third question, last question is on the Neighborhood stores in those local markets, those second tier and third tier, is there an opportunity to really run those businesses, those locations with a lot less inventory? Maybe a local assortment and kind of all is in stock basics? Is there a chance to kind of think about inventory in those markets differently than you do in the 150 in the top markets where they have the full assortment stores and their destinations? Thanks.","Jeff Gennette ","So let me take on the -- the first one on this, Omar. So on the cold weather, we definitely did get a jolt of customers and business based on the cold snap that happened in the country, in the really, the first two weeks of November. So as we mentioned, it had a material effect on -- not just on the categories of cold weather, but also on the appended sales both online and in stores, what we're up against from the third quarter of last year. We saw a nice piece of that coming back to us right now in the first two weeks of November.","With respect to Mcom and bricks and mortar, the degradation in trend was about the same relative going from the second quarter to the third quarter for the reasons that we quoted. And to the conversation about the third -- the tiered stores, we'll come back to you in February with what our plan is, exactly how we're looking at those buildings. It's also pursuant to your question about inventory levels, profitability and sustainability of those locations.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move to our next question, comes from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti ","A lot of our questions have been answered as well. But could you just speak to where -- maybe where you're seeing some of the incremental areas of real estate -- real estate monetization recently? I think as we've talked to you guys over the last few years. I think that your thinking was that, that those gains would slow a little bit going forward. You just stepped it up a little bit today. Do you view that more as a pull forward from something you were thinking about next year or have you found something incremental in the strategy? I know you guys have been working hard on that strategy for a few years.","Paula Price ","Yes. Hi, there. So I would say that in terms of our asset sale gains, our real estate team, they keep abreast of the market, and they help us monetize the assets when the real estate value surpasses the retail value. And so that's an ongoing process. And an ongoing assessment of our store fleet. And due to this work, we've been able to see some acceleration in asset sales this year. And so we've raised our guidance to $150 million from $100 million in asset sale gains. But I would say that we still think a normal range of between $80 million to $100 million. And this is an active process. So from time to time, you will see an acceleration such as this.","Michael Binetti ","Okay. And then if I could just ask, if we try to look at the full ecosystem a little bit here of some of the brands that have bigger businesses with you, many of them have guided fairly conservatively for fourth quarter. But I do want to ask you, do you feel like you got -- maybe you could help us think about how much support you got from the vendors to help clear through some of the inventory that you commented in the third quarter as we think about the full P&L you just presented. And do you think the vendors stand ready to offer that same amount of support if fourth quarter comes in below or do you think that, that -- how are you thinking about the vendor allowances to help get through the holiday? Thanks.","Jeff Gennette ","So Michael, what I'd say in the first three quarters of the year, our support from vendors is very similar to what it has been in previous years. I think the most important thing we could say on the subject is how our vendors and our -- all of our merchants work hand-in-hand on opportunities for customer demand. And we feel particularly good about the holiday timeframe and all the gift assortments that the teams have been hard at work at over the past nine months getting ready. So a lot of that is exclusive content. We know that it is customer wanted. We've been either testing price points or content. We feel very aligned with our vendor partners in accomplishing our goals together.","The other thing I'd say is that depending on sell-through, there's more room in sales based on the stocks that we have, just based on getting better sell-throughs. So we're ready. We're done the updates of it. These have got to be, that's all comprehended in our guidance of fourth quarter margin. So we're in good shape with respect to where we are right now with our brands.","Michael Binetti ","Okay. And again, Paula, could I just ask one technical one. You mentioned the operational blip on the digital site, and you said that was improved to get ready for the holiday experience. Was that -- just on timing of that, did that affect -- just so that we're calibrated correctly, did that affect anything in early November at all? Or was that completely done before the end of the third quarter and back up and running as you start the fourth quarter? Just to help us calibrate how you guys are looking at it. Thanks a lot.","Paula Price ","Yes. I would say that we have put the fixes in place and that the customer is seeing an improved experience at this moment.","Operator","Thank you. And then we'll now move to our next question. This comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen ","Hi, thank you. Regarding a modeling question, how are the merchandise margins this quarter? And what's your outlook for fourth quarter? Another question we had is just managing SG&A and long-term investments needed versus the short-term and your thoughts on managing margins versus investing in the business and what then needs to happen.","And then finally, on women's. I'm thinking about the women's category, it's been a challenged category across the industry. What are your thoughts on what needs to happen to women's and also attracting a younger customer as well?","Paula Price ","So I would start with gross margins. So what we -- when we look at our compression in the third quarter, which was down 30 basis points, I would describe that as due to the delivery headwinds that we expected to see. And in terms of SG&A, I would think about that in terms of our productivity program impacting that as we move forward. And so you'll hear more about that as we give you details of the -- further details of the program on Investor Day.","Jeff Gennette ","And then, Oliver, let me take the ready-to-wear question. So as Hal mentioned, this one has been -- we've been hard at work at this, not only with the new team and new structure, but really addressing our existing customer base as well as a new customer that we are hotly pursuing. And so the first thing I'd say is that with respect to brands, really making sure that all of our key brands are under construction. And so those that had issues with sell-through, we really went back and made sure that we had the DNA right, we have the right cost structure, the classification mix. And what Hal was describing in terms of some of the impacts we're seeing in early sell-throughs on what they were able to effect, which was really fourth quarter, we're encouraged by some of what we're seeing.","We have this opportunity with the under 40 customers. So we've been looking at that in terms of content, about do you do it by end use, do you mix brands? How do you merchandise it? How do you market it? Where do we stand up in terms of telling the customer about it? So we've been experimenting. We've got a number of stores right now that we're playing with different merchandise models, different architecture of labels and brands that are coming into that. We're encouraged by some of what we're seeing.","We've obviously done a lot of focus groups with respect to the under 40 customer and we're clear about what we -- she needs to see from us in order to give us more for her allegiance. She's already shopping with us in categories like fragrance and handbags and many categories of women's shoes. What do we need to do to be more relevant in women's ready-to-wear?","So things like what we did with My List at Bloomingdales, things that we're doing with like thredUP, things that we're doing with what I've described in terms of new brands and new ways of merchandising and marketing them. That's all of where we're going for this under 40 customer. And we know that we need to accelerate our efforts, and you will hear more of that from us at the Investor Day in February.","Oliver Chen ","Okay. And being promotionally prepared for fourth quarter, is the assumption that merchandise margins are going to be lower? And what about, Paula, hold and flow is a very good strategy to drive speed and also test read and react? How are you thinking about hold and flow across the range of your stores, lower productivity versus higher productivity?","Paula Price ","So again, with respect to gross margin in the fourth quarter, we're expecting to see some compression that is implied in our full year guidance, but compression will be a little bit more compression than we saw in the third quarter, but not to the extent that we saw in the spring season as we continue to take a more balanced approach.","And then hold and flow, we begin -- we have begun seeing some of the benefits of it. We expect to see more and more of it as we move through the year, but certainly as we get to 2020. So we expect that to positively impact our margin as we continue to flow more and more product through the process.","Jeff Gennette ","And just Oliver, what we mentioned earlier about the transformation of the supply chain, expect a thorough review of that in February.","Oliver Chen ","Okay. In the transformations, do you think you need to materially step your margins and revenue base down just to give yourself more breathing room to adapt to this environment?","Paula Price ","Well, that is sort of the idea of the transformation program. We have sales growth initiatives, we have productivity initiatives, and the idea is in combination to grow our revenue and our profit over time. And again, we'll talk about that in great detail on Investor Day.","Operator","Thank you. We can now move to our next question. This comes from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul ","Just a question on the gross margin. Where are you on the markdown optimization initiatives that you've talked about? And then the second question that I have is, can you just give us an update on some of your re-commerce initiatives that you talked about, I think, in the most recent call? Thanks.","Paula Price ","So I would just say that with respect to our productivity initiatives, namely hold and flow and markdown optimization, again, we're beginning to see some of the benefits of those in 2019, but we expect to see the more -- the fullness of those in 2020. And again, we'll outline that for you on Investor Day.","Hal Lawton ","And then Bob, on re-commerce, so thredUP is -- it's now positioned in our stores. It's performing well. We're learning every day about how the second-hand market affects the balance of our assortments where it is adjacent to. We're very careful to make sure, what does it cannibalize? How is the customer responding to? Is it a new customer? So we're going through all that data right now. What I would tell you is that we're beating our plan sizably with respect to thredUP. Very pleased so far about how it's performing, but we want to look at kind of lifetime value of this with customers that are shopping around it. So stay tuned.","Bob Drbul ","And can you update us on the rental initiatives that you have, I think with Bloomingdales and the opportunities with Macy's?","Jeff Gennette ","Yes, sure. So let me take you through that. So that's what we call My List. So that has launched. We're in our first kind of six weeks of it. And it's hitting all the kind of the customer benchmarks that we expected. And then to just the previous question, is it resonating with the younger customer? Millennials make up approximately half of the customers that are enjoying My List. It's also helping us reach customers that are out of kind of the typical geographic reach of where a Bloomingdales is. Dresses is the top classification. But in Q4, we launched, within My List, a gifting program that allows customers to give subscriptions to new members digitally and in select pilot locations. So like thredUP, My List is off to a great start.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey ","Can you talk a little bit more about some of the destination businesses that one called out and how their performance was? Whether it was beauty, women's shoes, anything that we're seeing there. And then also on the e-commerce portion of the business, is it back up and running now? What issues needed to be addressed? And what do we see digitally this quarter versus last quarter? Whether it was category sell-through or also frequency? Thank you.","Hal Lawton ","Hi. This is Hal. As I mentioned earlier, we -- with all the pressures we saw in the quarter, our destination businesses did also experience a slowdown versus Q2, but they did perform better than the balance of the business. As we mentioned a couple of times, we saw some bright spots in mattresses, fragrances, dresses, fine jewelry, men's, etc. I think what I'd just say about our destination businesses is they're in great shape for the holiday. I'd highlight things like our gifts under strategy and beauty, our holiday party dress lineup, our elevated jewelry assortment, things like casual sweaters, stockings, uppers.","Our destination businesses account for 40% of our sales. We've got a top there market share in these-they're strong profit contribution. And we're very focused on making sure that these continue to be destination businesses for Macy's customers.","As it relates to online, we've talked about that a few times. But I guess, I'd just say, we implemented a number of releases and enhancements in Q3. We've worked through those. The site is upgraded. Our customers are already enjoying these enhancements. We're seeing good performance out of it. Our conversion rates are back in line, and we're ready for the holiday season.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Priya Ohri-Gupta ","Paula, I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit to the level of confidence you have that you guys will be within your leverage target at year end, just given the third quarter performance, figure just inside of that at the end of third quarter. And sort of how we should expect that to progress going forward relative to some of the asset sale gains that you expect? Thank you.","Paula Price ","Hi, Priya. So as I said in my earlier remarks, we plan to use excess cash in 2019 to further reduce our debt. And just to remind, we've been paying down debt, $3 billion over the past trailing four years, and we continue to move closer to our leverage targets. And again, I just would put that in the context of our capital allocation framework, which I outlined earlier, investing in the business. And second is certainly continuing to maintain a healthy balance sheet. So I would think about it in that way.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll now move to David Swartz of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","David Swartz ","Yes. Can you tell us how the loyalty program at Bluemercury may affect sales? And also if the management chain -- change at Bluemercury affects the growth prospects or strategy of the company. Thanks.","Jeff Gennette ","So the BlueRewards loyalty program that just launched within the quarter is off to a great start. And so that is -- we've already got about 30% of the Bluemercury customers have signed on for that. So excited about that. It's hitting our targets. We expect that to continue to go further.","We had some management changes. So Barry Beck was one of the original founders. He is no longer with the company. He's gone on to kind of an entrepreneurial venture. We're very happy for him. And then Marla Beck is staying on with us until we have the appropriate transition strategy. We are currently actively looking for a Chief Executive Officer, but she's got a strong team beneath her that is deeply committed to the Bluemercury brand. I do not expect any hiccup with this transition.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Bernard Sosnick of Madison Global Partners. Please go ahead.","Bernard Sosnick ","I'm hoping that you can help me summarize some of the thoughts regarding the fourth quarter guidance, which I take away from your comment was based on the trending of the third quarter sales. However, in the third quarter, mentioned four impacts, including late cold weather, and you already said, there's been a jolt in sales from cold weather sales. And that, to me, suggests improved gross margin prospects on cold weather merchandise due to a reduction later in the season for markdowns. You also cited the difficulty with improvement in -- with e-commerce in the third quarter and we've heard that things have been reconciled. And we know that e-commerce is comparing against difficulties last year.","And also with regard to international tourism there's a headwind because of the strong U.S. dollar, but international tourism has been down for so many years now that a low single-digit decrease in international tourism is de minimis with regard to the overall impact on sales. So it's difficult for me to reconcile the very optimistic commentaries that you made about your positioning for the holiday season and the guidance, taking into consideration that you want to be conservative. Could you flesh that out a little bit?","Jeff Gennette ","So what I'd say on that, Bernie, is that we are being appropriately conservative. And what I would say is that there's many things that are outside our control; there's weather, there's macros. We want to make sure that when you look at where we went from third quarter into the fourth quarter, when you look at our annual guidance, it implies a fourth quarter range of being down [12] to down [29]. Remember, we were down [35] in the third quarter. So there's certainly some things that you are quantifying that we have confidence about.","We want to make sure that we have a fourth quarter strategy that we're very confident in, that we've been planning for. The confidence that you hear is everything that the Macy's and Bloomingdales can control on our side. But the macro conditions, anything that we can't control, we believe we have guidance that can -- that fits within all of those dynamics.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further question at this time. So I'd like to hand the call back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Gennette ","Thank you, everybody. Happy holidays, watch the parade.","Paula Price ","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for your participation.

And welcome to the Macy\u2019s, Inc. conference call scheduled to discuss our third quarter earnings and outlook for the remainder of the year. Joining us on the call today are Jeff Gennette, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paula Price, Chief Financial Officer.","Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited.

We look forward to taking your questions after our prepared remarks.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Gennette","So, thank you, Monica. So, good morning, everybody and thanks for joining the call. As you saw in our press release this morning, Macy\u2019s delivered a strong third quarter with comparable sales up 3.3% on an owned plus licensed basis and earnings of $0.27 per share. We saw strong results across the Macy\u2019s Inc. business with Macy\u2019s, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury, all performing well in the quarter which contributed to our solid topline growth.","Based on the third quarter results, we are raising the annual earnings guidance by $0.15 and adjusting the range of sales guidance. Paula will give you more details on the quarter and our remarks -- and our outlook in her remarks.","So Macy\u2019s recipe for success is e-commerce, healthy stores and a great mobile experience that ties it all together. It is our competitive moat. Our e-commerce business just completed another consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, driven by continued improvement to our online offering and experience.","We invested early in mobile and our mobile app just keeps getting better. We view the Macy\u2019s app as our customer\u2019s indispensable shopping companion and increasingly it\u2019s becoming a channel for transactions as well. This year we will hit $1 billion in mobile sales.","The growth of our digital business goes hand-in-hand with the growth of our brick-and-mortar business. We have seen the trend improvement in our stores beginning a year ago and we have seen steady quarter-to-quarter progress throughout the year.","This is important, because healthy brick-and-mortar -- healthy brick-and-mortar business is part of our strategy to build lifetime value with our existing customers and to bring new customers into the brand. I am going to give you a brief update on our strategic initiatives and then Paula will take you through the details of the quarter and then we are going to open up the line for your questions.","So as we noted on our last call, the third quarter was an important time for us as we were laying the groundwork for our strategic initiatives. That work is complete and we are fully prepared for the critical holiday season ahead.","As you know, we have five strategic initiatives in 2018 and let me touch on each of them. Loyalty, we recently marked the one year anniversary of our new loyalty program and I am pleased to say that the program is delivering the results we anticipated.","Our platinum customers who are our best customers are spending more with us and shopping more frequently. They like the simplicity and value of the new program. We had a great response to the exclusive experiences that we have been able to offer the platinum card holders.","Because we have a well-developed entertainment and events business, Macy\u2019s has a unique portfolio of experiences to pull from and to offer our platinum card holders. This includes exclusive access to our iconic events like the upcoming Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, like concerts, fashion shows, cooking classes to name a few.","While the first priority of our loyalty program is to take care of our existing best customers, we have now expanded the program with a new gender neutral tier, which we launched earlier this year. We call this the Bronze Program and the Bronze Program is showing strong early results and we have added nearly 2 million new members to the loyalty program. So overall, we are very pleased with the loyalty program. It\u2019s bringing new customers into the brand and increasing the lifetime value of our best customers.","Number two initiative, Backstage, we have added 121 Backstage locations this year including nearly 60 in the third quarter. I am proud of the work the team has done to deliver this expansion. It is a testament to the speed and agility that we have emphasized across the company.","We now have 166 Backstage in-store locations. With this scale we are now dialing up our marketing for Backstage with an emphasis on product that is off-price, on trend and arriving daily.","We expect the additional marketing which launched last month will increase awareness of Backstage and bring new customers into the store. And importantly, we continue to see a lift in sales across the entire store when we add in Backstage.","Third initiative, Vendor Direct, so to understand the role of Vendor Direct, let\u2019s first take a step back to understand how we look at the role of curation. In our stores, we curate for our customer through a highly edited assortment that is localized to a specific market, using our enhanced data and analytics, we are able to efficiently influence assortment down to the store level.","But online the customer curates for herself using search and personalization tools. Vendor Direct allows us to offer our customer a vastly wider assortment online and the self-curation tools direct to her products where she\u2019s shown the most interest.","We have more than doubled our SKUs online since the launch of Vendor Direct in April. This includes an expanded assortment of great national brands that we already carry, as well as the addition of new brands and categories that we know our customer will love.","Number four, Store Pickup. In the third quarter, we completed the expansion of our store pickup options. As a refresher with BOPS or Buy Online Pickup in Store a customer orders online choosing from the merchandise available in the specific store where they can then pick it up within two hours or less.","With BOSS or Buy Online Ship to Store customers have access to merchandise anywhere in the Macy\u2019s system, including Vendor Direct, which is then shipped to their neighborhood store for pickup.","BOSS is very popular with our customers and we are seeing greater than anticipated use. Our customers love having access to the full Macy\u2019s assortment, couple that with the security and convenience of pickup at their neighborhood store and BOSS has been a hit.","To support fulfillment of both BOPS and BOSS orders, we completed the rollout of At Your Service to every store in the fleet. At Your Service centers are located in the high traffic door for quick and convenient pickups.","At Your Service also handles returns, self checkout assistance and a variety of customer service activities. The success of BOPS and BOSS is a great example of how e-commerce, our e-commerce business and our stores business grow together.","Our last other five initiatives is Growth 50. And as we noted in the last call, the third quarter was when much of the construction work was underway, underway for the improvements in the Growth 50 stores, which represent, what we will talk about in a moment our magnet stores.","I am pleased to say that the teams were able to minimize the disruption in these stores and even better, now that the work is complete, our customers have noticed the improvements and are responding well.","The Growth 50 stores are performing ahead of their peer stores and this improved performance gives us confidence to roll this treatment out to another 100 stores in 2019. This investment will help us continue the momentum of our stores business and drive the topline into the future.","And while we put an emphasis on the Growth 50 stores, I do want to note that we have also invested in each of our stores this year, every store in the Macy\u2019s fleet has received improvements including At Your Service centers, Mobile Checkout and elevated and localized merchandising assortment.","To sum it up, we have turned in a strong performance for the third quarter and we entered the fourth quarter fully focused on our customer. The holidays are where Macy\u2019s really shines and I am confident that we have the right strategies, the right merchandise and marketing, and the right experiences to win with today\u2019s consumer.","Several things give me confidence in our ability to deliver the fourth quarter, consumer confidence and spending remains strong. It\u2019s a great backdrop. Number two, our e-commerce business is humming and the dotcom penetration naturally increases in the fourth quarter. Three, our stores are in good shape for the holiday and have momentum. Four, our strategic initiatives are up and running and we will feel their full weight in the quarter. And lastly, our colleagues across the business are engaged, aligned and growing in the same direction.","And with that, I am going to turn it over to Paula.","Paula Price","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter we delivered $5.4 billion of sales, an increase of 3.3% on an owned plus licensed comparable basis. Overall, we were pleased with our operational and financial performance as sales, earnings and cash flow all exceeded our internal expectations.","Through continued strong execution, the traction and scaling of our key strategic initiatives, and the healthy consumer environment, we extended the positive momentum from of the first half of the year into the third quarter.","We delivered solid performance across all our channels, brands and geographies. Our digital business maintained its steady double-digit growth as we continued to significantly expand our assortment and enhance our personalization capabilities, and as Jeff mentioned, our brick-and-mortar business again demonstrated improved and very encouraging sales trends.","Our channels also benefited from the successful rollout of the BOSS and BOPS fulfillment options. Macy\u2019s, Bloomingdales and Bluemercury all positively contributed to our performance in the quarter and each exceeded our internal expectations, and while we saw solid performance around the country, we delivered our strongest regional performance in the Northeast and North Central, which is primarily in the Midwest.","Turning to families of business, we delivered another strong quarter in men\u2019s and kids, fine jewelry, women\u2019s shoes, fragrances, coats and activewear, offsetting some underperformance in fashion watches and women\u2019s sportswear. We benefited late in the quarter from cold weather.","Total transactions were up 3.8% in the quarter, reflecting strong customer demand, both online and in stores. Average units per transaction were down 3.1% and average unit retail was up 2.6%, driven by more regular priced selling versus a year ago.","We generated net credit card revenues in the quarter of $185 million, up 28% from last year. On the strength of our new loyalty program, the corresponding penetration or usage rate of our proprietary credit cards increased 100 basis points to 48.4%.","Our new loyalty program is not only delivering a more engaged customer as Jeff mentioned but also stimulating higher credit sales and proprietary card balances, which yield higher credit card revenues and enhance our overall operating performance.","We delivered gross margin in the quarter of $2.2 billion. Our gross margin rate of 40.3% of net sales was flat to last year. We achieved significant rate expansion in our merchandise margins through stronger regular priced selling. This merchandise margin rate expansion exceeded our internal expectations and fully offset higher delivery costs related to both our new loyalty program that launched in October of 2017 and our growing e-commerce business.","As planned, we ended the quarter with inventory up 50 basis points on a comparable basis. This is consistent with the expectation we said on our last earnings call as the calendar this year put us one week closer to the holiday season and had a timing impact on our receipt flow. We continue to expect our inventory to be down at the end of the fiscal year.","We recorded $2.3 billion of SG&A expense in the quarter, $67 million higher than last year. On a rate basis our SG&A expense was 41.7%, compared to 41.4% last year. As we have been discussing this is due to investment in our strategic initiatives including Backstage and our path to growth incentive that we use to align all our colleagues around our North Star strategy, as well as to help us compete in a tight labor market.","This will be our third consecutive quarter with the incentives, which is open to all full-time part-time and seasonal colleagues, and in the third quarter about 75% of our colleagues earned the incentive.","Asset sale gains in the quarter were $42 million, $23 million lower than last year. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $407 million, which was 3.8% lower than last year. When excluding asset sale gains as well, EBITDA was up 2% in the quarter, based on stronger sales, the strength of gross margin and higher credit card revenues.","Our interest expense in the quarter was $59 million, compared to $74 million last year, as we accelerated our debt reduction by $744 million over the past 12 months.","Tax expense in the quarter was $12 million or 16.2% of pretax income benefiting from the Federal Tax Reform Act in certain tax settlements. This compares to $10 million or 27% last year.","We delivered adjusted net income of $83 million versus $65 million last year. When excluding asset sale gains as well, we more than doubled our adjusted net income to $52 million, compared to $25 million last year.","Our adjusted EPS was $0.27 in the quarter, compared to $0.21 last year. When excluding asset sale gains as well, adjusted EPS was $0.17 more than double the EPS of $0.08 last year.","Cash flow from operating activities was $429 million year-to-date, $30 million above last year. We invested $127 million more in capital expenditures related to our strategic initiatives and received $91 million less in proceeds from asset sales.","We returned $347 million to our shareholders in the form of cash dividends. We ended the quarter with $736 million in cash, which was above our expectations. We remain committed to using excess cash in 2018 to reduce debt to consistently achieve our target leverage ratios. We continue to believe that having a healthy balance sheet is key to maintaining both flexibility and durability.","Taking our strong third quarter performance into consideration, we are raising the low end of our annual sales guidance. Our new range is 2.3% to 2.5% on a comparable owned plus licensed basis. Our guidance for annual net sales growth is now 0.3% to 0.7%. As a reminder, fiscal 2017 had one extra week of sales.","We are raising our full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.10 to $4.30. We are also raising our guidance for annual net credit card revenue to a range of $740 million to $755 million. We are adjusting our annual effective tax rate slightly downward to 22.75%.","All of our other annual guidance assumptions for gross margin, SG&A, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and asset sale gains, which include the anticipated sales of the former I. Magnin building in the fourth quarter remain the same.","While we are cycling a strong fourth quarter from last year, we are confident in our fourth quarter plan. Our colleagues are aligned and engaged, and poised to deliver the full year -- the full strength of our strategic initiatives over the holiday season.","We have had a few inquires related to our store segmentation strategy that some of you had read about yesterday, so before we open the lines to your questions I\u2019ll ask Jeff to make a few comments.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, Paula. So I wanted to give everybody some color about our store segmentation strategy and it\u2019s really based on the customer insights that we have and a deep understanding of how the customer, what their shopping journey looks like across online and our stores platforms. And we certainly know that our best customers, they shop with us cross channel, cross category and cross stores.","So within the market, strong brick-and-mortar I think everybody knows really amplifies our online sales and conversely when we close stores, our online sales in that market decrease. So increasingly our stores serve as fulfillment centers for shopping that is done online and we see that in the popularity of our pickup options, which I mentioned is part of my BOPS and BOSS update.","So for some context, today over one half of our platinum and gold customers, which are our best customers regularly shop online in at least two or more Macy\u2019s specific stores. So knowing this is very important for us to better understand their behavior when and why did she choose one Macy\u2019s store over the other, what are her expectations and different types of Macy\u2019s stores, and within the specific malls, and this exploration led us to our segmentation strategy.","So we have bucketed our stores into three segments. We call them our flagships, magnet stores and neighborhood stores, and you are going to hear more in more granular detail our segmentation strategy when we lay out our 2019 plans in the New Year. But I did want to take a moment to give you a sense of how we are looking at these three buckets.","So let\u2019s start with flagship stores, and this includes Herald Square, as well as 10 regional flagships and these are some of the best retail properties in America and each of these 11 stores are the number one retail destination in the regional market. They have the best that Macy\u2019s has to offer. It\u2019s really an all senses engagement through fashion service and experience.","Our next bucket is what we call our magnet stores and these are really represented by the stores that we currently have on our Growth 50 group and when you are looking for a Macy\u2019s store or a mall that offers the best of fashion, food and entertainment this is what customers look to for magnet stores. Those are also where they go for magnet malls.","Customers come to magnet stores for expanded selection, including special occasion, dress up for men\u2019s and women\u2019s, fine jewelry and expanded gift assortment, wider selection of home. And in 2018 we launched this Growth 50 of these magnet stores. The investment approach we now believe is scalable formula that as we mentioned earlier will be rolled out to 100 additional stores in 2019.","And the last bucket is our neighborhood stores. These tend to be smaller. These stores are all profitable and each play an important role in how our customer experience is the Macy\u2019s brand. Customers visit their neighborhood store primarily for convenience for fulfillment of online orders, as well as for basic things like skincare replenishment or casual wear.","We are currently testing four different investment models for our neighborhood stores that are aimed at increasing shopping ease and convenience including more self-service options, and in 2019 we will test and iterate until we land on the right formula to scale the neighborhood stores in our fleet.","So to sum up a large percentage of our best customers already shop both their neighborhood store and our magnet store, and there are shopping behavior feedback will inform our store segments -- our store segmentation strategy moving forward.","So, with that, we are going to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks and congrats on your fourth positive comp.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Boss","Jeff, so, I guess, along those lines to map out sustainable positive comps from here. I guess, can you help us rank the initiatives that you have in place to improve store traffic? And then on the e-commerce front can you help break down Vendor Direct and just the magnitude of this opportunity?","Jeff Gennette","Okay. So, Matt, the -- I think when we look at the fourth quarter, we are obviously looking at a very strong environment that we are playing on along with our competitors. So that the consumer confidence is very strong, the spending is strong, I think, the predictions when you look at -- of where consumer spending is going to be during the holiday season it\u2019s a very good backdrop for us.","So if I was ranking to your question, I think, our dotcom business, we expect that to continue to be very strong. Certainly double-digit growth and it\u2019s a much higher penetration during the fourth quarter which really helps our comps in that particular quarter, and I think, one of the headlines on our dotcom business is that we have made significant improvements to the site navigation and content in 2018 and we are ready for the holiday season.","I\u2019d say the second piece of it is that our stores, all stores are improving in their trend from where they have been and it\u2019s sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter and now that all the investments has really touched all stores be it At Your Service or Mobile Checkout and certainly what you have done with the Growth 50 initiatives, we are ready for all the gift traffic that we are going to get in the fourth quarter. So we are bringing a store fleet that has momentum into it with us.","When you look at our strategic initiatives, what I would say is Backstage is a meaningful part of our comp and now that we have got as many stores as we are got, and we have got in as many parts of the country. So the opportunity to now market that in the fourth quarter is going to help comps there.","Vendor Direct having double the amount of SKUs online, broaden menus, new categories for our customers online is certainly going to be a piece of our comp. And then the radiated sales that come from both BOPS and BOSS is you are in the 20% to 25% range is an average on every one of those footsteps. We have a lot more activity going through the stores with the fulfillment options that converts digital demand to store traffic and radiated sales. That\u2019s kind of how I would rank all of the options that we have going in the fourth quarter.","So, I think, that the last thing I\u2019d say it\u2019s just the momentum that the team has and that when you think about everybody aligned against comp store growth, everybody knows that we are now going up against the fourth quarter that we had comp store growth last year, highly motivated to meet the customer, where I think that Macy\u2019s shines best which is the fourth quarter and we are very motivated to put another positive comp on the Board in the fourth quarter this year.","Matthew Boss","That\u2019s great. I am a big fan of the BOSS initiative.","Operator","And next we will go to Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.","Paul Lejuez","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just one housekeeping thing and then a follow-up, if you don\u2019t line up the comps, what was the impact you can share with us from the calendar shift in 3Q and then for 4Q, which weeks will your comp be based on and what weeks will you line those up against versus last year?","And then, I just want to ask a little bit more about the magnet stores and the incremental 100, how should we be thinking about CapEx, the impact of the investment in these new stores into 2019 versus 2018 in terms of overall CapEx levels? Thanks.","Paula Price","Okay, Paul, I\u2019ll start. So it\u2019s important to keep in mind that we not only had a shift in the calendar, but we also shift our promotional events in order to better serve the customers. And as we said earlier in the year, had we reported our comparable sales on the shifted like-for-like week basis, we would have experienced a slight detriment to the comp in the spring and a slight benefit to the comp in the fall. And then your second question we would use the same week that we used at the beginning of the year.","Jeff Gennette","And then Paul to your second question about growth 100, so we finally have a real scalable model and the amount of capital that we are spending. So it depends on what the store is, but just the average is really $2.5 million to $3 million that we have been spending and that is giving us -- and depending on what the store is, that could be an investment and certainly all the customer amenities, but then also putting new businesses like Backstage or big ticket into those buildings.","We have that formula now set. Some of the initiatives are giving us a nice return on investment and some are watching right now, but we know we have the right formula to make the adjustments going into 2019. So expect the 100 stores were spending and that 2.5 million to 3 million range per store in order to get those next 100 right.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. And just to clarify, Paula, did you say the third quarter was helped or hurt by the calendar?","Paula Price","So what we said in the first time is that had we have shifted the comp, we would have had a slight detriment to the comp in the spring and a slight benefit to the comp in the fall. That had we have done the shifted like-for-like.","Paul Lejuez","Okay. Thank you. Good luck.","Paula Price","And we didn\u2019t comment by the way on the third quarter. This is all with respect to the first half and second half.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks.","Operator","And next we will go to Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. A nice uptick here in the number of transactions, I think, you said, Paula, 3.8%. So I was wondering if you could unpack that for us and if you think that is sustainable here to 4Q. And on the guide, I think, you originally said gross margins in the third quarter would be a little bit worse than the fourth quarter, just wondering if you are still holding that guide?","Paula Price","So on the AURs, was it the AURs that you were asking for or the transactions?","Chuck Grom","Transactions. ","Paula Price","So transactions were up 3.8% in the quarter and that\u2019s basically due to our initiatives and our increased engagement from our loyalty customers. We -- especially our platinum course customers she\u2019s shopping more with us. And what was the second part of your question, Chuck?","Chuck Grom","Just on the gross margins, you originally expected the fourth quarter to be better than the third quarter. Third quarter came in better than you expected so just wondering if you feel that the fourth quarter should still be better.","Paula Price","Yeah. So we are pleased with the strength of our gross margin in the third quarter, as well as year-to-date and it gives us more confidence than we had at the start of the fall season in the annual guidance and for now we are sticking with our guidance annual gross margin up slightly. We are not guiding the quarters, but I think, you can back in.","Chuck Grom","Okay. Fair enough. And Jeff on store segmentation, it sounds a little bit similar to sort of what Kohl\u2019s has done with their standard to small average. Just wondering if you could frame for us the opportunity over the next couple of years on inventory, labor, merchandise margins all three of which Kohl\u2019s have seen a benefit from?","Jeff Gennette","Yeah. What I\u2019d say is that there\u2019s -- we have a lot of economic models now at our disposal that really helped on the inventory and the gross margin conversation. So when you think about better direct very little risk as you know in inventory there.","When you look at what we are doing with lease or what we are doing with retail as a service new economic models that really mitigate risk and just add a lot of experience and new content for the customer.","What I\u2019d say is there\u2019s a big difference in our store portfolio versus some of our competitors. When you are looking at some of these flagships and the volume that they command and the bones of those particular stores, those are really unique experiences in retail today on both really the Bloomingdale\u2019s as well as on the Macy\u2019s side and so let\u2019s take full advantage of those and we have a multiyear strategy to really increase the interest in those particular buildings.","On these magnet stores, really a magnet is a draw. So you got these regional malls that draw lots of customers. At the same time that we are really changing the chemistry and the content and experiences in these buildings, so are all our mall developers in these malls.","And so what you see them doing is they are really mixing their square footage. They are pulling out more apparel and accessories. They are adding more entertainment and food and beverage. They are making these more destinations. We are doing the same thing within our buildings.","And what we are finding is that, when you get to the customer insights about whatever that particular major market is, how often they are going from a neighborhood store to a magnet store that really is informing what our long-range strategy is within them.","So that\u2019s how we are looking at it. We are looking at our neighborhood stores about how do we make them more efficient. What do we do with excess space. How we make that an additive experience for customer. That\u2019s what we are focused on right now that we are on the testing phase with.","Chuck Grom","Great.","Operator","And as a reminder, we -- as a reminder, we would like to remind everyone to please limit themselves to one question to allow everyone an opportunity to ask a question. Next we will go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. On the topline, I think, you mentioned that weather was a benefit toward quarter end. Could you just speak to the cadence of comps, should we assume that they improved as the quarter progressed and has that cold weather benefit continued quarter to-date or any other color you can provide on early November trends?","And then just on the credit card revenue, again, a meaningful increase year-over-year. You have raised the outlook. I know loyalty is playing a factor. But just help us understand the magnitude of the gains and is there anything else that we should keep in mind playing a role there?","Jeff Gennette","So, Paul, I am going to take the weather question and then going to let Paula take the loyalty question. But as it relates to kind of the traffic in the quarter, all three months were positive. October was the best of the three months and a lot of that was related to the cold weather snap that we had and that really is across all cold weather categories. So what Paula had said earlier about the Northeast and particularly the Midwest area, all benefited from certainly cold weather on that.","You know I can\u2019t comment about November and how that\u2019s starting. But what I would say, just in general, with remarkable consistency, when you look at the cold-weather calendar and the business in the fall season, how you trend in the third quarter is a remarkably similar percentage of the overall fall business in cold weather.","So we know that our cold weather business in the fourth quarter is not affected by earlier demand, if you will, that\u2019s pulled from the fourth quarter. We feel very comfortable in our cold weather business. We did have good increases of that in the third quarter. We expect to have the same increases in the fourth quarter.","Paula Price","So I would say that our credit program is integral and fully intertwined with our overall retail strategy. It is the primary vehicle for delivering our enhanced loyalty program and nearly half of our sales occur on our proprietary credit card.","Our loyalty program has been very effective, as you heard earlier, in improving engagement and spending with our best customer, especially at the Platinum tier and that also benefits the credit program.","And our partnership with Citi has worked well and it\u2019s helped us to generate a revenue stream that continues to grow, driven by higher credit sales and proprietary card balances. We are seeing slower payments on those card balances, but the quality of the credit balances continues to be good.","And in terms of what you can expect to see, we have guided $740 million to $755 million in the year. That reflects the improvement that we are seeing, and so, we expect that to occur over the fourth quarter and that\u2019s been reflected there. ","Paul Trussell","All right.","Operator","And next we will go to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for all the information. Jeff, I wanted to follow-up on the BOPS and BOSS discussions you are having. Maybe help us with some examples or anecdotes how different customers are using those options, especially when we think about the underlying traffic strength in your business and merch margin strength in your business some of that got depleted away for shipping and return. How do you think about the BOPS and BOSS dynamic maybe alleviating shipping and returns cost over time as you get customers in the stores? And are you incentivizing the customers to come in the guests to come into the stores, given the attachment rates when they come to pick up these purchases, have you toyed around with that given the attachment rates and the savings again on shipping and returns? Thanks.","Jeff Gennette","Yeah. Good questions Omar. So the -- what I\u2019ll tell you is your last question, we have not. We have debated it, do we need to do that, do we need to give them an incentive and I would tell you that of the quarter of all the initiatives that we have BOSS has been a surprise about how quickly this has taken on and how big this business has become for us. The customers love the option.","And I think a lot of it comes down to the store segmentation strategy. What you are seeing with BOSS and BOPS is those neighborhood stores, those smaller neighborhood stores they have a much higher penetration of their overall traffic being generated by fulfillment options, which I guess makes some sense, because when you look at what we curate in individual stores assortment you don\u2019t have the same breadth of assortment in a smaller door as you do in a magnet or a flagship.","So as a result of that now you have got customers who are not either comfortable in shipping something directly to their home, because they are not there they are working or they want to feel they want to touch it by coming into a building. They are taking full advantage of BOSS.","So what we are seeing is that the radiated sales that come from a BOPS purchase and the BOSS purchase is pretty similar. So check that box that part is good for us. We know what those footsteps do.","When you look at the average unit retail or the transaction that is coming with the BOSS order versus a BOPS order it is lower. So that would basically say the customers that are not part of a gold or platinum level where they get free shipping they are forgoing the need to pay for shipping by taking advantage of BOSS.","But as people are getting more used to this I think we are going to see where it goes. We are in the beginning stages of this. We really turn BOSS in -- full across the horn in the third quarter and we are still measuring all the results of it, but so far very good, the dynamics of this are really strong. It\u2019s really helping us in our neighborhood store traffic and it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s been very positive thus far.","Omar Saad","Very helpful, Jeff. Thanks. Good luck.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Good morning. I had a quick question on following up Jeff on your comment about the sequential improvement in stores that you have seen here over the last four quarters. Are we back to positive traffic in stores, the transaction growth this quarter was very strong obviously I am just wondering if that\u2019s being largely driven by digital or are you seeing positive transaction growth in stores?","And then I just wanted to follow-up on Paul\u2019s question about the fourth quarter comp calculation, I am understanding you will compare 13 weeks this year to 13 weeks last year in the fourth quarter. Does that comp calculation clock start on the first week of the quarter November 4th or do you exclude the first week of November from your comp calculation and start the clock with the week beginning November 11th?","Jeff Gennette","So I am going to address the first one Kimberly, which is the sequential improvement in stores. So all the stores are performing better in this year versus last year and it\u2019s gotten progressively better. When you look at some of the stores, they definitely are -- have positive comps and some of them are getting quite healthy.","So let\u2019s just talk about some of the individual parts, when you look at the Growth 50 stores, that\u2019s a very positive comp story when you look at those and some of those stores were negative comps in previous quarters before we put in the investment.","When you look at what Backstage is doing, so Backstage is a separate part. For those stores where Backstage has been open more than a year. The whole portfolio of those stores have high single-digit comps. So that\u2019s good news, obviously, we have got certain businesses that are positive comps in stores.","But the aggregate store be it with Backstage is a subset or the full store that doesn\u2019t have Backstage, we have got a number of stores or stores in our portfolio now that were demonstrably better than they were in the beginning of the year they get better each quarter. We believe the trend is going to continue across all store types as we get into 2019.","And when you look at the profitability of those stores with many of those have fixed expenses, the profitability picture improves for the overall company when the store\u2019s comp gets better. So that\u2019s very healthy for us.","And then when you look at the economics of online and you look at a larger portion of the online demand being fulfilled through either BOPS or BOSS, and the radiated sales that come from that that also helps the profitability picture.","But, again, when you look at both online or stores and look at it as kind of a separate thing, it gets really murky. We really look at the full customer journey because she shopping in all channels, in all categories and in many cases many stores, so we have got to look at how one particular experience will have an effect on another experience or another transaction. So we look at the full customer journey versus the individual pieces. But in aggregate stores are improving.","Paula Price","Kimberly, I would say that, in terms of how we look at the comp in the fourth quarter, it would be similar to how we have been looking at it in all the previous three quarters. We will exclude the same week from Q4 that we did last year.","Kimberly Greenberger","Thank you.","Operator","Next we will go to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to understand the dynamic behind the SG&A growth this quarter. The 3% dollar growth was the highest we have seen in some time. Is this the new run rate going forward or was there anything that was pulled into the third quarter that may not continue in 4Q and 2019?","Paula Price","Yeah. So, Lorraine, in the fourth quarter we had elevated SG&A and that\u2019s due to the investments in our strategic initiatives, but particularly in Backstage, we rolled out 60 Backstage s in the fourth quarter\u2026","Jeff Gennette","Right.","Paula Price","\u2026in the third quarter and so you are seeing the impact of that. In terms of what you can expect for the balance of the year, I would just look to the SG&A guide. We haven\u2019t changed it. We are guiding that SG&A will be up slightly in dollars, but then our rate will be approximately the same.","Lorraine Hutchinson","I understand you don\u2019t want to talk too much about next year. But I think it\u2019s important given that you do plan to roll out an incremental 100 Growth 50s, if we could get some sense of where you are thinking about SG&A or if there are offsets that would be very helpful?","Paula Price","So, again, we will continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that we know are working from our test iterate and scale approach and we have a long track record of being very disciplined on expenses even while we are investing for growth, and so through the funding our future point on our North Star strategy we have a multi-year focus on managing expenses and that will help us to fund our strategic initiatives that are driving the improved sales growth that you are seeing.","So we have already a number of cost savings and productivity initiatives that are beginning to be unleashed through our use of analytics and technology. So we will build on those as we develop our multiyear view in our program. So look to hear more about that later.","Operator","And next we will go to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi. Just a question around competition, I just wondered, if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing from competition both online and the bricks-and-mortar, and if you are seeing any impact to your business from the Sears liquidation sales?","Jeff Gennette","Well, obviously, Bob, we look at competition all the time both online and in our stores. And when you think about what we set out to do with the North Star strategy it is really what is Macy\u2019s unique competitive advantage and how do we distort that in a more fulsome way.","So we are really focused on when you think about the point of the starts about It Must Be Macy\u2019s which is about what we are doing with really kind of localized, but really exclusive content. We spent a lot of time with our manufacturing partners that create specific content for us, as well as our own Private Brands and when you look at that in the context of having a really strong mobile business and a really strong digital business that is really where we know we can compete and compete well.","We are really focused now on experience as it relates to table stakes experience about removing the friction from the customer journey, but then also what if we add that Macy\u2019s can uniquely do, so that would be what we are doing with story, which we haven\u2019t announced yet, but what will story be within Macy\u2019s what we are doing with the market at Macy\u2019s, all that we are doing in VR and AR those are all pieces that we are putting a lot of initiative against.","But then what are we doing with our in-store colleagues in those businesses where that touch matters and what we are doing with special events and trade shows those are all things that increase the experience.","When I look at to your question about Sears, we have been dealing with Sears for a number of years as their businesses decline or as they have dropped out of particular malls. And as you would\u2019ve probably expected, we have very little customer overlap with Sears. So I don\u2019t see that affecting us much.","When I look at something like Bon-Ton when that goes out of the Midwest that definitely affected us, so when you look at some of our strongest districts, have been in those districts that competed against Bon-Ton. And when you think about the arsenal of products that Bon-Ton carry the brands and the categories, Macy\u2019s what you would expect would be a recipient of that. So beauty business is some of the best brands that we would be the place the customer would look for it.","So we have done a lot of outreach to those customers. We have done a lot of outreach to those stores that closed in terms of they are great colleagues, they are great management, making sure that we knew who they were, we brought them into our stores that we are nearby and we have been aggressive about going after.","So that customer wouldn\u2019t be disappointed with losing that competitor out of that market and figuring out this is a place where you can come and get continuation of the sales colleague that you enjoyed when you are in another location or a brand that you are used to seeing. So that one did affect us and that is helping our overall Midwest business.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we will go to Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs.","Alexandra Walvis","Good morning, guys, and thanks for the question. We wanted to ask another one about the new store segmentation strategy. As you think longer term about that strategy what proportion of sales are you expecting to deliver through flagships magnet stores and neighborhood stores?","And then one clarification question on the magnet stores specifically, you have mentioned that you are going from the 50 -- Growth 50 stores now and rolling out another 100 next year, will that be the total base of magnet stores? Or is there potential to make that a bigger group?","Jeff Gennette","So, Alexandra, the first question, we are not going to break out what percent of our portfolio was in each of the three buckets but all three of them are sizable is what I\u2019d say.","And the second part of your question the next 100 magnet stores will not complete the list. There will be a slug of others that would go based on what we learned, what the return of investments of those are. So when he had the Growth 50 going to the next 100 there will be more that we would do in future years.","Operator","Next we will go to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Hi. Good morning and nice to see the progress. As you think about the gross margin it was impressive on the merchandise margin offsetting the delivery expense. Are you achieving scale or economies of scale and delivery expense that\u2019s allowing this to come through and how do you think of the buckets of opportunity for that merchandise margin or rent price as compared to delivery expense? Thank you.","Paula Price","So we have been expanding our gross margin -- merchandise margin all year and that\u2019s been based on the discipline that we have with inventory management, as well as using the data analytics to inform our various inventory decisions and that\u2019s been helping us to sell more full priced selling or more merchandise and so enterprise better. So we are looking at opportunities there, we will continue to impact our merchandise margins.","On delivery expenses, we are also looking at those very closely as well, in terms of how we can be more efficient and we have a number of activities underway there such as BOPS and BOSS that are helping on our delivery expenses. So we are focused on both of those two components and we are seeing progress in both of those two components.","Dana Telsey","And then just on tourism, what did you see on tourism? How did it differ from the second quarter and how you are planning it? Thank you.","Paula Price","So, Dana, we saw you will recall in the first half of the year, 6% improvement in our international tourism business. In the third quarter our tourism business was down 4.2%, so year-to-date we are up 2.5%.","Operator","And next we will go to Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Hey. Thank you so much for taking the call. Paula, I was just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on how we should think about where you plan to manage your leverage going forward, you are pretty comfortably within your range. Should we expect any further debt pay down over the remainder of the year, given your comments on deploying excess free cash flow towards debt pay down this year? Thanks.","Paula Price","Sure. We continue to target our leverage ratio of 2.5% to 2.8%, a healthy balance sheet is very important to us and as we have said we will use that excess cash to pay down further debt and to get closer to our target ratio.","Operator","Next we will go to Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Tunick","Thanks. Good morning. I was curious on your views about CapEx needs going forward. I guess, talking and hearing from Jeff on these different initiatives for next year accelerating, just curious how we should view CapEx maybe next year or the next couple of years. Have you guys figured out either a lower CapEx spend per store as you have done the Backstage or Growth 50 initiatives just generally how should you be thinking about that?","And then maybe Jeff on the Vendor Direct and the mobile numbers you cited have you changed your view of maybe how high e-com can mix at the company over the next few years and are there any new distribution centers or other CapEx needs in order to maintain that growth? Thank you very much.","Paula Price","Look for us to continue to invest in our strategic initiatives next year and to have around a similar investment next year in terms of CapEx, and as a percent of sales, we are still well within line, and so around the same amount or a little bit more next year.","Jeff Gennette","And what I\u2019d say Brian on the, just to add to what Paula just said about, I think, when you can depend on from us is really a balanced investment strategy against maintaining where we are going with really robust digital growth, but also getting our brick-and-mortar fleet healthier.","And we know we can\u2019t do one without the other. So investing in digital and mobile is very important, but equally investing in stores. So as Paula said the capital outlay for 2019 expect to see the same as what we were in 2018 give or take.","And then to your second question about where fulfillment or where the overall digital demand is going to go, we do see that continuing to build as a percentage. But what I\u2019d say is that there\u2019s so many more fulfillment opportunities for us outside of building mega centers. And so, again, when you start to look at some of this excess space that we have in these neighborhood stores that are in every one of our major markets, there\u2019s opportunities to redeploy that square footage. So the opportunity basically with more economic models with hold and flow opportunities.","We are going to be looking at lots of opportunities for us to take fuller advantage of data analytics and getting the most out of the inventory that we flow closer and need to where customers are and when they want to purchase something. So we will be giving you more detail on that as we outline all of our 2019 plans, but it\u2019s very much on our mind.","Brian Tunick","Okay.","Operator","And next we will go to Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions here. Just want to ask you first on the credit line. I was just trying to back out some math in the fourth quarter. It looks like it\u2019s implied to be slightly negative in the fourth quarter, obviously, the most recent trends have been better than that. But, obviously, you are lapping loyalty, but I am not sure how much of that is a one-time step up in the third quarter and what that means for the next 12 months?","Paula Price","So in terms of our credit, we are guided at $740 million to $755 million. So that would imply a range for just doing the math versus where we were in Q3 of $207 million to $227 million. And in terms of -- tell me the second question?","Michael Binetti","Well, I am just curious since you guided to slightly lower in the fourth quarter year-over-year, but you have been seeing such big games lately and I know you are lapping loyalty. But I am just trying to think of how much, what -- so should we assume that third quarter growth we saw in credit was really one-time or what we can extrapolate going forward multi-quarter into next year on credit?","Paula Price","Have you contemplated a 53rd week?","Michael Binetti","Okay. So if we look at that maybe you can just unpack what drove so much growth in the third quarter for us between the drivers of like interchange fees, higher balances, credit score changes, I know you said you have a few comments earlier. But just -- if you could help us think about that, because you also mentioned that the quality of credit was quite high, but that the balances, it sounded like we are going higher as well, I didn\u2019t know how to reconcile those two comments?","Paula Price","Yeah. The credit sales are higher, again, driven by our loyalty program. The balances also are higher and that\u2019s driven by the sales, but also we are seeing slower payments and that is just because our customers deciding to pay slower. The quality of the accounts receivable continues to be high. The other thing is we are seeing a slightly lower fraud charges. So there are a lot of positives in there, but the biggest thing is credit sales in the higher corresponding balances.","Michael Binetti","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe if I could go back to Lorraine\u2019s question just ask a different way. I think given some of the commentary you have given on the store plan for next year and the CapEx related to The Wall Street Journal story. I guess, how should we think about how that influences the P&L in the SG&A line next year. You mentioned you have some cost-containment plans you have already told us about. I am just wondering of that lets you -- puts you in a position to lever SG&A as we look at multi-quarter into next year given the growth plans that you mentioned?","Paula Price","So we are developing our plans for 2019 and we will talk about those more on subsequent calls. But, again, we will be investing next year and we will also be mitigating our investments as best we can through cost savings. The other thing I should say is that to the extent that we have been investing we are already seeing returns on those investments, so all of that will be helpful as well.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

This conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please, go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Great, thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Macy's conference call. I'm Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. I'm joined this morning by Terry Lundgren, Macy's Chairman and CEO.","Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in our most recently filed Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","Terry Lundgren will start us off this morning to discuss the company's results and strategic imperatives. I will then discuss three subjects in more detail; the third quarter earnings, our work on real estate and the outlook for the fourth quarter. And then we'll open the call up for your questions.","So let's get started. It's a lot to cover. Terry?","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. I wanted to join the call today to help give my perspective to you directly on the third quarter earnings, to talk about the outlook and to discuss our analysis on real estate and other strategic decisions that we've made. These decisions are all being made to enhance shareholder value by strengthening our core business and accelerating changes in this new retailing climate.","As you see from our press release, we had a very tough quarter, and we are clearly disappointed with the 3.6% decline in comp store sales of owned and licensed businesses, and the 8% drop in earnings per share. We believe that the retail industry is going through a tough period that we seem to experience something like this every five years to seven years or so, and this one feels familiar in that regard.","As many of you know, this is a management team that has navigated through difficult times in the past and we've done so successfully. As we've demonstrated in the past, we use these challenging times to move decisively forward. We use these times to reset our ambitions and determine how we're going to win and where we're going to play, while maintaining a financial objective that we set for our shareholders, which is to grow sales profitably, maintain an industry-leading profitability rate and improve return on invested capital. We know this is what will enable us to maximize total shareholder returns. We've done this in the past and we'll do this again.","You will recall our decisions in 2008 and 2009 that made us a much stronger and much more successful company. We have a track record of strong financial performance and return of capital. We are taking significant steps on these important fronts, all designed to improve our operating results and enhance shareholder value. We're taking a series of actions specifically aimed at strengthening our core business. These are designed to restore our owned plus licensed comp sales growth to the 2% to 3% range that we've had in the past and an EBITDA rate of 14% over the next few years.","We continue to believe that the M.O.M. strategies are right, but they need to evolve over time. The first M in our M.O.M. strategy is for My Macy's. We continue to focus on localization and getting the right mix of merchandise in our stores for our customers at a local level. We are now taking this to an even more granular level with more focus on personalization. This will happen both in-store and online. Our aspiration is to help personalize shopping experience and offers to our customers as they walk into our stores or enter our website. We also need to help attract new customers in ways that we will make them feel like it is My Macy's for each and every one of them.","The second letter, the O for Omnichannel, now embraces our mobile strategy as well as some new services and models that we've begun testing such as subscription services. We intend to fully push the digital frontier utilizing our innovative culture with more and more testing and faster learning. We also are helping customers get merchandise however they wish, whether it be same-day delivery, Buy Online Pickup in Store, whatever is their preference.","The last M, Magic Selling, has been expanded to encompass magic experiences beyond just the selling floor. We need to keep making progress with our service, particularly in-store. Although operating over 750 locations with approximately 150,000 associates and providing good service in every transaction does present its challenges, it is an essential part of our mission. As part of this strategy, we are pushing to improve shopping experiences through our people as well as through technology. We have piloted our approach in jewelry and watches in 40 locations this fall, and based on its early success, we are rolling it out companywide in mid-2016. We have had great success with licensed businesses, which help us acquire new customers and make our stores more productive. As you saw this morning, we announced another new partnership, this time with LensCrafters, to open optical departments in as many as 500 Macy's locations.","In addition to the evolution of our M.O.M. strategies, I wanted to discuss two other subjects which are important to our core business and will help us achieve our goals. First, as we discussed last quarter, we are concentrating our resources on strengthening our top doors in our best locations. These locations have tremendous growth potential and we believe with greater focus we can improve their already-strong results.","We also recognize that we have the opportunity to condense our network of stores. We expect to close roughly 35 stores to 40 stores in early 2016, as previously announced, and we expect to continue to close more stores in the future. We will reduce expense and tighten capital spending additionally to operate more efficiently, while funding the highest potential growth initiatives.","Our target is to reduce SG&A by $500 million on an annual basis by 2016. But be clear that we're going to make significant incremental progress in 2016 and 2017 as well. We expect part of this reduction to result from a greater use of technology. We will also reduce capital spending for the next year to be somewhere around $1 billion, and that compares to $1.2 billion which we expect to spend this year, and that's just the right decision for us to make after the challenging year that we're having.","In addition to strengthening the core business, we are also testing new directions for future growth. We look for places where the growth is complementary to our core business. We want to invest in attractive businesses that meet three criteria. One would be, the business is attractive on its own; two, where we would bring something new to the table; and three, where assuming we win, we'll strengthen our core capabilities.","The three areas which we are focused currently on is \u2013 one is Backstage, which you know about, but over the next two years we intend to open approximately 50 free-standing Backstage stores. In addition to spring \u2013 into spring 2016, we're going to pilot Backstage stores within up to 10 existing Macy's store locations, creating a new hybrid model and we believe that these stores within our stores can help bring new vendors and new categories, which will appeal to existing customers, but also attract new customers to the full-line store. We are finding that Backstage is definitely attracting a younger consumer. And assuming these pilots work, we'll be ready to roll this concept out as a hybrid model quickly.","Second idea is Bluemercury, where we've opened 16 free-standing Bluemercury stores this year, taking that total to 76. Over the next two years, we expect to open another 40 or more locations. In addition, we're rolling out Bluemercury shops in Macy's stores and we'll utilize the Macy's capability to greatly enhance the experience and grow our online business at bluemercury.com. And also we will appropriately expand Macy's in China. I was just there last week as we watched on Alibaba's Tmall Global site, and we are also opening Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores in Abu Dhabi in 2018. These tests may also lead to further international opportunities.","Before I turn the call over to Karen, I want to make a few comments about real estate. I'm particularly pleased that Tishman Speyer has become our partner, and they're going to help us to capture more value from our real estate. This is something we believe in and Tishman Speyer is a company that has an outstanding track record of creativity in developing world-class real estate assets and they are as excited as I am about the possibilities to unlock potential value in many of our real estate locations, including our mall locations.","So we're going to begin by focusing our efforts on potential partners or joint ventures for the four major flagship properties, but don't misunderstand me; this is just the beginning. But we're going to start with Herald Square, Union Square, State Street and Downtown Minneapolis. From our work so far, we believe there is material shareholder value that could potentially be created from these efforts. And these partnerships could extend, as I said, into the mall store locations as well.","We will also intensify our current efforts with selected real estate monetizations and redevelopments in instances where the retail business could be enhanced or where the value of the real estate simply exceeds the value to operate it as a retail business. And we've demonstrated this in the past and we think there's more of these opportunities.","As Karen will discuss in a few minutes, we and our board concluded there was not enough value to be created from the establishment of a REIT at this time, even before factoring in the operational and tax risks associated with doing so, but we did put these unconcluded risks aside for our valuation process and still came to the conclusion that a REIT just does not create significant value or enough significant value at this time. And so we've studied it, we've used great outside advisors to help us think this through, and I just want you to know that we've given this a very, very thorough, thorough look.","Also know just that I'm just not happy with our current overall results and I'm committed to fixing it. Our team is among the deepest, most experienced and most determined team in retail. That's been clearly recognized for the last several years as we've proven to have strong success. And while we are quite dissatisfied with our current results, we're quite confident that we'll be able to return to delivering profitable growth. We know this is what you expect of us and I guarantee you, that's what I expect of ourselves.","Our expectations are based on our demonstrated ability to respond to market challenges and emerge stronger. No other retailer has a track record of mastering change and remember that some of our boldest and best ideas are developed during these down cycles. Our success since the beginning of fiscal 2009, which includes a 540% total shareholder return versus the Dow of 121% over the same period, means that we have demonstrated our ability to do this and we're operating from a position of financial strength.","So, let me turn this over to Karen now, who's going to fill you in on some more of the details.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Terry. As Terry said, the third quarter was disappointing. The sales trend unexpectedly weakened versus that experienced during the first half of the year. Comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis were down 3.6%, and on total sales of $5.9 billion were down 5.2% below last year.","As discussed last quarter, the total sales declined more than comp due primarily to the reduction in sales of our private brand merchandise to a third-party. Traffic was clearly a problem for us in the quarter, as I'll discuss in a minute, and I have to say, we're anxious to see how other retailers fared in the quarter. But in the absence of that perspective, I'll describe the factors that we believe led to the weakness.","First, sales performance in our tourist doors weakened versus the second quarter, with a significant decline in international tourist sales. Using international credit card sales as the proxy, we estimate the impact of the lower international tourist sales to be approximately 1.5 points in the third quarter, which compares to the one point that we talked about for the first quarter and the second quarter. As you might imagine, these are also our most profitable doors. And remember that we are significantly more weighted to tourist markets than our major competitors.","Second, the weather has not helped with the warm temperatures experienced across the country. Our sales of cold weather merchandise, such as coats, sweaters, boots, et cetera were significantly below last year in the quarter.","Third, the Center Core businesses are still growing, but experiencing slower growth than in recent years. This is in part related to the slowdown in tourist sales.","And fourth, some of our major brands experienced weakness during the quarter, as you've heard mentioned on the various calls recently.","In spite of disappointing overall sales, there were some bright spots. First, digital growth continued to be very strong. Our furniture and mattress business also continued very strong and soft home categories like textiles, tabletop, et cetera strengthened in the third quarter. Active continues to be a very strong category for us across the store, whether it be in men's, women's, or kids. In fact, our kids and younger Millennial businesses also did relatively well in the quarter.","Geographically, we did the best in the West, particularly the Northwest. As I referenced a few minutes ago, the total number of transactions was down 3.6% versus last year in the third quarter, which compares to a flattish trend in the first half of the year.","Transactions are a proxy for traffic, and clearly, something changed in the third quarter. Average unit retail was down 1% and units per transaction were up 1% versus last year. Both of these trends were similar to those in the first half of the year.","Gross margin rate in the quarter was 39.8%, up 60 basis points versus last year. Merchandise margin was up slightly in the quarter, but the gross margin rate also benefited from the reduction in the low margin third-party sales versus last year.","Inventory at the end of the third quarter was up 4.6%, and on a comp basis, inventory was up 3.1%. This is higher than anticipated and higher than we'd like it to be, but it is the result of the disappointing sales performance. We will need to liquidate this inventory in the fourth quarter so that we can maintain the flow of fresh, new merchandise. SG&A in the quarter was $1.968 billion, down $39 million or 1.9% versus last year.","During the third quarter, we booked a $57 million gain on the sale of the upper floors of our Seattle store, which occurred a quarter earlier than we had planned. In total, in the third quarter, we booked $78 million of asset sales which compares to $48 million last year. Marketing expense was less than last year in the quarter due primarily to a timing shift into the fourth quarter. We also benefited in the quarter from the savings associated with the restructuring implemented earlier this year and also a reduction in the bonus accrual due to our weak performance. The reductions were offset in part by our investment in growth initiatives, investments in digital, Bluemercury, Backstage and China.","Credit income in the quarter was $177 million, which is $5 million lower than last year as anticipated due to the costs associated with reissuing our co-brand credit cards with chips. Credit usage or penetration was 49.3% in the quarter above last year by 60 basis points.","Remember also that we are consolidating the results from the China joint venture, which at this point is only a small amount of expense. Operating income before the asset impairment charge was $369 million or 13% below last year. We also booked non-cash asset impairment charges of $111 million in the quarter. These are primarily related to the potential 35 store closings to 40 store closings which we announced in September. The estimate will be fine-tuned, if necessary, when the decisions on specific locations to be closed is finalized later in the year. Interest expense in the quarter was $80 million; tax expense was $61 million, an effective rate of 34.6%.","Also, as I just mentioned, we're consolidating the results for China that flow into our operating income. We then will break out the portion of, in this case, the loss attributable for our joint venture partner, which was $1 million in the quarter. Net income attributable to Macy's shareholders is $118 million, or $186 million, excluding the asset impairment charges, which is 14% below last year. Average share count on a diluted basis was 329.7 million shares, down 8% from last year. And therefore, earnings per share, excluding the asset impairment charge was $0.56 a share which is down 8% from last year's $0.61 a share on this basis.","Moving on to cash flow; year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $278 million, $563 million below last year. This is due to less net income, more inventory and lower payables. Cash flow from investing activities is about the same as last year, excluding our acquisition of Bluemercury earlier in the year. In the financing section, you will note that we showed $791 million of debt issued, which is all commercial paper. These borrowings are expected to be gone long before the end of the fourth quarter. You'll also note that we bought back $1.8 billion of stock this year, or 30.6 million shares.","Let's move on now to real estate. As Terry said, we and our board have been studying numerous alternatives for utilizing our real estate to create value. We engaged multiple advisors and have spent countless hours examining alternatives. Our primary focus in recent months has been related to the potential for spinning off some of our properties into a REIT. The premise of a REIT, as you know, is that we would create a separate real estate business that would presumably trade at a higher multiple than we do as a retailer and that this new entity would be able to then grow into a separate business on its own. That opportunity for valuation arbitrage and creating a new business sounds promising.","But as we analyzed it further, we realized that its creation would not create nearly as much value for our shareholders as we had hoped. We reached this conclusion before taking into consideration the operational and tax risks associated with the creation of a REIT, which also would be relevant.","Our analysis addressed several key factors; first, the size of the REIT. This is a function of the rent that the retailer can pay and therefore the amount of earnings for the REIT that could be then capitalized at a potentially more attractive valuation multiple. Second is how the REIT would be valued. Honestly, there aren't any true comparables to look at for a Macy's REIT, which would at least at the outset, be a single-tenant department store REIT.","Some of the factors influencing valuation include the quality of the properties, the diversification of geography and brand, as well as the lease terms themselves. And the third key factor would be how would the pro forma retailer trade? In other words, would the separation of real estate impact the valuation attributed to Macy's by the public markets, given the leveraging effect of incremental rent and the loss of control of properties? Even assuming no change in the retailer's multiple, a conservative assumption on a pro forma basis, any resulting value creation is not significant.","So, each of these three factors played a part in driving the conclusion. The most significant was the amount of incremental leverage in the form of rent that the retailer could support. This, in turn, is driven by the financial flexibility needed at the retailer to manage through ongoing secular changes in the sector. Our industry can be cyclical and you don't have to look far back for evidence that swings in leverage can be material through this cycle.","We've lived through enough downturns and bankruptcies to know that there is a real benefit to the retailer of maintaining the flexibility of an investment grade rating and having access to capital in all markets, particularly when the industry is in flux. In addition, our real estate advisors indicated that the REIT would trade better if the retailer was investment grade, since at least initially it would be a single-tenant REIT.","As I said a few minutes ago, the leveraging impact is highly material. When we capitalize the potential rent that the retailer would pay the REIT, at the 9.3 times factor for Macy's that Moody's is using for us for 2014, or potentially higher given that these leases would be long-term in nature, cash generated through leverage of the REIT can offset that somewhat by paying down existing debt, but leverage is still a limiting factor on the size of the REIT transaction that we could pursue. There would also be material transaction leakage in any REIT formation. These friction costs would include items, such as debt prepayment costs, transaction fees, incremental property taxes and transfer taxes.","We would also be required, under the relevant tax rule, to affect what is known as an earnings and profits purge, whereby we would distribute a portion of pre-transaction accumulated earnings and profits. While our shareholders would ultimately benefit from this distribution, it would limit proceeds available for debt paydown at the retailer and consequently, the size of the REIT transaction that we could prudently pursue.","In the end, the value creation was not significant and as such our board decided not to proceed. This is something we will continue to monitor as circumstances and markets could change. As Terry mentioned, we are encouraged by the possible value creation from partnership or joint venture opportunities for our flagship properties at Herald Square, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago and Downtown Minneapolis. These transactions could be for individual properties or could be more broad-based. We are open to all possibilities that will create sustainable value.","The board agreed that we should immediately begin a process to explore these opportunities. The ultimate structures will be determined by our process. Our expectation though is that we will be able to create significant value. It is possible that these partnerships and joint ventures, as I mentioned a minute ago, would extend to our mall-based stores and be significantly more broad-based than these four properties. We're seeking creative ways to strengthen our retail presence, while monetizing or highlighting value of the less productive space. These will take some time to execute. In the case of these four buildings, they are very complex and the best answers are likely to be very site specific. As examples, both Brooklyn and Seattle took over a year from inception to completion.","We have also recognized through all this work that we could benefit by adding resources to help us create more value with our real estate. As Terry mentioned earlier, we've engaged Tishman Speyer in an expanded relationship to advise and support our management team in identifying and advancing potential store redevelopment projects nationwide. We are very excited to have their help with these efforts. And as always, we will give you progress reports as we proceed.","So, let's move on now to our outlook for the fourth quarter. As you saw in our press release, we are forecasting our comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis to be down 2% to 3%, which would lead to the year being down 1.8% to 2.2% on this basis. Total sales for the year are now assumed to be down 2.7% to 3.1%. The fourth quarter sales assumption incorporates an improvement in trend from the third quarter. I would point to three factors that should contribute to this improvement in trend. The first is that Macy's and bloomingdales.com both penetrate higher as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter than in earlier quarters. Therefore, the higher growth rate of the online business is mathematically more of a help to the sales increase in the fourth quarter than it is in the third quarter.","Second, weakening international tourist business reaches the one-year point in mid-December and that will help the comparison be a bit more favorable in the back half of the quarter. And three, we feel very good about our gift assortments, given early reads in our prototype store. The trend in that store has improved significantly since we set it up for the holidays. The newness in some of our gifts is great, items like faux fur, tech watches and novelty gifts. The gross margin is expected to be well below last year in the fourth quarter due primarily to the higher-than-desired inventory position going into the quarter. For the fall season as a whole, we are expecting a lower gross margin rate than last year. SG&A in the fourth quarter is expected to benefit from the $250 million gain on the Brooklyn transaction.","Excluding this gain, SG&A dollars are expected to increase versus last year. While we will continue to benefit from the restructuring completed earlier this year, the benefits are offset by the investment in growth initiatives, the shift in the timing of marketing expense in the third quarter, as well as lower asset sales gains this year outside of the Brooklyn transaction.","Interest expense is assumed to be $96 million in the fourth quarter. And as you saw in the release, we are now assuming annual earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding asset impairment and other store closing costs, of $4.20 to $4.30. This equates to fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.54 to $2.64 on this basis.","Let me now turn it over to Terry to recap and wrap up.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, as you can see, we have a lot going on in our company, both in terms of delivering improved results in the fourth quarter and looking ahead to the future. It's not unusual for us to focus on a combination of strategy and execution at this time of year. Ours is a company that has always embraced change and continuous improvement. But what is different this year is the breadth and intensity of activity, given disappointing results, together with the exceptional opportunities we see emerging from the rapid evolution of shopping patterns and preferences in the future as well as in the real estate marketplace category.","We also know that our company must continue to change and we have done so year-after-year. We have a clear vision of where we need to go. We have a strong sense of urgency and we have the talent and resources to move ahead in a manner that is intelligent and is in the best interest of all shareholders as well as of our customers and our associates.","I know today's announcements are a lot to digest, but you can be sure that we are well coordinated and managing each element with a holistic view for creating long-term shareholder value.","Thanks for your interest and for taking the time to understand all that we talked about today, and now Karen and I are prepared to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. So, Terry, you spoke to restoring same-store sales back to positive 2% to 3% over time. Underlying all the noise this year, what base do you think we're at today, and is it fair to think about next year as sort of the stepping stone as you roll out some of these initiatives across the base? Any help on a potential bridge back to the 2% to 3% would be really helpful.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we'll come out with our forecast for 2016, as you know, as we typically do, at the beginning of the fiscal year coming, but it is what you've described, Matt, and that is, we don't expect to go from our current trend and forecast for the fourth quarter into the plus 2% to 3% immediately. All of these steps that we've described are aimed toward restoring that growth that we've seen in the past, but they're going to take time. All of these subjects are going to take some time. So this is going to be an adjustment period. We're going to be aggressively moving forward with the ideas that we think are working, investing in our top locations; that work has already begun, beginning to roll out the Backstage initiative, beginning to roll out the Bluemercury initiative, all these things that we've talked about. Many are underway, either planned, in the planning stages or even begun to execute in some cases. But they are going to take time to get traction. So I think you've described it well in your question.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up; Terry, I'm curious your thoughts on the upcoming holiday. Could you help break down the negative 2% to negative 3% comp forecast as we think about tourism, AUR, as you're reducing some of the inventory, and just how you're thinking about traffic and spending behavior from the consumer this holiday?","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, Matt, as difficult as the 2% to 3% is, it's a slight improvement versus how we have been in the third quarter. And frankly I think part of that is the fact that we will anniversary the weakness of the international tourist business which we felt in the middle of December last year and throughout January. But we're not expecting any major trends and change, as you can tell, other than that. So I wish I could say it's going to get ice cold across the country, I wish I could say that tourists are going to begin to show up and start spending, but you can see in our forecast for fourth quarter, we're not expecting that.","And therefore, of course all retailers who are in the fashion business like us, we're not selling lumber, so I can't carry the lumber over to 2016 and sell it at the same price next year. We're selling fashion apparel and so we're going to mark that inventory down. That will be good for consumers, but it will obviously put pressure on our own margins in the fourth quarter. But our goal is to be clear about making sure that we're prepared with fresh inventory receipts coming into spring 2016, and the only way to do that is to address the markdown needs of the short \u2013 to the sales plan that we're experiencing in third quarter and will in the fourth quarter as we've forecasted. So that's why the numbers look the way that they do in our fourth quarter forecast.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Best of luck and thanks for all the color.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","(38:06) guys have done a great job of keeping your inventories in line and I'm a little bit surprised that your comp inventories ended on such a high note. Maybe you can just talk a little bit about why you decided \u2013 it sounds like you kind of held the line on your pricing. Wondering why perhaps you didn't accelerate markdowns and then enter the fourth quarter a little bit cleaner? And then I have a follow-up question.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll just start with saying that you have to shoot when the ducks are flying, and they're flying in November and December. That's when the traffic is there. And so \u2013 clearly, we talked about with the warmer weather, we have build-up in inventory in all of those cold weather categories of outerwear and in boots and even the down comforter throughout the home. But throughout the entire company, we've got that issue.","You want to believe that it eventually is going to get cold, and so when it does, that consumers will \u2013 and traditionally, they have reacted to that. So you don't necessarily need to mark all of that inventory down. At some point, we will; but you'd like to be able to get some of that business in the higher margin and at the higher average retail early when the weather does break before you have to mark down. You'll have to mark it down eventually because there's just too much of the inventory we predict, because of what hasn't been sold in October and what we expect going forward, so that's basically why you would wait on \u2013 you wouldn't take unnecessary markdowns. On the fashion stuff, you definitely would take the markdowns, and we think we've done that, but our lumps are clearly in the cold weather category, and we'll have to address that.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Understand. Okay. And with regard to Backstage, I'm wondering if you could talk about the learnings that you've had so far, and how the initial locations are performing? It seems like taking kind of a leap forward and planning to open 50 over the next two years would suggest that you're pretty pleased with what you've seen so far. And then with regard to the hybrid model, how much selling space would you anticipate carving out from your existing mall-based store to accommodate the off-price portion of that model?","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. First of all, I will tell you, it's still early days in the evaluation process for Backstage, but our belief is that the model has certainly been proven by others. And I think in the last \u2013 particularly the last two years to three years, there has been a consumer migration to these lower price point options, and so that's where we know that there's a consumer interest there. So our belief is that there's a consumer interest there; we just need to get our share of that.","We're also seeing the younger consumer migrating to that space, and with our intense focus on the Millennial consumer, which we're getting inside of our Macy's stores, we think this is another way to attract that younger consumer. So it's more of a bet on the fact that the category has been proven mostly by others. It's early days for us in our testing, but we like the model. We like what we offer. We think we offer something different than a lot of the other guys in the off-price space have done.","And as far as the hybrid idea, we haven't done it yet. We're just getting ready to do so. But honestly, I think we've got space in the apparel floors. So we could take somewhere between 20,000 square feet and 30,000 square feet to create a significant space for the Backstage within the store. And I believe that lots of these stores, particularly in that mid-tier performance group that are not as productive as they need to be, and the way they're going to get more productive is bringing new ideas in, like a LensCrafters or a Finish Line or Sunglass Hut, which we've done.","But now perhaps with this hybrid model, which will also allow us to bring in new categories like home d\u00e9cor, which has been \u2013 we've tried this in the stores in the past at the Macy's stores. It's very complicated to do on a regular basis, but it's easier to do on a one-off basis of buying coat hangers and buying mirror sets and buying these other home d\u00e9cor items that have been successful in Backstage. And so we think that we can create some new interest in product categories, but also attract more of these younger consumers in the hybrid model. So I'm excited about this test and what this could bring, mostly to make those mid-performing stores more productive.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. You mentioned some of the real estate optionality around the flagships. I was just wondering if you could talk about how much value those could ultimately unlock and how we should think about the real estate gains per year going forward.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, honestly, I don't know the answer to that question. We do think it's going to be a significant value creation, but it is hard to predict. So, I'm sorry, I can't be really helpful with that.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just in terms of the environment and some of the partnerships that you've been launching over time, have the views or priorities around M&A changed at all?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think so. I mean...","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, no, I don't think so either. We've said this in the past. We look at everything that we think is reasonable in terms of its potential to add value to our overall portfolio. But, we've not made any investments in the period of 2005, when we bought The May Company, which was a massive investment which we all feel very good about, until we just bought Bluemercury, which is a relatively small investment. So we look at all of these ideas and our belief is that there still are other ideas out there but we're going to continue to be very, very selective about M&A opportunities.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi. Thank you. Terry, regarding your comment on the cycle and thinking about the five years to seven years, how do we think about the evolution of how you may pursue promotional strategies in this new context? And also, as we look at retail and we kind of try to reconcile the low unemployment and certain gas benefits, what do you think is happening with the nature of the consumer?","And, Karen, I just had a question on vendors, I was just curious on the vendor side, in terms of the near-term experience, what relationship you will have with the inventory positions in the gross margins? And on a longer-term basis with the vendors, I think your store experience is quite different and unique in your bargaining positions, so just curious about pure-play Internet and Macy's?","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, so, a series of questions. First of all, one of the things that you mentioned about the consumer is that the nature of the consumer is that they're \u2013 they have \u2013 at least in the first quarter they were spending in categories such as automobiles, in home improvement, certainly in technology and healthcare. You could find the specific categories where the consumer was spending and that did demonstrate that there is reason to believe in the GDP forecast. However, that dropped off, we all saw how that dropped off in the third quarter and yet some of those categories continued to perform.","So, they have \u2013 and their savings accounts still indicate \u2013 well they're a little less than they were in second quarter, they still indicate that there is money to spend if the consumer chooses to do so in the fourth quarter. We're just waiting now to see if, in fact, they will.","So, I think the state of the consumer is actually reasonably okay. One of the things that I've said on a macro basis that does concern me is that we have not seen productivity in the United States improve, in fact it's deteriorated somewhat, while the unemployment rate continues to be very, very low and it just seems that those two numbers are in a bit of a conflict with one another. You'd think that productivity would have to increase to continue to see unemployment go down and that hasn't necessarily happened. So, that piece of macroeconomic news does concern me about the nature of the consumer longer-term, but we'll have to see how that plays out in 2016 with job growth with other companies.","As far as the vendor relationships go, we have very, very strong relationships with our vendors. As you indicated, we are generally the largest or one of the largest customers for most of the major vendors that we do business with. But we obviously have a close working relationship. It's extremely important for them and for us. And Karen mentioned this in her comments, when you see some of these big designers, these big vendors releasing their performance, you can be sure that an important part of their overall result is directly related to their results with Macy's, just because of the size of our business relationships.","So having said that, there are vendors that have been highly supportive of us in difficult times, I know they will be in this particular time and we're counting on that, but look, there's only a limit to what everybody can do in terms of assisting us through this difficult period and that's what we've got baked into our fourth quarter forecast.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks, Terry. And just a quick follow-up; so, from a bigger picture perspective, how do we think about promotions in a brand-appropriate way and kind of the next generation of how you think about promoting in the context of your store experience and what consumers are really looking for?","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we are a promotional department store and always have been at Macy's. So that will continue. But I do think that there's got to be new and different and creative ways to attract customers to our business in the forms of loyalty, in the forms of our Plenti program, which is an alliance among many retailers that we now have 9 million people signed up or participating that can buy their gasoline at Exxon and they can buy something at AT&T and they can use those accumulated points and purchase something at Macy's. It's more of a points program as opposed to an outright discount or coupon. I do think there will be different forms of creating the value for the consumers. But in the end, it has to fill the obvious. And so we're working through that.","Interestingly, as we've done the Backstage work, there are no coupons with Backstage. There is the price you see is the price that you get. It's more of an obvious value approach. We've tried everyday low price inside the Macy's store in the past with minimum success, so it's not that you can just change over to an everyday low price at Macy's and assume that the customer will get that and understand that value. In fact I think other retailers have tried that and gone away from that, other department stores have tried that and gone away from that in the last few years. So it's not that simple, but I do think that there are opportunities for us to find new handles and new ways to create value for customers without the typical discount that you're used to seeing.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks, Terry, for the vision, and thanks, Karen, for the real estate details. They're really helpful.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Great. Thanks, Oliver.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just wanted to again touch on sales. The comments you've provided have been very helpful, Karen and Terry, but just wanted to dig into the weather perhaps a little bit more. You did speak to certain seasonal categories down significantly. Is there any color that you could help us with in terms of how coats and scarves were during the quarter; any cadence of the comp throughout the quarter, particularly perhaps in the warmer weeks of early October? And just any breakthroughs or silver linings perhaps as the weathers have gotten slightly cooler over these past few weeks?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, when the weather gets cooler we do see more traffic and we have seen more sales. So, yes, there's some reason to be optimistic, as Terry said. The weather will get cold. But those businesses have been tough and obviously often you go to the store to buy the coat when it gets cold so it's impacting other categories as well because it's less traffic. The 3.6% drop in transactions was pretty significant and was particularly tough in October. So I do think \u2013 and that's when the weather had gotten colder last year. So I hate complaining about the weather but in a quarter like this it's really hard not to talk about it.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it, got it. And from an expense standpoint, you mentioned that the fourth quarter, despite the sales drop, will have dollars going higher, ex the real estate asset sale. If you can just remind us of what some of those headwinds are that you're facing this year? Obviously, historically, you've been able to offset sales declines with benefits in SG&A, and to that point, you did mention in the release that you do target to reduce SG&A by another $500 million over the next few years. What are some of the areas that you think those opportunities lie in?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","So, in terms of the fourth quarter, the headwinds would be the investment in the growth initiatives that we've talked about; digital, Bluemercury, Backstage, as well as China. So we are investing in growth and we are obviously looking for offsets to that. The other issue that will cause an increase in the fourth quarter is that we shifted marketing dollars from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And lastly, we're anticipating lower asset sale gains outside of Brooklyn.","So last year in the fourth quarter, we had $36.8 million of asset sale gains and this year we're expecting that to be less again excluding Brooklyn. So those would be the big factors in the fourth quarter and as you know we're constantly looking to do better and with the sales trend we're all focused on that and as we go to look for the $500 million, maybe we'll get some good news in the fourth quarter but it would be wrong for us to predict that at this point.","And in terms of the $500 million, obviously it's a large number and as you know each and every year if you go back over our releases in the early part of the year, we have constantly been evolving the expense structure and announcing restructurings and different ways of doing the business that has saved money. This year it was $140 million that we decided to reinvest in growth, the year before it was $100 million. So we have stepped up the pace at which we're making changes, but it's not like we don't do this on a regular basis. When you get to a number that's as big as $500 million, obviously there will be no stone unturned and we are looking across the company for opportunities to use technology perhaps to be able to do some things more efficiently, that's a big area and we're looking everywhere. And obviously we'll update you as we go.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","We'll go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you, Terry and Karen, for all of the great detail. I'm wondering if you can talk about traffic. It seems that, that was the piece that really did step down in the third quarter. Are there some strategies or initiatives that you can put in place near-term, for example, in the holiday season, to include that traffic trend?","And secondarily, as you step back and look at the next one year, two years, three years, do you have any initial thoughts on a way to evolve or update your strategies that would help to fortify that traffic number and perhaps at least stabilize it and maybe potentially start driving a positive traffic trend in your stores? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, as we saw with traffic soften earlier in the quarter, we did begin to focus on what could we do in the fourth quarter to help the traffic. Part of it, again, I hate to keep saying it, relates to the weather. But to the part we can control, we have been developing strategies both in terms of our marketing for the store business and also some online specific strategies to help drive traffic. So we are hoping to be able to impact it and also with weather, we hope it will do better and obviously we're on that issue, Kimberly, since we saw it developing early in the quarter.","Longer-term, I think in addition to always starting with product and trying to have the best most-curated, most-wanted assortments, we're also working on categories that we think will be particularly relevant as we go forward. Areas like health and wellness for example. And other product categories that we already do today, how can we do those better; for example, the jewelry and watch test that Terry had alluded to earlier.","The other thing I would say is there's a renewed focus on finding new customers and attracting new customers to our stores. We will continually try to get more trips and more business from our already loyal customers, but we do recognize the need to keep building a new customer base, and again, that relates to our Millennial customer. So I would say that would be a big part of our traffic driving going forward.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's well said.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.","Paul L. Lejuez - Citi","Hey. Thanks, guys. Two questions; one on the Backstage stores, just wondering if you saw any impact, negative impact, on the nearby Macy's stores? And then second, Terry, when you talk about a return to 2% to 3% comps looking out in a couple of years, where do you think that share comes from? And just to be clear, are you talking 2% to 3% in the core Macy's concept or do you anticipate Backstage becoming a driver to help get to that 2% to 3%? Thanks.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'll answer your second question first, and that is that we're looking at the 2% to 3% to be all in, on a comp store basis, to be all in, so that includes the new initiatives with Backstage and Bluemercury. So we're clearly seeing the shift there. I also will say that \u2013 and the other answer to your question is \u2013 to your first question is we haven't seen a deterioration in the nearby Macy's stores. As an example we have Macy's store in Queens and literally right next door, we have a Backstage store there as well, and we haven't seen a negative transfer of business from the main store to the Backstage store. So that gives us more encouragement about the possibility of putting the Backstage stores within Macy's stores when we do that test.","And so I will also say on the 2% to 3%, there's going to be a growing percent of the business is going to be on our digital platform, certainly related to omnichannel. One of the complicated things about our business is that we're going to continue to aggressively support omnichannel shopping, but in many cases the customer is actually looking at her phone first, deciding where to go, coming in to the store, spending time inside the store, talking with our associates, maybe even trying the product on and then buying the product from us later, either that day or putting it in her basket and buying it a day or two days later.","And so we don't necessarily believe that that sale would take place if they didn't have the store experience, but when you look at the store impact, that's a negative for the store in terms of time invested, expense invested versus \u2013 and a positive for the online business, who is getting the credit for the sale.","So that's why we have to continue to look at these as overall omnichannel transaction as opposed to one versus the other. But it does create a complication for us in making sure that we understand just how many stores we need, how far will the customer drive to, try on this product once they've discovered it on their mobile device or their tablet device. And so those are the kind of things that we're thinking through but we think over time that nets to more and more of the business to continue to come from digital. And as I've said, we're growing at a double digit rate and we're already the seventh largest Internet retailer in America today, so more of the mix will come from purely how we calculate, the way I've just described it, in the online category portion of the business.","Paul L. Lejuez - Citi","Great. Thanks and good luck.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys, good morning. Karen, I know you gave a little bit of detail on the SG&A plans, but since the $500 million is a pretty big number, it sounds like it's fairly early on. I'm just kind of curious if you could give us a little more help on how you guys thought about building up to that number since it is a pretty large number. Any areas \u2013 I think it's even larger than $500 million if we take your language that says it's net of growth initiatives, right?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, the intent would be it would be larger than $500 million, so that it would be net of the investment in growth initiatives.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","And I will repeat what you said, which is it's really too early to talk about how we will get there. As you know, though, we've been pretty good at getting expense cuts once we commit to them.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Maybe you could talk \u2013 just ask a little bit more about Backstage in particular, the hybrid model. As we look across the sector and just think a little bit higher level here, we've seen lots of scenarios where retailers have gone maybe a bit too far in promotional intensity and had trouble backing up after training a consumer to expect that very heavy discount. And Terry said you guys have been a promotional retailer for a long time and policed this in your stores and with your business, but how do you think about potentially cannibalizing a full-price store \u2013 or full-price sale rather, from your stores with a Backstage inside that store and what are the guardrails you look at to keep that from being a drag on the AURs longer-term?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think the key thing, Michael, is that's why we're testing. In our model that led us to feel really good about the opportunity here, we did assume some cannibalization, A) because we're taking square feet away; and, B) because we do think there will be some categories where customers may choose Backstage over the main Macy's. But we think in the longer-term, it may enable us to do more things in the Macy's store so there would be less overlap. So we actually think this could be a really cool combination of concepts over time.","But in the math, we have assumed cannibalization. And we don't know. We, by the way, had also assumed that the Backstage free-standing would hurt the main store, and in the end, that hasn't happened. So it again is why we keep testing things, because you can't \u2013 with all the analytics in the world, it's very hard to predict what the customer is going to do when she's given real choices. And so we're anxious to get these first, no more than 10 stores open next year, these hybrid stores, and really see what happens.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could just ask one final question, I apologize; I know in the past, we've talked about keeping the optionality open on the off-price strategy. Should we take the announcement today that go-it-alone is the plan for the foreseeable future, and that you've looked across the landscape and don't see anything that you'd rather just acquire at this time?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think we're still evolving with our strategy. At this point, we think we're going to be opening up the 50 new stores over the next couple of years.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo Securities.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Karen, I had a question for you with respect to your comments about keeping an investment grade rating, and I understand that and appreciate it. In the past, you have had a 2.4 times to 2.7 times target leverage range, and I think that also contemplated the IG rating. So my question is, at this point, do you have any more details that you can give us in terms of either a target leverage range, a credit rating range, or if not, if we can anticipate maybe a finer point on some of your comments with respect to the investment grade rating in the future?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think, Todd, what I would say is we have made what I'd call a slight change in the calculation methodology rather than a change in our leverage target. We did update our adjusted leverage calculation to reflect the change in Moody's treatment of operating leases. So if we calculated on the new basis, our leverage target becomes 2.5 times to 2.8 times. But again, I'd characterize that as a change in calculation methodology, not a change in leverage.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","And having said that, for the right strategic opportunity, as has always been the case, we would consider moving outside of the stated range assuming we were confident we would get back within the range before too long.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess just one follow-up question to that. Commercial paper I think in the past has been a factor that you like to have, but it may not be a requirement. Can you just talk about that with respect to, is that something that you continue to value?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think as you said, you said it correctly, we like to have it. Obviously, we're in the commercial paper market quite significantly right now, and we think it's the right way to finance a seasonal business like our own. Having said that, if we didn't have it, we do have the bank line. So I can't tell you we need it, but it certainly is an efficient way for us to finance the business, given the seasonality.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Can you speak to how you're thinking about the investment grade rating in the context of some of the real estate alternatives being explored? Should we see any proceeds directed to that paydown? Or is there room to flex the current rating to accommodate share buybacks?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think that's a version of the question that Todd just asked. So I think the best way of saying it is that our target leverage is the 2.5 times to 2.8 times that I just talked about. And could that vary a little? Sure. But we do believe that Macy's needs the financial flexibility that comes with an investment grade rating.","Priya Joy Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I see. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America","Karen, you executed a pretty significant balance of the share repurchase in the first three quarters of the year. Should we expect you to back away from that a little bit until the sales variability stabilizes? Or would you think about continuing at the same pace?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We believe that we have adequate liquidity to continue to buy back the stock. Having said that, I'm not predicting at what pace we'll be buying it.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","But we do have the liquidity to be able to do so.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America","Right. And then given the variability that some of these large real estate transactions could cause over the coming years, how do you think about the payout ratio for your dividend?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, it's one of those subjects that the board addresses every year. And they will continue to do so. For this year's decision, we all felt that having a competitive dividend in the range that we've been at, made sense. And again, the board will continue to revise the analysis behind that.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen White Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for all the color and going over for questions. Given the tougher traffic trend, but solid growth online, as you look at specific delivery areas, are the strongest online markets the weakest in-store markets, and as a corollary, can you talk about how you're evaluating the right number of stores longer-term in this environment?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I haven't looked at that specifically, Stephen, but we tend to find that we do best in lines where our stores are strongest. So, I actually think they work together as we said, as opposed to one cannibalizing the other. And our store analysis will always be, we look at the cash flow from operating a store given what we think the trend in sales will be over time and compare that to the opportunity of selling the store, getting out of a lease, doing whatever.","Stephen White Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. That's helpful.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","And then obviously, we do take into consideration the math around online; for example, we know that online returns will happen someplace else if you close a store. We also know when we close a store, macys.com does less well, or bloomingdales.com in their context, but that methodology won't change.","Stephen White Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then one other quick follow-up on \u2013 I think it was Backstage, can you just talk to any difference in the packing and distribution that you've found and whether there may be any required step-up in the supply chain or investment at some point?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It is a very different business, particularly on the subjects you're talking about. So should we continue to expand at this rate, at some point there will need to be capital invested to help on the back of the house operation.","Stephen White Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But at this point you can support this with your existing distribution.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","At this point, yes.","Stephen White Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, all very helpful. Thanks so much. Good luck this holiday.","Karen M.

In terms of tourism factor, it was called out that the one-year midpoint is December. Should we expect a 100-basis point drag to the fourth quarter comp? And do you have any sense if Chinese tourists are still traveling to the U.S. after the stock market turmoil they experienced in the summer?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I can't predict how much it's going to impact us. Our hope and expectation is that it will be better than the 1.5 points that we experienced in the third quarter. In some countries, the trend actually got worse in the third quarter, so I think it's a complicated subject, but our expectation is the impact will be less than the 1.5 points that we talked about.","And to your second question, Chinese customers are still coming to the United States, not to the degree that they had been buying last year. I don't know specifically in terms of how many people are coming, but from the sales perspective it's not as great as it had been, but not one of the countries where we're seeing the biggest decline.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, great.

Wanted to follow up on a lot of the conversation around gross margin; you guys are thinking differently about a lot of aspects in your business. There's obviously a lot of change with the consumer, the new technologies, digital, a lot of shifts going on in your business (74:39). How do you think about the gross margin model that you work with your vendors? Have you thought differently about that? Is it potentially something you would put on the table as you kind of think about the new paradigm of the consumer and in discussions with vendors is it something you'd put on the table in terms of potentially rethinking how to do it and...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not sure that that is needed. Working with our vendors to help improve the sales and profitability of the business is one of the things our merchants focus on all day long. So, yes, we're always looking to work with them to improve our mutual business both in terms of sales and profitability.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then help us understand the dynamic around that same conversation 3Q to 4Q, into the next year? Where's the tipping point? Is it really just the comp level and inventory level, where there becomes a little bit of a tipping point in terms of how that burden is shared?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not sure I understand the question.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Well, it sounds like there's a little bit more gross margin pressure expected?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Oh, oh, oh. Well, if you think about the third quarter, we had very weak sales. As I said we're coming into the fourth quarter with excess inventory, most of which or a lot of which relates to the cold weather businesses and we did not want to take the markdowns and start clearing those goods in October because it will get cold. So it felt like we'd be taking price cuts too early and we would rather liquidate that merchandise when the customer's going to come in and want it. So that's why the margin shift is happening between quarter three and quarter four.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Okay. I understand. But the conversation with vendors doesn't necessarily change around the promotionality and the markdown support?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No. No.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you so much for taking my question and the detail that you've given us. A couple of quick questions for Karen and Terry; number one, of the $500 million that you're targeting for further reductions, how much is that going to come from store closings, just the natural SG&A that you save there? Number two, what are your expectations for credit income going forward? And number three, a sort of strategic question. Over the last 18 months, the reach and breadth of Macy's as an organization has dramatically expanded; Middle East, China, off-price, licenses in the stores. Is it possible the organization is sort of losing focus at this stage of the game and not spending enough time on its core business?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Michael, let me take the first couple of questions. At this point, we're really not ready to break out the $500 million or how it will happen, including the subject on credit. Obviously the credit profitability is a function of the sales that we're getting and therefore the credit sales and profitability. So I think we need to see the fourth quarter before I can comment on that specifically, and the $500 million we'll get back to. And remember, the savings is more than $500 million; the $500 million is the net number.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And, Michael, on the focus on the core business, I can assure you that the organization is very, very focused on the core business. If the core business does not perform, then all these other initiatives cannot make up the difference. We have to perform in the core business. But I can assure you that there is a small group of people, under the leadership of Peter Sachse, that are totally dedicated to these other subjects and have nothing to do with the core business and vice versa.","So we created a new organization under Peter Sachse of new business development, which supervises international; he now supervises Bluemercury, he supervises off-price. So his group is totally dedicated to those businesses and there's no overlap or mixing up from the leadership of the core business.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you so much for your comments.","Operator","We'll go next to Stacie Rabinowitz with Consumer Edge Research.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research LLC","I had sort of a turnaround of the question you guys were talking about regarding vendors earlier. Because so many of your vendors have been reporting weaker results than in the past, are you seeing any \u2013 do you think it's an overall kind of industry at that level and for clothing issue or are you seeing some variability in performance from different brands you carry, your private brands, Macy's versus Bloomingdale's; anything out there?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think we talked about general weakness in the apparel categories. There are areas that are doing well, we talked about active, juniors, dresses, so it's not that there's uniform weakness in apparel, but there has been weakness. And we're constantly looking to help our big vendors get better and help find new vendors that have the most-wanted products, including by the way our own private brand.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I'd like to say that, you can just see it as clearly as we can just that some of these larger brands report their own results that either you believe or you don't believe that some of these big brands are going to get it right, they're going to make the necessary changes, they're going to get fashion components correct, they're going to get the basic inventory planned properly and that they're going to respond and they're going to improve their results.","And so the business, as we've said, is cyclical, there's no question about it, but these guys that we're talking about, specifically the ones that have the largest relationships with us, they'll get it right, it's just a matter of whether it be the first quarter or the second quarter delivery or which one will it be. If you believe like I do, that we're going to work very closely together and identify trends, work with them on future deliveries, we're going to get these things right then you have some confidence that both the vendors and our company will benefit from that.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Are there any small vendors in the categories where you're seeing weakness that are doing well or newer trends that are kind of outperforming the category average?","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, we can't talk, and that's why I'm trying to specifically stay away from names of vendors because I know that my comments, as we are so important to them, will influence their value of their company. So I can't specifically talk, but the answer is yes, but I can't specifically name them and tell you who they are.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research LLC","No, that's all right. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just one quick question; on the inventory levels, can you just talk to any cancellations or adjustments you've made both for your branded merchandise or your private brands, just around the numbers that you're reporting today, like end of October numbers and just how aggressive you've been to try to get that to a better place in terms of inventory?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think the key thing, Bob, is we are always aggressive at addressing our forward-looking receipt plans and expectations, category by category, vendor by vendor, there's not really one overall answer, but whenever a business is trending better, we're chasing goods, and when a vendor is not doing well, we're trying to figure out ways of not having too many receipts coming in, so I would say this year is no different. It's just obviously a little more extreme.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And I think earlier I think Terry mentioned the consumer trading down from time to time, would you expect a bigger focus on some of your private brands as we look through the next several quarters?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, our private brands I wouldn't put in the category of trading down. If you think about INC it happens to be well priced, but the quality and the fashion sensibility of that product is spectacular. And I would not call that trading down at all. And fortunately, speaking of INC, it is doing quite well at this point, so we feel very good about brands like that going forward. So, don't always think private brand is being trading down. If you think about hotel in the home world, doing extremely well in textiles and again it's the most expensive textile product we have on the floor.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Goodbye.","Operator","We'll go next to Larry Haverty with GAMCO.","Lawrence J. Haverty - GAMCO Investors, Inc","Yes, hi, Karen and Terry. I'm just curious, you guys get the best financial advice in the world and I'm worried about whether your financial advisors are briefing you on the idea that this company could essentially be bought by its dividend. And I'll walk you through it. The dividend right now is 3.5%. If you gross it up for taxes, it's 5.2%. It's not too terribly difficult to do an LBO, I suspect, at 10% and half the financing costs would be the dividend. So the math is just incredibly persuasive, especially given the free cash flow that this company generates.","I'm wondering if within the company that's been discussed? If not, why not, and how in fact do you cope with it? Because the other side of it is that the economics of share repurchase, as you know, have just gotten absolutely compelling, especially with the level of the dividend being what it is.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think, Larry, all I can tell you is as you've said, we have the best advisors in the world and we're looking at absolutely everything.","Lawrence J. Haverty - GAMCO Investors, Inc","Okay. So this is not something that hasn't been considered.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Sorry, was that a question?","Lawrence J. Haverty - GAMCO Investors, Inc","Yes, I mean that you think...","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Larry...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Larry, all I can tell you is we're looking at every possible opportunity, and you know that.","Lawrence J. Haverty - GAMCO Investors, Inc","Thanks a lot, Karen.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Grom with Sterne Agee CRT.","Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks a lot. Most of my questions have been asked, but just, Karen and Terry, bigger picture here; your comps are down a lot, transactions are down a lot, but you've got some company out there. I mean Whole Foods is comping negative; there's a lot of retailers that are seeing a big deceleration in trends. But given your breadth, the type of product you sell, are you seeing anything out there that tells you that we're really kind of on the impetus (85:46) of a real pullback in consumer spending, something of the like that we saw back in 2008 and 2009? And the weather, which obviously is an issue, tourism is an issue, but there's just a bigger picture problem out there?","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, look, it's a fair question. Someone asked me just earlier this morning, is this similar to 2008 and 2009, and my answer is absolutely no. It's not similar because then it was a crystal-clear massive pullback by consumers and we literally saw them stop shopping the day of the Lehman Brothers collapse. The next day business dropped dramatically, we just saw consumers stop spending for a strong period of time. So this is different. This is what we've seen, a slowdown, as you said, in transactions particularly in this last quarter. We also here can see that the fundamentals of the economy are in much better shape than they were in 2008 and 2009. We can point to the tourism purchasing issue.","At some point, I can't tell you if the dollar's going to change in terms of its strength in the near-term; and in fact, I don't expect it will. But over time it will adjust and that subject will improve in terms of our ability to sell more products to tourists. At some point in time the weather will normalize. And so when I put all of that into the way that we look at the total business potential, I think you have to say we got to get through the fourth quarter, it's so important, it's such a big part of the overall business and when those subjects start to \u2013 the tourist subject begins to anniversary itself and the weather pattern begins to normalize and then you look at it and say there's really no improvement, then I think your point could be valid, but I'm not expecting that to be the case. I am expecting there'll some improvement when those two subjects year round and normalize.","Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Great. And then just, Karen, just on the asset sales, the $4.20 to $4.30, can you just sort of break down what you perceive to be as one-time versus recurring, just so we can think about 2016 from a modeling perspective?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I think in terms of \u2013 I don't know that I'd call it one-time, but the one thing that, as you've heard me break out, has been Brooklyn. And the gain, the $250 million gain. But things like Seattle, we hope to be able to replicate. Maybe not with one transaction but as we're modeling 2016 and thinking about SG&A, the only transaction that we're viewing differently would be Brooklyn.","Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Great. Hang in there. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Can you talk a little bit about Bloomingdale's and how Bloomingdale's did relative to Macy's? And lastly, the credit card penetration was up I think to 49.3%, up 60 basis points. So, it's obviously showing a difference in locals versus tourists, anywhere where you saw difference in locals' performance and how you think about that? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","On the credit subject, Dana, we are obviously very pleased with that result and I do think as you said, it's a function of having less international tourists and it tends in these kinds of periods, our loyal customers tend to come out more when business is weaker, so I think that's also part of the proprietary credit good news. In terms of Bloomingdale's, I would say the trends are actually \u2013 have the same issues that Macy's does, in fact in the international tourist business, that's an even bigger impact on Bloomingdale's given where their locations are.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I would say, Dana, they're similar trends, but to Karen's point, Bloomingdale's is even more highly penetrated in the Northeast, weather issues and more highly penetrated international, New York, particularly as a percent of their 37 stores as opposed to Harold Square being a percent to our 750-plus Macy's stores. But I think overall when you look at it, I would say, it's quite similar, so there was no major difference in the more upscale consumer of Bloomingdale's than there is for the more mid-household income consumer of Macy's. It was really the swing was more along the lines that I've just described with that international tourism and the concentration of our business in the Northeast.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back to Karen Hoguet for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Great. Well, thank you, and thank you for your patience today, it was a longer than usual call. I know there's a lot of material in the release and obviously call me, call Matt, Sarah, Ryan (90:56), et cetera, we'll try to get back to you as quickly as we can and help you with any of the details that you need help with.","Terry J. Lundgren - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And just to know that I think we've said it loud and clear, but we are going to be so, and continue to be so aggressive in terms of our work to right this shift, to get our business on track.

Good morning, and welcome to the Macy's, Inc. First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, and welcome to the Macy's, Inc. conference call. I'm Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","Sales in the first quarter were $5.771 billion or 7.4% below last year due both to the stores that we've closed in 2015 and the decline in comp sales. While we had planned comp sales to be below last year in the first quarter, our 5.6% decline on an owned plus licensed basis was worse than expected. On a two-year basis, the comp sales were down 2.9% per year.","While the quarter started stronger, the business weakened considerably versus our expectations beginning in mid-March, and that trend continued through April. As Terry said in our press release, we are seeing weakness in consumer spending levels in apparel and related categories. The number of transactions declined 7% in the quarter, which is far worse than what was experienced last year. This is the proxy, as you know, for traffic.","AUR, average unit retail, was up slightly and units per transaction was up approximately 1%. Additionally, we continued to be negatively impacted by reduced spending by international tourists. Sales on international tourist credit cards were down 20% in the quarter on top of a 21% drop last year in the first quarter. This reduction in spending impacted our comp by a little less than a point versus last year. This was disappointing and had a disproportionately negative impact on our center core businesses given what these visitors buy.","Given that our stores are concentrated in major tourist markets, this is a big factor for us and we are no longer confident that it will improve anytime soon. While we are focusing on increasing our share of the domestic tourist business, we don't think we can offset all of the loss on the international side.","There were some businesses in the quarter that performed relatively well; fine jewelry, dresses, active, fragrances, coats, men's tailored clothing, housewares and furniture. However, the significant weakness in other parts of our assortments more than offset these good news stories. The softer businesses included handbags, fashion watches, women's shoes, kids, men's furnishings and luggage. Regionally, we continued to see weakness in our major tourist markets which as mentioned before are many of our largest markets.","Our performance in Texas was also disappointing. We achieved our strongest performances in markets across the country that are less dependent on international tourism, but are also smaller, such as North Carolina, Southern Virginia, Columbus, Ohio, Oregon and New England. Digital sales continued strong, still growing double digits, but it too grew less rapidly than anticipated. Bloomingdale's trends were also weak due to the same trends impacting Macy's. One major success in the quarter was the rollout of Last Act, our centralized clearance areas for most of women's and men's apparel within the Macy's stores. Merchandise in these parts of our stores are marked with a clearance price and they are not eligible for additional discounts nor coupons. Sales of these goods were up high single digits, driven entirely by the higher average unit retail.","Backstage, our off-price concept, also had a good quarter. We are particularly pleased with how our first two Backstage in-stores opened, one in Nanuet, New York and the other in Waterbury, Connecticut. We are hoping these stores bring in new customers as well as add share of wallet of existing customers. So far, both objectives are being reached, but it is premature to claim success. We just opened four more and we expect to open approximately nine more this year. If this strategy works, we could roll it out to approximately 250 to 300 of our Macy's stores. Gross margin in the first quarter was 39.1%, up 10 basis points from last year's level. We ended the quarter with comp inventory down 0.8%. Total inventory was down 3.2% due both to the comp drop as well as the closed stores.","While we are satisfied with our overall inventory level, the slowness in selling of warm weather goods will put pressure on our gross margin rate in the second quarter. SG&A in the first quarter, excluding the retirement plan-related settlement charges, was $1.966 billion, down $57 million or 2.8% below last year. In the quarter, we benefited from the restructuring completed at year end. The expense flex on the lower sales and lower retirement expense, offset in part by omnichannel-related expense as well as the expense additions associated with Bluemercury, Backstage and China.","Credit income was $182 million in the quarter, $3 million above last year. While our proprietary credit card penetration of 45.9% was 100 basis points above last year, credit sales were below last year due to the overall sales trend. We still expect credit income to be slightly below last year on an annual basis primarily as a result of the sales decline. Asset sales gains in the quarter were $14 million, $4 million associated with Brooklyn and $10 million for other asset sales. This compares to $20 million in the first quarter last year.","During the fourth quarter conference call a few months ago, we explained that we would have non-cash charges for settlement accounting related to our retirement plans going forward. We expected these charges to be triggered because of the increase in lump sum distribution associated with our store closings, voluntary separation program and organizational restructuring. This charge was $13 million in the quarter and we are still assuming approximately $135 million for the full year. These charges, as you saw, are broken out separately on the P&L and are not included in our guidance.","Operating income, excluding these settlement charges, was $289 million, down from last year's $409 million. As a percent of sales, operating income on this basis was 5% as compared to 6.6% last year. Interest expense was $98 million. Tax expense was $63 million with an effective rate of 35.4%, down from last year's 38.5% due to the timing of some tax settlements. We still expect the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37%.","Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest was $1 million versus none last year. Net income attributable to Macy's, excluding the settlement charges, was $125 million as compared to $193 million a year ago. Average share count on a diluted basis was 313.5 million shares, down 9.5% from last year's 346.5 million shares.","EPS on a diluted basis, excluding the settlement charges, was $0.40 as compared to $0.56 a share last year. In the quarter, cash flow from operating activities net of investing activities was a use of $203 million this year versus a use of $328 million last year. The major variances were last year's Bluemercury acquisition offset by lower net income and less cash coming from previously escrowed funds from asset sales this year.","During the quarter, we bought back $129 million of stock or 3 million shares under our repurchase program versus $385 million last year. As you saw in our press release, we are focusing our efforts in three areas to improve our performance this year. One, speed up and scale up things that are working. This includes initiatives such as our jewelry pilot, Backstage in-store, beauty, including Bluemercury expansion, active and Last Act.","Two, we will excite customers with greater newness and more exclusive merchandise. You saw some examples of this in our press release, of exciting new collaborations and brands being introduced at Macy's. We also have a renewed focus on products that can only be found at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's, including our private brands, exclusive brands and exclusive product from the major brands.","And third, we are digging deeper to find expense reduction opportunities to free up money to invest in improving customer service, both in-store and online. Technology will obviously play a major role here.","While we hope to see some improvement in our sales trends during the second quarter, most of these actions are expected to have a bigger impact in the fall and particularly in the fourth quarter.","With the evolving role of our stores, understanding opportunities with our real estate has become increasingly important. Doug Sesler, our new Executive Vice President of Real Estate, has jumped right in and is learning fast. He is continuing the work in progress to explore potential opportunities for creating value through joint ventures or other partnerships for our mall-based properties as well as our flagship properties. This is very complex, but I can say that the interest is very strong and I believe we will have some good options, but it will take time to evaluate. At the same time, he and our real estate team are seeking to monetize unproductive real estate.","While we are excited about our business driving initiatives, we have lowered our expectations for the year, particularly the second quarter. For the year as a whole, we are now expecting comp owned plus licensed sales to be down 3% to down 4%. The upper end of this guidance, the down 3%, implies a similar trend for the remaining nine months of the year to the first quarter trend on a two-year basis, down 2.9% per year.","As stated earlier, most of our new initiatives will not have a meaningful impact until the back half of the year. As a result, we don't expect comp sales in the second quarter to be significantly better than that in the first quarter.","Also, as you know, the year-over-year comparisons get easier in the third quarter and fourth quarter given the weakness last year. We also are hoping for a more normal winter.","We are now assuming that our gross margin rate for the full year will be approximately flat to last year. And as mentioned earlier, we are working hard to reduce expense dollars given the lower sales outlook while trying very hard to minimize any impact to our customers. Expense dollars are now assumed to be below last year for the full year, but the rate as a percent of sales will still be higher. We are no longer expecting to be able to increase our EBITDA as a percent of sales this year, but we still believe that we will return to our 14% target, which we achieved just two years ago in 2014. Our EPS guidance for the year is now $3.15 to $3.40 per share, excluding settlement charges.","All of us have been reading the stream of negative news stories about various retailers over the past several weeks. Clearly, our industry is in something of a rough patch. We know we are not alone. But the consumer seems to be doing okay. Employment is steady and wages continue to rise. The consumer savings rate remains high and most macroeconomic indicators are better than flat. So it's reasonable to conclude that the consumer will return to more aggressive discretionary spending at some point, hopefully sooner than later.","As we described today, we at Macy's, Inc. are taking tangible action now to mitigate the current headwinds and drive profitable sales. And as the overall tide rises, we believe we will be very well-positioned to capitalize on new opportunities. We have always said that a down period in our industry is a great time for us to pursue gains in long-term market share. We are not counting on consumers to spend more this year, but we are working hard to give them reasons to shop more with us.","As Terry has said, a setback is a setup for a comeback. That is how we are looking at the business, even if our comeback is taking longer than expected to take root. We have a lot of newness in our pipeline. Not everything will work, of course, but we think that our proposition for the customer will be fresh and compelling in 2016, especially as we head into the all-important fourth quarter.","And we are absolutely not pulling back our commitment to digital and omnichannel retailing. Mobile remains a very high priority, and we continue to invest. You may have seen that a leading trade publication last month ranked Macy's, Inc. as the sixth largest online retailer in America, and as I said earlier, we are continuing to see double-digit year-over-year sales increases in online sales. While we have already somewhat downsized our fleet of stores, we continue to see value and opportunity in physical locations that sync with desktops, websites, apps and mobile in giving customers choices and meeting demand in new and different ways.","We would all prefer to be talking about sales and earnings increases today. We have confidence in our management team and organization to lead us in the direction of a recovery, and we are thankful for the heritage of innovation and the strength of outstanding brands on which we will continue to build.","So, now it's time for questions. So, who has the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Lorraine.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","How quickly can you adjust your inventory commitments to reflect your new sales plan? And specifically how do you plan for a winter after such a warm one last year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Those are two good questions. First, remember, a good chunk of our inventory is on replenishment, and so that gets adjusted based on sales, so we really don't have to do anything to change that piece of it. And the replenishment is not just what we would call basics. There is some fashion on replenishment as well, so that adjusts with sales trends automatically. But that's in part why we re-looked at the fall plan when we did. We're hopeful that what we've seen in the last \u2013 in the end of the quarter is unusual and the trends will improve, but we thought we should not take the risk of waiting, so that we could make a meaningful adjustment to our inventory and receipt plans as well as expense for the back half of the year.","Your second question on how do you plan after a winter like last year? That's one of the interesting questions we've all been debating. We are actually planning it to be \u2013 I'm sorry, cold weather merchandise to be relatively flat with last year, but if there is what we would call a normal winter, that would give us upside opportunity. Now, 2014 was an unusually cold winter, so we're sort of looking at half of the difference between 2014 as being what we think is reasonable and that's over $100 million in additional cold weather merchandise sales, so that would be helpful to the top line.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great. And then your newly lowered EBITDA forecast obviously impacts your credit ratios. Is there any change in how you're thinking about share buyback versus debt repayments?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think you saw in the first quarter, we did buy back less than a year ago relating to the cash flow forecast for the year. We remain committed to getting to a leverage ratio that we've targeted, the 2.5 times to 2.8 times. Obviously, we're a little above that today. Our hope is to be able to get there through EBITDA as opposed to reducing the debt. But we will have to see how things progress from here.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Karen","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, if we exclude the 100 basis points tourism headwinds, I mean, clearly, the underlying trend has deteriorated. I don't think you're alone on this, either. But any signs of stabilization you've seen at all with traffic? And then larger picture, any anecdotes you're seeing from the consumer or even by category which reminds you at all of 2008?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","That's a good question. I haven't looked at it in that context. Look, I'm not going to comment on early May sales. We've done that before and usually the first couple of weeks of a quarter don't necessarily predict it. Had I done that in February, the first quarter would've been very different. So, for now, we're assuming that what we saw in the first quarter could continue on a two-year basis. Again, we hope we're wrong and we hope there's improvement and there was something fluky in the last six weeks of the quarter. But I don't know enough to say that, and I don't know about going back to 2008. I'll do that and look more into it. I'm not sure. When you look at the economic trends, you would say that's not the case, but I'm not sure.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up, can you talk about the competitive landscape you're seeing out there? Any plans? Or do you see the need to increase promotional intensity, and just how you feel about inventory in the channel?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I think the competitive environment has become a lot more promotional. I think part of this is a result of the Internet where every promotion happens across the country immediately. And also there's a lot of price matching going out with some of the (23:59) with some of the competitors and there's some irrational behavior that I think is giving us some challenges, and that's in part why we lowered the expectation around gross margin a bit from what we had said earlier in the year.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, best of luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Question on gross margin. A little bit surprised that given the environment and all that you were up 10 basis points in the first quarter. So looking back on it, could you or should you have been more promotional? And can you give us some guidance in terms of what the implications might be for second quarter gross margins? And then a follow-up question would be, can you comment on delinquency trends, which was a point you raised in the fourth quarter earnings call? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. As I've said, we do expect the second quarter gross margin to be under pressure because of the slow selling in warm weather goods, so I do think there will be \u2013 we'll have a less good second quarter gross margin performance than in the first quarter. I don't think, had we promoted more, the first quarter would've been a lot different, but that's the question we're certainly asking ourselves as we move forward. But I would not expect that performance in the second quarter to continue. And again, you heard the guidance for the year as being flattish.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","And \u2013 yes.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Delinquency levels remain somewhat elevated post our credit conversion, but the level is still within what I would call our normal range and certainly within the range of our other issuers. Also the level continues to come down, so I do not think it's concerning at this point.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Question on the center core slowdown. Was curious outside of the tourist impact, did you see the domestic business slow as well in the handbags, watches and footwear? And then the other question is on SG&A, are you giving us any kind of number on top of the $400 million with the savings you're looking for this year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","On the domestic part of the center core, it declined as well, but the international piece of it made it worse than it otherwise would've been. So, we saw the declines in the domestic business also. And in terms of SG&A, I don't have an additional target at this time. We're obviously working on what that could be.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Terrific. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You mentioned online was a bit weaker than expected, but still growing double digits. Can you just talk about how the regional trends compare to what was in-store and maybe even provide any other color you can on key online metrics such as conversion, traffic, et cetera?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think what we find that the online business, where it's strong, tends to be similar to the store business. So I don't see there's a big regional difference in terms of the online business.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What about as it relates to the key metrics? And I guess as a follow-up, you'd mentioned price transparency is increasing online. How does that impact your view of consolidated gross margin longer-term?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think the transparency is in part why we lowered the guidance for margin. When we released the fourth quarter, we'd talked about the gross margin being up this year and we no longer think that will be the case. So I think that's where that came into play.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Paul.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A few just related questions around real estate, I just wanted to reconfirm for the year that the plan remains for gains in the amount of around $235 million, which includes $86 million from Brooklyn. I also just wanted to enquire, on store count, obviously you closed a number of doors at the very beginning of the year. Is there a likelihood of any further adjustments prior to year end?","And then lastly on the real estate side, you mentioned the success of Backstage, those first few doors. Can you give us a little bit more color on the difference in productivity or traffic that you're seeing within that part of the store versus the balance?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","So, the asset sale gains, that's the easy one. There's no change in our guidance for the asset sale gains between Brooklyn and the other stores. So, the $235 million would be the best guidance I could give you today on that.","In terms of the store count, as you know, we're always evaluating stores in terms of should there be any closures as we go forward, and at this point, I've nothing to report in terms of what we might do this year, but we're constantly looking at that store fleet as you've seen every year that I can remember.","And in terms of Backstage in-store, it's too early to be talking about those kinds of statistics. Obviously, we are pleased with what's happening, but with a couple of weeks of history, I'm not going to give statistics yet.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then just to follow up on the stores, you've often talked about the Top 150 doors. Is there a meaningful spread between the performance of those doors versus the balance of the fleet?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, the problem is many of the Top 150 doors are also our top tourist doors. So, in a normal year, we would see the Top 150 doing a lot better. That's not the case now because of the slow tourist business, but we are pleased with the results that we're getting, separate from what's happening on the international tourist side.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Karen, good morning. Thanks for taking the question here.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Just to get a cadence for our model, I think you said that second quarter gross margin on a year-over-year basis would be a little worse than first quarter. I think originally for the year you said third quarter would be a decline in gross margin. Is that still the right thinking in terms of cadence?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not sure. We're still planning the fall season, so I still think the pressures in the third quarter will be there, given last year relative to the fourth quarter, so I think what I said originally would make sense.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","But we'll see as we plan the fall and we'll talk about that in August.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then as we listen to some of the other conference calls across the space lately from some of the bigger brands that are public companies, there seems to be more comments bubbling up about concerns in the department store channel that seem like they've taken more of a focus to the long-term. How have the conversations with your bigger brands changed? Are you seeing more brands asking questions about some of your lower-tiered door counts? Are you see more brands pushing back on being included as some of the sales that you guys like to run to drive traffic? And if so, how does it impact your merchandising strategy?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I mean, I think there are lots of conversations going on with our big brands, as you would expect. I'm not sure there's a chicken and egg in here, too. But we're both working hard to figure out what's the right path forward, so that we both can grow profitably. And those conversations are going on, as you might expect, a little bit more deeply today just given the weaker businesses.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Kimberly.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm wondering about your commentary on the price transparency that's created by digital commerce and that does appear to be playing a role in merchandise margin erosion. It strikes me that perhaps this issue could be a bit more structural rather than transitory, and I'm wondering if you agree with that. If yes, are there other levers that you can pull in order to help get the business back to that 14% EBITDA target other than merchandise margin?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I don't think it's transitory, so I agree with that statement. But we were not counting on gross margin to be hugely helpful in getting us to the 14%. So I'm not sure there's really a change in our thinking there. We had expected sales productivity and expense to really help us get back to the 14%. So, a little bit of margin just getting back to a normal level after last year, but I don't disagree with your first statement. One of the things we're all focusing on is having more exclusive merchandise that you could only get at Macy's and you can't price compare it as easily, but also giving the customer just a better experience so that she's more likely to come in and buy from us at regular price.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All that makes a lot of sense. My last question -- you commented on the fourth quarter earnings call about a slight increase in credit delinquencies that may have been temporary related to the holiday or perhaps loosening of some credit terms. I'm wondering if you can take a look at how that portfolio's performing and give us any insight or new learnings.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I think I just commented on that. The delinquency levels still remain a little elevated, but we think it's more a function of the system conversion that we did last fall as opposed to the customer being weaker. And we expect that level to come down as we go through the year, and the level today is still within the range of most issuers.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, any change or...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","So, not a concern.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Not a concern. And any change or update to your forecast for credit income this year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No. We still expect it to be down versus last year on an annual basis. There will be some odd trends by quarter, just given last year and this year's numbers and how they match up. But overall, we expect it to be down versus last year.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much, Karen.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, Karen. Thanks a lot. We had a bigger picture question for the 10-year picture in department stores. What do you think about the food, exercise, healthcare and Generation Z, like what role do you want department stores to play as cultural institutions as you think about generating traffic for the long-term and making sure that you have a really exciting bricks and mortar experience that really captivates the younger customer which has a lot of attention issues in terms of things happening? And then also on the center core issue, are there any key aspects we can focus on for positive aspects to really reinvigorate the center core?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Let me start with we absolutely agree with you that we need to work hard to make the bricks and mortar experience a lot more exciting and we're working on that and trying to test some concepts, one of which actually is the whole health and wellness. So we agree with you that making our bricks and mortar experiences even better is a very high priority, and we're really focused on that. And to your point, some of the things that we're looking at are the health and wellness arena, so we'll see as we go, but, again, agree with the basic theory that you have there.","In terms of center core, I would say a couple of things. One is the jewelry pilot rollout should be very helpful to that area and we think that will be good. I think also we're testing a shoe pilot similar to the jewelry \u2013 well, similar in terms of its focus on a specific category, different strategies, out in California this fall and we're hopeful that that will help the shoe business. We've got a lot up our sleeves in the beauty area, including the rollout of some more Bluemercury stores. So we do think it will get better. I don't know that it will return to the growth that we've had in recent years this fall, but we're hopeful.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you. And it sounds like you've been really thoughtful and prudent about how to promote in the safest way possible. So, with the warm weather goods that are elevated here, what's the methodology for how you'll think about promoting those in terms of which way do you feel most comfortable to mitigate and soften the least impact possible?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think the answer is we have lots of tools for clearing merchandise and I think you've found over the years, our gross margin has held up pretty well. So we balance all the different ways of doing it and now we have Last Act, which is working so well. So, I feel comfortable that our merchant team will figure out a way of dealing with the warm weather goods in a way that isn't irresponsible.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And just our last question, you were really helpful with your comments on what seemed like somewhat of an optimism on the way the customer and the economy is functioning. So how do you help us reconcile that versus what you're seeing and just how you're thinking about that bigger picture in terms of what seems like different trends fundamentally versus a certain health in the customer and the economy?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We're frankly scratching our heads. We see the same economic data you all see and it would point to a customer that would be spending more. I think that gets to what he and she are spending it on. Savings rates are high, which tells you that either they're purposefully saving more or that there's some of that savings that can be used for discretionary spending if they get motivated to do so. Some of it is spending in different categories; health, restaurants, travel. I'm not sure, but I would say that we too are somewhat puzzled by the data that we're seeing on the consumer and the traffic we're seeing in the stores and on the site. So, I think, we could \u2013 or watch. Thank you very much.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you and best regards.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Randy Konik with Jefferies & Company (sic) [Jefferies LLC] (40:11).","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Quick question, given the differences you're seeing in categories from a sell-through perspective, do you think about changing the density of category commitments in any way in terms of dedicating more or less of a store towards handbags or less towards handbags, watches, et cetera, given the changes we're seeing in that category? How should we think about ongoing long-term density changes from a category perspective?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I would say if you think about the strength of the department store, we have the ability to flex resources based on what's selling. So we're constantly looking for opportunities to make our space, particularly first floors of our stores, which are the center core categories, more productive. You don't want to change space based on a short-term trend, so there is some balancing there, but we are working very hard to make that space as productive as we can and you may see other categories growing and shrinking based on the sales trends, but that is the strength of the department store, our ability to do that.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","I guess a follow-up is, are there any categories that you're looking at where you're trying to change the density of commitment to that depth of category right now, given you said watches were weak, we see the wearables trend, et cetera, that's happening in the marketplace. How should we be thinking about specific categories?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, in that case, part of the answer will be becoming more aggressive in what customers want in the whole wearable tech side, so you will see a movement towards that. So again we are focused on making our space as productive as we can as well as our site.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And I guess one thing that didn't come up in the call was you spoke a bit about the trends around tourism markets. Is there any kind of variability in trend by geography where we may have seen more temperate climate versus more of the cold climate during the quarter? Just wanted to try to get some perspective there.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, weather continued to be an issue in the quarter. So obviously where we've had colder weather in the last six weeks, eight weeks, until recently, clearly has hurt the warm weather and the warmer February hurt on the cold weather goods. But honestly, after last year, I just couldn't talk about weather again today. But it continues to be an issue and, yes, we did see some changes, but they weren't as dominant as the tourist issues that we talked about.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Perfect. All right. Thanks for the help.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citigroup.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks. Hi, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Paul.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, can you talk about the performance of private label versus third-party brands and just remind us of the private label penetration versus what that looks like compared to last year? And then also just curious if you have an idea of how you're planning fourth quarter inventory at this point?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","On private brands, we made a lot of progress in the first quarter. One of the things our team there is doing is really paying attention to the Buy Now Wear Now mindset of the customers, which is getting to how we flow merchandise, which I think will be very important to the business and did help us in the first quarter. And also very much focused on editing some of our apparel brands had become somewhat duplicative and so we're really trying to edit and reduce overlap, which didn't necessarily help us in the first quarter, but will help us, as we believe, as we get to the fall season.","Another thing that's happened is we have worked on our home area and trying to add some interest and color and print into some of the home product which we're also seeing beginning to do well. So I think we are making changes and the private brand business is doing relatively well. So we'll continue to work on that because, as I said earlier, our exclusive product is very important to us as we go forward.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And what percent of total sales are private brands?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry. It's a little over 20%.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And did they outperform in this last quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It varies by area, but overall did very well.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And just last one, can you just talk about Doug Sesler? What's he specifically been asked to do and how is he incentivized?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, he's been asked to manage our real estate function and to work on the work that had been started last year on the flagships and the mall properties to see if there might be a joint venture partnership structure that would add shareholder value that make sense. So he's very focused on that and at the same time, as I said earlier, trying to monetize unproductive real estate.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And incentivization for him?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not going to comment on that.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, Karen. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Morning, Todd.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Wanted to ask you about the real estate initiatives. It looks like the options you're considering generally involve moving from owned real estate to a lease structure. And given that lease expense factors into your target leverage range, can you tell me if you engage in a transaction that increases your lease expense, is it fair to assume that you would consider options to reduce funded debt to maintain leverage within your targeted range?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, we'd have to. Again, we have said that any of these transactions would not jeopardize our investment-grade rating. So should we take on incremental rent expense that would change our leverage ratios, we would have to reduce the funded debt to make that happen.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Makes sense. And then related to that, with respect to your desire to maintain your investment-grade credit rating, can you say that that applies to all of your bonds as opposed to just your corporate credit rating?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not sure I understand that question, but the key is that we do want to be an investment-grade company, so I think that's true overall.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, and I guess where I was going was that any transaction you would consider, you would not look to subordinate some of the existing bonds.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I can't comment on structure, but the key is that we will be an investment-grade company.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Fair enough. Thank you, Karen.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow-ons. Karen, could you break out the number of exclusives or percent of your business that is both private label and third-party exclusive and what...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think the limited distribution product is north of 40%.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And I assume you see that going higher in the next year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Could you give a sense of how high?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No. And again, it's a hard number to move in a major way, so, again, I can't be specific, but that would be our intent.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And could you just talk about the in-store Backstage sourcing, how much of that is coming from actually in-store and how much from other sources?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Oh, none is coming from in-store. So it is being merchandised by a separate off-price organization and they are buying 100% of the goods not from sort of the other side of the store.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","And they're trying to buy categories of merchandise that complement within the main store, so things like toys and games, some electronic kind of products, gourmet food, if you can believe that, home d\u00e9cor, which has been a huge success for us, and some knock-down furniture pieces. So again trying not to compete with what's in the remainder of the store.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And just last question on marketing and the opportunity to shift some of your initiatives given the success on digital and social media in the fourth quarter to try and grab some more traffic.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, we have been shifting that and we plan to continue to do so, so I think that's all part of the plan as we look to accelerate the sales performance of the company.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","I know you just said a few minutes ago you didn't really want to spend too much time on weather. I wanted to ask one follow-up. It did seem like it was a bit warm early spring, a nice start to the spring and it's been colder and wet, at least in the Northeast. I'm trying to understand, I get the idea and maybe you've thought about this, that in a digital world, weather can have a bigger impact than it used to when everyone's got a store kind of in their pocket, or a pocket full of department stores in their phone and their computers. But, I'm trying to understand, why do you think that's not being made up with e-commerce and why that's not compensating for the loss of traffic?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'm not sure I understand why you think digital would make it up, and I agree with your statement. We did have warmer weather than usual in February and March, which hurt our cold weather sales, and when we got to April and the weather was cooler, it impacted the warm weather sales, but I'm not sure why digital would change that.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","No, well, everyone's got in their pocket a Internet full of department stores. Maybe there's less impetus to go out shopping if it's rainy and wet or the change in weather is not spurring...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think it's such a traffic issue, but it's \u2013 in February and it's warm, you're not going to buy the cold weather goods that we have in our stores or online. You're just going to not need it.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got it.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We do find, for example, when there used to be major snowstorms, the Internet business does go up. But this is not so much about store traffic as it is what people are buying, and when the weather is unseasonal, they're buying less seasonal merchandise.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Sure, the catalyst to buy.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","So, it's a different point, correct.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then a quick question on real estate. In the past, you'd expressed some caution around the idea of burdening the core operating business with any sort of significant rent expense or burden there. I'm assuming the company's and management views haven't changed on that aspect.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct. That was the whole conversation I just had with Todd.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","But that is correct.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Bob.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Just a couple of quick questions. Good morning. The first one is on the focus on more exclusive brands, can you just talk about your expectations around like net profitability with margin support and margin guarantees from the branded vendors, what your expectation is on the inventories and sort of net sell-throughs on some of the private, exclusive brands that you guys focus on? Is there more risk in that strategy, especially around weather and seasonal merchandise?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I would say that there's more risk, but there's also more reward, so I think it's both sides of it. And I think the key thing is from a customer perspective, what I think will help to drive traffic to Macy's, whether it be online or in-store, is having that unique special product that's at really good values. And I think these exclusive products, whether it be from a major brand or our own private brand, will be helpful to making that happen.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. And as you look to the rest of the year, you talk about greater newness and more exclusive. Are there any of the new collaborations or brands that you would call out that you're most excited about as we think for the remainder of 2016?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think you saw a lot of it in the press release, so obviously we put the ones we're most excited about in the press release, so I would just look there.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And then just the last question that I have is when you think about coming out of sort of the fourth quarter comp inventories, how much have you worked through on some of the excess merchandise? Is there like an excess from the fourth quarter versus your spring overage on inventories at this point that you could talk to, like separate the two as buckets?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, no, we're through the fourth quarter so-called overage, some of which we had purposefully kept over, thinking February would be colder, but we are through that overage, if you want to call it that, and by the way that's where Last Act was very helpful.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Okay, thanks for much, Karen.;","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. My question has to do with more details about one of the leading categories, beauty, if you can clarify whether the Bluemercury expansion is within Macy's traditional stores or this is just an acceleration of the freestanding store concept? And secondly, if you feel that you need to increase the number of beauty brands to compete with the specialty stores, and if so, how do you think that is going to impact the layout vis-\u00e0-vis your other plans that you've made with glasses and stuff like that that you've mentioned in the past? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, we're rolling out Bluemercury both freestanding and in-store, so I would say both there. We're planning to open 24 freestanding stores this year and 18 shop-in-shops for Bluemercury. And we're very excited about how they're performing and what they're going to be able to add to the Macy's location. So, that we feel good about. And we're also rolling out beyond these stores the proprietary brand from Bluemercury, M-61, which was just recently launched on macys.com. So that's also adding to our beauty arsenal.","And in terms of more brands, we're doing that in a couple of ways. One is we have our Impulse Beauty installations in so many of our stores, which are combination of smaller brands and we continue to bring new brands in and add to that footprint as we go forward. And on the upper end, you've got Bluemercury that also has a lot of these smaller brands. So, yes, we'll continue to do so and at the same time fully support the big cosmetics brands that are the bread and butter of our beauty department.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Just a quick follow-up, Karen. Just trying to understand the change in trend from 4Q to 1Q, obviously tourism and weather, you referred to seasonal categories been difficult in both quarters. That seems to be a common thread. Was the biggest change really a deceleration in the center core? And in addition, you guys focus on some top brands. Are you seeing a deceleration in the performance of some of your key organizing brands? Is that another, with obviously without naming them, but is that part of the challenge? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I would say if you look at the number of transactions in the fourth quarter, it was down 4%, and in the first quarter, it was down 7%. So something really changed on that dynamic which negatively impacted the business. Yes, center core did get weaker, but I think that \u2013 the sort of key categories and center core, but I think a lot of that relates to the international tourist business, so I think that's more of a factor there.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then one quick follow-up, if I could, on tourism, I mean, a lot of companies have been talking about fourth quarter was going to be the end of the headwind, then first quarter, then summer. You're basically saying it's going to continue based on the first quarter performance. Do you look at certain metrics to try to predict that, whether it's hotel bookings or flight bookings coming from Europe? Or are you just saying, look, this is how it is; we're not going to assume in our guidance it's getting any better?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think I would say we're just assuming that as we're giving guidance and more importantly planning internally, so we don't think it's going to get better this year.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.

This is Anjani on for Michael. I apologize if this question has been answered before, but for gross margins, they did improve 10 basis points.

Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And now I would like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks, Evan. Good morning, and welcome to the Macy's Inc. conference call, scheduled to discuss our fourth quarter and annual financial performance. I'm Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning. Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affects the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","Joining me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Terry Lundgren. Terry is going to start the call by sharing his thoughts on the year and then the state of the industry overall. And then I'll take you through our financial performance and our outlook for 2017 and then we'll both answer your question.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks, Karen and good morning, everyone. This is going to be my last earnings call as CEO, as we announced this morning that I'll be passing that baton to Jeff Gennette next month. And I wanted to join the call to provide my perspective on Macy's 2016 performance, as well as share a few thoughts of what I'm seeing in the industry as a whole. So let's cover our 2016 performance first. Frankly, it wasn't the year we expected, nor hoped for and we're not happy at all with the 2.9% decline in comp store sales on an owned and licensed basis. And the $3.11 in diluted earnings per share frankly, thought we could have done better than that, particularly in the fourth quarter.","That being said, we did make significant progress in a number of areas. We completed a major restructuring of the entire organization and concluded a significant reduction in layers of management in the central organization and improvements in the field of store management structures. These were big changes for us. I'm happy to see that our organization is settling in and learning to work with leaner teams and faster processes.","We took bold steps towards streamlining of our portfolio with the closure of 66 stores. We plan to close approximately another 34 additional stores over the next few years, just based on whatever timing those things will work out to be, but very focused on getting to that 100 store closure that was announced last August.","This will give us a healthy physical portfolio, one that complements our growing digital business. And this is how the large majority of Americans shop. 90% of what we sell at Macy's and Bloomingdale's is still sold in a physical store. That's for all product sales, including apparel, shoes, beauty, handbags, jewelry, home furnishings, all the things we carry. 90% of these categories still sold in physical stores. Lot of people don't believe that or understand that, but I just wanted to point that out. Now it's less than that at Macy's and Bloomingdale's because we have such a highly developed online business, which continues to see double digit growth, but I want to emphasize that physical stores will play an extremely important role in the future of shopping, for us as well as for others.","We feel very good about our digital investments, which have created the best, or certainly one of the best omnichannel experiences in the retail industry. But we acknowledge that more experimentation with in-store technology and creative solutions for customers who are shopping in our physical stores is an opportunity for focused capital investments in 2017.","In 2016, we also continued to execute our real estate strategy and made good progress. We expect this momentum to carry on into 2017. I feel very good about the many projects we are working on and believe that they will create meaningful value out of our substantial real estate portfolio. I plan to work closely with our real estate team and expect to get a lot done in 2017.","To sum up 2016, in large part, our performance was impacted by the continuing challenges in our sector and changes in the consumer shopping habits we've seen. And in my 14 years as CEO at Macy's Inc. and my six years as CEO of Neiman Marcus before that, I've seen a series of setbacks that seem to happen every five to seven years in our industry. Going back to when Campeau bought Federated in a highly leveraged transaction in the late 1980s and then Federated ended up filing for bankruptcy very shortly after like a year and a half later. Then six-and-a-half years after that, Macy's was bankrupt, largely because they levered up to buy a former employer of mine, Bullocks and Bullocks Wilshire. And in December of 1994 I rejoined Federated from Neiman Marcus in early 1994 with the idea that we would buy Macy's. We were able to do that because Macy's was bankrupt at that point and time. They had levered up to buy Bullocks and Bullocks Wilshire.","Seven years after that came 9\/11 and it was a tremendous hit to retail and it was written that consumer shopping habits changed forever and department stores were no longer relevant. Well, a few years after that, 2005, we were able to acquire The May Company and become the first national fashion department store in the United States and become the largest seller of most of the most-wanted brands in the country.","And then 2008 came and we all know what happened to consumer spending at that time. We were hit very hard, but we made the needed adjustments, created a winning strategy, pulled together an incredibly talented team and bounced back with consecutive winning streaks for five years in a row ending with growth, a period of five years of growing by $5 billion and a 14% EBITDA with 38 fewer stores than we began that period with. So, we did what we had to do. And now here we are seven years later and after 2008 and 2009 with another setback. And once again, we're faced with challenges. These are different than before but the message is the same, and that is there's lots of concern out there about our ability to bounce back, but yet internally, so many of the people that are on our team have seen this movie or some version of it in the past and get excited about taking on that challenge. So we anticipate that the challenging environment that we experienced in 2016 will continue, but we're not standing still. We made a lot of strategic decisions this past year that are going to set us up well in 2017 and we're going to continue to fine tune our strategy and vision forward to get ourselves in position to win in the future.","Before I turn it over to Karen to review the details of our performance, I want to say that it's been a privilege for me to lead this company for the past 14 years and I look forward to stepping into my new role as Executive Chairman. Jeff Gennette is an extraordinary leader and since his appointment as President of Macy's, Inc. three years ago, he's taken on increasing responsibility for operating this company and done a great job and everything that I've thrown his way. With Jeff as CEO, we have someone with deep knowledge of our business coupled with the vision and determination to reinvent Macy's as we've done every other time when I've been told that our industry was no longer relevant.","So Jeff also has a terrific team around him with a mix of Macy's veterans and some key recent hires who bring a fresh new perspective. We have the deepest, most experienced and most determined team in the retail industry. I hear that continuously from our vendors and from our other partners. And the veterans on this team, including Jeff and Karen, have a long track record of winning and are determined to win again and I believe they will.","With that, let me hand it back over to Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks, Terry. So, I'm now going to summarize the key components of our fourth quarter performance. Sales were $8.515 billion, down 4% from last year. On an owned plus licensed comp basis, sales were down 2.1%, which was at the low end of our expectations when we started the quarter. Our digital sales continued strong, with double digit growth, while sales transacted in stores continued to be below what we had expected. It isn't possible to perfectly distinguish sales between channels, but clearly customers are choosing to purchase less in store and more through digital means.","By family of business, we saw the best performance during the quarter in apparel \u2013 men's, women's and kid's, as well as in fine jewelry, shoes, intimate apparel, and fragrances. The most disappointing categories in the quarter were handbags, fashion watches, and fashion jewelry. While not one of the weakest categories, we also had hoped for better performance in cosmetics. Our home businesses were tougher than expected in total, but within home we had stronger sales in furniture, mattresses, luggage and textiles. Geographically our business was strongest in the Southwest, most notably Southern California. And the trends at Bloomingdale's were similar to those at Macy's.","Transactions in the quarter were down 4% while average unit retail was up 2%. Gross margin rate in the quarter was up 90 basis points over last year. The merchandise margin was up slightly more than that, but we had higher delivery expense associated with our dot-com businesses.","The gross margin in the apparel areas was strong, offset in part by lower than expected margin rates in other parts of the business. Our comp inventory was up 2% at the end of the year, which was higher than expected due to sales weakness in certain center core categories and receipts of early spring transitional merchandise.","SG&A in the quarter was $2.202 billion, down slightly from last year. During the quarter, expense in our stores was lower than last year, due both to flexing expense on the lower sales and from the impact of the store closing. In addition, SG&A was lower due to the expense reductions that we implemented at the start of 2016. We also benefited in the fourth quarter from $20 million higher asset sale gains than we booked last year. This year in the fourth quarter we booked asset sale gains of $133 million. This includes $10 million for Brooklyn and $123 million relating to other assets. There were no gains on sales of flagship properties in the fourth quarter or in the full year. We did complete the sale of the Union Square Men's Store in the quarter and received the cash, but the gain will be booked in the fourth quarter of 2017. The downtown Minneapolis transaction did not close during the quarter, but we do expect that it will close shortly.","The SG&A reductions were offset primarily by expense associated with our fast growing digital business as well as by $72 million lower credit income than last year in the quarter. While we expected credit income to be below last year, it was worse than expected due to the lower sales, lower card usage with our proprietary penetration in the fourth quarter of 47.1% compared to 47.9% last year, as well as lower late fees.","Operating income before impairment, store closings, settlement charges and other costs was $1.062 billion in the quarter, down 4.6% from last year on the same basis. Impairment, store closing and other costs in the quarter were $230 million, slightly below our original expectation of $250 million. Store closing related costs were approximately $68 million in the quarter and the restructuring related and other costs were approximately $162 million. The majority of these costs resulted from severance and other related charges.","Approximately $177 million of the fourth quarter charges will be settled in cash. We also booked $17 million of settlement charges associated with our retirement plans in the quarter. Net interest was $87 million and tax expense $256 million in the quarter. Net income attributed to Macy's shareholders was $475 million. Diluted share count was 307.8 million shares and EPS on a diluted basis was $1.54. Excluding impairments, store closings, and other costs, as well as settlement charges, left EPS on a diluted basis of $2.02, which compares to last year's $2.09 on the same basis.","Cash flow before financing was strong in 2016. Cash provided by operating activities net of cash used by investing activities was $1.614 billion, $722 million higher than last year. The cash provided by operating activities was $183 million below last year, but this was more than offset by $469 million in higher asset sales, $201 million in lower capital expenditures, and last year's $212 million acquisition of Bluemercury. We utilized during 2016, $316 million of cash to repurchase 7.9 million shares. We repaid approximately $750 million of debt at maturity and utilized $459 million for our dividend.","So, as Terry said, our performance in the fourth quarter and 2016 in total was not what we expected. And as a result, our changes need to be more dramatic and we need to move faster. As we look to 2017, we feel good about so many things happening in the company. Our digital growth, including the dramatic improvement of our mobile apps, the progress on our real estate strategy, the restructuring of our organization, successes in our new approaches to fine jewelry and shoes, growth in exclusive merchandise, including our private brands, and an improved easier to shop clearance and off price strategy.","However, we were not able to overcome the secular changes in the industry related to shopping habits. These changes appear to have had a bigger impact on our store business than we had expected. We recognize we need to make dramatic changes in how we operate the business. In some cases, we're already executing our strategies, while other strategies are still in development, most notably our marketing strategy. This includes ideas also for testing how we can simplify our pricing and for improving the store shopping experience.","We also will be developing and testing new merchandise concepts and categories, new services and entertainment to help drive traffic as well as new technology to improve the customer experience and our ability to operate more efficiently. We will be utilizing a cross section of our stores, including both key strategic stores in our best malls, as well as others where we see upside opportunity. We will partner with our developers as well as our vendors and we will form new collaborations that will help us to attract more customers to our stores and convert more of the traffic we have to purchases.","We also are working on a strategy to transform our beauty business, as we have done already with furniture and mattresses, fine jewelry, and shoes. This is a very important category to our customers and we need to work harder to maintain our market position. Bluemercury will be a part of this strategy as will our own internally-developed Impulse Beauty concept. These efforts will all take time to see results. It is far better, though, that we take the time to test our ideas and let our customers vote with their dollars as opposed to rolling out ideas without testing. In the meantime, we will also continue our work on reducing costs further, so we have more funds to invest into these growth initiatives.","We're also continuing to execute on our real estate strategy that is focused on creating value through monetization and in some cases the redevelopment of our assets. Let me give you just a quick update on our real estate progress and I'll use the same three-part framework that we've been using to talk about our strategy. First our flagship. You'll remember that we defined this as including Herald Square, Union Square, downtown Minneapolis and downtown Chicago. With Union Square, we sold the Men's building and will be creating a more exciting shopping environment in the Men's Store as we bring men's merchandise back into that building. We were pleased with the execution of the sale of the Men's building at roughly $1,000 per square foot.","In addition, we have developed an exciting plan to carve out approximately 10,000 square feet of the main Union Square store along Geary Street, facing the Square, to create luxury specialty retail opportunities surrounding our entrance on Union Square. We believe that the rents that this space will command will be very high and the luxury retailers will also create additional excitement and drive traffic to our store.","As I said earlier, we are very close to completing the sale of our downtown Minneapolis store and we're still working on a plan for a downsized State Street store in Chicago, which we expect will result in a more vibrant, more productive store. This is expected to be similar to what we did in downtown Seattle, where the buyer of the store's upper floors converted this space to creative office space.","We also are continuing to work on opportunities to create value at Herald Square. The strategies are wide-ranging but are all aimed at making our store even more exciting than it is today, while creating significant value. This will be one of our top priorities in 2017.","The second bucket of our real estate strategy was our underperforming locations or locations where the real estate value is substantially greater than the retail value. Where we closed stores due to subpar performance we are proactively monetizing our ownership or leasehold interest. In some cases we've negotiated transactions with a mall owner and in others we're selling to a third party, typically after a marketing process.","And in stores that are not critical to our strategic footprint and where we believe that there was substantial redevelopment value, we have and will continue to selectively sell. It should be noted that we start with an analysis of the potential for redevelopment and a determination of the value of our assets that we believe the redevelopment will support and then sell only if we believe the value is justified.","And then the third bucket is our other locations. As you know, we are working with Brookfield on approximately 50 properties to identify redevelopment ideas and get moving on execution. We're very excited about how this partnership could help us to optimize the potential of these properties and potentially many others. Let me just give you two examples of how these could work. First, we have the opportunity to redevelop a 25-plus acre site in a top-ten market. The site enjoys tremendous trade area demographics with household incomes well into the six figures. Underutilized today by our existing store, the site presents an opportunity to once again create a dynamic mixed-use development with a mix of complementary retail, residential, and hotel uses. The potential value creation on the Macy's land from such a development could be substantial.","And the second example is an opportunity where we would participate in a larger redevelopment or densification of a high potential mall in a top-20 market. This mall could be reinvented to become a mixed-use destination, encompassing a mix of uses including retail, multi-family, and again hotel uses. Increasing the density of the site could reasonably add 1 million square feet of additional commercial and residential GLA, creating significant value. Not only would this create value for the site, but would also create beneficial synergies for the ongoing Macy's retail operation.","We and Brookfield are both very excited by these types of opportunities. Brookfield is taking the lead and currently we are in the predevelopment phase, which will include economic analysis, planning, approvals, et cetera. Depending on the scope of each of these projects, the timelines will vary, but we are encouraging and assisting Brookfield to move as expeditiously as possible. Of course by its nature, redevelopment of assets like these does not occur overnight, but we are excited by the potential.","So our guidance for 2017 reflects our desire, as I mentioned, to take the time to test and learn before we roll out initiatives nationally. And as a result, we are assuming that there will be little to no improvement in our sales trend in 2017 relative to 2016. Fortunately, because of the $550 million SG&A reduction that we announced last month, we expect the earnings impact from the sales decline to be far less than what it otherwise would have been. We are assuming comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis to decline between 2% and 3% in 2017. On an owned basis, comp is assumed to decline approximately 20 to 30 basis points further and total sales are expected to decline approximately 100 basis points more than comp or approximately down 3.2% to down 4.3%.","Also remember the 2017 is a 53-week year. The total sales guidance incorporates that extra week, but the comp guidance is on a 52-week basis. With this sales assumption, EPS on a diluted basis, excluding any charges associated with store closures, restructuring, or settlement, is expected to be $3.37 to $3.62. This guidance includes the expected $236 million or approximately $0.47 per share gain on the sale of the Union Square Men's building, which as I said earlier, is expected to be booked in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding this gain, our earnings guidance on that same basis would be $2.90 to $3.15.","Embedded in our guidance are the following nine assumptions. One, our gross margin rate is expected to decline for the year as a whole and in each quarter. The merchandise margin is actually assumed to be approximately flat but because of the digital growth and increased free shipping, gross margin rate is assumed to decline.","Two, we are assuming the SG&A savings of $550 million, offset by the growth spending of approximately $250 million. So the net reduction versus 2016 of approximately $300 million is embedded in our guidance. Should sales be at the lower end of our range, we would, however, expect SG&A dollars to be lower as well.","Three, credit income for the year is assumed to be approximately $740 million to $760 million. Depreciation and amortization is assumed to be approximately $1.010 billion.","The fifth key assumption is, as I said, we're assuming book gains from asset sales for Union Square of $236 million and we're also assuming $100 million, roughly, book gains for Brooklyn and $80 million to $100 million for other properties. So excluding the Union Square gains, the asset sale gains are assumed to be $180 million to $200 million, which compares to $209 million in 2016.","The sixth assumption is capital expenditures. We're assuming that they'll be relatively flat with this year at approximately $900 million.","Seventh key assumption relates to use of cash. The excess cash after the capital expenditures, the payment of our dividends, and the $300 million approximate debt maturity in July is all assumed to be used to repurchase debt. We ended 2016 with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.3 times, which as you know, is above our targeted range of 2.5 to 2.8. We are therefore using our excess cash in 2017 to help us return to the targeted range. The premium on the assumed debt repurchase is not included in our guidance. We also are not assuming that we will buy back any stock in 2017.","The eighth key assumption is interest expense, which is assumed to be approximately $320 million to $325 million. The reduction versus 2016 results from paying off the debt in 2016 maturity as well as the additional $300 million in 2017 and an estimate of our anticipated debt repurchase. Actual interest expense could vary based on the timing and the actual amount of that repurchase.","And the ninth and final assumption is that we're assuming an effective tax rate of 37%. So, that's an overview of the quarter as well as our outlook for 2017. As we head into 2017, we assume, as we've said, that many of the industry challenges that we faced in 2016 will continue. However, the decisions we made and the actions we have taken over the past year, should serve us well. In particular, we have significantly paired the footprint of our physical stores and are developing plans to invest in improving the customer experience in both the physical and our digital stores.","We have taken a hard look at our organization and made major changes to both reduced costs and also improve agility. And we have built strong momentum for maximizing the value of our significant real estate portfolio.","We've taken many actions in 2016 to deal with the industry challenges and improve our company, our store and our operations while seeking to create value for all of our shareholders. Our management team is always looking at different ideas to enhance shareholder value and improve our company.","Terry and I will now take your questions, but before we start, note that we are obviously aware of the recent headlines but, consistent with our long-standing policy, we will not be answering any questions or otherwise commenting regarding rumors or speculation. I will note that we are focused on the actions that will ultimately improve our financial performance and provide the greatest value for our shareholders.","And with that, Evan, why don't we open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instruction] And we'll take our first question from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you so much. Terry and Karen, I was trying to reconcile some comments. Terry, you talked about the negative sentiment and I assume you mean among the investment community around the pressure that Macy's and other department stores have been feeling on the top line. And, clearly, there have been times in the past where sales have been very difficult to come by and you've certainly managed to navigate through those choppy waters well. At the same time, Karen talked about some of the dramatic and dynamic changes in consumer shopping behavior. So, I'm wondering, at this point in time, do you think that Macy's has the full and complete sort of toolkit of strategies to address the challenges that you see in the business, number one.","And number two is this time perhaps a little different, given that the challenges presented by the industry seem to be coming from a real change in the way consumers are buying, rather than some of the other factors in during prior periods? Thanks so much.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Sure. I'll start and, Karen, you might want to fill in, but. So, to answer your question, Kimberly, that first is do we have a full set of strategies to address the need to turn our business in the right direction? I'd say the answer is they're still developing. We're going to be talking about some of the strategies that we have developed in the near term. We've got a meeting planned for our internal organization to express some of these new ideas and thoughts. But I can assure you that there's more to do. We feel great about the progress the investments we've made on our digital platform, with our online business chugging along nicely and very well developed. As Karen said, the investments we've made in our Macy's app has been very positively received. So, we're doing some good things there.","But clearly the answer has to lie in our conversion of consumers who are shopping in our physical stores into sales. Instead of just shopping and browsing and then clicking and buying either at Macys.com or somewhere else, converting them into purchasers inside of our stores. And we've got test stores lined up, we've got a lot of the exciting things that we're testing and doing. But as Karen alluded to, it'd be a bad idea for us just to roll those out immediately and hope they work. So, rather, we're going to spend 2017 to try various new formats that we do believe will improve our conversion rate. And then the ones that do work, as we've experienced and we've figured out with lady's shoes and with fine jewelry, we'll do those and roll that out hopefully later in the season in 2017 and 2018. So those are still underway.","And then to your point about is this different than the prior setbacks that we faced? I would say yes, it is different. But each time has been different. And so this time I think the positive this time is that consumers have money to spend. They are spending on automobiles and they're spending on healthcare and they're spending on home improvement and they're spending on all of those things.","I actually thought that they would spend less on those items in 2017, believing that they had been spending in those same categories in 2016. But that is not what happened. They continued to spend in those same categories \u2013 I'm sorry in 2016 as they did in 2015.","And so at some point in time you've got to believe that everybody's going to have a brand new car, at some point in time. We just had record after record performance of automobile sales. At some point in time, there's dollars that are going to be freed up for other categories of spending. And when they get to these categories we have to be a major consideration. And so one of the key strategies that we are performing well in is our exclusive and unique product. And as we've mentioned, the private brand sales are doing better than the market sales. The brands that we have from the market that are sold only at Macy's, brands like Tommy Hilfiger, as an example, are selling significantly better than the more broadly distributed brands. And so we have to work that out with our vendor partners because supply and demand has become a real issue here and an opportunity for those who are working with us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kara Szafraniec from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Kara Szafraniec - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good morning. One quick modeling question. How much can we assume that the extra week in 2017 will be worth in earnings?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I can't give you an answer on earnings. It's worth about 120 basis points for the year in sales.","Kara Szafraniec - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Perfect. Thank you. Just to kind of follow up on some of the testing concepts, especially the simplified pricing structure that you had mentioned this morning, and it was in your press release. I was just hoping maybe you can elaborate on some of the details of this? Is this a test basis or is this something that we can expect to see rolled out chain-wide sometime soon?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, we're testing lots of different components of it, one of which you all know about was the Last Act strategy, where we rolled out a greatly improved clearance strategy that is working extraordinarily well. Helping us to clear clearance faster and better, but it also, as you know, we moved the second and third markdowns into a special area of our stores and put it together within a category. So, all of the women's apparel, for example.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","With no additional coupons.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Right. And so the price on the ticket is what the price is. No coupon, no POS discount. So, the customer A sees the price that she's going to pay, which simplifies the experience greatly. And also the customer who loves shopping for clearance can find it altogether. So, that's been terrific. The other benefit is, frankly, it's cleaned up the regular price parts of the floor. And so it's helping the regular price sales as well, because it looks better without all of the clearance merchandise displayed in the same place. So that's been hugely successful and we continue to roll that out to all of the categories in the store.","We're also testing some other strategies to move away from some of the coupon reliance. That's going to take a little bit longer to develop. As we all know, making dramatic changes in coupon strategies is not good, but you will hear more on this subject as we move forward.","Kara Szafraniec - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Perfect. Thank you for the detail.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Karen, on the top line, so, you've outlined a number of top line initiatives, but what's the best way to rank the opportunities, I guess, as we see it over the next 12 months?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, as you look over just the next 12 months as opposed to into the future, obviously digital ranked high because again the improvements we're making in the site and the mobile apps will continue to happen. And as we've said that's naturally where the growth is occurring. I would say also on the exclusive products, you think about brands like Tommy Hilfiger or a private brand that had just a terrific year in 2016.","The shoe strategy I'm very excited about, but that will be rolled out during the year. Fine jewelry will continue to be very helpful in 2017. And then there are two other factors that will help 2017. One is the retention of sales from the closed stores will help the other stores nearby and so that should help comp in 2017. And also this is again mathematical but a mix effect that adds digital growth. That growth has a bigger impact on the total Macy's, Inc. side, both for Macy's and Bloomingdale's, as the store business is smaller. So, that will also help the top line, albeit just mathematical. So, there's a lot of good things happening that should help 2017.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, Terry, just a higher level question for you. If you were to build Macy's from scratch today, how would the structure differ from what we see out there today? And anything you think you could execute differently as a private company?","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Well, I think what we're trying to do is \u2013 when we announced a year ago that we were closing 100 stores, we didn't just come up, pull from a hat \u2013 let's take 100 out of the 800, but instead we laid out on a sheet of paper the demographics of each marketplace and said, where are our populations growing? Where are household incomes strong enough to support a regular diet of a Macy's store? Where are cities and markets where we can win on a competitive basis? We laid it out that way and then chose which stores we were going to close and where we wanted to remain open. And so that's how we came up with our plan. So, I think to answer your question, our physical environment was done that way. And that may change, Matt, over time, but when we laid this out a year ago, that was our intention that this was not just a plan for 2016 and 2017, but a longer term look at our need for our physical stores.","And then more and more, we're convinced that the consumer is entering the store with their mobile device and making their decision where they're going to shop before they leave their home or their car and making sure that we are able to convert those individuals once they choose to come to our store to make a purchase inside our store, as opposed to a search that might bring them to an alternative site where they believe they can get a similar or a same product for a better value. That can happen. And we have to be stronger, more aggressive on that subject to ensure that we are always very competitive. And that's where it has to go for us.","We have to make sure that we understand that the transparency that is clear to the consumer today, that we are responding to that and in fact anticipating that that's the way the consumer will shop and getting in front of it. So, I think we're on that track. I think that we're doing all of those things that I would do. And I've said this before, if the department store did not exist today, there'd be a group of smart people sitting in Silicon Valley inventing the department store today, because it will serve a purpose.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's great. Best of luck.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on CapEx. I heard the guidance for this year, but it sounds like many of the tests around cosmetics and entertainment options would require some pretty big investment in your store base. So I was just wondering how we should think about CapEx in the out years and if you'd expect that to be a growing line item?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, Lorraine. We clearly, as we look at our budget for 2017 and the next couple of years, are allocating money to the stores. We believe that's going to be important as we go forward. Given the EBITDA reduction, though, we try to be balanced. So, as EBITDA grows, I wouldn't be surprised if CapEx grows a bit. Maybe to $1 billion, but I don't see it growing significantly from what we've got. It's really just how we allocate the money.","One of the things, also, I should mention as part of our cost reduction was also looking at areas of spend that aren't expense. For example, how we purchase things that go into a store remodel. And hopefully that's going to allow us to accomplish more for the dollars that we did spend in store as we go forward. So, I could see it potentially going up a bit, but again I don't see it as an enormous increase. The only exception to that would be if we find ideas that are fabulous that are making a big difference, you better believe we'll invest to make that growth happen.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","And I would just add that we're spending similar amount this year as we spent last year. One could argue that with our sales decreasing in 2016 and again in 2017 on a comp store basis, plus the fact that we have 66 fewer stores going to 100 fewer stores, you could make the argument that we should spend less in capital, but we are actually spending the same amount, which means more per store on average, just to Karen's point, to make sure that we are prepared to invest in the ideas that are driving sales in our physical stores.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","And, Lorraine, one other thought also is the other way the capital could increase over time, not in 2017, but as we go forward, is as we develop real estate strategies. For example, if you think about Union Square, we sold the Men's building for the $250 million, but it does costs something to bring Men's back into the building. So, it is possible that as we create value through real estate, there will be a capital cost associated with making that happen. And so again not in 2017, but as we think about the out years, that could happen also, but it would be, in essence, funded by the asset sale.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just to follow up on the SG&A. The $300 million of net reduction, is that inclusive of any inflationary pressures you may feel on some of those SG&A line items?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah. That's included in the $250 million offset to $550 million. In part, that's why, as we both said, the $550 million represented a major restructure of the company as well as significant pressure in the non-payroll area. But that was intended to offset that as well.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Karen, thanks for the color on guidance. Just wanted to inquire if there was any variability that we should be thinking about in 1Q or first half versus the back half when it came to some of the metrics such as comps or SG&A spend, credit income, et cetera, real estate gains. And then Terry, just kind of big picture, part of the narrative beyond the weaker mall traffic and the changing spending habits of the consumer, is a narrative around apparel and the lack of excitement in the category and the downward pricing pressure that that category is facing. Do you agree or disagree with that? And then just maybe what are you seeing on the horizon from a product or category standpoint that the consumer could be excited about going forward?","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Sure.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Paul, to your question around guidance by quarter, as we think about the spring season versus the fall, we do expect the spring season to be tougher than the fall, largely because, as you've heard, many of these initiatives on the sales line are to be rolled out as we go through the year. So, I would expect, as we progress from the spring season into the fall season that happens, with the strongest quarter expected today to be in the fourth quarter. But obviously we'll continue to provide updates as we go.","In terms of the gross margin rate, I'd say similar just based on things that are happening. Typically margin goes along with sales. And asset sale gains, I don't know how to predict it by quarter. That's why we often give guidance without asset sale gains because those will be lumpy and will happen when they happen. The Union Square Men's though is a huge lump and put that in the fourth quarter. So, that one's big, but the others are really hard to anticipate. As I said, we do expect Minneapolis to close shortly, but the others are harder to anticipate.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Let me talk, Paul, about your question about the mall traffic, and then apparel, specifically. First of all, I think there's a lot of very good work being done right now by several of the developers on trying to reinvent and create new reasons for consumers to come to their shopping centers. And you're starting to see some real investments there that are addressing those opportunity. That's good for us when they do that and we want to work side by side with them to ensure that we're investing where they're investing, one.","Two is that the consumer is just more organized today and so since they've already done their homework and done their searches for what they want to buy and where they want to buy it from, they are visiting fewer stores once they get to the mall. So I think there's enough consumers in the mall. It's just a matter of where they're choosing to shop based on the searches that they've done. And so we have to be top of mind in that search process for them. And our technology team has worked very hard, along with our merchant team to make sure that we match up well.","And then finally on the apparel subject, look, the reality is you're hearing consistently from other retailers that the apparel business is difficult and yet we've called it out as our strength. So, it isn't across the board everywhere and everyone. Apparel is a category that when you have the right product at the right time and in a price point that consumers consider a value, whatever that price point might be, you're going to get a response and we've. And also as I alluded to earlier, this whole subject of supply and demand becomes very, very relevant in the apparel business. And, in our case, our apparel business is good because it's the exclusive product, the unique product. The products are only available at Macy's or 100% Bloomingdale's, our program there. Those are clearly the leaders in our performance in the whole store, but certainly in the apparel area. I think that's the answer.","By the way, the other key thing is not everybody can do that because it takes a very talented merchant team who understands what consumers are going to want six months from now or three months from now, when they're making their decisions. And being able to forecast that and work with our designers and our vendors to find the products that are going to be right for our customers, because if they wanted to sell you what they didn't sell to somebody else, that's a disaster. So having merchants that truly understands the opportunity to buy product for their stores and have a unique and exclusive in our stores, that's a skill set that's hard to duplicate and I'm very, very proud of the team at Macy's and Bloomingdale's because we stand out among others as having the best in the industry in that regard. So, I think that's the key to it.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks. You guys closed 40 stores about a year ago. Just curious what you think the transfer rates were from those closed stores? And what do you hope to see on the most recent class of store closings? What do you consider an acceptable rate? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, first off, we're getting better and better at this because, as we've closed more stores, we've learned a lot about how to retain sales in other stores. So, fortunately, last year we did significantly better than we had done in the past and we hope that, with the closures this year, to do even better than that. The answer, Paul, is actually a little complicated. It has to do with whether it's a single store market where we obviously can't repeat store sales. Sometimes they'll travel a bit to another, but we assume no retention there. And we do lose a little bit on Macys.com. So one of the things we did last year was a strategy through Macys.com in e-mails to retain that customer as best that we can. But as you've heard we say many times, our customers buying online love to return in store. They love to shop in store, buy online. So we are, I think, forever going to lose some of that Macys.com business when we close a single-store market.","In a multi-store market, the answer will depend on how dense the stores are in that market, how far away the nearest store is, and also how similar the trading areas are. So, where the demographics are similar, trading areas are similar, we could retain roughly 40% to 45% of the sales. But in other cases it's only 10%. So, it really does depend on the individual situation. But I will say that \u2013 last year's closures, we did better than what we had anticipated and I'm hopeful that maybe the same thing will happen again as we develop marketing strategies and also assortment strategies.","One of the reasons we've announced the closures earlier than we used to is so that our buying and planning teams can think through in that store vendor X did really well or they tended to buy sizes large and extra large compared to stores nearby. And by announcing it and talking about it earlier, we've been able to do a better job of getting the assortment right for the new store, so that we could retain more of the sales. So, it's a long way of saying we've made progress and hope to continue to make progress.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good luck, guys.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much. Two questions, if I may. First, Karen, just given some of the rating agency actions in the last couple of months, how should we think about your desire to maintain a mid BBB versus a low BBB credit rating? And how that could impact your financing costs?","And then just secondly, as we think about your debt reduction actions through the year, philosophically would you look to reduce your interest expense as a priority? Or should we think about you trying to maximize the amount of debt that you are actually able to take out? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, look, you'll recall back in 2008\/2009 we set our targets for our credit ratios. And so frankly that's really our objective, which is to get back into the targeted range that we've talked about. Being an investment grade company, as you know, is very important to us. And that's why we're utilizing our excess cash in 2017 to repurchase debt. We do believe that a retailer that is investment grade is the right answer for our company and so we are taking that quite seriously.","In terms of the philosophy around debt reductions, we tend to focus on the net present value as sort of the primary factor, but we will also take into consideration interest rates and things like that as well as we develop that strategy.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about inventory. Could you talk a little bit about the inventories that you're holding per store? And it sounds like you ended a little bit heavy, but my question is more maybe the characteristic of the inventory and whether as you think about 2017 your inventory levels are where you want to be or if you have any strategies to make your inventory turns more efficient?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I think, Lindsay, as you know, we are working to improve the efficiency or inventory turns as we go forward. We think that's an important part of simplifying the shopping experience, to make it easier for the customer, and to see what we're offering and have it edited and making sure that what we have is, in size and color, consistent with what the customer wants. We believe that that will lead to an improved inventory turn over time. So I do believe that's something we are focused on.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Then maybe, Karen, on the credit card penetration rate, could you talk about what drove the lower penetration versus prior year and maybe even versus your expectation? And if there are any specific strategies on that for next year or for this year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, we actually had anticipated that it would come down somewhat this year. But, as I said, it did come down more than what we had expected. And I think we are focused on that. I referred earlier to changing marketing strategy, a piece of that also will be around loyalty and credit. And I think you're going to see more efforts to build our offers for our most loyal credit customers.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Hi, Karen and Terry. I have a question regarding speed and the concept of speed. What are your thoughts in terms of transforming of both the relationship with your vendors and buyers as well as thinking about speed in terms of customers wanting packages from drones and just the customer experience really needing speed as a factor. And my second question was about the long-term store footprint. You've given a lot of really helpful and agile details regarding real estate. But the five year plan, in terms of making sure resource allocations is in the right place in the footprint and kind of achieve the right place in terms of the brand and as mobile continues to accelerate beyond a lot of expectations, what are your thoughts about the long-term store footprint?","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Let me start with the speed and you can talk about the long-term because you're going to be here. But on the subject of speed, which I think is a very good and important question is that we have been working hard on this with our own private brand initiatives with some success. It does require some change in the way that our merchant team works with anticipating product delivery. You do have to commit up front without actually seeing the product, touching the product. And you have to have some trust that if you're prepared to work with speed that you're going to forego the approval process. That is what slows it down.","And so we're doing that in private brand. We've got a great leader there who's taking on that initiative and studied companies, particularly some of the specialty stores who have done such a great job on this subject. And we're learning to forego those approval processes and make quick decisions and speed the process along.","How that translates to \u2013 I know our vendors \u2013 it's hard for us to certainly dictate, but I do know that many of our vendors are thinking along those same terms there. They realize that the way the consumer is shopping today there is an absolute need for reducing the weeks of supply in the system. The only way to do that is to commit the fabric up front and to commit to design process without approvals along them \u2013 several steps along the way that historically have been part of the process. So, I do think you're going to see more of that in our industry and we're clearly going to see that with what we can control with our own private brand groups. And I'll let Karen respond to the other question.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, and as Terry said earlier, before we came up with the 100 store closures, we had done a full review of all of our real estate and really looking at it strategically. And within the 100 are many, many, many stores that we never would have closed in 2016\/2017 or even 2018. We've tried to look out four or five years. And, as you know, none of our stores are cash flow negative. So this was painful, but we felt we were trying to get the footprint right for the future. So we did look forward.","So, obviously, though, that could change. It could change if customer behavior changes differently than what we had anticipated. Or I think it also could change based on the work we do with real estate and maybe we find ways of changing the footprint as we go forward. So, I couldn't possibly tell you that I know what it's going to look like in five years. I can tell you that we worked hard to look forward, but we're constantly looking to see if the world is changing and are going to be very flexible should that happen or should through the real estate work we find different opportunity.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Binetti of UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Karen and Terry. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Morning.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","I'm just curious. One thing for the model, Karen. Just based on the credit guidance for \u2013 I think it's for flat to slightly up, I'm curious what the components are? It's a little counterintuitive based on the revenue guidance down 3% to 4%. What the components in the credit guidance are that would drive it up?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I think as I said earlier, we're hoping that the penetration improves somewhat. So that should help offset that. Also, the profitability of the portfolio, we think, has dropped a little bit in 2016 after a very good 2015. And I think that's getting back to a more normal level, as well.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. I wondered like, on the apparel, you guys had called it out for a few quarters now. Maybe you can just give us some sense. It seems like it's a fairly big opportunity on the margin line in particular. I know that was below what you guys had hoped for, for quite a while. A lot of the brands \u2013 I guess as a corollary \u2013 a lot of the major brands that sell through your stores have talked about reducing promo levels, backing off of Friends & Family and those kind of things. I'm wondering if you could help us think about the strategy there and how much of an opportunity it is, if the nice apparel trends you've seen in the last two quarters continue.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, as I said in the fourth quarter, the margins in apparel actually were strong. So I think that's obviously good news as we go forward. Our private brands in apparel, most notably ready to wear had a really strong year in 2016, and as I said, the exclusive merchandise, branded merchandise. So we feel good about it as we go forward. And to your point, it should be helpful, but there are pressures other places that are offsetting some of that.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Okay and then just one last one. I guess, based on some of the earlier commentary on paying down debt this year, you'll have to excuse me, we're still working through all the puts and takes on the cash flow model. But just based on the plan in place for EBITDA this year, the debt pay down and then any cash from real estate that is realized, is it too early to know if share repurchases can restart as early as 2018 at this point?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","You know what? It's too early to know. We'll just have to see.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","We are aiming to get our credit ratios back into the 2.5 to 2.8 range. So that is a priority and it will depend on a lot of factors.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. The first one I wanted to ask is about the interest in the release today around Backstage. Looks like you're going to expand it to 30 locations in the store. Would love to hear more about what you're seeing with that platform and the factors that led you to kind of expand it further? And I have one follow up.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","So, on Backstage, we're actually really excited about what it's doing in store. We believe that not only is it helping to grow the total store and make it more productive, but it's also giving our current customers more reasons to make trips to our stores, and also beginning to bring in new customers. So, we feel good about it in general. Some are working better than others. So, we are still working on refining the format, but we do think it could add a lot of value to a certain set of stores.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","And we look at it as if a store in particular has decreased in sales over the last couple of years, then obviously we need to get the productivity up of that location. And one way to do that is to bring in a new business. So, it's similar to bringing in a Bluemercury shop within a shop or a leased Sunglass Hut or a Finish Line, something like that. Instead, we're bringing in our own Macy's Backstage and hopefully attracting a different customer. And so we think maximizing the existing real estate is something we must do and expanding our Backstage into these stores is proving to be positive to get additional comp store sales in these locations.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's really interesting. Thanks. And then I wanted to also ask about one of your vendors, Hugo Boss, had said on a recent call something along the lines of moving to more of a concession format and I think in seven or eight of their locations. Wanted to A) make sure we were interpreting that properly and that that is something you're testing and looking at with different brands. And kind of what your thought process is around that concession model?","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","We haven't done that with a large number of our vendors, but we have done it with some, particularly at Bloomingdale's. And so it just depends on the store and the situation where we believe we can maximize the business potential, expand our customer base. It's really true added value for the customer and for us and for the vendors when we do it. But it's really on an individual store, individual brand basis. We have the license agreement with brands like Gucci and with Louis Vuitton and some others. But the others are just really one here and one there.","But, I know we have \u2013 Bloomingdale's has several of these examples where just a handful of their stores they are using a license arrangement, whereas in the majority of their stores they are buying and owning the inventory as they have in the past. So it's been a mix.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Is the Hugo Boss example the first time in Macy's?","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","No. We have Louis Vuitton at Macy's. We have Gucci at Macy's. Our Sunglass Hut is a licensed operation. So, this is not something new.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thanks for the info, guys. Good luck.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Richard Jaffe of Stifel. Please go ahead.","And Richard, your line is open. You may have your mute function enabled.","Again, Richard, you do have an open line. You may have your mute function enabled.","We'll move on to our next question from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, Karen, Terry. Terry, good luck and congratulations on the bump upstairs.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I guess couple of questions. Can you give us an idea on the exclusive versus private label, private brand mix, where it ended 2016? And I'm just curious in terms of your ability to get more exclusive national brands. You mentioned Tommy Hilfiger doing well for you. Just how that road has gone for you and what we should think about that in 2017?","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, it's about \u2013 well 20% of our total assortment today, sales, is attributable to private brand products. And another 20% is where we're headed on exclusive product. Some of that comes from brands that are more broadly distributed where we had 1% of their merchandise deliveries exclusive only at Macy's.","And Bloomingdale's uses this technique quite a bit with their what they call 100% Bloomingdale's promotions, where they'll work with a vendor in advance and then take a chunk of their inventory, say 15%-20% of what will be delivered from the various brands they do business with, and have it only available at their stores. And they'll work with those companies to make sure that we're creating product that is specific in demand at Bloomingdale's. But Macy's is doing the same thing with big, big brands.","And so I do think that is a greater possibility of expanding our unique and exclusive products. And we'll continue to do that. We do have a couple of big ones, because they've seen the success that we've had with Kipling and with particularly Tommy Hilfiger, with RACHEL Rachel Roy, and a number of other brands. They've seen the success we've had with these brands when it is exclusive. And it has to be good for them and it has been for Tommy Hilfiger, because we've been able to do so much more business profitably for them and for us by having a single customer than they were able to do in the past with multiple customers. So we understand it has to work both ways. So, we're working on a big one right now, not ready to announce it. I do think that there's much more potential here.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. And can you talk about how tourism impacted the business in the fourth quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, we saw a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter. So hopefully that could help us as we go through 2017.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","But, I would say it's basically year round three years of bad performance. So we're just hoping we hit bottom.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Callen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, Karen, is the goal to get back into the 2.5 to 2.8 times range in 2017?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","All I said is that the goal is to get back. I don't know that it will happen in 2017.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just maybe an extension of Michael's question. So, if real estate opportunities move more quickly or proceeds are above what's currently in the guidance, can we expect that goes to further debt reduction to the extent that you're not inside the leverage range? Or at what point do we pivot to share repurchases?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Look, at this point, what I can say is that we anticipate for 2017 that we will be utilizing all of the excess cash to get us back in that range. So that remains our priority.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana, you have an open line. You may have your mute function enabled.","We'll move on to our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much for the follow up. I just wanted to quickly ask if you had any strategies to talk about in handbags, which has been a category, a negative category call out. Anything we can focus on for 2017?","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","I'd just say that we're working very closely with our core vendors. We have a number of smaller brands that are performing okay. But, we've got to get the big guys on track and we're working very closely with them. We feel good about the initiatives that they are taking. They are so committed and so aggressive about getting the business turned around, because we are such important partners to one another. So, I can't tell you specifically \u2013 I know what we're doing, but I can't reveal exactly what we're doing. I don't want to share everything with our competitors. But I can tell that you we are working very, very closely and regularly and feel good about the cooperation and the strategic thinking and planning that we are doing with the big brands that we're counting on making a difference there.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Terry, what do you think the issue has been?","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","It's a number of things. And we would both admit we had such a ramp up of success, as you will recall, for a big part of 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. And we ramped up very quickly and grew the business very fast. And I think it's got to a point where supply became greater than demand. And it was just almost as simple as that. And when that happens, when you're backed up with inventory and when you're backed up with inventory, somebody wants to reduce the price. And when somebody reduces the price, others match that reduction. And so then it gets away from you a little bit. I think that's what happened. And I think now that getting that supply and demand back on track is the first right answer. And the whole focus on design and the product itself trading up, adding more quality back into the product and making sure that we're covering the higher price points, as well as the opening price points.","And we're as guilty because we went after expanding the product to many stores. And that required us to have the more opening price point much more so than the balance that we once had with these brand. And I think that's getting back on track with the quality and the uniqueness and the design of the product being the driver, as opposed to just the price, is going to be good for both of us. And it may take a while, by the way, to sort that out and for consumers to appreciate the change. So we're working patiently with these brands to make sure that that happens throughout 2017. And we feel good about the very strong cooperation we have working with these brands.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And there appears to be no other questions at this time.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Great. Well, thank you all very much and let us know if you have further questions. And, in the meantime, thanks for your support and interest. Take care.","Terry J. Lundgren - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude our presentation for today. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Macy\u2019s, Inc. Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet","Great. Thanks, and good morning. And welcome to the Macy\u2019s, Inc. call scheduled to discuss our third quarter earnings. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company.","Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.","We are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We produced a comp store sales increase of 3.5% or 4.6% on an owned-plus-license basis, is 30-basis-point increase in EBIT rate, and a 31% increase in diluted earnings per share. This is an improvement in trend from the first half of the year and it makes us cautiously optimistic about our outlook for the fourth quarter.","Sales in the third quarter were $6,276,000,000, up 3.5% on a comp basis. This is on top of a 3.7% comp increase last year in the third quarter. This is towards the higher-end of our guidance of 2.5% to 4% for comp sales growth in the back half of the year.","Including license sales, comp sales were up 4.6% in the quarter. This is the most comparable metric for customer demand. This is particularly true this year because we have converted businesses like athletic shoes from being owned to being licensed. The owned comp dollars would be 0 this year for these businesses against, obviously, a big number year ago, so making the comp sales somewhat misleading. And this 4.6% on an owned-plus-license basis compares to 2.4% in the first half of the year. This is over a 2-point improvement in trend.","As we said at the end of the second quarter, we felt we had to intensify our marketing and enhance our value offering to drive the business in the current economic environment. We did both and we are happy to say it paid off. The customer responded well to the cleaner and bolder look to our sale advertising, some new promotional handles and great values on fresh merchandise. We also improved graphics and visual merchandising in the stores and on our website in order to make our sales and values more obvious. This was a real team effort.","During the third quarter, the number of transactions increased approximately 1%, which has improved versus the first half of the year when the transaction count was roughly flat. Units per transaction was up 2% in the third quarter versus being flat in the spring and our average unit retail was up slightly in the quarter. And remember, last year, our average unit retail in the quarter increased 4.5%. Also, as evidence of the success of the changes that we made is the fact that the change in trend was very widespread geographically. Sales improved across all of the Macy's regions in the country in the third quarter, with particular strength across the South and in the Northeast. Bloomingdale's had a strong quarter as well.","We also saw broad-based strengthening across all major categories of business. There are lots of good news stories and only a few weaker ones. Starting with women's apparel, we are pleased that this category has continued to strengthen. The season change was positive for this business with our customer responding very well to the newness.","Our strength in private and women's apparel was driven by our private brands, cashmere, dresses, suits, coats and active. And our Impulse business, which is aimed at the older millennial customer, had a great quarter, including a terrific launch of a new private brand, Maison Jules. And while sales in juniors continued weak in absolute terms, the trend did improve versus that in the first half of the year.","Sales in the Center Core categories continued their very strong performance, driven by handbags, cosmetics, fine jewelry, intimate apparel and boots. The trend in watches did, however, slow somewhat in the quarter.","Performance in men's continued good, with particular strength in active, tailored clothing and cold weather merchandise.","And our home business was outstanding, with particular strength in home textiles, housewares, furniture and mattresses. Luggage was the one category within home that weakened in the quarter.","Looking at the third quarter, we are particularly encouraged by 3 trends that bode well for the fourth quarter. One, the traditional gift categories are trending very well. This would include businesses, such as fine jewelry, cosmetics, cashmere, handbags and housewares. The second encouraging trend is that the cold-weather businesses were all strong: coats, boots, sweaters, et cetera. If we have anywhere close to a normal weather pattern this year, this could add significant volume. And the third encouraging trend was the stronger growth in women's apparel businesses, including that of the older millennial customer, which is always great for our business.","Turning to gross margin. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 39.2%, down 40 basis points versus last year. This is in part due to the increased shipping cost associated with our omnichannel business. But our merchandise margin was down as well in the quarter. Fortunately, we were able to more than offset this reduction with a 70-basis-point reduction in SG&A as a percent to sales. Expense in dollars grew only 1% over last year for the third quarter in spite of the continued omnichannel investment and the added marketing expense. We benefited in the quarter from the leveraging from the stronger sales. Also, depreciation and amortization was $12 million below last year and our credit profitability increased $8 million over last year. As expected, the benefit from credit was much less relative to a year ago than that experienced during the first half of the year.","Operating income in the quarter was $360 million, up 11% over last year in dollars and 30 basis points higher as a percent to sales. Interest expense was $96 million versus last year's $103 million and tax expense was $87 million compared to last year's $77 million. The effective tax rate was below last year in the quarter. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 36%, which is approximately 95 basis points better than what we expected at the start of the year due to our securing the benefit of additional state and federal income tax credits and settlements throughout this year.","Net income in the quarter was $177 million, 22% above last year's $145 million. Average diluted share count in the quarter was 380.2 million shares, down 7% from last year's 407.9 million shares. And earnings per share on a diluted basis was therefore $0.47 or $0.31 -- 31% above last year's $0.36 per share.","Inventory at the end of the third quarter was up 7% over last year and consistent with our plan. As I discussed at the end of the second quarter, this increase was caused by the calendar shift, with last year having the 53rd week, there are unusual inventory comparisons at the end of each quarter. We aim to have inventory in our stores on the same calendar date regardless of when it falls in the fiscal calendar, since that helps customers shop. So for example, the last day of the third quarter this year was November 2 versus last year when it was October 27. So receipts in the first day of November were booked in the third quarter this year and the fourth quarter last year. And also, with our November sales growth planned significantly higher than that in December and January due to the compressed calendar and, to a lesser extent, the year rounding on Sandy, we needed to be sure we had stock in stores and in warehouses to support our growth. By year end, however, we do expect inventories to be back at a more normal level of increase relative to the prior year.","This inventory increase, net of payables, was the primary reason the net cash provided by operations was $70 million below last year. But remember, this is due to timing.","Cash flow from investing activities was $74 million favorable to last year. So cash flow before financing activities was $4 million above last year. We utilized $447 million to buy back 10.1 million shares in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have bought back 27.6 million shares for $1.25 billion. We also issued $400 million of 10-year debt during the quarter with a coupon of 4 3\/8.","As you read in our press release, our guidance for the fall season is unchanged. For comp sales, we are expecting 2.5% to 4% for the back half of the year. We do expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the fourth quarter, but hope to be able to offset it with lower SG&A as a percent to sales. Year rounding on the 53rd week, however, does put pressure on the SG&A rate. And we continue to expect our annual earnings per share on a diluted basis to be $3.80 to $3.90.","So while we are very satisfied with our performance in the third quarter, all eyes at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's are now focused ahead to the fourth quarter. And we are very excited about what we see for the holiday season. We feel especially prepared this year. Our merchants have outstanding assortments planned for every store and online. Our stores, macys.com, bloomingdales.com and our mobile apps are being continuously improved to enhance the customer shopping experience. We have more fulfillment capacity, including 4 online fulfillment mega centers, as well as 500 Macy's stores now equipped for shipping. And you will be seeing very compelling marketing again this year.","This year, as you know, we have 6 fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So the holiday shopping season will be shorter and more intense. We expect a heightened sense of urgency among customers, so it's important that we be ready for her every day, every time and every way she shops. Our promotional calendar is full of great fashion and gifts with great value.","And speaking of gifts, the merchants have been working all year on a fabulous assortment of items, especially for Macy's from our stars, Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy, Calvin Klein, Michael Kors and others. You will see these store gifts in every door and in the spirit of My Macy's, they are being tailored by region. There will be no doubt that Macy's is the holiday headquarters for gifts.","We are mindful of mitigating factors, such as the economy and the shorter season, so we have redoubled our efforts to notch up our holiday execution. We believe we are well positioned to capture more than our fair share of the business. We hope you are as excited as we are about what you will be seeing at Macy's and Bloomingdale's in holiday 2013.","And now, I'm happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our take our first question from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, at the June Analyst Day, you outlined an algorithm, it was pretty impressive, 5% top line, equating to 15% net income and a 20% earnings growth profile. Any changes to the plan as we think forward? And with that, your appetite for potentially increased capital allocation, if the backdrop were to stabilize through holiday?","Karen M. Hoguet","So, as we look at it, there really hasn't been a change. Our strategies are working, our outlook is really unchanged. And we're always looking for opportunities to invest our capital wisely. But at this point, I think our budget for next year, which is approximately $1 billion, give or take some, is what we expect to spend.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then, from a marketing and promotional standpoint. I mean, it sounds like you guys stuck to the outlined game plan, the more aggressive game plan you talked about last quarter. Can you talk about some of the changes that worked in the quarter? And as you talk about doubling down into the holiday, what incrementally we should think about into 4Q and into the holiday here?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think what we did is when the second quarter started, we looked at some of our promotional events and decided that, perhaps, they had become a bit stale. So we changed some of the promotional handles. For example, added Doorbusters and Deals of the Day as opposed to morning specials. We looked at the actual items that we had been promoting and decided some of them needed to be changed or freshened. And we spent a lot of time analyzing which items drove other business, what we call radiated sales, so that we could do this intelligently. We also worked in the stores to make the visual better for the customers in the stores, to see the values that we were offering. So as I said, it was a complete team effort. The stores, the websites, marketing, merchants, everybody was involved here.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Swinand from Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You talked a little bit at one of the conferences about omnichannel and localization. I'm wondering if you're doing promotions or omnichannel marketing that's leveraging the localization that you're getting out of My Macy's?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, when we do marketing, we are doing localized marketing when there's a particular item or event going on in that community, things like the Kentucky Derby or sporting events. So that is happening. But so much of the marketing is more nationally driven. But when you think about the localization of assortments, often its sizes, colors within our major brands, it's not completely different merchandise, so the national marketing works well.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Got it. Interesting. And then kind of on the same lines, with the license sales, is that driving incremental traffic and are they marketing both online and nationally as well in coordination with you?","Karen M. Hoguet","They are. And we believe that for businesses like Finish Line or Sunglass Hut, some of the big installations, we do think it helps traffic and it's just part of the overall plan for getting more customers in the door.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You mentioned analyzing incremental or ancillary sales from the traffic. Is that also resulting in sales to other departments?","Karen M. Hoguet","In some cases, yes.","Operator","And we have a question from Charles Grom from Stern Agee.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Karen, on your -- on the second quarter call, you called out -- I mean, you referenced some crowding-out concerns. Just wondering if you feel as if those pressures abated or did you guys just simply execute better here because there's a pretty big swing in your comp from quarter-to-quarter.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think as we said at the end of the second quarter, we needed to make some tweaks in what we were doing, keep the fundamental strategies, but perhaps execute slightly differently. And we spent the second quarter putting it all together and working together as opposed to overreacting too quickly. And what we changed did work in the third quarter, as you can see. Business was strong in August and September, strengthened in October, but it was strong all quarter.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Good to know. And then just first half of the year, you also called out that budget shopper is being a little bit weaker, but appears that the value message resonated a little bit more. Any thoughts on that customer demographic?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it's hard to tell. Once again, we're reporting first. So we need to wait and see how other people did. I think we did well with that customer in the quarter, but, again, I have to wait and see how our competitors did.","Charles X. Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then just the last question on the guidance, the implied fourth quarter view. It looks like you're projecting, roughly speaking, about say 50 basis points of margin compression versus last year despite going against your easiest comparison of last year. So just wondering, is that mainly the cycling of the 53rd week or is there some credit gift pack, just can you help us out on connecting the dots there?","Karen M. Hoguet","I'm not sure how you came up with that estimate, so maybe we should talk offline. That doesn't sound right.","Operator","And we have a question from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Karen, I'm wondering if you can just talk to us about your philosophy in terms of SG&A management. I think there was, obviously, a really nice surprise here in the SG&A expense in the third quarter. How do you think about monitoring your business as it's unfolding and whether to release SG&A dollars or pull in SG&A dollars? And was there any sort of concerted effort in the quarter to be really sort of lean with the SG&A budget?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think Macy's has always been very disciplined on the expense line. And we always try to be lean but appropriately investing in growing the business. And I think the third quarter demonstrated that again. We did invest in marketing, as we said we were going to do. And still, from the bottom line perspective, did a terrific job, I think, in terms of the SG&A performance. But we are always disciplined and always looking for ways of being more efficient. I don't know that we did anything differently in the third quarter.","Operator","And we have Stacie Rabinowitz from Consumer Edge Research.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","So you've been talking on the call about the difference in the marketing this quarter. And you've been talking a lot about choosing different items: better, bolder, different kinds of advertising and messaging. Was there anything, any point, any category where it was just plain deeper discounting, or was it really just a more targeted, better executed marketing strategy?","Karen M. Hoguet","No, it really was just more targeted, better strategy. I would not say there was any wholesale deeper discounting going on. Did we give some additional value? Yes, in some places, we did. But nothing that obviously hurt the bottom line of the company in any dramatic way.","Operator","And we have a question from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just going back to your comments on the cadence of the quarter. You mentioned that October, you saw some accelerated demand. Could you just speak at all to kind of the magnitude of October's results versus earlier in the quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, there's a lot of focus on October. I'm not quite sure why. The whole quarter was very strong and October did get stronger. But from my perspective, I'd focus on the third quarter in total. But the strategy worked right out of the gates.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then early on the call, you spoke about capital plans for next year likely being in that $1 billion range once again. From that standpoint, is the leverage target still 2.4 to 2.7? And if that is the case, given how well the cash flow generation, the EBITDA growth has been, are you still open to adding debt to the balance sheet either this year or next?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think the easiest way of answering that, Paul, is that it is still the credit rate targets, the 2.4 to 2.7. And my guess is we would stay towards the middle of the high -- lower end of that as opposed to levering up too much. But again, with the EBITDA growing, there is some capacity.","Operator","And we have a question from Paul Lejuez from Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Karen, just wondering if you can quantify, on the gross margin line, how much the shipping cost hurt that line versus the merchandise margin decline? And then just wondering about any specific categories that, perhaps, took the brunt of the merch margin compression or was it more broad-based?","Karen M. Hoguet","It was broad-based. And we don't break out the components of margin that way.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got you. And how about the performance of mall stores versus off-mall stores, Karen?","Karen M. Hoguet","We don't have many off-mall stores. I mean, we have the big freestanding stores like Herald Square, 59th Street, but almost -- most of our stores are in malls.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Any comment on that store, how the progress is going in terms of the refurbishment and what's that doing to business in the Herald Square store?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, the progress is terrific. The first and second floors are just about all open again for business, look terrific. And the renovated areas are exceeding our expectations. So we feel really good about what's been done down here.","Operator","And our next question is from Liz Dunn from Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess as we look at this earlier opening, the Thanksgiving opening, are you looking at the fact that more people are doing it this year as an opportunity because there will be more traffic and more excitement around it, or do you think it's, perhaps, more of a risk because there will be more places for the consumer to go?","Karen M. Hoguet","No, I think that would be an opportunity, if you look at it on a balance.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. As we think about these licensed categories, is the net financial impact positive or are you looking at that more as just being able to offer kind of better merchandise to your consumers? And did you see any lift in adjacent categories to those categories that you licensed?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. What we do is, as we're looking at licensed categories, it's always driven by assortments we want to offer the customer. So for example, in the case of athletic footwear, we were not able to offer the best brands, the best shoes within those brands to the customer on our own. And by partnering with Finish Line, we've been able to do that. So it's always driven by trying to give our customers the best assortments we possibly can. And we often find that it helps. So for example, I think the athletic footwear business is helping our active business, as well as some of the millennial categories. So I think that's good for us. And I believe Finish Line, it's been good for them as well.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Do you think there are any other big categories to do this in?","Karen M. Hoguet","I would say there's some smaller categories, but at this point, I can't think of anything of major size. But again, we're always looking to be able to offer the customer merchandise that we think she expects from Macy's and try to get it in the best way that we can.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then final question. Can we just have a little bit more color on the performance of Bloomingdale's during the quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I'm sorry, we always tend to focus on the 90%. Bloomingdale's had a very good quarter and improved their trend relative to the spring season as well. So I would say, it's fairly comparable performance deltas and continues to do well.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Karen, so I'm -- really quickly just on the near-term here. It looks like the comp for the fourth quarter could be anywhere from about 2% to 4%. And you've obviously been ahead of it and had a good read on what the promotional environment need to be for the year. With all that given, when you sat down and thought about the range for the fourth quarter, what do you think it takes to get to the high end of that range?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I mean, it's a good question. I'll stop and think about it. Obviously, a little help from the economy would always be helpful to that end and it would just have to mean that our assortments and execution was even that much better than our peers. And I think would be the 2 factors, I would think. And also, by the way, weather.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. It sounds like you're pretty happy with November trend so far. I guess how do you gauge how much of what we're seeing is really calendar comparison-related versus a true pickup in demand, since the 6 fewer shopping days you mentioned will compress December? I guess...","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, again, if you look at the third quarter, we were pleased throughout the quarter. So that's really what our optimism is based on.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just my last question. So in the quarter there was a nice article run about you guys significantly increasing the space you're allocating to the athletic brand. I mean, maybe you could talk a little bit about why the time is now to get bigger there, what did you learn. And I'm always, frankly, impressed with how quickly these things are rolled out in your stores after you mentioned it in an article. So how soon will we see more of these Nike, Under Armour, North Face's shops rolling out through your stores?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it's no surprise that active has become an important part of what customers are wearing and needing. Sometimes it's for athletic endeavor, sometimes it's just to run errands. And we've solid big opportunity here and, in fact, that's what is happening in terms of performance in the stores.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","How fast do you see that rolling out?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, all of -- most of our stores today have active and we'll just be expanding them as we see opportunities, again, from a My Macy's perspective, with what kinds of assortments.","Operator","And our next question is from Jeff Stein from Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Karen, could you talk a little bit about the millennial brands that you've introduced this year. You've called out Maison Jules as one of your more successful brands, but wondering about some of the others you've introduced. And it seems that most were rolled out to a limited number of doors for fall. So I'm wondering, based on the performance that you've seen from all of the brands collectively, should we look for a material expansion as we head into spring?","Karen M. Hoguet","So I think you'll see big expansions as we go into next year. As I said, that business has done very well. Maison Jules has been particularly successful. I think it's probably the first private brand launch that we've done that was done through the lens of My Macy's. And we actually put different assortments in different regions and different colors and different sizing. Plus, we also incorporated the omnichannel strategies. So there's tagging on the merchandise that offers extended sizes and colors online. So interestingly, Maison Jules is the first time we've launched a brand where we had, what I would call the whole MOM strategy encompassed, and it's been very successful. I would say some of the other brands have -- some have done well, some have done less well. And sometimes it just takes time for a new brand to be tweaked and fine-tuned and improved. But by and large, we feel very good about the brand launches and do expect to have quite a bit of rollout as we go into '14.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Great. And with respect to your online business, can you talk about the momentum in Q3 relative to Q2? Because I understand, if I remember correctly, that you did see a little bit of weakening in Q2 in your online business. And what's going on with respect to how you're achieving your growth? Is it more transaction-driven, average unit retail or both?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, the online business, as we said, when we stopped reporting it separately, is getting just so hard to measure because so many customers are shopping online, going in the store to buy and vice versa. So it really is hard to break it out and say that -- having said that, the business has not weakened and is very strong. Now that may be customers on the smartphone in the store, but nonetheless, if you look at online transactions, it's done very well.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Great. Great. And from a marketing perspective, are you also planning to increase your marketing as a percent to sales in Q4 if you hit your comp guidance range?","Karen M. Hoguet","I can't be that specific, Jeff.","Operator","And our next question is from Richard Jaffe from Stifel.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Karen, just a question on the junior's business. It seems like mstylelab is an opportunity and any thoughts of why that hasn't performed as well as the better junior's and what might be done in time for Christmas?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes -- no. It's been a tough business for us, as you know, for a while. We did begin to see some improvement. Now we are making some changes in the assortment, getting a little bit more key item-focused. And we're feeling a little more encouraged, but we are getting much more success with that older millennial customer through the Impulse category.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just a quick thought on the effectiveness of the in-store fulfillment of e-commerce sales. Any way you can share that with us, or that you've been able to gauge how well it's been working?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it's been working extremely well. Our stores have done a terrific job executing it and are almost as fast and accurate as our mega centers. So that's really very good news. But the real benefit of the store fulfillment, actually, has -- and hopefully, I can do this simply -- but it is enabling us to put fashion assortments into all of our doors, whereas we might not have done so before having the ability to use that inventory to satisfy internet demand. What it's doing is helping our stores have more fashion, better assortments and getting more four-wall growth, in addition to obviously efficiently getting the goods to our internet customer. The great example of that right now on the floor is cashmere, where we have stocked significantly more fashion colors in all of our Macy\u2019s stores and much less inventory in our mega centers for the fashion colors, so that our stores look better and are growing faster. And at the same time, then, satisfying internet demand from that inventory. So it's really the omnichannel dream.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And the in-store fulfillment, is it meaningful yet or still on the very early stages?","Karen M. Hoguet","No, it's meaningful. I mean, you've got 500 doors and my guess is we'll roll it out to most stores by next year. It is meaningful.","Richard Ellis Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could it someday be a majority of your fulfillment?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't think it'll ever be a majority, but it does enable us to get inventory closer to the customer. One of the things we were testing as of this quarter is \"buy online, pickup in store,\" which based on early reads, I think will for sure be rolled out next year. And so that's another capability that is allowing us to get merchandise to the customer faster in a way that she likes.","Operator","And we have a question from Lorraine Hutchinson from BoA.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Karen, I just wanted to follow up on the merchandise margin. Do you expect pressure to intensify in the fourth quarter? And then how are you thinking about the need to continue to provide that kind of value in the first half of next year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I would say the pressure will continue. Don't know that it will intensify. I may get more thoughts on that as I see others report and hear what they're seeing. But I do expect it to continue. And in terms of spring, it may continue, but I don't think -- I'm not sure yet on spring. We'll have to see.","Operator","And we have a question from David Glick from Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Karen, most of my questions have been answered. I just thought, perhaps, you could give us a little more color on women's apparel. It sounds like the moderate businesses are picking up a bit in the seasonal categories. I'm just trying to get a better understanding on sort of moderate versus better trends and how much is really driven by sort of the stronger value message and the favorable trends in seasonal apparel?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the fall fashion is both wearable and interesting and the customers are responding well. We have consciously gone after that opening price point business lately and have been very successful there. Also getting a benefit from the cold weather goods: sweaters, cashmere, coats, et cetera. Active, because as we talked earlier, both true active and at-leisure is an up-trending category. Private brands are doing well. INC is very strong, as our other of the regular price -- I'm sorry, the opening price point brands. So it's really fairly broad-based.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So that doesn't mean your better brands, which have been a real strength for you over the last several years, that doesn't mean they're slowing down, it's just better performance at the moderate level?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's correct. That's correct.","Operator","And we have a question from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2, if I may. One, I was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit about your inter-quarter traffic trends from month-to-month? And just secondly, I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit more context around how you think about that issuance, given that you do look to be sort of in the low to mid range versus your target. You did come to market in September, but it was only for $400 million. Any thoughts as to why sort of that wasn't a higher figure, given the capacity you have, and do you look to come multiple times a year? Just any color you can provide.","Karen M. Hoguet","I think the only color I can provide in terms of debt issuance is what we've said, which is, again, expect us to be in the mid- to lower end of our range, targeted range of the 2.4 to 2.7. And that's really all I can say on that. And then in terms of trends during the quarter, as we have said, the August-September period was strong as was October. So I don't have the traffic patterns or the transactions by-month in front of me. But it wasn't like business have been weak and suddenly got strong in October.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take a question from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Karen, your license businesses seem to be gaining traction and help to add traffic also. On the existing licensing business, anything different that they're doing that you're learning from at Macy's or Bloomingdale's? And should we be looking for new licensed businesses to be added?","Karen M. Hoguet","Not that I know of in terms of what we're learning, but I'm sure we do both in terms of assortments as well as selling service because we're always looking to learn from any of our partners. And as I said earlier, I don't expect any major new categories to be licensed. But we are always trying to find ways of improving our offering to the customer, so there may be something at some point.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","And then just on the tax rate, does it stay at this level for 2014?","Karen M. Hoguet","At this point, I would say no. My suspicion is -- and again, I don't have the full plan yet -- but my suspicion is it will go back to the 37%-like level.","Operator","We have a question from Michael Exstein from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Karen, a couple of just very quick ones. Was there less disruption to the business from the Herald Square renovation this quarter than previous quarters, number one? Number two, was women's the top-performing area in terms of percentage growth?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, let me do those 2, then you can continue. There was less disruption from Herald Square. There was actually as much disruption but there's more good news, so the net was favorable this year to a year ago in the third quarter.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And what about women's, was that the top percentage gainer for the quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","We don't disclose those numbers.","Michael B. Exstein - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then finally, what would be the implications for the inventory if you added back the inventory that was in place in the licensed businesses that -- formerly owned businesses that are now licensed, in terms of what would be the like-to-like inventory year-over-year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, if you did, if -- let me give it a different way. Comp inventory was just slightly higher, Michael. So it's not a big factor. Maybe a 1%. Yes -- no, I've been focused on the versus-plan comparisons, but a slight impact.","Operator","And we have a question from Rob Wilson from Tiburon Research.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Karen, the $8 million higher credit income in Q3, what should we expect in Q4? And will that be impacted by the extra week last year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we have not given guidance by quarter. We have said that the back half of the year would be much less of an increase than the first half. So I don't expect anything materially different in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, but we really have not given guidance on that.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","So not necessary any real impact from that extra week last year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Again, I'm not giving guidance by quarter.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And one last question. The tax rate, is it -- I guess my math would suggest you're expecting a higher tax rate in Q4 than the first 3 quarters of the year. Is that correct?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's correct. And that relates to the timing of settlements and the receipt of credits.","Operator","We have a question from Brian Roenick from BLR Capital Partners.","Brian Roenick","Just, Karen, in the fourth quarter, as a result of the 53rd week comparison, what do you expect the spread to be between top line and same-store sales?","Karen M. Hoguet","I'm sorry, you've caught me by surprise. My guess is it will be sort of 4.5-ish kind of points. Sort of that kind of a range.","Operator","And Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Karen, just a bit of a follow-up to Richard and Lorraine's questions. But the guidance suggests that you'll have a third straight year of gross margin pressure and I realize part of that has been shipping from online and now some merchandise margin pressure. But can you help us frame the longer-term trajectory of gross margin and maybe specifically, address the opportunity from optimizing inventory across channels?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, my view is, and I've said this forever, that the long-term prospect on gross margin rate should be flattish, there will be quarters and times where it goes up or down. But again, I think flattish is the right long-term perspective.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then when we think about optimizing inventory, and I guess this goes along the getting better fashion brands, is there any way to frame that opportunity and how big that could be?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. There really isn't. I mean, we obviously helped it as we can better optimize inventory, we can, perhaps, improve gross margin rate. But at this point, I think I'd urge people to think flattish.","Operator","And our next question is from Craig Hutson from Loop Capital.","Craig Hutson","Balance sheet-related question. By my count, you have at the end of the latest quarter, 14 issues that have a 7% or higher coupon, which makes you look considerably different than the rest of your investment-grade peers. And now that you're suddenly investment-grade and have that 2.4x to 2.7x leverage target, what is the rationale for not trying to clean up the balance sheet and go after and tender for a lot of those high-cost debt?","Karen M. Hoguet","We constantly do the math on that. And it gets to an issue of what the net present value of these kinds of transactions are.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Karen, yesterday, I was at the Bay Shore mall in Long Island where you have a new store. The retailers there say traffic in the mall has picked up since the store opened, which implies a good performance for the store. I'm wondering if you could give us a little color on that. But my main point is that the appearance of the store is really nice, but different than from what you have in your traditional stores to a certain degree. From that, can we judge that there were thoughts that you might have with regard to renovations of the stores going forward? And if so, could you give us some thoughts on that?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, unfortunately, Bernie, I don't know the answer to the question. I hear the store looks spectacular. We are very happy with it. I think everybody on the team has now been there, except for me. So unfortunately, I don't know the answer to your question. I'll get it and get back to you. But I know we are very pleased with how it looks and how it's doing.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, I -- it's the positive impression that I got that caused me to ask the question.","Karen M. Hoguet","Good. Well, I'll find that and get back to you. Yes, thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Greg Hessler from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","At this time, I'll turn the conference over, back to Karen Hoguet, for any final closing remarks.","Karen M. Hoguet","Great. I just want to thank you, all, for your support and your interest in Macy's. And, hopefully, you'll do a lot of shopping with us during the fourth quarter. Thanks, and I'll talk to you, all, soon.","Operator","Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation today."],"13977":["Macy's, Inc.

Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Good morning. This is Karen Hoguet, CFO of Macy's. I'm joined today by Jeff Gennette, our CEO. We both want to welcome you onto the call and thank you for your interest in our company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes.","Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning. Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today, due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","I'm going to turn the call over to Jeff now.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, thanks, Karen, and good morning, everybody. So, let me dive right in. So, we are on track to hit our full year sales and earnings guidance. Overall, we're pleased with our third quarter results. Karen is going to take you to the details later, but I wanted to give you a few headlines.","So, in the third quarter: owned plus leased comp sales were down 3.6%; gross margin was up 10 basis points over last year; comp inventory was down 4.2%; SG&A was down 5.5%; and earnings were up compared to a year ago. So, overall, a good quarter, but know that we are intensely focused on improving our comp sales trend.","So, while we have work to do, I want to step back and look at the bigger picture. I'm confident that we're taking the right steps to get that trend moving in the right direction. This includes: our approach to marketing and customer engagement; to our edited and elevated product assortment that shows our fashion authority; to the continued integration of technology, particularly mobile, across the full customer experience.","We're focused on executing strongly against our plans in each of these areas in the crucial fourth quarter ahead. Progress here will provide the momentum we need to return to comp sales growth in the future.","So, let me take a moment to detail two areas that performed well in the third quarter that will be very important drivers of sales in the fourth quarter. So, the first one is digital sales. We had another very solid sales performance in the third quarter, with double-digit growth. And we anticipate that digital will contribute strongly in the fourth quarter, as we know our customers are increasingly transacting both online and in our stores.","We anticipate a sales lift in the fourth quarter in digital of approximately 100 to 150 basis points from the increase in penetration of digital sales, and our guidance reflects that. In addition, to fuel this growth, we've significantly improved our search engine optimization. We've shifted more of our media spend to digital. We've enhanced our delivery options, whether it's expanded same day delivery services or buy online, pickup in store.","We will continue to improve both functionality and user experience of the Macy's app because we expect mobile shopping on Macy's to be very big this holiday season.","The second area that will give us lift in the fourth quarter is the new loyalty program which we launched on October 2. As we shared with you in June at our Investor Meeting, a robust loyalty program is a key element of the North Star Strategy and getting it to our customers in time for the fourth quarter was a big step forward for us.","And just to remind everybody, our overall goals for the loyalty program: number one, we wanted to strengthen our relationships with our best customers, and that's about 10% of our customer base that currently account for about half of our sales. Second, within our existing customer base, we wanted to migrate customers up to higher spending levels. And third, we wanted to use the loyalty program to attract new customers to Macy's and encourage those infrequent Macy's shoppers to come to us more often.","So the October 2 launch was focused on our proprietary cardholders and it supported those first two goals, strengthening relationships and the upward migration of spend. So, early results are promising. We're getting some very positive feedback from our customers, particularly around free shipping. But in 2018, we're going to roll out further enhancements to Star Rewards as well as expand the program beyond our existing proprietary card base.","So, now looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we're excited about our plans for the holiday season. And this is really a time where Macy's truly shines. We're bringing our fashion authority to bear on holiday trends across all categories. We have an updated marketing approach, including creative that will tap into the heart of the Macy's brand. We're ensuring our customers get the convenience she needs to shop the way she lives; in our stores, through our app and on Macys.com. And we're committed to giving her the great holiday experience that she expects from Macy's: from the holiday traditions at the Thanksgiving Day Parade; to the tree lightings across the country; to the Believe campaign, where millions of children send their letters to Santa. So we look forward to getting this holiday season underway.","And in the fourth quarter and beyond, while driving sales is a big priority, at the same time, we're managing our resources smartly, to fund efficiency and fund growth. Much of this effort is around cost management, and we're doing a good job here.","We're also making continued progress on the organizational side, getting more streamlined and efficient and moving more quickly. To that point, we're seeing benefits from the merchandising restructure that we announced in late August. And, just as a reminder, we massively simplified Macy's approach to merchandising by collapsing three organizations into one and building a more direct connection between merchandising and our improved data analytics capabilities. So we're working faster and smarter. We're responding more quickly to our customer, and we're engaging more effectively with our brand partners.","And also since our earnings last call, we also welcomed Hal Lawton, Macy's President, to the company. He joined in mid-September and he has hit the ground running. We're excited about the expertise that he brings to the table, and this experience is squarely at the intersection of technology and retail. Hal will have a real impact with the Macy's brand.","So to sum it up, we're focused on delivering a strong fourth quarter and heading into 2018 with momentum. And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Karen to walk you through the third quarter results in more detail.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff. In the third quarter, sales were $5.281 billion, down 6.1% versus last year and down 3.6% on a comp owned plus licensed basis. This is slightly worse than we expected, attributable primarily to the hurricanes and the warm fall weather. We estimate that the hurricane impact hurt our sales in the quarter by approximately $20 million, or 30 basis points. And sales of cold-weather merchandise were approximately $50 million lower than expected, due to the unseasonably-warm weather. International tourist sales dropped 11.7% in the third quarter, hurting our comp by 50 basis points. Part of this, though, is double-counted with the hurricane impact.","Our digital business, as Jeff said, had another strong quarter, now making it 33 quarters in a row with double-digit growth. And we are pleased with the performance of our Backstage stores within our Macy's stores and are excited by the potential of this concept. It is the only mall-based, off-price concept which we now are realizing gives us a competitive advantage. Details are still being developed, but we plan to expand it aggressively next year.","Our strongest families of business during the quarter were: fragrances; fine jewelry; dresses; men's tailored clothing; active; and shoes, excluding boots. We were also encouraged by the improved trend in handbags as well as cosmetics.","The weakest categories in the quarter were all the cold-weather businesses, including coats, boots and winter accessories, as I had mentioned. In addition, sales were softer in the home-related businesses at Macy's during the quarter, although the sales in these categories did improve significantly in October. Sales at Bloomingdale's were stronger than Macy's, particularly in the home categories. And Bluemercury had a good quarter as well.","Geographically, our sales were relatively similar across the country, other than the hurricane-impacted areas. In the third quarter, transactions were down 7.3%, average units per transaction were up 1%, and the average unit retail was up 2.9%, in large part due to lower clearance activity.","We continue to feel good about the strategies outlined at the June Investor Meeting: Backstage, the key merchandise initiatives and retain sales after our store closures. These initiatives produced approximately $50 million in incremental sales in the quarter. We remain on track to deliver the forecasted $200 million to $260 million for the second through fourth quarters this year from these initiatives. In addition, as Jeff said, we launched our new loyalty program in October and have received great customer feedback, as well as from our associates.","Our gross margin rate in the quarter was 39.9%, up 10 basis points from last year. This is much improved from the first half of the year when we were down 80 basis points versus last year.","Our merchandise margin was flattish in the quarter. Inventory at the end of the quarter was down 6.9%, or 4.2% on a comp basis. These lower inventory levels helped our gross margin rate in the third quarter, due to having less clearance merchandise we needed to liquidate.","This inventory level also puts us in great shape for the fourth quarter, with lots of open-to-buy available for fresh merchandise to drive sales, and not too much carry-forward inventory that would need to be liquidated.","SG&A dollars, excluding asset sale gains, were $1.995 billion, $117 million or 5.5% below last year. Year-to-date, we are now $286 million below last year on this basis as compared to our annual reduction target of $305 million. We did, however, benefit from some timing shifts from the third to the fourth quarter, particularly in marketing. But even with this shift, we are on track to exceed our annual target.","Our SG&A is lower than last year, as you know, due to the restructuring that we completed at the end of fiscal 2016 as well as the impact of the closed stores. We are continuing to restructure areas on a continual basis, so that we can both reduce costs and become not only leaner, but also more nimble. These cost reductions were partially offset by our continuing investment in digital, our shoe and jewelry strategies, and the expansion of Backstage as well as Bluemercury.","Income from credit in the third quarter was approximately $161 million, $4 million below last year. Penetration of our proprietary cards in the quarter was 47.4%, down 110 basis points from last year in the third quarter, although the trend improved to only 70 basis points below last year in October, after we began the launch of our new loyalty program. And remember that this credit income does not include some costs associated with our credit operation, including fraud and new account originations.","Book gains associated with asset sales were $65 million in the quarter. This compares to $41 million last year. During the quarter, we completed the transaction to sell two floors of our Downtown Seattle store for approximately $50 million. We booked a gain associated with this sale of approximately $40 million.","We are in the process of shrinking our store to four floors, and in so doing, making it a far better, more vibrant shopping destination. During the quarter, we also booked $22 million of gain associated with Downtown Brooklyn, and we closed a few other small asset sales for a total of $3 million of gain.","In the third quarter, we booked $33 million of costs associated with our restructuring and cost-reduction efforts. This is higher than the $20 million to $25 million discussed in September, when we announced the restructuring of our merchandising organization. We have recently restructured our marketing function, as well as other areas which added to these restructuring-related costs, that also will enable us to save an additional $8 million on an annual basis and at the same time, improving the effectiveness of our organization.","We booked $22 million of settlement charges in the quarter associated with the lump-sum payouts in our retirement plans. So excluding the restructuring and settlement charges, operating income was $176 million in the quarter, which is 4.1% above last year. Interest expense was $74 million in the quarter and tax expense, $13 million.","Average share count on a diluted basis was 306.5 million shares. Earnings per share on a diluted basis, excluding the restructuring and settlement charges, was $0.23 in the quarter, up 35% over last year. Cash flow from operating activities was $389 million this year, $81 million above last year. This is due primarily to lower cash outflow for inventory, which offset a few other negative cash flow items.","Cash flow from investing activities was an outflow of $346 million, $145 million lower than last year, due both to lower CapEx as well as higher asset sales.","Therefore, cash flow before financing activities was an inflow of $43 million, $226 million higher than last year's $183 million use of cash. We did not repurchase any debt or any stock during the quarter, and we ended the quarter with $534 million of cash on the balance sheet, $77 million above last year.","So as we look to the fourth quarter, we are expecting an improvement in our comp sales trend on an owned plus licensed basis relative to that produced in the third quarter. This expected improvement in trend is primarily due to five factors that Jeff mentioned earlier: the higher digital penetration in the quarter; the launch of our loyalty program; our new marketing strategy; additional post-hurricane recovery; and, hopefully, cold weather. And we expect our merchandise initiatives, the retain sales from closed stores, and Backstage will continue to contribute to our sales, as previously mentioned.","So in order to achieve the annual owned plus licensed comp of minus 3%, our fourth quarter comp would need to be minus 1.9%. And on the other side of our guidance, to reach the upper end of our guidance, which is minus 2% for the year, we would need to grow 1.1% in the fourth quarter. We think it likely that we'll be at the lower end of our sales range for the year.","We remain confident that our earnings will be within the previously-guided range for the year of $3.38 to $3.63, including the $234 million gain associated with last year's sale of our Union Square Men's store.","Our guidance for the fourth quarter ties back to the guidance we gave back in August for the fall season. It remains essentially unchanged. We had guided then to a gross margin decline of 20 to 50 basis points for the last two quarters of the year, which would now imply, given the third quarter performance, that the fourth quarter would be down 30 to 80 basis points.","The fourth quarter merchandise margin is expected to be flattish, like it was in the third quarter. But our gross margin is expected to be negatively impacted by the free ship offering for our best customers as part of the new loyalty program.","For SG&A dollars, excluding asset sale gains, we had guided for minus 3% to minus 4% from last year for the back half of the year, which now implies down 0.7% to down 2.6% for the fourth quarter. We now expect to be at the better end of this range and, as I said earlier, exceed our targeted $305 million annual SG&A reduction. And there's also no change in our assumptions for credit income, asset sale gains, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, CapEx and the tax rate.","So to sum things up before we open the line for questions, overall, our team is pleased with how the third quarter played out. And we are very excited about our plans for the holiday season. We are focused on executing a robust digital sales strategy and continuing to execute on the initiatives we outlined for you earlier in the year. Our inventory is in good shape, which is helping our gross margin. And we continue to deliver on our commitments to reduce SG&A. Our cash flow continues to be healthy, and we are generating cash above that needed to fund our CapEx and our dividend. While we did not repurchase debt in this quarter, we remain committed to using our excess cash to reduce debt to achieve our targeted leverage ratio. We continue to believe that maintaining our investment grade rating is important.","And with that, Jeff and I will now take your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan","Thanks. So, Jeff, on the promising results to the Star Rewards loyalty that you've seen so far, I guess what has you the most optimistic about the launch? And can you just talk about also about the lift that you're seeing today at Backstage and how that compares to your 10% target over time that you'd like to see there?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Matt. So, the first thing on loyalty, is it's too early for us to measure the results of it. We launched it in the beginning of October, and cards are coming into customers all the way through the month. What's been great about it is getting the initial reads from the customers about it. They find it easy to understand. They're very clear on what the rewards are. You're already hearing customers talk about them.","We're getting this all from our associate population about if they're a Gold customer what it would take to be a Platinum customer. They're very clear on what the step up rewards. We're already seeing the Rewards Certificates being used. We did a nice job launching this, so I think our associates are fully on board. They appreciate how simple it is. Our customers are appreciating it. As mentioned, they're excited about the free ship and the 5% back in rewards with no exclusions is popular, so, so far so good. And we hope to tell you statistical results in the future.","And then, with respect to your question about Backstage, we're on track. We now are getting a cumulative \u2013 about a 7 point lift in the 45 stores that have Backstage within them, the full line stores that have Backstage within them. And that is 7 points towards our ultimate goal of getting it to 10. So we're on track. As Karen mentioned, we're going through all of the planning now to have a more aggressive rollout in 2018 and beyond.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan","That's great. And then, Karen, so on track to exceed $300 million of SG&A savings this year. What's the best way to think about efficiencies from here as we look forward? And larger picture, just how do you think about growing EBIT dollars versus expanding EBIT margin at Macy's over time?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I would say we're continuing to look for opportunities to, frankly, make the organization work more effectively. The good news with that is it also comes with cost reduction, but it's really being driven by how can we make decisions faster and better as we go forward. And I would say our focus is really on growing comp sales again. And so, we're focused as much on EBITDA dollars, but doing things intelligently and in a balanced way, as we always have. But I would say we are focused on getting back to comp sales as a big objective of ours going forward.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan","Great. Best of luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks and good morning. I guess the question on the transactions, Karen, down, I think you said, 7.3%. Can you maybe give us some perspective there? Is that the hurricane or warm weather impact and sort of what you're planning from a transaction perspective as you enter the fourth quarter? And then, you mentioned about the capital allocation, but obviously there's been a lot of focus on the dividend and on the dividend yield. Can you maybe give some perspective of how you sort of think about allocating the capital? And what would cause you to consider cutting the dividend from a cash flow perspective? Thank you very much.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Sure. In terms of the transactions, I do think it's an impact of the warm weather and the hurricane. So, I really am not making too much of that as we go forward. In terms of the dividend, I think as you all know, it's an important part of how we plan to use our excess cash. And as we've said, our cash flow generated is very strong. So when you think about paying out the dividend, we're very comfortable with that piece of it. Obviously, the yield is higher than we had expected it to be, but that's a function of the stock price.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I would just add to what Karen said about transactions is we are focused on getting AUR improvement, where it's warranted. And we've made a play in our merchandise assortments to elevating and editing them and then elevating the trim, the make, the fabrics. And where we've done that and when we do that well, our customers' paying higher retails for the units that we're selling. So that's encouraging, so expect us to continue to stand by edited and elevated assortments.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, Karen, just on the cash flow uses, how should we be thinking about CapEx? Is there any early thoughts about next year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","You know, I think that over the last couple of years, our capital has been between sort of $900 million and $1 billion, so I would think about it in that range. Remember that some of the real estate transactions that we're doing are requiring us to spend capital. So as we're evaluating asset sales, for example, Union Square, as we go to integrate the closure of the Men's building, that requires capital. So that may lead us to spend a little bit more than what we're spending this year, but not over historic level.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Super. Thanks. Good luck for the holiday.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Not sure if you're willing to share, Jeff, but curious what Hal Lawton has been focused on since joining Macy's? His reputation at eBay and HD [Home Depot] and throughout the industry is very strong, and, obviously, he's a great add to the team.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, Chuck, he's diving headfirst in, and he's taken a real hands-on approach to learning the business. Two big things; he's got the teams focused on delivering fourth quarter, and he's working on a strategy that, as Karen mentioned, is going to help return us to comp sales growth. So we're very excited about having Hal, and we expect a significant impact with his leadership. And I think it's going to really be at the crossroads of retail and technology. That's the big plus that Hal will bring. And not only does he have that, but he also knows how to operate at scale. And so he's been here eight weeks, and it's all good.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, great. And then, Karen, back in June, you talked about the $200 million to $260 million of estimated incremental sales from the three efforts. I think you benefited $60 million in 2Q, $50 million in the third quarter. Would you still expect to generate that $200 million to $260 million for the full year now? Or do you think there's some upside to it?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No. The $200 million to $260 million was for the three quarters, and yes, I do expect to achieve that.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, great. And then my last question, Kohl's just spoke to a big recovery in their seasonal business during the second half of October and into early November. Given that the weather's become more favorable, curious if you guys have seen a similar trend so far.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","We have.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey thanks, guys. Karen, any update you can share on sales transfer rates and maybe what sort of lift you're getting to the comp from the sales transfer after stores have been closed? And then second, just on credit, how do you think about what to expect on credit as you close stores? Just, is there a lag between when the stores close, when you might lose that credit customer? Just want to think a little bit about planning the credit contribution looking out to next year. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","So, the first question's easy, which is the retention from the closed stores stayed about the same in the third quarter at about 12%. So, I think that we're hovering in at that level, which is very good. And as I've said, that ranges. There's a big range store-by-store, but in total, it was about 12%.","In terms of credit, I'm not sure I understand your question vis-\u00e0-vis lag. We try really hard, obviously, not to lose any credit customers. And either if we're closing a store in a market, we're trying hard to retain their sales in other stores. And in markets that are freestanding, using dot-com to try to retain their business.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Right. So then, Karen, on the 12% retention, is that largely a credit customer that you're retaining? Is that how to think about it? I'm just trying to think of should we expect your credit income, your share in that income, to go down over time as you close stores and you lose some customers, you don't retain them all? Just trying to wrap my head around that.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, Paul, well this year though as you know, we've guided for credit income to go up, even with those closed stores. So I don't think that would make a big difference in the answer.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Why's that?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Because obviously, the stores have closed this year. I don't think there's a lag effect to it.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","What's driving credit income to go up, Karen?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well it's a combination of usage of the card as well as the credit profitability.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","And by the way, we didn't say it was going to go up significantly, so.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Yes. Got it. Thanks, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Heather Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Heather Balsky on for Lorraine. First, just as you think about your margins in the near term and the shift to e-commerce, for next year, especially given higher shipping costs, what could the impact be if online is higher than plan in 4Q? And how do you think about it next year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I don't think it's so much an issue of online. I think we understand that pretty well. I think to some degree, we've got to see the loyalty program and what impact that has. So I think, Heather, we'll wait until we get through the fourth quarter before we comment on that.","Heather Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, you also spoke about improvement in handbag and cosmetics. Could you just address both categories, what you think is driving the improvement and how's the promotional cadence in both?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So I'll take that, Heather. So the first thing is on beauty is, the beauty business is where we had strength in fragrances all through the first half of the year. It got stronger in the third quarter. And that is we had a lot of new launches that the customer is responding to very favorably. And Macy's being the number one destination for premier fragrances, we get a lot of those new customers and new sales when the launches are good.","When you look at the balance of the beauty business and look at color and treatment, skincare is improving and our business and in our big brands is improving. So we had better performance in the third quarter than we did in the first half in those other parts of the business.","And we're laser-focused on continuing momentum that we're starting to see in the beauty area. We've got new leadership in this category. We're trying new tests. We've got a bunch of new tests that are being, testing all the way through the fourth quarter that we're going to learn from and looking at rollouts into 2018.","With respect to handbags, handbags is exceeding our expectations. We are lapping a very promotional year last year with some of the big brands. Supply and demand is much more in check, not only at Macy's but across all retail channels in the handbag category. And there is more of a concentration from the great brands out there on newness and on really serving products and categories and values that are very customer-focused. So we're taking advantage of that, along with all of our competitors, so the handbag business is definitely better than it was. And we expect that to stabilize in comps in the future.","Heather Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Morning.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Merchandise margins were nicely flat in 3Q and I believe you expect it to be very similar in the fourth quarter, despite much tougher compares. You had a lot of success on that front a year ago. Can you just elaborate on what drives your confidence there? Any puts and takes around the inventory position and mix would be helpful.","And then just on the real estate side, if you can just give an update on the Brookfield partnership, any broader thoughts around the state of your store fleet. And then lastly, I just wanted to confirm, Karen, that you reiterated the original guidance for the year in terms of real estate gains, the $235 million for Union Square and then I think another $275 million to $300 million in asset gains outside of Union Square?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Paul, I'll start. I'll take the first part of your question, which is on merchandise margins and then Karen will take your real estate questions. So I think the biggest reason for the improvement in margins has been where our inventory position is. And if you look at the first half of 2017, we had carryover from a very tough fourth quarter in sales last year. And we were out of parity. We had too much inventory for the demand generated online and in our stores. So there was a lot of liquidation that was going on. We really entered the third quarter in a good inventory position, as we reported last earnings call, and we're in a very good position right now.","So, we are not anticipating having to liquidate a lot of unplanned inventory walking into the fourth quarter. And when you look at what Karen mentioned, we have built in freshness, so the opportunity to react in-season and with our streamlined merchandising organization that is armed with an empty \u2013 well, not an empty, but with an available checkbook, we're able to react to those things that are tested, that are known, that are giving us higher margin because the sell-throughs are better when it comes in. So it's a good formula to have our inventories in the position that they're in for the sales that are in the quarter ahead and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","And on real estate, we continue to execute the strategies that we've talked to you all about. Let me start with the question around gains. Yes, we are confirming the guidance that we had given in August of $275 million to $300 million of gains from Brooklyn and the other assets other than Union Square Men's, so that stays the same.","And we continue to work with Brookfield. We talked last quarter about that of the 50-ish properties that Brookfield is looking at, we expect that roughly two-thirds of those will go into a development phase. And that work continues. And, obviously, as soon as we've got updates, we will update you all.","We continue to also work on the flagships; don't have anything to announce yet on Chicago. And, as you know, the strategy there has been to sell off some of the upper floors, not the whole store, obviously. But that's still underway. And we continue to work on various opportunities and possibilities for Herald Square.","And in terms of the other monetization of assets that we have, the team continues to work on lots of those. And, again, we expect to deliver the guidance for this year.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for the color. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, you've got a number of strategies in place to drive traffic to stores. Obviously, the new loyalty program is part of that and, I think, Backstage you would include in that, as well. Can you just touch on any other strategies?","And on the Backstage in particular, I think you mentioned you planned to expand aggressively in 2018. Is there any other color you can share on your plans and how you're thinking about that?","And lastly, I just want to make sure I understand what your commentary was on handbags and cosmetics. It sounded to me like they're still negative, less so, though, here in the third quarter than they were in the first half of the year, so on a better trend. And with regard to handbags, you would expect it to get back to flat comp at some point in the future. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. Thanks","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, let me talk with other initiatives. So one initiative that we have is really what we're doing in technology to fuel all of our initiatives online, so ongoing site monetization, what we're doing with our mobile and kind of the tablet app, Kimberly, its responsiveness, to improve conversion. Expect that to be a part of what is fueling our confidence about digital and the double-digit growth that we expect to go into the fourth quarter.","The other piece of that is the fulfillment options. So we expect buy online, pick up in store to be a more potent piece of our business in the fourth quarter. And when customers are coming in, you're obviously getting a bunch of those customers that are buying other things. That radiates sales. That's captured in our guidance.","Then there's the merchandise initiatives that I didn't speak to overtly, but: the fine jewelry; the women's shoes; what we're doing in some of the apparel areas that we've been talking about, like active and dresses; big ticket. All of those, we're anticipating will continue to give us growth into the fourth quarter. So those are all the headlines on the initiatives.","With respect to Backstage, what I'd tell you is that it continues to grow as we get smarter about it. And what we're finding is that we're looking at all of the areas where we're having success and building on those. And areas where we're not happy with our lift, we're making changes, and we're seeing nice positive results from that. So, we're looking at each of those. And what you'll see from us is that we're going to start to experiment in larger doors in the future. And we're looking at different parts of the store that you would put it into and what the results are.","We're looking at capital on that and efficient ways of spending it. We're looking at what marketing might look like in the future. We're looking at what we're learning from Bloomingdale's and Outlet, because there's some really good learnings there that are being imported into Backstage. We're getting smarter about logistics and our technology needs. So we're \u2013 been good students on this. We're obviously testing. We're iterating. We're scaling this. So expect more from us on Backstage. It's been a good initiative for us.","And then with respect to your last question on cosmetics and on handbags, handbags is still negative. And that is, this time last year, we were up against heavy discounting and planned discounting. And in the beginning of 2017, we went away from that. And what we're finding is that they're still negative comps, but we're exceeding our plans there. And so when we fully lap that at the end of 2017, goes to my comment where we do see a path to get back to positive comps there.","And beauty is significantly better than it was in the first half. I didn't quote it, but we were about 2.5 points better in the third quarter than we were in the first half of the year. And we've been running positive comps in fragrance. That continues to get stronger. And in the beauty categories, I see definitely green shoots that give us confidence for the future.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you for all the detail.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Morning.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I just have two questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the performance of your private brand portfolio versus the national brands, especially in the apparel side. And the second question, Karen, that I have is when you look at the inventories, I think you said comp inventory's down 4.2% and you have lots of open-to-buy, it all happens in a hurry over the next 60 days. So when you think about trying to improve the sales, the opportunity with the open-to-buy, just how aggressive would you expect to be? And are you seeing lots of opportunity around the open-to-buy because inventory levels seem pretty lean throughout the channel.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Bob, let me take your questions. So private brand versus market brands, it really is a study by whatever FOB you're looking at. So we're competitive. In some cases, we're above; in some cases, we're with and in all of those categories, the performance of our private brands in each of the areas where we have it versus our market brands. So we put a big premium on our private brand organization over the past couple of years. We really winnowed down our private brand fleet to get to those brands that really capture the DNA of very specific customers through all of our customer analysis. And we're working on the supply chain of each of those. Some we've got them where we want, and some we've got aspirations to get much faster. So, so far, so good. So, I'm pleased with our private brand performance, as well as how that stacks up versus market brand performance.","With respect to open-to-buy, there's lots of available inventory in the ecosystem. And so when we see something that's really working, we can generally find the same or a comparable product that we can react to. So having liquidity in your open-to-buy and buyers being very aggressive with the new streamlined organization, I'm fine being that it's available, and we can get it.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And just one more question, on the online business, I guess the buy online, pick up in store, you guys had previously talked about I think it was 25% radiated sales. Is that still a good number? Are you seeing any sort of changes around when you get the people in the store in terms of how that purchase takes place generally?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","That's still a good number. What you find is that not every customer converts on the radiated sales. And the customers that do, have a bigger up-spend. But the average is for all buy online, pick up in store sales, we get a 25% lift in overall sales.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will move to our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jeff, I was hoping you could give a little bit more detail on what you saw in men's and women's apparel?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, Lindsay, as Karen mentioned, the cold weather businesses were depressed in the third quarter. Outside of that, there was some good signs of life and, as Karen mentioned, the active across men's, women's, and kids', quite strong. We've been seeing double-digit increases there. That continued in the third quarter. The dress side of the business, dresses in women's as well as some of the structured pieces, like coats \u2013 not coats, but structured jackets, like the suit area, as well as the men's clothing area and the dress shirt area on the men's side, both very strong in the third quarter.","So when you take out the cold weather businesses and the balance of sportswear, what we learned was things like our capsules that we do exclusively with some of our private brands and some of our market brands did quite well in the third quarter, so good signs of life in the apparel areas.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Any shift in terms of your third-party brands that you use and who's had momentum and any sort of shift in where the momentum is coming from or is it relatively consistent with what you saw in the second quarter?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Nothing I'm going to comment on specifically, Lindsay, about specific brands that are doing well or not, but we're obviously all over that. And wherever we see those shifts, we're reacting with the right open-to-buy dollars. We're deep in, in our relationships with all of our best brands. And we're talking daily about opportunities that we see for the Macy's customer.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then, just a couple modeling questions related to the new loyalty program. You called out that in the fourth quarter, the implied gross margin is down 40 to 80 basis points, due, at least in part, to the greater free shipping from the loyalty program. Is that the way we should think about the impact to gross margins for, I guess, Q1 through Q3 of next year, that there will be a drag from greater free shipping? And would it be an intensified drag as the program gets rolled out more? And then on the credit penetration, to the degree that you saw the decline in penetration improve to down 70 basis points in October versus 110 for the quarter, do you expect that rate of decline to improve as well as we get into 4Q and the loyalty program rollout intensifies?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","So the expectation is the credit penetration trend should improve materially as we get into the fourth quarter. So that's going to be the first place that we see the benefit from the loyalty program.","In terms of the impact on gross margin, the fourth quarter implied reduction is actually 30 to 80 basis points, but having said that, I don't know what to tell you yet for 2018. We really need to see how this plays out, so I think we should hold on that discussion until after we get through the fourth quarter.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning. Karen, I wanted to ask about cash flow for the fourth quarter, if there are any one-time items that we should be watching for, for this year. And directionally, can you provide us any guidance for cash flow from operations compared to a year ago?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I'm sitting here thinking. I can't think of any one-time item that we expect. And no, we don't provide guidance on cash flow. Sorry.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. No, that's fine. I understand. The other question is you've talked about reducing your leverage to your leverage target range and using your excess cash for debt reduction. Given fourth quarter is your big free cash flow quarter of the year, should we expect some type of a liability management exercise before you report earnings or can you give us any color there?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No, we can't comment on any anticipated capital structure move.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question. Jeff, I know you talked about the streamlining of the merchandising organization and collapsing into one and looking to effectively use data and kind of engage with consumers. I'm wondering, with the rise of social media, online fashion bloggers with big followings, how do you get that organization to really reconnect with the consumers and reestablish their position as industry leaders when it comes to fashion and setting those trends? Do you put them online? Have you thought about using personalities? Help us think about how you reengage the core Macy's merchant with the end consumer?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's a good question, Omar. And I would tell you that we're really looking at what that on-boarding looks like with user-generated content being in the social space, so expect us to comment on that and what our strategy will be in the future. So it's on our radar screen.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And we will move to our next question from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. Regarding digital and what we should look for going forward, what are your thoughts on how you're positioned on conversion versus traffic and what you want to do in consumer engagement? And how would you characterize your competitive advantages as a bricks-plus-clicks versus pure plays such as Amazon? Just as long-term investors would love to hear your near-term and long-term feedback.","And our second question was just generally about speed and inventories. You made really good progress with slimmer inventories. What do you think is the future of inventory management in terms of things you're focused on to continue to drive both factors? Thank you.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Hi, Oliver. So I think when you look at technology, Macy's has got a very robust technology agenda. And that includes working with great partners that we have today and that we're open to new ones. So some of the things that we're focused on with respect to technology, is really making sure that our ongoing site optimization is just really strong, and we learn every day. We do a good job here, but we have lots of opportunities to improve on this.","We're looking at mobile and tablet app responsiveness and making sure that we get the conversion rates there where we want them. We're looking at vendor direct and fulfillment opportunities that we see and the opportunity to do more with extended aisle and more direct ship from vendors. So we see a big opportunity there. Expect us to lead there. We see lots of opportunities with machine learning. And that could be regarding fit or attribution, image recognition, certainly where it all will lead in terms of personalization.","And then lastly, to the previous question about on-boarding of new customers and the idea about the Gen Z customer and using user-generated content, being in the social space, using our teams in a more relevant way to market in a more authentic way is all part of what's on our kind of technology playbook.","And this is where we think Hal is going to have a big impact. This is clearly in his wheelhouse. And in the first eight weeks, we're already thinking about exactly what that means in terms of what we layer in as foundational for where we've got progress already in place and what we layer on in 2018, so expect us to focus on all of that.","With respect to your question on inventory and turnover and speed, continue to expect us to make improvements there. So we were not in a good inventory position in the first two quarters. We're in a better position now. But if we're going to move at the speed of our customer, that's going to involve having inventory turns that continue to speed up and buying closer in and using everything we understand from customers to inform decisions that we have for products that are available or products that we create. So expect us to get faster.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you. Best regards.","Operator","We'll move next to our question from Bernard Sosnick with Madison Global Partners.","Bernard Sosnick - Madison Global Partners, LLC","Good morning. With regard to real estate, thank you for the update, but I'm wondering if you could flesh out to some greater detail the progress on the development of properties by Brookdale (sic) [Brookfield], which you said earlier could be significant in several instances. Could you help out on that?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No. Unfortunately, Bernie, I really can't until there's something completed that we can talk about.","Bernard Sosnick - Madison Global Partners, LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Brian Callen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Karen, the 4Q still has a significant amount of asset sale gains to be realized to get to the all-in reaffirmed asset sales guidance you just mentioned. Can you help us translate what pieces or percentage results in actual cash received versus booked gains in sort of cash from ops or in the P&E dispositions?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Actually, I don't have that in front of me. But with the exception of Union Square, obviously, most of them will have more cash, obviously, than the book gain, putting Brooklyn aside.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Aside from Brooklyn. Okay. And then, I guess thinking long-term about the state of the balance sheet, can you make any comments about intentions in 2018 about continuing to focus on debt reduction and deleveraging; maybe even looking inside your \u2013 the high end of your 2.8 times leverage target, given the evolving retail environment?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I mean all I can say is that we remain committed to getting back to our targeted level of the 2.5 [times] to the 2.8 and we'll continue to work towards that objective.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone. Can you talk a little bit about any further color on Last Act and how you see what's been happening there, how it's impacting store sales and traffic, and also any update on tourism and what you saw different this quarter than last quarter? Thank you.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Dana, I'll take Last Act and Karen will take tourism. Last Act is running as it has for the past 18 months. It is a faster way for us to liquidate, more profitably, our clearance. And customers love the ease of it. They love that they get what the price is. The price on the ticket is what they pay. We have that rolled out to every single FOB in the company. And as we mentioned when we talked about our inventory position, when you look at our overall markdown units, we're moving through them as expected. We don't have the hangover that we had this time last year. And Last Act is working as expected, so all good there.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","And on the international tourist business being down 11.7% as compared to 9% declines last quarter, I think most of that delta relates to the hurricanes and where those hit, given where tourists tend to go, obviously, particularly in Florida. And I suspect a piece of that is also double-counted in terms of warm weather. So I would say it continues to be a big drag, but I'm not sure that it really got worse in the third quarter, if we took out all those other factors.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen M.

Today's hour-long conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike McGuire, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike McGuire","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2019 results. With me on the call today are Jeff Gennette, our Chairman and CEO; and Paula Price, our CFO. Jeff and Paula have several prepared remarks to share, after which we'll host a question-and-answer session. Given the time constraints and the number of people who want to participate, we ask that you please limit your questions to one with a quick follow-up.","In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on the Investors section of our website, macysinc.com.

As a reminder, today's call is being webcast on our website. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call, and it will be archived on our website for 1 year.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you saw in our press release, our fourth quarter comparable sales were down 0.5% on an owned plus licensed basis. And we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.12. For the year, comparable sales were down 0.7% on an owned plus licensed basis, and we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.91.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we saw a strong trend improvement in sales from the third quarter, and we were able to deliver nearly flat comparable sales within our expected margin range, and we closed the quarter in a clean inventory position.","We had a solid holiday season, led by our Destination Businesses, growth doors and Backstage. Our digital performance also accelerated in the quarter. Importantly, our customers responded well to our gifting assortment and marketing strategies, especially in the 10 days before Christmas, when we saw a significant uptick in sales.","Our teams executed well this holiday season, in our stores, distribution centers and customer contact centers. I'm proud of each colleague's commitment to strong execution during this important time of year.","As I said at Investor Day, taken as a whole, 2019 did not play out as we intended. However, there are areas of the business that are working, and we will continue to focus our resources there.","The five 2019 strategic initiatives all performed well in the fourth quarter. Let me give you some context on how each initiative contributed to our 2019 results.","Growth150. In 2019, we expanded the growth treatment to an additional 100 stores. Comparable store sales at the original 50 growth stores outperformed the Macy's fleet by approximately 3.5% in 2019 and Growth150 by approximately 3% in the fourth quarter once the additional 100 stores were completed.","Backstage. In 2019, we expanded Backstage, Macy's off-price offering, to another 50 locations within Macy's stores. Backstage locations open for more than 12 months continued to achieve mid single-digit comparable sales growth and have improved both gross margin and inventory turn.","Vendor Direct. In 2019, we grew the Vendor Direct program and added more than 1 million SKUs and 1,000 new vendors. This drove a nearly 60% increase in Vendor Direct sales, which now comprise approximately 13% of digital sales for the Macy's brand.","Mobile. In 2019, we improved the omnichannel experience for customers through the enhancement of app features such as My Wallet, My Store and My Stylist. We exceeded our expectations and saw more than 55% increase in sales. The Macy's mobile app now contributes approximately 20% of the Macy's brand digital sales.","And lastly, Destination Businesses. We invested in six areas of the business that account for nearly 40% of total Macy's sales. Dresses, fine jewelry, big ticket, men's tailored, women's shoes and beauty, these investments were aimed at driving growth through great products, top-performing colleagues, improved environment and enhanced marketing. All six areas continued to outperform the balance of the business on market share, return on investment and profitability. And we capture approximately 9% of the market in these categories.","In the fourth quarter, Destination Businesses grew 4.3% and for the full year grew 2.9%. Each of these strategic initiatives play an important role in our go-forward growth plans and have been incorporated into the Polaris strategy.","I'm now going to turn it over to Paula for a more detailed review of the fourth quarter and annual performance, as well as our outlook for 2020.","Paula Price","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As we previewed at our Investor Day on February 5th, we delivered net sales in the fourth quarter of $8.3 billion, which brought our full year sales to $24.6 billion. And as Jeff said, owned plus licensed comps were down 0.5% in the quarter and down 0.7% for the year, which surpassed our latest guidance.","As we look at our category performance across the broader business, we delivered a strong performance during the quarter across our Destination Businesses. And in fine jewelry, dresses and fragrances, we saw a particular outperformance versus both our expectations in last year.","Men's tailored, mattresses and women's shoes also turned in good results. Our holiday gifting strategy was strong with our Gift Under strategy resonating well with our customers. In particular, our beauty gifting strategy performed very well.","For the quarter, the weaker businesses included watches and housewares and in the future these will claimed down consistent with merchandize category work we shared on Investor Day.","Bloomingdales and Bluemercury each performed within expectations in the fourth quarter. With regard to our quarterly company sales metrics, overall transaction fell 0.5% versus last year. Items per transaction were down 1% and inline with trend. And we saw positive increase in average unit retail during the quarter which rose 1.1% on the strength of several of our high AUR Destination businesses. The increase in AUR occurred even while backstage which trades lower AUR to higher unit and transactions grew comps mid single digits.","Turning to credit revenue. We generated $239 million in the quarter, nearly flat to a year ago. Credit card penetration was 46.4% in the quarter, 60 basis points below last year. On the year, credit revenue was $771 million, up slightly to a year ago. Credit card penetration was 46.9% for the year flat to a year ago.","Despite our initial expectations for credit to be down year-over-year, we posted a slight improvement. This was primarily driven by strong core brand sales growth from transactions under cards outside of the Macy's family of brands. Offsetting these were the decline in our own top line sales and an uptick in delinquency and bad debt trends to more normal level.","Gross margin in the quarter was 36.8%, down 70 basis points versus last year. We ended the year with a gross margin rate of 38.2%, down 90 basis points from a year ago, of this decline about 50 basis points were due to delivery expense. And as we stated at our Investor Day, while we continue foresee pressure on margin rate from the growth of lower margin businesses in 2020 we will be working to offset this mixed impact with $100 million of Polaris cost savings that will help stabilize our margin rates.","As a reminder, these gross margin improvements derived from initiatives within supply chain, merchandising mix and pricing, marketing and private brand sourcing. Comparable inventory in 2019 was down 1.4% to last year, underscoring our commitment to a more productive use of inventory.","Within SG&A, we recorded $2.5 billion of expense in the quarter, $29 million less than a year ago, but up 10 basis points on a rate basis due to sales deleverage. The SG&A dollar reduction reflects lower variable expenses due to lower sales, as well as some benefits from various miscellaneous items which we do not expect to carry forward into 2020.","For the total year SG&A expense was $9 billion, $41 million below last year, but 40 basis points higher on a rate basis. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we are committing to resetting the cost base and the more stable SG&A rate as we move forward while still investing in our growth initiatives.","In the fourth quarter we realized gains on the sale of assets of $95 million versus $278 million last year. For the full year, we realized gains of $162 million, down from $389 million last year. Keep in mind that our fourth quarter and full year 2018 asset sale gains included the $178 million gain on the sale of the I. Magnin building at Union Square.","Accordingly adjusted net income in the quarter was $661 million versus $850 million last year, while on an annual basis adjusted net income was $906 million versus $1.3 billion last year. The decrease in asset sale gains represents about 70% and more than 40% of the decline in adjusted net income in the quarter and the year respectively. Nonetheless, we are not pleased with the net income decline.","As we communicated at Investor Day, while 2020 will be a year of transition for us, our Polaris strategy will help to establish a date from which we can grow profitably. While there is work ahead to improve our overall profitability, we are committed to stabilization and growth as targeted within our 3 year plan. For 2020, we expect to achieve growth savings of approximately $600 million from Polaris, some of which will flow to the bottom line in order to stabilize operating margin.","Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.12 in the quarter compared to $2.73 last year of which asset sale gains represented about $0.23 and $0.65 respectively and for the year adjusted diluted EPS was $2.91 versus last year to $4.18 of which asset sale gains represented approximately $0.38 and $0.92 respectively.","Year to date cash flow from operating activities was $1.6 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year. The variance was driven primarily by lower earnings and a decrease in non-merchandise accounts payables which were partially offset by lower tax payments and a net improvement in merchandise inventories and payables.","Capital expenditures were $1.16 billion compared to $932 million last year above our full year guidance of approximately $1 billion. This was due mainly to the timing of certain projects. However, we continue to expect to spend approximately $1 billion in 2020.","Cash used by financing activities was $1.1 billion this year versus $1.5 billion last year. We repaid $597 million of debt in 2019 compared to the repayment of $1.15 billion in 2018, which drove the decline. In both years the debt repayment was predominantly voluntary.","During 2019 we executed very consistently against our capital allocation strategy through continued investment in the business, continued debt reduction and the continued payment of a dividend. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, we remain committed to that strategy. We will continue to be disciplined with our financial policy in order to maximize value creation, while also maintaining a balance sheet that is both flexible and durable.","We are focused on executing our Polaris strategy which will stabilize our profitability in the near term and position the business for growth in the long-term. Our company has a strong consistent track record of prudent financial policy and effectively managing our balance sheet, including paying down approximately $3.5 billion of debt over the past four years. And as we said on Investor Day, we plan to continue to use excess free cash flow to further reduce our debt in 2020.","As we have said a fundamental cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy is a commitment to maintaining balance sheet strength and as such we continue to target an adjusted debt to EBITDA multiple of 2.5 to 2.8 times that we believe is commensurate with an investment grade credit profile.","We are confirming our guidance for 2020 presented on February 5th at our Investor Day. In addition, I do want to provide more color on a few items. You will note, that we expect credit revenue to decline year-over-year. This will result from the combination of our projected decline in top line sales and our expectation that the slight uptick in delinquency and bad debt continue in line with market trends, partially offsetting these are projections for continued growth in co-brand sales.","With respect to the possible impact of the coronavirus, we are cheerfully monitoring the situation to assess implications to our colleagues, tourism sales and supply chain. While still too early to estimate, we anticipate that there could be a small impact on first quarter sales from international tourism.","With respect to the supply chain, we are working with our vendor partners to minimize any possible disruption. As we've said before less than 50% of our private brand goods come out of China. Our vendor partners source a sizable amount from there too.","As with tourism, it's too early to size any possible impact, but we'll keep you aware of any changes that could materially impact our business. At this time, we have not factored in any potential negative impact from the coronavirus into our 2020 guidance.","With regard to the quarterly cadence of our 2020 results, we expect growth to be most challenged in the first quarter from a top and bottom line perspective, due primarily to the anticipated disruption from our corporate restructuring and campus consolidations.","Additionally Polaris savings within both gross margin and SG&A are not expected to immediately impact the first quarter, as those benefits will develop more slowly in the second quarter and grow from there.","Keep in mind that we are cycling off a relatively strong first quarter last year and that our full year 2020 sales guidance is negative, with our best sales comp coming in the back half of the year. For the first quarter, we expect our owned plus licensed comp sales to be outside the range of our full year guidance. Our complete guidance is in the slide presentation we posted on our website earlier this morning.","But in closing, we entered 2020 with confidence in our future. We are very clear-eyed about the challenges before us and we believe we have the firepower to take them head on, digital, the growth treatment to our Magnet locations, Loyalty 3.0 and Backstage all serve as growth conduits for our future. Our savings and profits stabilization progress are in process. We are focused on execution and in what will be a long and bright future for Macy.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you, Paula. So let me share some additional perspective on the business. As I mentioned on Investor Day, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury are important to Macy's Inc. And today I'm going to provide some detail on Bloomingdale's and I will share thoughts on Bluemercury on our future call.","So Bloomingdale's also plays an important role in the Macy's Inc. portfolio, as it gives us a meaningful play in the growing luxury market. As a standalone business, Bloomingdale's generates revenue of more than $3 billion and contributes to Macy's Inc. profitability. Bloomingdale's has 34 full line stores, with a 35th store opening in Silicon, Valley next month, as well as two international stores we operate under licensed agreements in Dubai and Kuwait.","That the Bloomingdale's customer is affluent and highly loyal to the brand and importantly that 19 freestanding Bloomingdale's outlet stores have shown sales growth for the past three years and have provided valuable learnings on free standing off price.","Bloomingdale's also benefits the Macy's brand as Bloomingdale's tends to be further ahead on the fashion curve and gives us an early line of sight on trends. Bloomingdale's also gives Macy's Inc. a multi-channel platform to test and learn before scaling programs enterprise-wide.","For instance, we piloted My List, a rental service at Bloomingdale's in 2019. We currently have 80 vendors in over 1500 styles live on My List and we are launching another 20 vendors in the first quarter of 2020.","At our Investor Day on February 5th, we showed our Polaris strategy and three year plan. Let me take you through this at a very high level. We are focusing our resources on the healthy parts of our business and investing in the opportunity to grow where retail is growing today and in the future.","This includes growing customer segments, new profitable categories and off-mall formats. We are accelerating what is working in the business, Loyalty, Backstage, Destination businesses, our Growth store treatment and Mobile. Importantly, we are addressing what is not working in the business and taking actions to stabilize profitability in the face of continued headwinds.","Over the next three years our financial targets include right-sizing costs and expanding gross margin, with accelerated savings totalling $1.5 billion by the end of 2022, $600 million of which is gross margin improvement and $900 million of which is SG7A savings.","I'm confident that the Polaris strategy will change the trajectory of Macy's Inc. Performance and the team is fully focused on executing our plans. I want to quickly remind you of the five points of the Polaris strategy before we open the line to take your questions.","Number one, strengthen customer relationships. We will build customer lifetime value, expand our Loyalty program and accelerate personalization and monetization. Earlier this month, we expanded our Star Rewards Loyalty program that we introduced in 2017. Loyalty 3.0 now allows every Star Rewards number to earn on every purchase, regardless of how they pay.","Customers will be auto enrolled based on their annual spend and all customers now have the opportunity to enjoy special benefits, including Star Money Bonus Days and the Perks and Offers such as extra savings and access to exclusive events. Loyalty 3.0 is off to a great start and we've exceeded our bronze enrollment goals so far.","Two, curate quality fashion. Our customers come to Macy's for fashion, value and high quality products. So we will curate an assortment of the latest trends and exclusive products at the best values from the best brands. We will drive disciplined merchandise category roles to be the best destination for the best brands, while balancing sales and margin.","A key component of this is our commitment to build for [ph] $1 billion private brands. Three, accelerate digital growth. We know that our omni channel customer is our most engaged and valuable customer. Our digital business generates $6 billion in revenue across all three brands and contributes to our profitability. And we see digital as a key engine of growth moving forward.","We will improve the digital experience by enhancing features across both dot.com and the app. We will grow our customer franchise with a strong focus on personalization and continued innovation to deliver the best digital fashion experience to our customers. And we will continue to strengthen the profitability of our dot.com business by growing store pickup and ad monetization.","Four, optimize our store portfolio. We will continue to grow treatment for our stores in the best malls, including another 100 stores in 2020. We will focus on improving productivity in our neighborhood stores. We will find ways to profitably expand off mall, including free-standing Backstage stores and we will test to improve the market ecosystem which we are piloting in three markets in 2020. This ecosystem approach will test within a given market the right mix of format and location of our stores to drive maximum sales growth across both our stores and digital business.","And five, reset our cost base. We're rightsizing our organization, streamlining our store fleet and addressing the inefficiencies in our fixed cost base and we're focused on improving the productivity of our working capital. We took a big step towards this earlier this month with the restructuring that we announced and we will pursue the remainder of our cost reduction goals with discipline.","2020 will be a year of transition as we make significant structural changes to the business. We have spent the past three weeks aligning our colleagues around the new structure and strategy and the teams are beginning to settle in. We all have an eye towards execution. I'm confident that our colleagues have a clear understanding of the Polaris strategy and share my commitment to delivering our plans in 2020 and beyond.","And with that, we will open up the line to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the information. Jeff, you mentioned the private brand strategy came up at the Investor Day as well, you know big target there, it's obviously been part of the Macy's ecosystem for a long time. If you can help us understand what's different, what are the company's capabilities now something in the landscape that has changed that I think would allow you to really build those into big sustainable consistent brands versus prior history? Thanks.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, Omar. So the first thing I'd say is there were much farther along in global sourcing than we were even a year ago and we have huge opportunity basically to transition from a brand based global sourcing to category based. So our sourcing structure is really going into \u2013 into that.","Our vendor decisions now are used to be kind of relationship based. They're now going to more data driven and strategic base. Our sourcing organization is more centralized, whereas it used to be done more within each brand. Big, big change, on what we\u2019re doing with materials and speed the market.","So we used to have kind of more informal and ad hoc decisions on materials. As an example we used to have 12,000 different fabrics with a lower than acceptable adoption rate. We're now much more focused on getting fabrics that cut across different genders, across different brands.","Our costing basis we're going much more aggressive and we shared some of this in the Investor meeting about what we're doing with garment and the SKU level costing and really getting more into that, we're seeing big changes in the overall costing by garment in our tests. We're now expanding that out into more of our brands. And our planning is much more involved in how we're doing this across the business.","So we talked about the $4 billion brands we looked at, we have 38 different categories. There's some businesses that some of these brands aren't in. So as an example of that would be like the INC brand which is our biggest and I think our most potent private brand.","So as an example of that was where you know three years ago we weren't in the shoe business with INC. You know, that's now $100 million plus business. It's now our number two vendor in all of women's shoes. We talked in Investor Day about what we would do with fashion jewelry, with all of the $4 billion brands and we've gone from zero to 60 in that very quickly.","So we're looking at all of our opportunities, what customers we serve, what lifestyles we need to be in and we were clear at Investor meeting about where we saw underserved customers, particularly the customers that are under 40 and the new brands that we'll be announcing later that will serve them.","So I think our capabilities have come up measurably in how we're addressing the private brand opportunity in the future and we'll get us to our goal of 25% of total business by the year 2025.","Omar Saad","Got you. That's really helpful. And then one quick follow up on the coronavirus. Are you seeing any impact on the international tourism at all from what's been happening abroad and around that or is it too early to tell?","Jeff Gennette","It's too early to tell. What I'd say is that, let me just kind of give a broader - we expected this question with respect to the coronavirus. It's certainly an evolving topic, one that we're watching really closely.","So to kind of put into the three buckets, starting first with colleagues, we have a Hong Kong office that has reopened after the extended Lunar New Year. We will put all the processes in place, really the protocol that we developed under the SARS epidemic to - with the coronavirus to protect our workers, make sure we've got flexible schedules. ","So we are in good stead for now with our colleagues.","With respect Omar to your question about customers, you know, so Macy's, the Bloomingdale's, we have about 70 stores that have a strong Asian customer base, so that\u2019s either local, like a store like Flushing or tourist based which would be a store like Union Square. And we've seen some slowdown of sales in these stores this month, nothing to be concerned about yet. But we believe that this - you know, that this is unfolding, so we will see how that goes.","And then the third bucket is really the product piece, which is what's going on with our supply chain. We expect a slowdown. We have seen a slowdown, a product that's flowing out of China, nothing concerning yet. And we're watching this one very, very carefully.","You know, this is an example of where the tariff situation actually over the last 18 months really gave us a very clear line of sight into our product flow from China for both our national and our private brands. So for our private brands, we're working really closely with our suppliers there. Our team that is in Hong Kong is working with all of our suppliers. We've got - those teams that have come back after Lunar Year. We know exactly what the production of factories are, goods that have been finished goods that are in process, fabric that's been allocated to current and future deliveries.","So we're looking at all of that. We're managing that receipt flow. And for international brands, we\u2019re working with our partners very closely on the impact and product availability. So that's all factored right now, but we're watching this. It's an evolving situation. And as Paula mentioned in her remarks, any effectiveness in our sales and earnings has not been factored in our 2020 guidance.","Paula Price","And just to give you some numbers on the international tourism, what we saw in the fourth quarter was about a 10 basis points impact on our comp, international tourism so far was down 7.5% and we attribute that to the strength of the dollar.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you very much. Good morning. Our question is about digital margins versus in-store and how you're thinking about the opportunity there and what will happen with shipping over time?","A follow up we had is related to the need for speed and speed across the organization. If you could help us understand some of the major needle movers with speed, as well as how you're embracing the younger customer that would be helpful for thinking about long term growth? Thank you.","Paula Price","So I'll start Oliver. So with respect to digital margins you know, the digital business contributes to our profitability. But with respect to the shipping headwind we do expect that to continue in around the 50 basis points type of range. And so one way that we're mitigating that is sort of encouraging more buy online, pickup in-store transactions, which is our most profitable online transactions where our customers order online, pickup in store and then buy about 25% more.","And then the other way I would think about that long term is that we're using our Polaris savings those that impact our gross margin to stabilize gross margin and remember that those include initiatives like centralized fulfilment, location level pricing and markdown optimization. So I would expect us to stabilize margins long term.","Jeff Gennette","And Oliver, let me take your second question about just kind of speed. And one of the things that even though we said goodbye to a lot of colleagues and with the Campus consolidation that we just went through, we do believe that once we are fully stable with the new teams altogether that we're going to move at a significantly faster pace.","So when I look at the culture and I look at all digital now being consolidated to New York and all technology being consolidated to Atlanta, I think the metabolism of the company is going to pick up dramatically on that.","We're getting all of our new colleagues set up. We're ahead of our hiring plans. We actually had a higher percentage of colleagues from San Francisco that have elected to move into their New York or Atlanta. And we're very happy with the caliber of talent that we have available in both New York and Atlanta. So that piece is moving at\/or ahead of schedule, so I'm pretty pleased with that.","When you look at - what we\u2019re doing to kind of attract the under 40 customer you know, just remember that we have many businesses in which we already get a very good share of the under 40 customer. So look at fine jewelry, I look at handbags, I look at men's clothing. Those businesses are all getting good share there and we're growing that customer base.","So our growth opportunity as we said on previous calls is really in the women's ready to wear area. And so that's what we're really focused on. What we've talked about in terms of what we're doing with our private brands, what we're doing with our market brands. We have a clear line of sight on that.","As we talked about previously, we've got a new environment that we tested in six stores in the third and fourth quarters. We're now rolling that out to another I believe it's 60 doors in 2020, that brings all these products together for a consumer that really doesn't want to wade through 60,000 square feet, wants to go to one area where her needs are being addressed. We're also doing that online.","So I believe that we've got a path ahead on that. But just to remember - just to remind everybody that we had parts of our business that are quite strong with this under 40 customer. The ones I mentioned, plus the entire men's area. So women's ready to wear is the one that we're really very focused on in 2020.","Oliver Chen","Very helpful. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Paula. Best regards.","Paula Price","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you so much. Inventory coming out of Q4, I think you said Paula is down 1.4%. Given the sales guidance here for Q1, you know, the inventory in absolute looks pretty clean, but still running a little bit above your sales plan. So I'm wondering if you expect inventory to get even cleaner as we work our way through the year and do you think there is a more medium to long term opportunity to manage inventory at a lower level?","Paula Price","Hi, Kimberly. So I'll just start by saying that you know, the fashion retailer we want to make sure that we're always giving our customers fresh fashion. And so we need to maintain appropriate receipt liquidity. And so we've been very focused on our stock to sales parity.","And so we've guided next year to be down significantly. And as you heard on Investor Day, we're targeting to reduce inventory by $200 million at cost over the next three years and we'll do that through Polaris. And for this year, as well - at least, as well as 2020, we expect our comp inventory to be this year where its down 1.4, so consistent with our sales performance and next year we're expecting it to be down even more than our annual comp sales guidance.","And so we're looking at a number of initiatives, as you've heard, including hold and flow location level pricing both of which will impact inventories and just bringing more rigour to how we approach our buys. So we're very much focused on stock to sales parity as it relates to inventory.","Kimberly Greenberger","Okay, great. So it sounds like we'll see even more progress in 2021. That's terrific. And then I just wanted to follow up on the delivery expense number, I think it was a 50 basis point headwind in Q4. Paula, it sounded like you said you expect that expense to continue. Can you just remind us what the full year 2019 headwind was?","And I know you've got some Polaris cost savings that should offset delivery expense pressure here in 2020. I would imagine this expense pressure continues into 2021 and beyond. And so I'm wondering if you've got a pipeline of savings in 2021 and 2022 to offset this ongoing headwind?","Paula Price","Yes. Sure, Kimberly. So in 2019 in the spring, we saw about 70 basis points of pressure related to delivery in the fall it was about 50 basis points, so annual would be about 50 basis points of gross margin pressure. And so again, we expect to mitigate the delivery expense headwinds through our Polaris savings. We have $600 million of savings targeted over the next three years with very specific initiatives attached to it, including as we've discussed at Investor Day. Centralized fulfilment, pricing private label sourcing, location level pricing, all the things we've been talking about.","And we have a very robust governance model with very specific initiatives tied to each of these programs. And so we would expect to be able to stabilize this particular headwind, as well as others in our gross margin.","Kimberly Greenberger","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Great. Thanks for all the color. Jeff, maybe to break down comps, so your destination businesses are up to 4% at 5%, at 40% of sales in the fourth quarter. So what's driving the continued negative comps? And as we think about the cadence for 2020 what are you seeing quarter to date that's driving that first quarter outlook for comps down worse than the 2.5%. And just your level of confidence in stabilizing the trend as the year progresses?","Jeff Gennette","Yeah. So Matt, I would say that when you look at the - there's 40% of the business that in 2019 was up 2.9% which was the Destination businesses. So when you look at the balance of the business depending on what category you\u2019re in, they obviously - many of them were negative.","So we talked about a couple, we talked about housewares, as we talked about fashion watches, were two categories as an example. Overall ready to wear outside of dresses was challenged to last year, pieces and parts of the balance of home store outside of housewares were negative. So the composite of that as you saw was down a 0.5% on the comp basis for the fourth quarter and down 0.7% for the full year.","So as we look at going into 2020 you know, we just - there is a level of disruption that we've gone in with the you know about 11% of the executive population that we - that we basically are not going forward with in 2020. So that's the level of disruption that we're anticipating, you know, in the first quarter.","I would tell you though that in the month of February is progressing as we expected. So it is not worse than we expected. It's right where we expected it would be. And when you look at going forward into the second through the back half of the year, we do expect that our business will improve.","So when we guided the down 1.5 to 2.5 we did expect that the first quarter would be the one that was most affected by it, getting better as we got into the second quarter and then the second half will be better than the first half. So that will be both in savings, as well as where we expect \u2013 where we expect sales.","The other comment I'd make about one of the big initiatives in sales, that it get - starts to get traction in the first quarter and starts to pay deeper dividends in the second through the back half, it's the Loyalty program. And so what we launched on that, which was earlier this month that starts - that's something that builds. So it's point system. So as a customer builds points for all tender types and it's tiered depending on whether or not they're proprietary number and their spend level, as those points start to build customers then start to redeem and then they buy other things that they do.","So that's a period of building that, which is really going to be through the first, going into the second quarter, you start to see benefits of that in the second quarter going into the back half of the year.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow up on gross margin Paula, what's the best way to break down the flat gross margin forecast for 2020, meaning what's the best way to think about the underlying merchandise margins outside of the 50 basis point digital headwind. And just any color on the magnitude of 1Qs gross margin decline relative to the year at flat? I think would be helpful.","Paula Price","The best way to think about it, is again as you've mentioned regarding gross margin to be flat on the year. And so the biggest headwind there would be the digital delivery expenses, the 50 basis points. And so all of the improvements that we've talked about with respect to Polaris, again, whether they're coming from the supply chain or the merchandising strategies, all of that will go right into merchandise margin. And so we expect merchandise margin to improve and to be able to fully mitigate the headwinds. So I would think about it in those terms.","And in terms of quarterly cadence, I would just think about the first quarter being the most impacted by sales disruption, both from a top line perspective and from a bottom line perspective and then to see improvement in the quarters sequentially thereafter, because we expect our $600 million of productivity from both gross margin and SG&A to start to materialize, I would say, in the beginning of the second quarter and then to build from there.","Matthew Boss","Great. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Please go ahead.","Chuck Grom","So you guys outlined a lot of initiatives and Jeff you went through them today. I was wondering if you could maybe force rank for us you know, where you think the biggest opportunities are, mainly as you move into 2021, as you expect comps to turn back into the positive territory?","Jeff Gennette","So Chuck, just to repeat what I've said at Investor Day, I would put them - I put the top four in the following rank, the first one would be Digital sales in terms of contributing to comp, the second would be the new Royalty program, Loyalty 3.0. The third would be Backstage and what we're doing with that, those comps that we're getting on all locations that have been opened more than a year still comping you know, mid single digits and this is like three years running on that and the last would be two the previous to Matt's question about Destination businesses. So those are the four that are going to contribute to growth.","And when you look at it Digital obviously for us is a big strength. $6 billion business and is one that we fight above our weight in the Digital business across all three of our brands. So we have about 6 million customers coming into our Digital platforms every day. So lots of opportunity to take advantage of that traffic, where we had very strong natural traffic. We obviously pay for some traffic, but that's a big strength of ours.","And we were candid about some of the mishaps that we had in the third quarter with respect to Digital. We're very focused on and we made improvements on that and saw that in our trends in the fourth quarter. So we have a robust strategy in Digital for all of 2020.","When I look at Loyalty, we mentioned, feel very good about that. The headline there on Loyalty is how many tender neutral customers, which we call the Bronze tier, have joined us or we're way ahead of our expectations since we launched the program about two weeks ago. And these are customers we now are able to track. And so we wanted to expand our known customer base significantly and the Bronze program with what we just did in Royalty 3.0 was getting it back to us.","Backstage as we mentioned, we're going to add 15 more stores in - in-store within stores in 2020, as well as we're going to be expanding to off-mall in seven freestanding stores in those three markets that we mentioned at Investor Day.","And then last but not least, when I look at Destination businesses, this is going to be - you know, again when you look at our 38 FOBs [ph] to have six of them comprising 6% of the [indiscernible] 40% of the company's total business, these are businesses that customers think about Macy's either first, second or third and we're growing these businesses, they fight above their weight in ROIC and in profit. So we see continued growth in all six of them. So we're very focused on those.","Chuck Grom","That's great. Thanks very much. Obviously Backstage an important component of all this. I was wondering if you guys could just remind us what the average basket looks like for someone that's always shops at a Backstage versus Macy\u2019s? And then I guess what a combined basket looks like across both in terms of dollar size and also looking at margins?","Jeff Gennette","Yeah. So what's interesting about it is, the difference between you know, freestanding in stores, in store for us. So we have had freestanding stores that we've been operating since the beginning of 2000, really the end of 2015, as well as what Paula mentioned in her comments about - or I mentioned in terms of the outlets at Bloomingdale's, we have 19 of those.","So they are - they perform differently. The margins there are actually at you know, the overall company's margins, a couple of stores actually slightly above. When you look at stores in-store, margins are fairly comparable. And when you look at the customer behavior of Backstage purchases, the customer gets more loyal and more profitable when they're buying both in Backstage, as well as the regular brand or the full price brand. We've seen that both in-store, as well as purchases they might do online.","So we've got lots of personalization strategies to see behavior in between the channels and when we do that we get a much stickier loyal customer that is more profitable for us. So that's why we've been really talking about this ecosystem and testing it out in free markets to see what the interplay between Backstage, mall based, full price, as well as digital what that does for our overall customer journey and the profitability or the customer lifetime value of our customers.","Our omni channel customers are our most profitable customers and the more we increase touch points, digital Backstage, full price, the better those customers are. So as we have talked about on many calls, we have seen limited cannibalization going on between full price and Backstage. We're just adding to the customer\u2019s basket when we are able to see that behavior.","Chuck Grom","Thanks lot.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Alex Walvis of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Walvis","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question on the AUR growth, positive here in the quarter. Can you dig into that a little bit more, I believe you mentioned growth in those higher ticket Destination categories, but I wonder if there's anything else going on there and if you can comment on AUR growth in like for like categories?","Paula Price","Sure. Hi, Alex. So you know, we look at the sales metrics together, AUR, UPT and transactions. But from an AUR perspective, if you look at the two year trend, we saw slightly favorable performance year-over-year, but in line with the third quarter. But when we look sequentially, higher AURs was the biggest driver of our trend improvement in our overall sales comp, when we look at the three metrics.","And Q4 versus year ago and sequentially we sold more products. As you mentioned in our AUR, in our Destination businesses, and in particular fine jewelry was up quite significantly about 11%, dresses about 8%. And that performance was balanced by fewer transactions in total, though our units per transaction showed a bit of a trend improvement.","The other mixed component to be mindful of is that our growing off-price business averages down AUR, as Jeff just talked about, but - those transactions and units per transaction to drive the comp sales improvement. And so the end result was that sequentially we improved our owned plus licensed sales comps in Q4 versus Q3.","Alex Walvis","Understood. And then just to follow up on that. And you mentioned that off-price boost units \u2013 transaction, I believe that's also the effect of the Digital business, but perhaps you could also comment on that. And then I suppose the question I'm getting out here is units per transaction has now been down over the last couple of quarters. What's driving that? And should we expect that to recover as digital and off-price remain strong drivers of the business?","Paula Price","So units per transaction is relatively consistent. The trend is relatively consistent. Part of that would be the effect of the digital business and I would say that we would expect that trend to stay consistent. And then we would expect to see offsets in either the transactions or the AUR. So that those three things interplay as we move forward into 2020.","We don't necessarily forecast those three metrics, but we would expect the three of them to work together to get to our guidance.","Alex Walvis","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question here. You know, you commented that February was going, Jeff exactly the way you planned it. But I think that the language was a lot more specific here today. You mentioned very clearly you expect a meaningful impact from disruption in the stores to be somewhat focused in first quarter and then you did mentioned corona, but you said that that wasn't affecting your numbers yet. I know you said was too early to put any size to corona. I'm wondering if you're - I think you might have answered on that earlier, that you might - you're not really seeing anything in the stores yet today, it was just a common sense comment that you expect that to show off to some of the tourist stores.","I'm just - I'm kind of curious about, it sounds a little - it sounds like you've taken a little bit more of a cautious approach to one key, but your commentary earlier said that it was about in line with what you\u2019re thinking three weeks ago. Did I hear those two things correctly?","Jeff Gennette","Yeah, Michael I think because of the disruption - because of the disruption that we had planned as - with all the changes in Polaris, we plan the first quarter was going to be the worst of our four quarters. So independent of the coronavirus that's what we expected.","And when you also look at the performance of the first quarter in 2019 it was our strongest performing quarter. So we're lapping that, plus look, we\u2019re just taking a prudent approach based on all the structural changes that we went through, as well as the benefits come later as a result of the Polaris changes and gross margin in SG&A, as well as the benefits of the Loyalty program that all come into second through the back half of the year.","So we took a prudent approach to how we planned the quarter versus the other three quarters of the year, that all went into our guidance that we delivered at the Investor Day and we reiterated today.","As it relates to coronavirus into my previous comments, we haven't seen a huge impact on that as of yet. Obviously, the biggest question is going to be about supply chain and what are the effects of supply chains with respect to either a shortage of labor, inability to basically react to the materials in the factories that we have or that we've negotiated and then the transit of that when those logjams [ph] start to break up and what the ports look like and the costs of all that.","So those are unknowns right now, it would be too early for us to comment on those, but those - that's what we're looking carefully in the future with respect to the coronavirus. But just to reiterate, we have not seen a big impact as of now.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then Paula, I just want to ask a follow up on the credit rating update from last week. It sounds like from your comments you disagree with the change. How much do you think that could impact refinance rates and does that change the interest expense outlook that you had in the 2020 EPS of 225 to 275, just looking at the longer term there?","And then I think for - I think also within your guidance for $1 billion [ph] of free cash flow by 2022, but that assumes that working capital improvement maybe $200 million. Is there any immediate impact that we should think about from receivables or payables at all that might in fact - that might impact that net working capital line and changes to the rates, the factors charge on receivables or anything like that that would, that we should think about as far as new news breaking into the 2022 guidance you gave us?","Paula Price","So I'll just kind of go in reverse of your questions Michael. I would say that you know for free cash flow we've given targets around that. So I would reference those, we expected $1 billion [ph] of free cash flow by 2022. And we've also given specific working capital targets, $200 million by 2022 as well.","And so with respect to the S&P decision you know, clearly we were disappointed in their decision to revise our credit rating. But that said, you know, it has no effect on the targets that we've given out and it has no effect in our commitment to executing Polaris, which we know will stabilize our performance and set this up for long term growth.","And you know, the credit ratings are not something that we can control, but what we can control is our focus on executing Polaris and also our approach to strong financial fiscal policy in managing our balance sheet.","And just to remind we've paid down $3.5 billion of debt over the past four years, most of which was voluntary and we'll continue to use excess free cash flow in 2020 to pay down debt as we discussed and we'll continue to target our leverage ratio of 2.5 to 2.8 times EBITDA which we believe is commensurate with that investment grade. So we're focusing on the things that we can control.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks a lot for all the help.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Bob Drbul","Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a couple of questions for me. First on the supply chain, have you seen any delays from vendors? You're missing delivery windows on product. Are you willing to sort of open the delivery windows given some uncertainty that exists out there with the supply chains widen a bit?","Paula Price","So Bob, obviously, very active conversation right now. And as a fashion retailer there is a shelf life of products. So we're working very closely with our vendors, as well as our private brands. And particularly when we look at kind of the early second quarter receipts and making sure that that is fashion appropriate for the timing of when our customers expect it.","So we're looking at every one of those, every order and making decisions about are we going to take all of it. Will we take part of it depending on what factors come up. So if there's a delay in manufacturing or delay in delivery we have options on all of those that we're working with our own suppliers, as well as our national brands. So there is a - we're also looking at contingencies that if we weren't able to get it here where can we get it elsewhere. And are there other options that we have for other businesses that could alter [ph] our businesses.","Bob Drbul","Got it. Okay. And then just a second question, on the Rental business and I think e-commerce side generally. You know, what categories are you seeing the most response - the best response on the My List piece and I guess just on the thread-up relationship. Is it bringing in sort of newer customers, younger customers, like any early learnings on and gave like 40 stores, if my memory serves me on that business, any comment would be helpful. Thank you.","Paula Price","Yeah, your memories right. 40 doors on thread-up and obviously that's been a big \u2013 as a big focus on ours on, particularly those under 40 new customer acquisition. So we've been testing in these 40 doors in different locations throughout the store. You know, we put it next to last act, we put it in women's apparel, we put it adjacent to juniors.","And as we expected the area that's adjacent to juniors is the ones that are doing the best. It's definitely resonating with this millennial Gen Z customer. We have been able to attract many new customers that are coming into our brand, that are as a result of threat-up. We have extended our pilot program for spring 2020 and we're working with James and his whole team of threat-up about what we've learned, built the brand priority list is, brands that are aspirational, recognizable for the under 40 customer.","We're looking focused on the best classes. We're looking at - like as an example, jackets happened to be a particularly strong classification within threat-up. So all the learnings that we've gotten we've made adjustments in the 40 doors about its placement based on what we've learned and we've got a very active partner in threat-up helping us acquire the right goods for these customers in these stores. So much to learn on that.","The other big test that we've got is really in subscription, which is My List, which we're doing through Castle at Bloomingdale's and we're learning a lot there. And what's interesting here is that same aspiration really which was how do you get under 40 customers into our brand.","And so we look at other subscriptions so far at Bloomingdale's, 50% of the subscribers are millennial and 30% are brand new to Bloomingdale's. So that gives us a lot of encouragement about how it's working.","So as Paula mentioned, the vendor matrix is growing. We are - we've got 80 vendors so far, 1500 stores that are alive, another 20 vendors that are coming into the first quarter. So I can \u2013 we do these surveys at the end of each of the - of our interactions with these new customers. And two big things come up about why they like it, and one is that they trust Bloomingdale's and one is that they really are enjoying the quality of the service. So those are things that we're amplifying and but we're going to continue to learn from both My List at Castle and throughout our e-commerce at Macy's.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Bernard Sosnick of Madison Global Partners. Please go ahead.","Bernard Sosnick","I have a question on the presentation of ready to wear in the six stores that have been reset and the 60 that is scheduled for this year. Is there more presentation by category rather than brand? Could you give us a little color on where you're heading?","Paula Price","Yeah. So that's exactly it. You know, there is - it's kind of a hybrid. What we have found is that customers definitely shop by category, but they also want the option of doing it by brand. So depending on what store it is, what we're doing is, we've got some brand around the perimeter and then in the center about 50% of the space. It's all done on by category and trend within.","So you've got multiple brands that are being merchandised in the center area. And then you've got you know, big brands like Guess or Nike. They would be on the perimeter. So that's what we've found is the best way we tried it, where you had everything done by buy category. That didn't work as well as when we did a hybrid brand and category as a mix.","And depending on the store, so if you go into like Cross County, which is you know, here in the metro area, what you find there is there are certain brands that really resonate with that customer, different from one of the other six stores that we - that we mentioned.","So like Guess is one of the biggest brands and ready to wear. So making sure that that was separate was very important to that customer. Now as important in some of the other stores that we've experimented with where Guess was part of the trend statement that was in the middle.","So we're looking at this very carefully and all of our merchants basically have to coordinate what they're doing with promotion and receipt flow in order to support this. But the customers are voting strongly, they like it this way, that's how they shop online. So how we have a physical environment that kind of matches their experience was important for us to get at.","Bernard Sosnick","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Jay Sole of UBS. Please go ahead.","Jay Sole","Great. Thanks so much. I just want to follow up on the potential for supply chain disruption. Jeff, you know, how you think about some decision point you know, at what point would you decide if you are not seeing production ramp back up in China which you decide to cancel orders there? Maybe at point would you start [ph] to try move to manufacturers in other countries. Can you just give us maybe some frameworks of how you're thinking about those things and the time line on that, it would be great? Thank you.","Paula Price","Yeah, Jay. I'm not going to add much to what we talked about, this is obviously a very open fluid conversation for us right now, so we're watching it. But there - you know, I want to put it into kind of a couple of constructs.","The first one is if the product is the product and the point of manufacturing in these factories and so that's the first one, so we're going to want to - we're going to want to take that, we're going to want to honor our agreements. Is the fabric and the factories that is that is needed and what we might do on those particular cases is we might move off of the current content and move towards future content that we need.","So \u2013 and that when I talked earlier about the whole notion about our improvement and sourcing we had fabrics that cut between the seasons. So that gives us a lot of flexibility where we need to go.","To the first part of your question about you know, when do we make decisions about when we're going to cut or what percent we would take or when we make the decision to move it on to you know, a number delivery, those are all very fluid conversations right now.","Just know that our whole new sourcing apparatus, as well as every merchant is focused on this with both private brands, as well as our market brands. And I believe we're going make all the right decisions as a fashion retailer for our future.","Jay Sole","Got it. Okay. Then maybe just switching gears for a second, you talked about Backstage, inventory turns are improving. Can you just give us a big picture sort of framework about how much inventory turns are improved, how much more opportunity there is for that metric and maybe what the drivers are to get you to where you want to be long term inventory turns in Backstage?","Paula Price","Yeah, Backstage obviously, the fresher the inventory the better off it performs. So you know, what we're looking at right now, we have a number of units in which the sell-through is double, what we're getting in the full price side of the business. And so this idea that you're getting fashion that's arriving daily where you get limited quantities that uses sell-through. And this is nothing that this group doesn't know about in covering the off price industry, but that's something that certainly plays out by developing off price business here at Bloomingdale's and Macy's. So that's very important for us.","What we're finding is that the turns are faster, the dollars per square feet are better when you're in free standing, they are very strong in Macy's stores in stores, because recognize that they're displacing content in an area of the store that was underperforming, now Backstage is over performing, but we do expect those metrics to go up considerably as we start to go into you know off-mall formats, as we've seen in Bloomingdale's and as we've seen in the freestanding units that have been up and running since 2015 at Macy's.","In order to deal with this need for faster and fresher deliveries is the reason that we went into Columbus with the distribution center. So again, we're building our competency. We're getting better at our price every day and our ambition now is to be off-mall, as well as on-mall.","So we'll continue to build out the Macy's mall network by adding more units there. I don't think that there is a store in the Macy's network that doesn't want Backstage, that is accretive to the overall sales of those stores, it's us finding the right spaces in every one of our most productive stores to do that. But now starting in these three markets to start expanding an off-mall we do expect it to behave much like the stores that are already freestanding.","So we also know that we believe that the Backstage that is in a store versus one that is off-mall that those opportunity amplify each other. And just remind everybody that every Backstage store will now have fulfillment capabilities of anything within the Macy's network. So we think that the opportunity to make any return from any Macy's purchase or buy online ship to a store that that capability is up and running.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. As you think about the growth formula being added to the additional 100 stores in 2020, what is the sales lift you're anticipating from this next tranche of stores and how it differs from last year?","And then Jeff, the neighborhood stores, you mentioned some new plans. How do you think about plans for the new neighbourhood stores? Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","Yeah. So Dana, I think we're certainly anticipating that the growth rate that we're getting - will get in the next 100 of our gross stores will be similar to what we got in the first 50 which we then expanded to the 150, which is basically about a 2 point improvement. We do have this I believe down to as much of the science as we can have where we basically are spending about $2.5 million to $2.7 million in each of these growth stores, about 50% of that spend goes to customer amenities and 50% goes to sales-getting initiatives. The entire building lifts by 2 points.","What's very interesting about it is that all of the digital business done in the zip codes that that store serves also go up 2 points. So when you look at the omnichannel behaviour, you're getting that amplifying effect which is great. So that is giving us a nice return on investment for the \u2013 of what we're doing in these growth stores.","So we have ambition to take on the extra hundred, which bring us to 250 by the end of 2020 and then we'll have about 150 left in the portfolio that we'll be investing in future years.","To your question about neighborhood stores, you know, this is one we're not putting a lot of investment into. You know, basically we'll make sure that the facilities are clean, they're well operated, but obviously when we made the decision to close you know, 125 additional stores it was knowing that we needed to take care of these customers in the time that they remain open, we need to figure out strategies to migrate them to online or to another store in the market. We need to start to experiment with square footage that would be off-mall, to see other places where this customer might enjoy Macy's products.","Those were all our objectives there, because we know that on-mall we have to have a fleet that is brand right and moving forward and a number that we used to have you know, 5 years ago, just to remind everybody, that when you look at the number of stores, not boxes, but stores, we had about 707 or 670 total stores, we're now down to about four just under 400, just at 400, when you take out the neighborhood stores with the closures we just announced.","So we've shut about 40% of our total stores over the last 5 years or our plans what we just announced and we believe this is the portfolio that are mostly in A and A plus malls that deserve a level of investment because we believe these malls are going to be vital destinations for generations to come.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Brian Callen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Brian Callen","Paula, I'm just thinking about the cadence of cash flows and funding needs this year. Can you provide a little bit of color around the cadence of asset sales. And then separately the year end cash balance was the lowest, I think I've seen since 2007. So should we anticipate a plan to rebuild that cash balance? Or is this kind of a new comfortable cash run rate given improving productivity?","Paula Price","Hi, there. So in terms of the cadence of assets sale gains, we don't typically provide the cadence on those, but we have - we have guided the year. And in terms of our year end cash balance, you're right, it was lower this year and that's because we anticipated that we would have less of a tax payable this year as a result of the tax reform. So we were comfortable with the year end cash balance.","Brian Callen","Should we think that that goes up or is that a good run rate to use for year end going forward?","Paula Price","I would say that we would expect that to come back up. We've given you the cash flow targets for this New Year, which is about a $1 billion by 2022.","Brian Callen","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go ahead.","Paul Lejuez","Hey. Thanks, guys. I am curious, Paula, how should we think about SG&A per store for the stores that are closing, just want to understand what the base level of expenses are from which you're targeting the future SG&A cuts as part of the Polaris strategy?","And also if you could maybe just be a little bit more specific in terms of the timing of the store closings that we should expect of this group that you most recently announced? Thanks.","Paula Price","Yeah. So in terms of timing we've announced the first tranche which is the 29 stores that we just announced and then the 125 which includes that 29 will take place over the 3 year period and I don't think we've been more specific than that.","And in terms of the SG&A for stores that are closing, I would just think about the neighborhood stores that were closing, as we are really managing those to be very efficient and we\u2019re managing them for profit. And in terms of our SG7A overall, I just remind that we're targeting $900 million of savings over the next 5, 3 years. We've broken those out into a few buckets, the corporate bucket is about $500 million. That's coming from a number of places, corporate restructuring, including the Campus consolidation and headcount reductions, technology efficiency, that\u2019s the system modernization, leveraging the cloud more, consolidating our systems, call center optimization, another $300 million for marketing in-stores, which is optimizing media and production spend, enhancing the productivity in our stores with self checkout and handhelds and of course, supply chain that we've been talking about in terms of SG&A, though, a small parcel contracting, looking at our freight expenses very carefully, optimizing lane rates, all of that will benefit our SG7A lines overall. But in terms of neighborhood stores, think about those as we're really managing those for productivity and profitability.","Paul Lejuez","And Paula, the closing of the store that is - just want to make sure I understand, that is not included in those SG&A savings, that just is a separate saves?","Paula Price","I would think about the total savings from Polaris. I would think about that as $1.5 billion and I would think about that as against the overall onetime cost that we projected. So I would think about it at all in.","Paul Lejuez","Okay, thanks. And just one follow up, when do those closing stores come out of the comp base? Is it when they are finally closed? Or do they come out when they're in wind down mode?","Paula Price","We take them out as we closed them. So when we announced the specific stores, we have taken those out of comp. So that's about a 10 basis points lift, the 29 stores are already out. But the balance of the stores are in because we're still operating them.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. Thank you. Good luck.","Paula Price","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Good morning. Can you talk about the P&L impact of Loyalty program updates and then any early feedback that you've had from the changes that you've made there?","Jeff Gennette","So what we talked about in the Investor Day, Lorraine, was that we discontinued the Thanks for Sharing program. And so those monies and markdowns that we had accorded to that we're already built as part of the base are now going towards the Loyalty 3.0 launch. So we do not expect a deleterious effect on our gross margin. It's all comprehended.","And as mentioned, it's exceeded our expectations thus far. You know, it's early, but in the first two weeks we're off to a great start. So and again the biggest objective on this was for us to get a clear line of sight on a larger penetration of our overall customer base, regardless of how they spend with us.","So to be able to give every one of our customers, even though they may be buying either cash or another form of payment outside of our credit card benefits, it's been a big hit thus far. So our objective is to get at least 70% of our known customer transactions within our line of sight for all the things that we can spend from that, via personalization or modernization in the future.","So Loyalty program was an important step in that. But to answer your first question, we do not expect any gross margin implication as a result of adding these great benefits and as part of Royalty 3.0.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hello, good morning. This is Gabby on for Paul. Thanks for taking our question. I know it is early, but looking at the recent Macy's closures, can you discuss what you're seeing in terms of recapturing those sales and maybe if you could just remind us how you're thinking about that opportunity moving ahead? Thank you.","Paula Price","Yeah. So I was just speaking to the recapture, what we've assumed is that we would have retention rates similar to what we've seen in the past, which sort of averages out to the mid teens and the way to think about that is retention is always sort of a function of the proximity to the any nearest - of the nearest Macy's stores. The next product that they're buying out of those stores, competition, demographics and also in multi store markets our ability to retain sales is obviously better than when we entered a single store market. But in terms of how we're thinking about retention, I would say - I would say that's it.","The other thing is that, as we talked about at Investor Day, we're looking at a number of different strategies to migrate customers to other Macy's stores, including our new off-mall formats, as we place them, and also Macy's dot com. It's a little bit too early to say what the actual retention will be though. But that's how we're generally thinking about it.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Just a quick follow up. I may have missed it. But I was wondering how outerwear performed over holiday?","Jeff Gennette","We don't comment on that one Gabby, but basically it is - it performed better our expectations, when you looked at all the cold weather businesses.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. Paula, just wondering if I could circle back to your thoughts around the credit profile and how the rating agencies are thinking about rating to be your leverage target. So as you're seeing some of the rating agencies or baking additional considerations, the leverage target you've given remains consistent, but how are you thinking about other levers to pull in the event that you need to sort of preserve ratings at some of the other agencies. Or is there enough sort of cushion within the operating profile to withstand a short term migration into high yield, if that becomes the case. Thank you.","Paula Price","Hi, Priya. So you know, we really - our cash profile and the cash target that we shared at Investor Day and how we are thinking about cash efficiency. None of that has changed as a result of this recent change in our in our credit rating. And as you saw during the Investor Day presentation, we expect that over the next 3 years through our Polaris strategy we will in fact have excess cash to determine how to use that within the four prongs of our capital allocation strategy.","So we haven't changed in terms of how we're thinking about capital allocation, in terms of how we're thinking about our financial policy and we'll continue to execute on both sides, the operating side with our Polaris strategy, and on the financial side as we think about continuing to pay down debt and continuing to target our leverage ratio.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","But I guess as a follow up, how important or critical is it for you to try to retain investment grade ratings, at - at least one of the other two rating agencies?","Paula Price","Again, that hasn't changed either, investment grade rating is very important to us and you know, the data show and we believe that investment grade companies have more cost effective access to capital. So that's important to us. It's also important to demonstrate financial strength and prudent risk management to our vendors and our partners.","And so that can - nothing's changed there. We continue to view that as important. We can't again control how the rating agencies rate us. But we are, as I said before very much focused on what we can control. And that's encapsulated in our plans to stabilize and then grow profitability and cash flows. And also in continuing to prudently manage our balance sheet and again move towards our target leverage ratio. So nothing has changed there.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, everybody.","Paula Price","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"13858":["Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) Q1 2015 Earnings Call May 13, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Karen M.

First Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Great. Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Macy's conference call scheduled to discuss our first quarter earnings. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website www.macysinc.com beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes.","Please refer to the investor relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning. Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed form 10-K.","While we expected both owned and owned plus licensed comp sales growth in the first quarter to be lower than the 2% guidance for the full year, our sales performance fell short of what we had expected. And as a result, so did our earnings. In speaking to our leadership group last week, Terry, our CEO, started his comments by saying, \"I am disappointed but not discouraged.\" I think that sums up how we all feel. And given the confidence we have in our strategies and the fact that most of the factors contributing to our weaker sales are already behind us or will be shortly, we are still comfortable with our guidance for the full year.","In addition to our earnings, we also announced this morning a 15% increase in our dividend, the quarterly dividend moving to $0.36 per share, and a $1.5 billion increase in our stock buyback authorization. This increase gives us a total authorization of approximately $2.1 billion as of the end of the first quarter. These moves are consistent with our ongoing approach for returning value to our shareholders.","Sales in the quarter were $6.232 billion, 0.7% below last year or down 0.1% on a comp owned plus licensed basis. Total sales are being helped by the acquisition of Bluemercury, but that good news is being offset by store closings and lower revenue, as we transition away from supplying product to Aeropostale.","As we look at the key factors negatively impacting our sales in the quarter, we would highlight the following five. First, international tourism. With the strong dollar, our sales from international tourists are down significantly. Because of our strong flagship stores in key tourist markets like Manhattan, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Chicago, this has had a big impact on our overall sales. We estimate that roughly 5% of our annual sales come from the international tourists, and our sales from these tourists were down double-digits in the quarter. We estimate that this negatively impacted our comp growth in the first quarter by about one full percentage point. And unfortunately, this impact will likely stay with us at least through the summer vacation period.","The second factor I would highlight is what we call the learning curve. As you know, we reorganized our merchandising, planning, and marketing functions at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's at the start of the year to maximize our omnichannel opportunities. We did this to accelerate growth, and we are confident that we made the right changes, but there is clearly a learning curve, and it is steeper than we had expected. We are hopeful that as the year progresses this new organization structure will enable our teams to positively impact our results. This would be consistent with what we experienced in the merchandise categories where we tested this approach last year.","The third factor is the slowdown in the West Coast ports. This disruption in our receipt flow impacted sales throughout the quarter. Early in the quarter, we felt the absence of fresh fashion on our floors, and at the end of the quarter our customers missed the deep markdowns that would've been taken in prior years, but hadn't yet been taken this year because the shipments had just arrived. From a sales perspective, this should be behind us.","The fourth factor is growth in general merchandise, apparel and furniture, GAF sales, as we call it, which are our lines of business, was slower than we had expected during the quarter.","The fifth factor, which we've all talked about, would be weather. Clearly, this played a role with the unseasonably cold start to the quarter. And in addition to these five, what I would call overall trends, we also experienced weak sales in some categories including fashion jewelry and watches, tabletop and housewares.","While we were disappointed with our sales, there were some successes and strong trends in the quarter that deserve mention. First and foremost, digital growth continued very strong in spite of the factors mentioned above. Also, there were some categories of goods, most notably active, dresses, furniture, and mattresses were all very strong. And also, the launch of our Thalia new private brand was a huge success. We are very excited by the potential for this multi-category new brand. As you know, the brand was designed for and aimed at the Latina customer, but it is clearly having resonance with a much broader customer set.","And also geographically the southern markets continue to perform relatively better than the north. Average unit retail in the quarter was up 1.4% with units per transaction down 1.2% and the number of transactions down just slightly. The AUR increase was actually a function of mix with our regular-priced business trending better than clearance, and also, our clearance AURs were higher than a year ago.","Gross margin rate in the quarter was 39%, up 10 basis points over last year. And our merchandise margin was actually up 20 basis points over last year. We are very pleased with this performance, although in part it was favorably impacted by the delay in the receipt of the spring goods from the port slowdown, which will negatively impact our second quarter gross margin rate. Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 2.7% over a year ago, which obviously was higher than we had expected due in part, again, to the port slowdown but also due to the weaker than expected sales.","SG&A in the quarter was $2,023 million up 1.2% over last year. It actually isn't a big increase in dollars, but because of the lower sales, as a percent of sales expense was up 60 basis points over last year in the quarter. In spite of the expense benefits from the restructuring that we did at year-end, we were not able to flex expense down sufficiently in light of the sales shortfall. This is largely due to the fact that the first quarter is a low volume quarter, and therefore, making it a tough quarter to reduce expense.","Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $6 million higher than last year. Credit income in the quarter contributed $179 million of EBIT, or $8 million above a year ago, and retirement expense was $21 million, $2 million higher than last year.","Operating income in the quarter was $409 million, $34 million below a year ago, and as a percent of sales 50 basis points below last year. Interest expense was $95 million, $5 million lower than a year ago. Taxes were $121 million, essentially flat to last year in dollars. However, the effective tax rate was 38.5%, 380 basis points up from last year's rate.","Last year, we did benefit from settlements in the first quarter, and for the full year, though, we still expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. Net income was $193 million, $31 million below a year ago. Average share count was 346.5 million shares, 7% below last year. And as you saw, the earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.56, down 7% from last year's $0.60.","Cash flow from operating activities, and after investing activities, was a use of $328 million. This did include $212 million for the Bluemercury acquisition. So excluding the acquisition, cash flow on this basis was an outflow of $116 million, which is approximately $106 million worse than a year ago. This is due to $31 million lower net income, $80 million more inventory net of payables, $43 million of higher capital spending, a higher 401(k) contribution with our new retirement plan, and these increases were partially offset by the release of escrow from some of last year's asset sales. Also, during the quarter we utilized $385 million to buy back 5.9 million shares.","As I said earlier, we are disappointed with the quarter, but are encouraged by our prospects, especially for the back half of the year and beyond. Our M.O.M. strategies are still core to what we are doing: My Macy's, Omnichannel and Magic Selling. And we will continue to make progress on all three of these key strategies. In addition, there's some new initiatives about which we're very excited. The following are seven of these initiatives.","First, the acquisition of Bluemercury and its impact on our overall Beauty business. We believe it will contribute both to our growth and earnings going forward. We're excited by the prospects for increasing the number of free-standing stores as well as comp growth in the Bluemercury stores, e-commerce and the addition of shops within the Macy's stores. At the start of this year, there were 59 Bluemercury locations. Today, there are 63 stores open, and we expect to open 14 more by year-end. We are also developing plans to maximize their e-commerce business utilizing our omnichannel capabilities, and we expect to open approximately five shops within Macy's stores over the next nine months, with a few opening this fall so we can start testing various concepts. The Bluemercury approach to the Beauty category is opening our eyes to new strategies and tactics, which could actually help us grow our overall beauty business beyond their own operation.","The second key initiative is Plenti. Our new loyalty program Plenti was launched on May 4. It is the first U.S. loyalty coalition involving major U.S. brands. It offers consumers everyday opportunity to earn and redeem points with much choice. Plenti offers opportunities to both incent our current customers to buy more and also to bring new customers into Macy's who enter the Plenti program through the other participating brands. In the first week, we have already enrolled more than 2 million customers at Macy's, which is well ahead of expectations. We are very pleased with early customer response and interest as well as our store team's terrific execution. The third initiative I'd highlight is that we are developing strategies to focus on our top 150 doors, and especially what we call our 30 platinum doors \u2013 our very best.","These 150 doors and the 30 were selected based on numerous factors including the recent sales growth, external economic factors in their markets, customer service scores in these stores, as well as their profitability. We believe there is opportunity to elevate these stores further and accelerate their growth and hopefully we will begin to see the benefit this fall particularly in the fourth quarter.","The fourth key initiative is what we call All Things Wedding. Macy's and Bloomingdale's have always been known for our gift registries, but the truth is we have an enormous opportunity to not only improve our wedding gift registry business, but also to strengthen, pull together, and market our complete offerings throughout our stores ranging from engagement rings to bridesmaid dresses to tuxedos, to cosmetics, et cetera, et cetera. Frankly, this initiative impacts almost every category in the store. And we believe it offers a great way to build ongoing loyalty with millennial customers.","The fifth initiative is that we are focusing on some key categories where we see outside growth opportunities. A few of these would include active, dresses and jewelry. Our efforts for these categories vary, but they all include not only having the right product but also having the right selling models as well as marketing strategies.","The sixth key initiative, which you heard a lot about last week, is Macy's Backstage. We don't have anything new to report since the press release, but as you might imagine, we're all very excited about the potential for this new initiative. We believe that these stores will help us increase our share of wallet with existing Macy's customers as well as bring new faces into Macy's stores.","And the last initiative is international. There are numerous third parties approaching us about potential partnerships overseas, but we aren't far enough along in our work to discuss these yet. We are excited, as you might imagine, to further build on the strength of our Macy's and Bloomingdale's brands in other key countries and markets.","There is a lot going on, and our talented, dedicated and, I might add, competitive organization is working very hard to accelerate our sales growth while maintaining our profitability.","As I said earlier, we still believe the right expectation for 2015 is approximately 2% owned plus licensed comp sales growth and approximately 1% total sales growth. But it will be more back-end loaded than we initially expected. And while we expect the second quarter comp owned plus licensed sales growth to be positive, we do not expect it to reach the 2% annual guidance. In terms of earnings, we are still expecting $4.70 to $4.80 per share in annual earnings on a diluted basis. But in the second quarter, we are expecting our earnings per share to be below last year.","One of the hallmarks of Macy's, Inc. in recent years has been our ability to overcome obstacles and succeed despite a variety of challenges and macroeconomic factors. In a lot of ways we did have the deck stacked against us in the first quarter. These included the external factors I mentioned, such as weather, port bottlenecks, the value of the dollar, and a sawtooth economy.","There were also internal factors, such as the impact of our omnichannel reorganization, which we believe caused some inadvertent but short-term disruption. While we are disappointed in our first quarter results, we are not discouraged. We see some of the first quarter obstacles disappearing and some of our new initiatives beginning to gain traction. Our style is not to make excuses but to take action.","With today's consumer having so many choices for shopping and buying, both Macy's and Bloomingdale's continue to put in place new growth strategies on every front, both organically and in pursuit of bold, new ideas. Not everything we are doing will pan out, nor should it, but we know the value of testing, learning, and taking successful ideas to scale very quickly. We remain fully committed to the new stage of growth we introduced to you in February. We expect to continue to grow comp sales and earnings per share in the full year 2015 consistent with our guidance, and we are more excited than ever about the new ideas that will unfold in the years ahead.","Let's now open the floor for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. . We'll go first to Charles Grom from Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, Karen. Just on the guidance of $4.70 to $4.80, any meaningful changes to the six or seven factors that you outlined in your February call both on the gross line or SG&A line, buybacks, et cetera?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, I don't think so. I just think, again, the timing by quarter will vary.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay, great. And then in order to get to that 2% comp hurdle for the year, trends need to get, as you mentioned, a lot better, particularly against tougher compares in the second and fourth quarter. Could you just walk us through a couple of the drivers that make you comfortable hitting that number, particularly if the second quarter is expected to be sub 2%, but a little bit above zero?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean, I think if you think about the first quarter, the weather is, obviously, better and the port slowdown will be behind us. The hope is that the disruption from the new omnichannel restructure is lessening as we get into the second quarter. What will continue with us is likely the impact of the strong dollar on the international tourists.","Hopefully, as we get through fall that will begin to improve. But, I think what makes me most excited about the fall is when we look back at the areas that we tested last year with the single view of inventory and viewing omnichannel across the organization. By the fall of last year we began to see big improvement, and I think the same thing should happen this year. And so, I'm actually quite optimistic about that as we get into the fall season.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. And then just last question. Obviously, gross margin is much better than you would expect on that type of comp. Any thoughts on the promotional backdrop today? Are you seeing any unusual activity from your peers?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I mean, yeah, obviously, we are, particularly in the upscale world. But remember also, I said that the second quarter gross margin is going to have the impact of some of the delay of the markdowns on the goods that were received late in the first quarter. So while we're very pleased with the first quarter, the second quarter may not be as good and the two will equalize together.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","And that's a major factor on why you expect earnings to be down a little bit relative to last year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. Great. All right, thanks, Karen. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Chuck.","Operator","We'll go next to Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Thanks, Karen. The Plenti loyalty program sounds pretty awesome in terms of the potential here. Do you expect this to have a back-half impact in terms of the timing at which this may occur? And given that you are mildly more inventoried than you'd like, what gave you the confidence to kind of maintain your full-year outlook as you look towards the back half?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, remember the second quarter gross margin I said will be pressured, and part of that is a result of the inventory being high at the end of the first quarter. But that will be behind us as we go to the fall season. In terms of Plenti, people here are betting on when we're going to see the impact. I think most of the knowledgeable people think it's likely to be spring 2016, because it will take customers time to start building points and really understanding the strength of the program. Frankly, that would be consistent with what we saw with Bloomingdale's when we rolled out the Loyallist program. It does take customers a while to understand these new programs, but hopefully it will help the back half. But we're not counting on that.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, Karen, and our final question is on the top 150 doors. It sounds like a shrewd prioritization. What's the nature of the lower hanging fruit in terms of the changes that you envision, whether it be different allocation of floor space or selling techniques? Just more color there would be appreciated.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, it's really, we're looking at the story holistically. So it will be some shift of space. There will be some new brands brought in. It will be places where we can elevate the assortment consistent with the customers in those stores. But if you think about it, the top malls in the country are doing extraordinarily well, as are we, but we think we can actually push that growth farther.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And we do believe your learning curve program makes sense in terms of how you characterize that. As we do look forward, which aspects of that are the most near term, in terms of the improvement opportunity as your organization gets more integrated?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think the key issue will be understanding inventory allocation and how to think about putting inventory in stores versus warehouses. And we're trying hard to make sure that our best-selling styles are everywhere and an increasing the congruency. And I'm trying not to get into technical retail speak, but it will help, we think, enormously to have inventory in the right places. And I think it will take a few months for that new organization to figure out how to do this. But I think the sales opportunity is tremendous.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Best regards.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Oliver.","Operator","We'll go next to Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much, Karen. Karen, the question we're getting most often from investors here over the first three months of the year is around your real estate strategy. And I'm wondering if you can just articulate how you're thinking about Macy's real estate as an asset. Are you, at this point, contemplating any sort of strategy around the value of your real estate and, if not, is there something that may happen over time that could cause you to change your mind?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, when it comes to real estate, the first thing I would say is this is far more complicated than what most people think. And some of the estimates of value in our real estate, I think, have been done overly simplistically. Having said that, as you might imagine, we are studying closely with our key banking partners all the various transactions that have happened lately and all the possible strategies, the pros, the cons of how you would do it, et cetera, et cetera, to see what's right for us. Our objective is always to maximize value. And up until now, we haven't seen an opportunity that made sense in terms of a global strategy.","Now keep in mind, over the last couple of years you have seen us monetize some of our real estate, frankly not with our worst-performing stores. So examples would be last year Sunnyvale and Cupertino in Northern California, where we did take advantage of a disconnect between the value of real estate and the value of the retail entity. And we are continuing to study many opportunities like that within the portfolio. So I would say obviously we're studying everything, and if something would make sense, we obviously would do it. So that's the only way to answer it, Kimberly. But we are staying close to the subject, because like you, we're getting the question also.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much, Karen.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Karen. The breakdown of the comp, you mentioned that AUR was up a bit, UPT down. Just wondering how do you expect that to trend as we move forward, particularly in the second quarter? And then how you kind of make up the composition of the 2% full-year comp?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","As I have said repeatedly, that is an impossible number to forecast. There are so many factors that go into it, so I don't know how to begin to answer that question.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then when we think about the smaller store concepts, both the Macy's Backstage, as well as Bluemercury, can you help us out with any thoughts around store count opportunity longer term or productivity and profitability metrics?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, if you look at Bluemercury, obviously if you look at Sephora or ULTA, we're currently sitting at 63 stores. You can see the enormous opportunity in free-standing stores. So I can't give you a specific number, but it's enormous. Also, obviously, the opportunity to go in the best Macy's stores is huge as well. And you add on e-commerce growth; we're very encouraged by that, but I can't give you any specific numbers. As to Backstage, again, we're just testing this fall. If it works well, again, the opportunity is huge, but that one we have to pilot it before I could begin to give you any insight as to what that strategy may mean.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Karen. So from a top-line standpoint, if you parsed out tourism and some of the weather impact, what categories do you think account for the trajectory change that we've seen from the 3 to 5 comps we were running from 2010 to 2012 versus today's reduced level?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think it's a category change. I think it's sort of the overall level. I mean, there's ups and downs within categories, but there really hasn't been any dramatic shift broadly based.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then even to break that down a little further, I mean, what do you think of the health of Center Core? Any changes? I know you mentioned watches and some shifts maybe in jewelry, but any slowing or shifting of drivers worth noting?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It's hard to know right now. Obviously, I called out the fashion jewelry and watch business being slow, and that's a part of Center Core. We were up against some major handbag promotions in the first quarter, so it's kind of hard to read until we get through that, what's happening there. But that growth continues to be very strong, absent the impact of that promotion. Shoes has done well, Beauty is doing quite well, fragrances, in particular, is very strong. So hopefully there's no major change in Center Core as the total. And, again, we're looking for ways of offsetting that jewelry\/watch slowdown. That would be the only call out. But then usually other opportunities pop.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Best of luck.","Operator","We'll go next to Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI.","Matt McGinley - Evercore ISI","Good morning. My first question is on the free cash flow generation. The first quarter is always a little bit choppy in terms of how you generate cash, but this quarter had a bigger investment in inventory as it related to the port issues. So my question is does that working capital investment normalize over the year or should we expect that overall it would be an inventory investment over the course of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So it will normalize. I mean, as I said, the inventory was a little high at the end of the first quarter but that will normalize.","Matt McGinley - Evercore ISI","Great. My second question is a follow-up on the tourism spending. I'm thinking about this from a historical standpoint. How does that tourism spending typically snap back after a weak period in the past? Is that driver mostly FX or do the stores that are more tourist-dependent tend to recover as you get into a more tourist heavy season like the summer?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I'll be honest I have not looked at that. I can't remember a time where it feels as bad in those stores, but I may be wrong, and it's a good suggestion. We'll do that.","Matt McGinley - Evercore ISI","Okay, thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","So, I'll let you know after we've done it. Yeah, I can't remember it, and maybe I should \u2013 I'm not sure. Let me look at it and we'll let you know.","Matt McGinley - Evercore ISI","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Swinand of Morningstar, Inc.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Good morning. Just wanted to maybe follow up on Paul's question about the units per transaction. Is it that people are being more careful? Is there any read-through into the environment or maybe is it just the tourism effect or the port squeeze effect having fewer goods available or people that aren't sort of stocking up? Is there any way you can comment on that color?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, as I said, when you look at the AUR, part of it was mix, and the regular price was doing better. And we typically sell fewer units per transaction with regular price. So, I have a feeling the first quarter may be distorted because of the port situation and we ought to wait and see the second quarter before we make too much of it.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Got it. So regular price up, but maybe just the takeout of the markdowns lowered the units per transaction?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","That's correct.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","If we know \u2013 If we know it positively impacted the AUR, so it would have made sense that it would do the opposite on the UPT.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Got it. Thanks. And then just wanted to drill down a little bit also in the \u2013 again, a follow up on the other question, but with watches and Center Core. Is it tough comparisons from individual brands and promotions from brands, or is it pretty widespread across the different brands being down in any color on why you think that might be besides the promotions?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I have not looked at it brand by brand, so I'm not sure how to answer that. Sorry.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Research","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","My question pertains to share repurchase expectations. The past couple of years, you've managed your balance sheet to a lease adjusted leverage range of 2.4 times to 2.7 times. And I calculate you are slightly below that range right now. So as you consider the pace of share buybacks going forward, should we expect that pace to be governed by the upper end of your leverage range?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, we \u2013 yes, I think is the easy answer. We aim for the 2.4 times to 2.7 times, so yes.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good morning, Karen. A couple of questions. Besides the top-line acceleration that you are hoping for in the back half of the year, are you assuming any incremental expense cuts to stay in that $4.70 to $4.80 guidance range you've provided?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No. I mean, we always are doing what I would call expense management cuts, but nothing significant.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And with respect to the port delays, would you say that the vast majority of that is now behind us? And then taking a look at the delayed deliveries, I think you mentioned in your fourth-quarter call that something on the order of 12% of your receipts were running late. Was it primarily private-label brands or nationally branded goods? Because I presume that national brands coming in late, you might be able to return some of that merchandise. So how should we think about the mix of the merchandise that was delayed?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I don't know the specific percentage breakdown, but, yes, a lot of it was private brands, but certainly not all.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then final question, on the new loyalty program, have you done any research to understand how many of those sign-ups are already existing Macy's credit cardholders or customers?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We are doing that, and I don't know the answer. And after one week it would be too early to tell you anyway. But, obviously, we're tracking that quite closely.","Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Drbul of Nomura.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, Karen. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Bob. Good morning.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Just had a couple questions. The first one is, on the inventory situation, are there areas in the store and throughout the business that are higher than others? And sort of how aggressive will you be in terms of getting it? And when you think about it on a monthly basis, do you think it will be throughout the whole quarter? Do you think you'll get it cleared up in June into July? Just give us an idea of how aggressive you...?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, obviously, there are pockets where inventory is higher than others based on the port situation and also based on weakness in sales. And so, we have plans to make sure that we enter the third quarter fresh and we don't take forward any of this inventory. And again, remember, the comp expectations is 2 times. So while the inventory is higher than we expected, it's not that high.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And then did you quantify any impacts on the tourism piece? I guess just a couple questions. Can you give us just updated thoughts on how much of your business is susceptible to the tourism trends and comp trends in tourism-affected markets versus ones that are less affected by the tourism?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Overall, it's about 5% of our sales, we think, comes from the international tourist. And so, as I said, we think it hurt our comps in the first quarter by a full percent.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And is that the expectation that you are holding in the full-year comp plan that you reiterated this morning?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No. I mean, second quarter, yes, but as we go through the fall, we're hoping to begin to mitigate that somewhat. And as we get to the fourth quarter, it begins to year-round also.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And then, just a last question is, could you give us any updated thoughts on acquisitions, whether \u2013 do you think that the off-price piece is a potential area for acquisition? Or do you fully expect to do it sort of on a one-by-one store basis?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We always look at buy versus build alternatives, and we'll continue to do so. In that case, we've got to test it and see what we think and decide, assuming the success is successful, what's the right way of scaling it quickly? And we'll look at anything.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Bob.","Operator","We'll go next to Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, Karen. Good morning. A couple of follow-ups actually on both those questions. But I guess the first would be, how does the tourist spend maybe vary by category? Did that drive any changes in the quarter among the strong and weak categories? And on a related note, how did the impact from tourism change relative to the fourth quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","The second question is quite a bit. It almost doubled. So that was a big step-up in terms of the impact. By category, it's relatively spread through the store. I haven't really gone through and looked at it category by category. The merchants are doing that, but I don't know the answer to that.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then I guess going back to the Backstage and off-price, and I realize that it is still early, but you did mention that scaling is a key competency. So can you talk about how maybe the off-price supply chain differs from your existing and is there any kind of investment that is already embedded in your plan as it relates to the supply chain for off-price?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","All that's in our plan right now is the test, and if it works, we'll obviously go from there. We've estimated what we think it would cost to build it out to scale, which is why we got so excited about testing it. But, until we test it and know, I think it's premature to talk about that.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And the last one, if I can squeeze it in, would just be on the non-top 150 stores, I mean, I guess what is the plan there? How has that changed as you're now reemphasizing the top 150? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We continue to focus on each and every store with a strategy that works in its local market and that's appropriate for it. Obviously, the elevation of assortments doesn't work in all markets. So we are focusing on those stores that have the greatest opportunity, as you might imagine. But, through My Macy's we've got strategies for each and every door.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll go next to Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi, Karen, how are you?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Fine, how are you, Dana?","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good. Can you talk a little bit about marketing plans and how you see them for the remainder of the year? Is it skewed to the second half and what percentage of sales done on proprietary cards? Any change there? And just two last things, in Backstage, are there any brands that are in Macy's stores that you won't sale in Backstage and how is single view of inventory progressing? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Okay, that was too many for me to remember. Let me try one by one. If I miss one, tell me. Credit penetration was 44.9% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. So that is, obviously, good news. In terms of our marketing spend, obviously, with the omnichannel organization, we're thinking differently about how we spend digitally versus the traditional media. But, overall, I don't see any major change as we go through the remainder of the year. In terms of Backstage, the question was are there vendors we wouldn't sell there?","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Yes, that are in full line that won't be in Backstage.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Oh, I'm sure there will be. And I suspect there'll be vendors that aren't in full line that will be in Backstage; so I think it will go both ways.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay. And then, single view of inventory, how is that doing?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, that's what I'm most excited about as we go to the fall season. And I do think it has caused some disruption in the beginning of the year as the new organization figured this out and figured out where to put inventory. I think it absolutely is going to give us a huge sales opportunity as we go forward.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to follow up on Backstage. As you're testing it, how are you thinking about how much clearance you'll ship to the off-price channel versus maintaining the traffic flow that you get from clearance in your flagship stores?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, it's a very good question. And, obviously, we're going to test different approaches. Interestingly, if you think about certainly the 30 platinum doors, it's very possible that clearance is taking up too much space, and it would be better cleared so that we could bring in fresh, more newness into the stores. So that may be where we take more of the clearance out than other stores that we think are more dependent on that traffic. So Peter and Vanessa and the team are going to test lots of things, and we'll learn more. But my suspicion is, to your point, we will take varying amounts of clearance out of different stores. And also, remember, we're not taking goods out until they are well down the markdown cycle. So it's not the early markdowns that will be taken out for off-price.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. And what are you hearing from your vendors about AURs in the second half? Cotton prices are obviously down. There are some offsets. Is there any change in strategy that you hear coming through the pipeline?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I have not heard of any.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Exstein of Credit Suisse.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much, Karen. Just a couple of quick questions. Number one, what sort of costs associated by the Bluemercury rollout and the off-price rollout are incorporated in the estimates that you talked about today? Number one. Number two, in spite of the port issues, you actually were able to lever your payables pretty nicely. I am just wondering was there some sort of change going on there because one would've thought that the payables may have backed up a little bit from that.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Let me answer that one before I forget. That one's just timing, Michael.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","So I don't think there's anything different there.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then, how about the cost associated with the rollout of off-price and stuff like that?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, that's all in the numbers. And as we've discussed, we're offsetting that as we aim to maintain the 14% EBITDA rate. For this year, we would expect Bluemercury to sort of be breakeven on the EPS line.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","But, obviously, next year we hope that it will be additive. And, obviously, there are costs included in the SG&A, particularly as we go through the year associated with Backstage and also Bluemercury.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then, finally, in terms of the Plenti loyalty program or rewards program, is that on top of the normal Macy's loyalty program so that you'll be layering loyalty programs on top of each other?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No. The Star Rewards program will be merged into Plenti. So, we will still offer a lot of the coupons that we do for our credit card customers, but the actual rewards that we gave, roughly 1% is now being replaced by Plenti.","Michael Block Exstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great.

Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes, good morning. Thank you, Karen. Just two quick questions. Most of my questions have been answered. Just wondered in the first quarter whether there were any asset sales that impacted SG&A? I do see in other net line in the cash flows from investing activities. And then, secondly, I was just curious what that handbag promotion was last year that you did not repeat that would've impacted the business. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","That I'm not going to comment on. But your first question is, there were asset sales but nothing material.","David J.

You've seen some cushion build with a couple of the rating agencies. Would you look to maintain current ratings at least a mid-BBB, or is it sort of just looking at staying investment grade overall? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We tend to focus on ratios rather than ratings, because I've learned over the years I can't control ratings, but ratios I have more control over.

Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","The first question is it would be a little less than the first quarter, and then relatively evenly Q2, Q3, and Q4 on the $140 million.

Today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Macy's, Inc. conference call scheduled to discuss second quarter earnings and our outlook for the back half of the year. I'm Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company.","Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made on this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","While second quarter sales and earnings were still below last year, we were pleased with the improvement in our sales trend during the quarter. Our comp sales performance on an owned-plus-licensed basis was much improved from the first quarter on both on a one-year and on a two-year basis and sets us up well for the remainder of the year. I will talk this morning first about the quarter and then our outlook for the second half of the year and will also discuss the strategic announcements made today regarding our store portfolio and real estate opportunities.","Sales in the second quarter were $5.866 billion, down 4% from last year. On a comp owned-plus-licensed basis, sales were down 2%. This compares to the 5.6% drop we experienced in the first quarter. On a two-year basis, the first quarter was down 2.9% per year and the second quarter down 1.7%, representing a 1.2-point improvement in this trend. Both Macy's and Bloomingdale's experienced improvement in the second quarter.","We would cite four key factors contributing to this trend change. One, weather has been hot this summer and has contributed to the strong apparel sales and perhaps more shopping in general as a way to avoid the heat.","Two, international credit card sales were down 12% in the second quarter. This compares to a 20% drop in the first quarter. While this still negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter, it had less of an impact than it has had in recent quarters. As a result, our sales trend in the major tourist stores improved for both Macy's and Bloomingdale's in the quarter.","Three, many of our sales-generating strategies are beginning to kick in. The investment in staffing in our best stores, our fine jewelry strategy, the Last Act clearance strategy, and home store improvements, this is very encouraging.","And four, a few strong promotional events and sharper pricing helped in the quarter as well, and we were able to structure these events to both drive sales and preserve our gross margin rate.","The families of business that were strongest in the quarter included all of apparel, men's, women's, and kids', as well as fine jewelry, shoes, fragrances, textiles, and housewares. Handbags and fashion jewelry and watches continued to be weak.","We are encouraged by the start of the back-to-school season. We are seeing strength in all categories, but are most excited by the strong trend in denim.","Our private brands also helped fuel the quarter's improvement, particularly in women's apparel, shoes, and home. This strength is great to see, given the importance of having great merchandise that can be found only at Macy's.","Geographically, our Southwest region, which is primarily Southern California, had the strongest performance.","Our digital business had a strong quarter again of double-digit growth both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We are benefiting from new releases on our mobile apps and other technology improvements that are driving increases in conversion. Our investments are focused on removing points of friction, and our Net Promoter Score has improved on our digital business two points year over year. For example, we've been able to auto-provision our customers' wallets to make it easier to use coupons and other promotional offers. We've also improved navigation to make it easier and faster to shop.","The number of transactions in the quarter was down 5% versus last year, with average unit retail up 2.8% and relatively flat units per transaction. This is slightly different from the first quarter when, as you remember, the number of transaction was down by more and the average unit retail not up by as much. The change in both of these metrics demonstrates the improved underlying trends in our business.","Our Backstage stores are doing well in total, although performance by door is mixed, as you would expect from a new business. We are learning a lot about how to maximize this opportunity, with our focus being on the store-in-stores. We are encouraged by the early results.","Bluemercury has had terrific new store openings, including in Tribeca, Columbus Circle, East Hampton, as well as their 100th store which opened in Savannah, Georgia. We now have 103 Bluemercury stores, including 12 in our Macy doors. We are optimistic that Bluemercury will contribute significantly to our beauty offering in our Macy's stores as well as in the freestanding locations.","We are pleased with the early performance of our China joint venture, which is doing business through Tmall. We are learning both about the Chinese consumer and also how to do business there. It is too early to judge, but we are encouraged by what our small team has been able to accomplish in a very short time.","Gross margin rate in the second quarter was 40.9%, flat with last year, which is better than we had expected. This resulted from our sales being stronger than expected and also from the success of our Last Act strategy for clearing end-of-season merchandise. We've now expanded Last Act beyond apparel areas, including for example to handbags, and we expect to convert shoes later this year.","In total, our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 3.2% versus a year ago. And on a comp basis, inventory was down 1.5%.","SG&A in the quarter was $2.026 billion, or 34.5% of sales. This is $32 million or 1.6% below last year in the quarter, due primarily to $21 million in asset sale gains in the quarter versus none during the second quarter last year. The portion of the Brooklyn gain that was booked in the quarter was $11 million, and gains on other asset sales were $10 million.","We also benefited in the quarter from the restructuring that we completed at year end 2015, lower store expense due to last year's closings, and lower retirement expense. Offsetting these positive factors were an increase in expense to support our digital growth and a reduction in credit income.","Credit income in the quarter was $181 million, $14 million below last year, due primarily to lower credit sales. The penetration of our proprietary credit cards was approximately 47% in the second quarter, down about 80 basis points from last year but up over 100 basis points from 2014.","Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $260 million, about flat with last year.","We booked $249 million in asset impairments and other costs, primarily related to the expected closure of approximately 100 stores, which I will discuss with you in a few minutes. Settlement charges related to our retirement plans were $6 million in the quarter.","Operating income after these charges was $117 million. Excluding asset impairment, settlement charges, and the other costs, operating income was $372 million, 6.4% of sales. On this basis, it was 15% below last year.","Interest expense in the quarter was $97 million and tax expense $11 million. Including the asset impairment settlement charges and other costs, net income was $9 million.","The net loss attributable to the non-controlling interest was $2 million relating to our China joint venture, so that net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $11 million. Net income attributable to Macy's shareholders in the quarter excluding the asset impairment, settlement charges, and other costs was $168 million. Average share count on a diluted basis in the quarter was 311.3 million shares, down 9% from last year.","We did not buy back any stock in the second quarter. We suspended the program in reaction to our disappointing first quarter. However, should current sales trends continue, we will consider resuming our stock buyback in the back half of the year.","EPS on a diluted basis was $0.03. Excluding asset impairments and settlement charges, EPS in the quarter on a diluted basis was $0.54, which is down 16% on the same basis from last year.","Cash flow before financing in the first half of the year was a positive $222 million this year as compared to a use of $217 million last year. And net cash provided from operating activities was $560 million as compared to $398 million last year, primarily due to the reduction in inventory. Net cash used by investing activities was $338 million, $277 million lower than last year, due primarily to last year's acquisition of Bluemercury as well as lower capital spending. We are still targeting capital spending of $900 million for the full year, which compares, as you know, to $1.1 billion last year. Cash used by financing activities was $331 million this year, $855 million less than last year, due primarily to the lower stock buyback as well as fewer option exercises.","As we move to the back half of the year, we are encouraged by the recent business trends. Our annual sales guidance of minus 3% to minus 4% on a comp owned-plus-licensed basis feels achievable. The fall season would need to be minus 2.3% to minus 4.1% to hit that guidance. This compares to the minus 3.8% in the first half of the year. On a two-year basis, the back half of the year would need to be minus 3.2% to minus 4.1% per year as compared to minus 2.3% in the spring season. We still expect the comp sales performance relative to last year to be worse in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter, largely due to the last year comparisons.","Our earnings per share guidance for the year remains at $3.15 to $3.40 for the full year. The only change in our key assumptions versus our prior earnings guidance is that we now expect the Brooklyn gain in fiscal 2016 to be approximately $36 million, which is $50 million less than what we had told you to expect when we gave guidance in February. The total gain associated with the Brooklyn transaction does not change. This is just timing due to delays in the project construction. We are comfortable at this point, though, covering this $0.10 a share of bad news within our prior guidance.","As we have said, we are focusing on setting the company up for a comeback. And while we are very pleased with the improved sales trend, it does not change our feeling of urgency for making changes to better position Macy's and Bloomingdale's for the future. You will hear about these changes and our priorities as we move forward. Today's announcement is focused on our store portfolio and how we are strengthening it to position us best so that we can win over the longer term.","As you know, we have a terrific portfolio of stores with strong locations in almost every top mall in our markets as well as great freestanding stores such as Herald Square, 59th Street, and Union Square. We are in 49 of the top 50 U.S. markets based on population and 91 of the top 100.","All of our stores except a very few are cash flow positive, but not all of our stores fit today with our desired long-term retail footprint. While our weaker performing and less well located stores are cash flow positive, many of these don't produce acceptable returns on investment and often don't represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand. And as we all know, market demographics change over time, and this country is over-stored given evolving customer shopping habits.","We decided to be proactive and to close a larger number of stores this year. This will bring the shopping experience to a consistently higher level and concentrates Macy's stores in locations with better potential. We believe we can benefit from right-sizing the company. This will force us to make necessary overhead reductions to preserve profitability and ongoing cash flow. And while it will shrink the company somewhat, these closings will positively impact our return on invested capital and help us to accelerate our growth.","As you read in our press release this morning, we expect to close approximately 100 stores. We will not, however, lose representation in any of the top markets. Most of these stores will close around our fiscal year end, but we will continue to operate some of these until we either sell the store or until leases or operating covenants either expire or can be amended or waived. Most of these stores are underperformers or in weak locations. However, we will also close a few stores because their desirability as a redevelopment opportunity exceeds their value to us as retail store.","While we can't be too precise until the actual store list and timing are finalized, our estimate is that if all of these closings happened at fiscal year-end 2016, they would negatively impact sales in 2017 by approximately $1 billion. But as I said earlier, we don't expect all to be closed at year end, and so the impact on 2017 should be less.","This potential sales loss is lower than the projected volume of these 100 roughly stores due to our ability to retain some of the sales in other stores as well as on macys.com. With the stores we've closed in recent years, we have greatly improved our ability to retain sales both through new targeted marketing efforts and by trying to make sure that we add specific merchandise, categories, and vendors that is in stores that are being closed into stores that are nearby.","The desire to retain as many customers as we can and begin impacting assortment decisions for spring 2017 is why we are making this announcement so far in advance. These stores currently produce incremental EBITDA, but we are hoping to be able to offset this loss with cost reductions beyond the costs that come from closing these stores directly. We are working hard on strategies to reduce costs consistent with both the downsizing of the company and also so that we can be more agile in making decisions going forward. At this point, we don't have details worked out and we will discuss this with you more down the road. But as you know, our track record is very good in delivering expense reductions to which we commit.","The preliminary list of possible closures resulted in our having to impair many of these assets now. These asset impairments are primarily what is responsible for the $249 million in total charges taken in the second quarter.","One of the reasons we feel it is right to shrink to grow is the success we're beginning to have in our top doors. Our work with our top 150 doors gives us confidence that we can accelerate our growth in these strategically critical locations. We want to focus our financial resources and our talent to make this happen, along with fueling our digital growth. This will come from a combination of improved assortments, more technology, more and better customer service, and more special events.","The closing of approximately 100 stores is a big step and not one that we take lightly. We believe it is critical to reposition the company for the future, but that still doesn't make it easy. We will be respectful and open with our associates in these stores, and we'll try to minimize the impact on local communities by improving nearby stores and with our digital shopping venues.","We also provided an update today on our pursuit of various opportunities to extract value from our real estate portfolio consistent with our long-term store location strategy as well as our balance sheet leverage objectives. For some time now, we have been examining opportunities for four large downtown stores in major cities, Herald Square, Union Square, State Street in Chicago, and downtown Minneapolis.","Today, we announced that we are currently in discussions with potential purchasers for our San Francisco Men's store on Union Square. For those of you not familiar with San Francisco, we have a Men's building as well as a main store, and what we're talking about is selling just the Men's store. The main store would continue. This store would be redeveloped for alternative use, and our Men's business would be recombined into our main Union Square store. While today it is currently one of the country's most successful men's stores, the value of the real estate appears to offer significant opportunity, and we believe we can recombine it with the main store and both preserve the strength of our offering and hopefully improve the main Union Square store as well.","We continue to analyze possibilities for our Herald Square New York flagship store, downtown Minneapolis, and the upper floors of our State Street store in downtown Chicago.","In addition to these flagship stores, we have made progress in identifying underlying situations where the development or redevelopment of all or a part of our real estate holding exceeds the value of its existing use. We are developing and executing plans to move forward to capitalize on these opportunities. This will occur through sales of assets or portions thereof, some of which are included in the 100 closings, but it could also happen through joint ventures or strategic alliances.","We are in early stages of discussions with various potential partners.","We also continue to evaluate financial transactions such as sale\/leasebacks or joint ventures for locations that we expect to operate for many years. However, this is a low priority for us at present, given a combination of leverage as well as breakage or leakage that would result from debt repurchase, from taxes, and from fees.","While we know we have a lot of work ahead of us, we feel confident that we are on the right path. As I said earlier, closing stores is not something we take lightly, but we do believe it will enable us to focus more on our better stores and on our digital business. And by closing weaker stores and monetizing some of our real estate where the redevelopment opportunities are significant, we will grow faster and we will produce a higher return on invested capital.","We have talked before about the ongoing need to reinvent our company and that our industry every five to seven years also needs to be reinvented in response to evolving customer shopping preferences and patterns. This is what you are seeing at work today at Macy's, Inc. Terry [Lundgren] and Jeff [Gennette] are working closely with our management team and our board on the strategic progress needed to extend our longstanding role as a leader in fashion, innovation, value, and convenience. As in previous times of reinvention, some big moves and tough decisions in the short term are necessary if we are to grow sales profitably for the longer term. We need to create value from our assets and manage our expenses prudently so that we can invest in the levers of growth.","After a series of tough quarters, the distinct change in our sales trend in the second quarter has given our team encouragement. We have so many good ideas on the table. The biggest challenge will be prioritizing what we do, ensuring that we invest appropriately for success, and following the data to be sure that we are in sync with the customer. Everyone here is on board to implement our chosen strategies with passion and rigor.","Retailing is changing, there's no doubt about it. Our company is committed to being tomorrow's leader in omni-channel retailing. We will strike the right balance between stores and digital. And the closing of 100 locations will get us to where we think we need to be, all while maintaining a significant physical presence in virtually every major market across America.","Fortunately, our company has the critical mass to offer all of the options that our customers want in terms of stores, websites and mobile apps, in terms of expedited shipping, buy online pickup in store, and same-day delivery in many markets, in terms of offering a range of exclusive product choices supported by great experiences that are the hallmarks of both Macy's and Bloomingdale's. So what you are seeing today is meaningful change in the making, and you will be hearing more as time goes on.","I'll stop at this point and take whatever questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we will take our first question from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Mr. Trussell, please turn off your mute function.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Paul.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you for all the color. Maybe we can just start with the top line. You spoke about an improvement that you saw throughout the quarter as well as a little bit less negative tourism. As we think about the second half, what are the key drivers that you think can further accelerate the momentum you have in the business and perhaps start turning the comps toward positive in 2017?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think if I start by focusing on all those things that we are doing, it always starts with product and assortments as well as obviously offering the value that our customer wants, but we're supplementing that with improved service in our stores. As you know, we are investing in adding associates to help us with that. So we hope to have not only more sales associates but also continue to improve the training so that we have better associates. The mobile apps and what we're doing online should clearly help as well. So most of our focus is on what we can do internally to help make that happen.","Obviously, if the tourist trends continue to be less bad, that would be positive. And obviously if we have a cold winter, that would be terrific as well. But all of our attention is focused on the parts we can control, and the key is having spectacular experiences both in-store and online and on our mobile apps.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then just to follow up, one, if you can, give us a little bit more detail on gross margin performance in the second quarter. Obviously, that came in better than plan. If you can, just walk us through how you were able to achieve that and any timing items or things that we should just keep in mind as we try to model out that line item going forward.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think the key is that sales were better than we had expected, and we have a terrific merchant team that was able to plan out the promotions and needed clearance markdowns to get our inventory in the shape that we were in at the end of the quarter and did so in a way that we were able to preserve the margin. Also, as I said, our Last Act clearance strategy is working well, and that helped as well.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just a quick clarification, Karen, you're saying \u2013 you said earlier that you would have \u2013 you actually would have raised your EPS guidance by $0.10...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, it's the opposite.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","... if it wasn't for the real estate?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, all we're saying is we're keeping the guidance the same. But since we had given a number for Brooklyn of $86 million at the start of the year and now it appears like it's going to be $50 million less, I just want to make sure you've all thought about that in your models, but we're not changing guidance. So that did hurt our earnings by $0.10 a share, but we're not changing guidance.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thank you for the clarification, good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll move to Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch Research","Thank you, good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch Research","Karen, you said that you would be able to cut costs to offset the EBITDA loss from the closed stores. Will that limit your overall longer-term cost reduction plan, or will these cost cuts be incremental?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, the key is, as you know, we're focused on getting our profitability back to the 14%, so we have been continuing to focus on are there ways of doing the business more efficiently to make that happen. So all of that activity is continuing and will help us offset the loss in EBITDA dollars from the store closings. Obviously, if we can preserve the EBITDA and have whatever the number turns out to be, roughly $1 billion less in sales, that will help our EBITDA rate and also, by the way, help us in terms of return on invested capital, so all good.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch Research","Yes, and then the AUR was up for the quarter. Was that a mix shift, or were there other factors involved there?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, AUR is a very tough number when you look at it in total. I'm sure there was some mix shift in there. But it also had to do with the fact that we were able to clear the inventory both through Last Act and earlier in the markdown cycle in a better way.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch Research","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take a question from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to ask about the $1 billion of lost sales you estimated. I know it's still early from the 100 store closures. You talked about that being net of some sales recapture in other stores and potentially online. Are you able to disaggregate what's the gross versus net number and the potential of that to benefit comps in your existing store base?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, we'll talk about it as we get the specific stores and where we are going forward. We have had a lot of success in retaining more of the sales than we used to be able to retain, both through marketing and also through our assortment decisions. And so as we model these out, we have estimates store by store, which depend on distance to the other store, how similar the stores are, et cetera, et cetera. But once we make the final decisions, Lindsay, we'll try to help you with that.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. And to follow up, we've heard from a number of your vendors a change in their thoughts on friends and family and couponing and promotional strategy. Are you guys also contemplating a shift in that strategy for next year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, I wouldn't say we're contemplating a shift, but obviously we're working with our key vendors to make sure that we can keep their sales growing as much as they should and sorting through how to do that by giving customers the value that they want.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And we will move next to Paul Lejuez of Citi.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Paul.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I'm just curious how you plan to work through inventory at some of these stores that are to be closed. Should we expect you to merchandise those stores similarly as if they weren't being closed, or will they have a more toned down assortment as we think about the back half? And then maybe...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, there will be no change for the remainder of the year in those stores in terms of the inventory.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So should we expect pretty significant promotions in those stores at the end of the year before they close?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, it will be business as usual, like we always do when we close stores. And then once we close them, they will go into going out of business mode, but it doesn't change how we operate them between now and then. As you know, we haven't identified which ones they are, so don't expect any change in terms of how stores are operated this fall.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And you talked about having I think a better experience just in terms of retaining sales on recent closures. Can you talk about the 41 stores that closed last year, what percentage you were able to retain at nearby stores or e-comm?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We're still watching the percentage, but it's not as much as people would think it would be, but we are having a lot more success than we used to. I think we need a little more time, Paul. So let's just wait until the end of the year, and then we'll talk about it.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then just one model question. On the depreciation line, the impairment charge in 2Q, does that help you a bit in second half on the depreciation line? And if so, can you quantify that for us?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think as we look at the depreciation, it's not going to change much from the guidance we had given you before for the year. So it changes some, but not enough to make a difference.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks and good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you talk about early indications from some of the initiatives, so what you're seeing from the jewelry rollout, Last Act, Backstage? And then just we traveled out and saw some of the tests in Easton Town Center, and it was pretty impressive. Any learnings you've found there and potential to roll out across the fleet?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The good news is if I look at, for example, fine jewelry, we started it in 40 stores in California last year. And based on that success, as you know, we're rolling it out. The good news is as we year-round the rollout of that in California, the stores continue to grow significantly, so we feel great about the sustainability of the accelerated growth. And now it's in over 350 stores, with the remaining locations being rolled out next year.","And Phase 2 of the rollout is doing as well as the first phase did last year, so we feel great about that. Last Act continues to be very strong, helping both sales and margin. And Backstage, as I said, we're learning an awful lot about how to give value to the customer and perhaps how to both increase the share of wallet of our existing customers and also attract new customers to our doors. So all is good.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just anything on Easton Town Center?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Oh, sorry, I forgot about Easton. Easton, there's a lot of things that are working very well, and I think you will see us roll it out a lot with active and the wellness, beauty. But I think it's too early to really be specific about what it will be, but we feel great about what we're seeing there.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just to follow up, larger picture, there are a lot of changes underway from your vendors. I'm sure you hear it on every single one of these calls and more on the distribution front. Can you speak to how you see this playing out for Macy's over time? Do you believe this could actually accelerate your differentiation effort versus some of your peers? I'm just curious how you think Macy's is impacted and the best way for us to think about it.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Look, we have great relationships with the major vendors. We're important to them; they're important to us. And hopefully, with us being proactive and hopefully accelerating our growth and making the company stronger, that will be good for them as well, and we'll work together so that we all can be stronger in the future.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, best of luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take a question from Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","A couple real quickies, Karen. Any estimate of the cash impact of the store closings, and is that part of the $249 million?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Most of the $249 million is non-cash, and it's related to the asset impairments. Almost all of it is non-cash.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay, but there will be severance charges?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","There will, there will. But typically when we close stores, the bigger number is the impairment charge. You can go back and look at last spring and see that.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay, but you're including that in the $249 million, the severance?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","No?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, because we don't know the stores yet.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","And our hope is to be able to place as many of the associates as we can and minimize that number.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay. And Last Act, can you quantify the impact that you believe it has had on your overall gross margin?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, I really can't.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay, final question real quick. How large is the men's store at Union Square?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It's about a little less than 250,000 square feet, and the main store is about 925,000 square feet.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take a question from Brian Tunick of RBC Capital.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. I'm new, but I was curious, Karen. On Backstage, maybe you can give us little more color there. What is the team internally evaluating when they're considering rolling it out into more of the Macy's stores, and how does that change given the store closing announcements?","And then just on the buyback potential acceleration into the second half, can you give us a view of what a minimum cash position would be when we try to think of how much stock you would buy back?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Unfortunately, I can't give you much help on your second question. Typically, we look at the cash that we're going to generate through the year, but I can't give you a \u2013 and use it to buy back stock what we're not using for CapEx and internal purposes, but I can't give you a specific number.","On Backstage in-store, what we're trying to evaluate, and this is really being done category by category, what impact does it have on the Macy's store and what impact does it have in terms of bringing new customers to the store, sort of both. As you would expect, when we take space away from the rest of Macy's, the non-Backstage part of the store will do less business. But currently we are seeing a lift in the total store including Backstage, which is very encouraging. But as you might imagine, different stores are behaving differently, different categories. And so we're really just trying to learn and figure out what's the best way of expanding this concept.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And where are you in building out a buying organization or developing a packaway strategy? Obviously, I know Bloomingdale's Outlet is developed. But is there a lot of overhead you need to add to build out the capabilities like other off-pricers?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We have an organization already. It is being bought completely and planned for completely by a separate organization, so we already have that. Obviously, it will grow depending on the growth of the business. But we do it completely separate from the core Macy's organization.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Terrific, thanks very much and good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll hear from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Hi, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","I wanted to \u2013 as you guys are really thinking outside the box and creatively about different strategies, operational and real estate related, you've had some nice success with the licensed concept with Finish Line and others. Have you guys thought about pursuing more of that kind of concession model maybe directly with some of your big suppliers? Have you thought about \u2013 that would allow you to take away some of the inventory risk and maybe some of the expense around running those businesses. I'd just be curious since you're in that mindset of thinking differently about things.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We definitely will expand the licensed businesses that we have, but it always starts with opportunities to grow sales and give our customers experiences in categories that we haven't been able to do as well ourselves. So it doesn't start with a desire to reduce inventory. It's really, can we give the customer a superior offering? So our focus has been primarily on categories or in some cases vendors that we might not otherwise be able to offer. But it really does start with the lens of the customer in terms of what we choose to license versus not.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. And then maybe you could just give us a little update on the Black Friday in July event, how that went, and it was a unique thing that you guys did.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","It went very well, and we were quite pleased with it.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks, good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we will hear from Michael Binetti of UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Karen. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","And congrats on a very tough quarter for the industry.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Let me ask you. I think as we look ahead a little bit, obviously you're talking about a lot of things today that are longer term in your model. If I look at just 2017, maybe a little bit of help on how to think about some of the puts and takes as far as \u2013 can you help us dimensionalize the comp trend in your, say, top 100 doors versus your bottom 100? Or you pick the number, just so we can understand how this could impact comps.","And then maybe just how you \u2013 I think there was an earlier question about friends and family about a couple brands pulling away from it, how you think about the merchandising to replace any hole in comps that that may cause as we look out to the next year.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think it's premature to give guidance or thoughts on 2017. So I apologize, but I'm not going to be able to help you there. And obviously, that's what we work on, which is when we see some sort of a risk, either from less good product or a change in a promotion strategy for a vendor, what can we do to fill those holes with other products or other categories, and that's what our team does all day long.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Is it meaningful? I guess is it fair for me to assume that there's a meaningful delta in the spread of comp growth or comp distribution of the company between your top doors and then any of the bottom 100 that we may have talked about?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I don't know how to answer that because everybody defines meaningful differently.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So you guys have done a great job on staying nimble on watching the costs during the smaller number of closures over the past few years, but this one is obviously bigger. If you can do it respectfully to your team, can you talk to us about how the approach to cost with a bigger announcement like this may be different than in a year when you close a lower door count? Obviously, people will look at where is Macy's going to come up enough to offset the fixed cost deleverage potential?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think there would be a big difference in terms of our approach. For example, one of the areas we'll focus on is the whole world of indirect spend, where we think there may be opportunities to take costs out. But I don't think this year will feel any different than other years in terms of what we're trying to do.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we will hear from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Kimberly.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask about transactions. The 5% decline, does that include e-commerce? Secondarily, apparel I think you mentioned was strong across the board. Was that category actually positive in the quarter or just better than the rest of the categories?","And then lastly on the 100 stores that are closing, I understand that the $1 billion in revenue is the expectation of the net loss net of retained sales, and I know that the retained sales assumption varies on a store-by-store basis. But could you give us some idea of what the gross revenue assumption is? That would be helpful. Thanks, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","So the 5% drop in number of transactions does include dot-com. That's the number we quote every quarter. And in ready-to-wear, there were parts of the ready-to-wear that were quite positive. In total, it was pretty close but not positive. But there were categories, things like junior dresses or millennial dresses that was positive, and active and things like that.","And I think as I had said earlier, until we know specifically which stores are closing, I don't want to talk about gross versus net. And remember, that $1 billion is likely to be a bigger number than what actually ends up closing at year end 2017 because some of the 100 stores will be closing a little bit later. So once we have the specific stores, we'll try to be more helpful with gross and net.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you, Karen, and just one last follow-up. I think you mentioned on a slightly lower credit income, it was largely a result of a slight decline in penetration. Are you seeing any increase in late payments, delinquencies, or defaults in that portfolio at this point?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, remember, we had expected credit income to be below last year when we started the year, so this is not a surprising trend. We are seeing some increase in delinquencies, as we had said. But remember, part of that is because we're also trying to grow the portfolio. So there's nothing concerning happening in the portfolio today, and it is happening as we had anticipated.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, and thank you so much for all the detail today. It's really helpful.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You bet. Thanks, Kimberly.","Operator","And we will move to Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Regarding the reinvention of stores and the changes you're making, what are your thoughts on how we should focus on millennials and Generation Z and how you're going to balance being appealing to younger and older in your core as the store evolves? It's a longer-term question in terms of how will these stores look different in five years. What is your consumer research saying, and are there major category shifts we should see? The service component is also interesting in your prepared remarks. Which departments do you think will benefit from more service, and why did you identify this as a need?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","That was a mouthful. I'm not quite sure where to start with that. Clearly, our view of the stores going forward will evolve. So I can't sit here today and paint what it's going to look like in five years. But as we do stores like Easton and Columbus, that gives you some insight into some of the things we're looking at, for example: an expanded active area that includes health and wellness more broadly; the way we've approached the bridal business at Easton, including having some wedding dresses available that you could buy in the store day-of or not having to be pre-ordered. Also, what we've done with beauty in Easton is really very exciting. So there are a lot of concepts, fine jewelry, which we've talked about. We're experimenting with shoes.","So I would say almost throughout the store, we are looking for ways of improving both the assortment that we carry, making it more special, more exclusive to Macy's, which will attract not only millennials but also older customers as well. So I think you're going to see a lot of experimentation continue on that front.","In terms of increase in service, one of the areas we've actually focused on this year has been ready-to-wear. And the reason for that is it's the category that also has to handle the most Internet returns. And so we wanted to make sure we had more staff there so that they were able to service customers that came in wanting to buy in addition to dealing with the returns that are going to obviously come from a growing digital business. So that's one of the examples of where we've put increased staffing.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And, Karen, you've been on top of understanding the real customer focus on value and evolving Last Act. But what's the future of the evolution of how you execute promotions in a brand-appropriate way in the manner that you want to execute them and is appealing in terms of how you may segment different ideas? I just want to get your take on the modernization of promotions.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think it's premature, but we've got lots of thoughts and lots of tests that we're going to start to begin thinking about that. So we agree that that's an issue that should be on our plates and for sure it is, but premature to really be talking about it.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, and just our last question, Karen. You've been a really good partner to a lot of vendors. As the opportunities \u2013 as the landscape evolves and Amazon becomes a partner to a lot of your vendors as well, what are your thoughts on how you'll maintain a competitive advantage? And there's many ways to approach that, but what's top of mind? And has anything been surprising in terms of what we should know about the evolution of that relationship and how this is evolving?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, I would say first, vendor relationships have always been one of the core values of Macy's. And that's going to always be important, and we're going to work very closely with our vendors to help our business and their business simultaneously. So I see that continuing. I think also as part of today's announcement we're focused on growth and more profitable growth. And yes, while we're shrinking to achieve that growth, I think that will help our vendors as well.","And let's not forget the critical importance of stores for most of our vendors. We have the ability of showing merchandise and providing instantaneous not only purchasing, but also the ability to put outfits together in a store, which again for many customers to be able to see the color, feel the fabric, see how it fits, it's still where the lion's share of where this merchandise is being sold. So I think all of that will help us to continue to be very important partners to our vendors.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you, great job on moving so quickly in your communications strategy. Thanks, best regards.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I appreciate it, thanks.","Operator","And we will take the next question from Richard Jaffe of Stifel.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Just a quick clarification. We had planned for 30 stores to 40 stores this year. Is the 100 stores you've mentioned an incremental or an additional 100 stores? Or is that...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, the 30 stores to 40 stores \u2013 the 41 stores were closed year-end last year. So if you're talking about last year's announcement, that's already happened. So this is 100 stores on top of that, approximately 100 stores.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it, that's helpful. And given what appears to be the success of some of the shop-in-shops you've built, I know you can't be specific, but is that going to be an initiative we should look for in 2016?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Are you talking about like Bluemercury store-in-store, or are you talking about the licensed businesses...","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Bluemercury or...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, absolutely.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then in time for Christmas, do you think?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Hopefully.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Look forward to it. Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we will move to Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, Karen, and nice to see the progress.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you very much.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As you think about the apparel pickup, what's your take on what's driving it? Is it style? Is it price? Is it Last Act? And then on the promotional cadence where you saw the margin uptick, did that come from a lesser rate of promotion or better full price? How do you triangulate it? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Honestly, I think the pickup in apparel is all of those things. It's improved assortments, improved offering. I think it is the value offering and the price, and I do think Last Act. So I'd say yes, yes, and yes. And I also think, as I said earlier, the warm weather did help.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","And then as we go in the back half of the year, any new collaborations or anything new on the merchandising side that we should look to?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think I would say stay tuned. There are some things in the works that we're still hoping to get done. But we continue to strengthen the relationships that we have in these collaborations, so stay tuned.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it, thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Operator","And we will move to David Glick of Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","A question on Backstage and then I'll follow up on the store closings. At what point do you think you'd be in a position to more aggressively roll out the store within a store Backstage concept? And did you consider or is it still possible to consider some of these locations that are closing to repurpose as Backstage stores?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I think it is unlikely that we will repurpose any of these stores for Backstage in-store, although that's always a possibility. And I think we will continue to grow Backstage in-store. I'm not sure. Again, the word aggressive has a wide range of definitions.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","But I think we feel good about it and we'll expand it.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then a follow-up on the store closings. Can you help us think through the cash flow impact? Obviously, it's EBITDA neutral given the cost cuts that you're implementing. But if you can, give us some color on the working capital and CapEx impact, and then also as you seek to get back to your historical EBITDA margin goals, the impact this could have on gross margin given the probability that some of these smaller doors are higher markdown, lower margin doors.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Until we have the specific stores, David, it's hard to do it. Obviously, it will free up working capital and it will allow us to spend less on CapEx, although I confess we're not spending an enormous amount in these stores, which is part of the reason why we're closing them. But we will reinvest that capital. So I don't expect a reduction in the capital budget because of these closures. Also, they will bring in proceeds. So again, as we get closer to knowing which stores, there will be a cash flow positive that will come from selling many of these stores. Some are leased, so it's not all of them. So more to come as we know more, but the working capital and the proceeds should be positive in terms of cash flow for the company.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And the gross margin impact?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I don't know that it will be significant, but again, we'll wait and see as we close the stores.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great, nice progress. Thank you very much, good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You bet, thank you.","Operator","And we will take a question from Andreas Olia of GBM (1:01:15).","Unknown Speaker","Hello, congrats on the results. Can you give us a little more color regarding how many of the stores that you are closing are owned versus leased?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we don't know exactly which stores it will be, but I don't see any reason for it to be dramatically different than the split of our stores today.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take a question from Sheila Jaywalker (1:01:48) of Jefferies.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","It's actually Randy Konik at Jefferies. Hi, Karen, thanks for taking my question.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Sure.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","I just want to go back to the real estate approach. Since the call is talking about 100 stores but we don't know which stores they are, can you give us some thought process on the approach? Is it an exercise in looking at the density per market? I'm just trying to get a sense of since you identified 100 stores but we don't know what the 100 stores are, I want to get some more color on the approach to what the process was. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The process, we did two very detailed analyses, one, which we've always done, which is how is the store performing and how do we expect it to perform in the future. And we project out cash flows and discount them back and compare that to the proceeds that we would get, so what you would expect to be a typical financial analysis.","What we did this year, though, to supplement that is we went through and looked at all of our locations and evaluated them based on their strategic importance, which had to do with quality of the market, quality of the malls, the competition in the malls and the market, what was happening in terms of growth of income and population in all the markets and coverage that we would need to go forward, and ranked our stores in terms of long-term strategic importance. And so what we've done to come up with this 100 stores is married those two.","And in most cases, as you would imagine, a poorly located store is also an underperformer. And so for the most part, they were both of those, but it did lead us to accelerate some of the closings that in prior years we might not have done without that long-term evaluation of the strategic importance of the location. So that is most of the 100 stores.","There are a few additional locations, though, that have been included that are not strategically critical to the company based on that analysis, but where from a redevelopment opportunity we think there's a big opportunity. So in those cases, they're not underperformers but that long term they're not critical to the Macy's footprint. And so we will be taking advantage of the real estate demand for those locations as well. But I would say most of them are both underperforming and not in good locations for the long term.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","And if I may, is there any type of color or guidepost that we could get around geographic dispersion of those closures?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","They're all over the country. They're over the country.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Is there any concentration where we might see? Because if there are 100 top USA market MSAs and there are 100 door closures, it's most likely not one per MSA, I'm assuming. So I'm just curious if there is any type of \u2013 did the analysis spit out in the Southeast market where this is where we disproportionately have some underperformance where we could reduce exposure to become more profitable? I'm just curious from a geographic...","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Again, we don't have the specific locations. But geographically, they're spread across the country. Because even in high-growth markets, there are malls that aren't strong or areas where we've got duplication. Remember, Macy's is the combination of many companies that we've put together over the years. So it shouldn't be surprising that in some markets, we don't need as many stores as we have.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Got it. I guess my last question is when you think about \u2013 you've obviously done a great job over the years of giving a cost number and hitting that cost number. When you think about the visibility of lack thereof of the top line estimate, is there anything you can point us to, to give us some perspective on what the retention assumption is on the gross versus the net?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, not at this point. We need to work through what stores it's specifically going to be.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Operator","And we will move to Brian Callen of Bank of America.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just one on the real estate optimization and maybe specifically on the asset sales and JV transactions bigger picture that you're looking at. Are those conversations with buyers or partners taking longer than you would have anticipated a year ago? Are there any hang-ups or were there any surprises in the conversations?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","No, as you'd imagine, we'd always like to get things done quicker. But these are big complicated assets, so I would say no. It's pretty much as expected.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then just quickly on the repurchase halt, was that at all driven \u2013 obviously, you said based on your performance in 1Q. But is that at all driven based on the negative outlooks from the rating agencies, or is intent the same in terms of your investment-grade rating and you were just prudently halting the repurchase?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","The intent is completely the same. And again, that's always been the benefit of stock buybacks. You can flex them up and down depending, and we took advantage of that opportunity after the first quarter. But we continue focused on maintaining the investment-grade ratings.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","And we will take a final question from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for the questions, Priya Ohri-Gupta, just a quick one around the expected use of proceeds from some of these asset sales. Do you anticipate, given some of the outlooks from the agencies that Brian recently mentioned the need to pay down some of your upcoming maturities using the proceeds or perhaps proactively looking to reduce some of the maturities that aren't coming due near term? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","We're working hard to get back into our target debt-to-EBITDA range, the 2.5 to 2.8 times, which we're obviously above right now. But we think that that will happen naturally through EBITDA increases and don't at this point anticipate proactive debt repayment. But that doesn't mean we couldn't do it in the future should EBITDA not materialize. But at this point, the use of proceeds will be as you might expect but not proactive debt paydowns, although again, it could happen, and our goal remains to get back into these targeted ranges.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is it your expectation, given the outlook for EBITDA declining this year, getting back to that 2.5 to 2.8 times leverage range as more of a 2017 objective at this point?","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","I can't comment at this point.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","You bet.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue.","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Wonderful. Thanks, everybody.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet","Great. Thank you. Good morning. I'm Karen Hoguet, CFO of Macy's, Inc. And on behalf of our company, I'd like to welcome you to our conference call scheduled to discuss our fourth quarter earnings. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.","2011 was another record year for Macy's, Inc. We are very proud of our team and the momentum we have built up. Our sales grew approximately 5% in comp stores for the second year in a row while increasing the profitability of the company. This results from the combination of great strategies and terrific execution, which has helped us to gain market share.","Our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales increased 80 basis points in 2011, on top of last year's 100-basis-point increase. And we have strategies to increase it further to the 14% to 15% targeted level while continuing to invest in driving top line sales.","We also increased our return on invested capital by 230 basis points in 2011, almost reaching 20%. And our return to investment grade ratings in all agencies speaks to the strength of our balance sheet, our performance, and the sustainability of our strategy. It is great to be entering the new year with so much positive energy throughout our organization.","I will outline the key aspects of our fourth quarter and the full year 2011 performance and then discuss some of our key assumptions for 2012. Sales in the fourth quarter were $8,724,000,000, up 5.5% over last year. And on a comp store basis, our sales in the quarter grew 5.2%.","Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, reflecting a very strong holiday performance. Our sales performance continued to be balanced. We were pleased with our performance at Macy's, as well as at Bloomingdale's, online and in stores. In fact, all regions across the country produced sales growth this year for both the quarter and the full year. All year long, our southern regions across the country performed best, and that continued in the fourth quarter. And the northeast also had strong sales growth in the fourth quarter.","By family of business, we saw strength during the quarter in so many categories, including cosmetics and fragrances, shoes, handbags, watches, men's, textiles, housewares and furniture. And the areas with the most notable weakness in the quarter were the cold weather merchandise areas, junior's and traditional casual women's apparel. Average unit retail in the quarter was up 9%, while transactions were up approximately 1%, and units per transaction down approximately 4%.","For the second half of the year, our average unit retail was up approximately 7%, which is at the high end of the 5% to 7% that we had anticipated. All in all, we did a great job anticipating and planning for the merchandise cost increases that we had experienced.","Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 41%, down 30 basis points from last year. Merchandise margins were flat in the quarter, while we were negatively impacted by the free shipping as expected. Inventory at year end was up 7.5% over a year ago. This is a little higher than the 6% to 7% we had expected due to the decision to keep cold weather merchandise in the stores longer than usual so it would be available for the customer when the weather has historically turned coldest. While you might not know it on the East Coast, winter isn't over yet. And by the end of the first quarter, this merchandise will be gone, and our cost store inventory will be again below expected sales growth.","Also, remember the year-end inventory continued to be impacted by the higher in-transit discussed each quarter in 2011. We've now year-rounded on the change, so it will no longer be a factor as we enter 2012.","In the fourth quarter, SG&A in dollars was $2,314,000,000, or 3% over last year. As a percent of sales, it was 26.6%, down 60 basis points from a year ago. This is better than expected due to various year-end adjustments and lower depreciation relating to the timing of capital expenditures.","Credit profitability in the quarter increased by $59 million over a year ago, which is within the range of what we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. We clearly continue to benefit from the stronger portfolio performance.","At the end of the quarter, we sold 4 store leases to Lord & Taylor that they had been subleasing from us since the 2006 divestiture. We booked a $54 million gain on this sale. Also, in the quarter, we booked $29 million in costs, primarily associated with the announced store closings, of which $22 million was noncash asset impairment charges. The net of these 2 items is the $25 million of income that you see on the P&L.","Interest expense in the quarter was $108 million as expected. The tax rate was 36.6% in the fourth quarter. You'll recall that last year, in the fourth quarter, our tax rate was 35% so the year-over-year comparison in fourth quarter earnings is negatively impacted by the higher tax rate.","Average diluted share count in the quarter was 427.3 million shares. During the quarter, we bought back approximately 8.2 million shares. So since we resumed our stock buyback program during the third quarter, we have bought back a total of 16.4 million shares for approximately $500 million at an average price of $30.57. EPS in the fourth quarter on a diluted basis, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor, was $1.70, well above both expectations and last year.","Our cash flow was also very strong throughout the year in 2011. During the year, operating activities generated $2.1 billion of cash as compared to $1.5 billion last year. Our pension contribution this year was $375 million versus $825 million a year ago. And CapEx was $764 million this year, below the budgeted $800 million dollars, due to the timing of the cash outlay. Cash flow before financing activities was $1.476 billion, up $435 million over a year ago.","In the financing section of the cash flow, you will note the $800 million of debt that we issued in January. Given market conditions, we accessed the market in advance of the approximately $790 million of debt maturing during the first half of 2012, $617 million in March and $173 million in July.","At the end of the year, we had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, or $2 billion excluding the debt issuance which we used to pay down debt. This compares to $1.46 billion at the end of last year.","Our return on invested capital in 2011 was 19.7%, up the 230 basis points over last year that I referred to earlier. And our credit ratios, excluding the impact of the January debt issuance, were well within our targets, with debt to EBITDA at 2.6 relative to our target levels of 2.4 to 2.7 and our EBITDA to interest of 7.1 relative to the range in our target of 6.4 to 6.6. Maintaining credit ratios at least in the target range is very important to us, and you can check our website to the specific calculations.","Let's now move on to 2012. As stated earlier, we expect the momentum to continue. For planning purposes, we are assuming a comp store increase of approximately 3.5% on a 52-week basis. Remember, our retail calendar includes an extra week in January in 2012. So for the full year, our total sales including this extra week are expected to be up approximately 1 point over our comp store sales increase.","Now obviously, in the fourth quarter, given that extra week, we're expecting a much bigger gap, in fact 3.5 points higher total store growth in comp. However, in the first 3 quarters of the year, total sales growth is expected to be slightly below our comp store growth due to the locations that we closed at the end of 2011.","We are planning to open 2 new stores in 2012, both in fact next month. One in Milwaukee and one in Salt Lake City. We are also opening 5 new Bloomingdale's outlets during 2012, bringing the total number to 12.","We are assuming a flattish growth margin rate for the year, although we could have continued pressure from free shipping given the sales growth expected in the omnichannel business. And by the way, this may not be the case in every quarter, but over the course of the year, we do expect the gross margin rate to be flattish.","On the SG&A front, we expect to be able to continue to improve our expense rate as a percent of sales. We expect our income from the credit portfolio to increase approximately $15 million to $20 million during 2012, but we are expecting big variances when we look at the comparison to last year and each quarter. As we start this year, we're expecting a year of strong credit portfolio performance and, therefore, the earnings will be more evenly distributed through the year. This is obviously very different from 2011 when the good news ended up being much more back-end loaded, particularly in the third quarter of 2011.","For the year, we're expecting retirement expense, pension plus SERP, to increase by approximately $65 million, while depreciation is expected to decline approximately $25 million for the year. For interest expense, we're assuming approximately $435 million to $444 million -- I'm sorry, $440 million for the year. And we're assuming an effective tax rate of 36.95% for 2012, although it will vary by quarter. And our CapEx budget for 2012 is $850 million.","In terms of uses of cash, we are now planning to contribute $150 million to the pension plan during the year, and we will pay off the $1.1 billion of debt at maturity. Remember that we, in essence, pre-funded the March and July maturities with the issuance in January, and we have an additional $298 million of debt maturing in January of 2013. With our excess cash, we expect to buy back stock on a regular basis throughout the year, depending on market conditions. We have approximately $1.3 billion of authorization remaining.","So net-net,  we are assuming earnings per share on a diluted basis of $3.25 to $3.30 for 2012. This represents an increase of 13% to 15% over 2011's diluted EPS, excluding store closing costs and the gain on the sale to Lord & Taylor. This does not include any store closing-related costs that we could incur in 2012.","The real headline from today's announcement is the significant back-to-back-to-back improvement in our results over the past 3 years. When we first announced our new strategic direction in 2008 and 2009, we talked about the opportunity we saw to accelerate sales growth and improve overall financial performance. And that is exactly what happened in 2009, 2010, and again in 2011, as our organization has executed superbly and captured market share from our competitors. But as you have heard us say many times, we're not even close to being done. We have in place a whole new set of activities beginning this spring to continue to refine our localization approach within My Macy's and empower our organization to meet the specific needs of customers by location.","We are also forging ahead with experiments and innovations within our omnichannel strategy to serve customer needs in-store, online and via mobile. Not only is this driving sales, but it is also beginning to help us improve the management and velocity of our inventory.","In MAGIC Selling, we are strengthening the coaching process among sales managers and associates on the selling floor so our customer engagement is consistent and leads to more items in her shopping bag. And you will be hearing more about our initiatives to engage millennial customers in more comprehensive and powerful ways as we sharpen our focus on what is now America's largest and most diverse generation.","We feel very good about our prospects in 2012 to strengthen our business at both Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We also feel very good about the groundwork we are laying now for continued growth beyond 2012. The results we are generating are very real, and the momentum in our business has our organization ready to take the company to the next level of success.","And so now, what questions can I answer?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of store to door right now, how many stores are on that program? What's the pace at which they'll be ramping? And what's the opportunity available?","Karen M. Hoguet","23 stores were available this fall for us to be able to ship from a different store to the customer directly. And in 2012, that number, by the fall season, should reach approximately 290. Obviously, big success this fall, and we think it's going to be a big opportunity for continued growth.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then in-store, obviously, MAGIC Selling training has been a huge success. Can you talk about online customer service?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. Actually, to the fourth quarter this year, that was a very big priority. But frankly, we have been disappointed with some of the service issues the year before. And we think we did a much better job, the customer service scores improved significantly. And so we'll continue to work both in making the site easier to navigate and also make sure that we have the customer service backed up when there are questions or issues that come up.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, it sounds like the holiday season overall exceeded your plan. What were the key drivers?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it always starts with the sales line. And when you can achieve sales growth over 5%, that's always obviously a great thing. We invested in certain ways to achieve that sales growth in the selling floor and some of the support functions in our stores, in marketing and obviously, also, the investment in store fulfillment. And it clearly all paid off in terms of the sales that we got.","Operator","We'll go next to Liz Dunn with Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess in terms of getting to the 14% to 15% EBITDA margin, can you talk about -- I'm assuming most of that will come from leverage on continued strong sales. And then in terms of your 3.5% comp growth for 2012, can you talk about how price will play into that?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, in terms of how we're going to get to the 14% to 15%, you're right, a lot of that will be leveraged from sales growth. We also are working to reduce expense where we can in areas that obviously won't impact the sales that we're generating. Also, we see opportunities for gross margin rate as we go forward, both from markdown optimization that we've been working on and also as we are able to improve the inventory turn through our omnichannel strategy, that should help gross margin rate over time as well. Not in 2012 necessarily, but as we go farther out. So we feel good about that.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then looking at the direct-to-consumer business, I think you said about $2 billion is what you're looking for, for 2012 or is that just over $2 billion? Because it looks like, with the growth that you had for 2011, that would suggest a little bit of a slowdown in the growth rate. Can you help us think about how that...","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. No, we do expect it to be more than $2 billion. And hopefully, it will continue to grow at the pace that it is. Obviously, it's a pretty high rate to continue, but we do expect it to be more than the $2 billion.","Operator","And we'll go next to Steve Kernkraut with Berman Capital.","Steven J. Kernkraut - Berman Capital Management LP","I guess I had just one question, just on the e-commerce business as well. The way -- what impact does the growth of e-commerce business have on the overall inventory, where the inventory is up 7.5%? You would think it would be able to grow less because so much of that online inventory is centralized in your distribution  centers.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, the inventory turns for the online business are significantly higher than the store. And one of the things that we're doing as we enable the 290 stores to ship to the customer directly will be the ability to supplement online sales using store inventory, which, based on our tests, we think will be a big contributor to sales in 2012 and beyond. So we...","Steven J. Kernkraut - Berman Capital Management LP","Yes. I mean, I would think as time goes on, that your sales should be able to grow at a much faster rate than your inventory.","Karen M. Hoguet","That's the expectation, Steve. It will be having -- utilizing our inventory better, whether it be in the warehouses or in stores.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As we think about omnichannel and CapEx, what CapEx initiative is involved in omnichannel? And what do you see that achieving the operating margin or EBIT margin goals going forward? Does it happen faster, in 2 years, what's your sense?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think we will be investing in technology and omnichannel for a long time to come. There's different pieces to it. There's a small piece that relates to the store fulfillment. There's a bigger piece that relates to building incremental warehousing space. As you know, we're opening our next big mega center in West Virginia this year. So that's a big chunk. And there's a lot being spent in terms of software development to improve the site itself. But we will be continuing to invest in that, plus store technology as we go forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Nomura.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Karen, can you maybe share with us what your specific assumptions are for how e-com factors into that 3.5% comp guidance? And then just wondering if you can maybe talk about whether you have any new specific initiatives on the e-com side of the business that will act as a tailwind this year.","Karen M. Hoguet","We don't break out that as part of our planning to disclose -- sorry, I can't give you that number. And in terms of improvement in e-commerce, a lot of it will have to do with the merchandising on the site and getting greater alignment with the stores. So I think that will be a big chunk of it. And obviously, continuing to try to make the site easier to navigate.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Will you be increasing the merchandise available online, stuff that you wouldn't necessarily have in your stores?","Karen M. Hoguet","We do some of that. But more of what we're trying to do is actually increase the alignment with the stores.","Operator","And we'll go next to Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on -- go back to Steve's question earlier on site to store to door and the comp. Do you expect that 3.5% comp to be consistent throughout the year? Or do you expect it to be back-end weighted? Because I'd imagine, if Nordstrom's any bit of a playbook for us, you would expect a pretty big comp lift as you get to 290 stores towards the end of the year.","Karen M. Hoguet","At this point, I would say it's relatively even through the year by quarter in terms of the expectation. But there's always hope that as we get to 290 stores, it does what we think it could do. And obviously, that would help comps as we go through the year.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then you've always talked about this 14% to 15% EBITDA target for longer-term goals. But it appeared to me that there's a lot of opportunity, and you kind of alluded to it on the gross profit margin line with inventory productivity, as well as sales efficiency as you get more of your business online to maybe exceed that. I mean, have you guys thought about that as your -- as part of your long-term planning?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, I thought about it, Steve. I don't see that we'll exceed it. I mean, there's always that possibility. But remember, we're also trying to invest for growth, so you've got to balance it all. So I think, getting to 14%, I can see pretty easily. Getting to 15%, frankly, will be more challenging. And if I were you, I would not count on getting above the 15%. Again, not that it won't happen, but it'll be a ways out is my guess.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick question here. The past couple of quarters, you've bought back I think 16 million shares, and I know that there's some level of buybacks in your guidance. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of sense for what you guys are thinking as part of the $3.25 to $3.30 EPS for you.","Karen M. Hoguet","We're not making out exactly what we've assumed in terms of the buyback. But you should get a sense of what we've been doing. And the idea, it's just part of the story. We're going to take our excess cash and buy back stock.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michelle Clark with Morgan Stanley.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Karen, you mentioned the 53rd week impact. Can you just detail for us what you're expecting in terms of the EPS lift in the fourth quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. Actually, Michelle, we really aren't breaking it out. It's sort of a complicated calculation. Obviously, adds a lot to sales, and it's a very profitable week as you might imagine. But we are not giving specific guidance as to the EPS impact.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then your comp outlook for 2012 of 3.5%, I'm guessing that, that assumes no pick up from any disruption related to J. C. Penney?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we'll have to see how that plays out. Our best assumption right now is the 3.5%, and we'll see.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Karen, I was wondering or hoping that you could update us on price optimization, when we should expect to see that impact your gross margin and top line results.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. My guess is we'll continue to experiment this year. It's proven to be a little more complicated than we originally thought. But initial tests are looking good. So my guess is we're probably talking about back half of '13.","Operator","We'll go next to Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Karen, just specifically on some of the merchandise weakness. Obviously very strong performance on many categories, but we can understand the cold weather items. Just maybe if you could share some specific initiatives to kind of help turn junior's and that traditional casual women's business around.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, I think on the casual women's traditional business, I think that's been a business that's been weak throughout the industry. It's not just a Macy's issue. And we have retooled some of the private brands that are in that area. And interestingly, initial selling on that is looking very strong. So we have some hope that in 2012, that business will continue. In the case of junior's, it's a very competitive marketplace. As I alluded a few minutes ago, we've spent a lot of time this year evaluating our strategies for the millennial customer, which include sort of 2 categories: the younger millennial, which is the junior customer; and also the older millennial, where today, frankly, we see a lot of white space and opportunity for us. And I think as we move on, we'll see improvement in that business as well.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a question on the fourth quarter margins. I mean, obviously, impressive flat margin -- merchandise margins given the holiday season, but if you connect the fact that inventory, a little bit heavier at quarter end, and your comment that maybe not every quarter we should see flat margins, could we see some pressure in the first quarter based on some overhang coming out of the fourth?","Karen M. Hoguet","There's really no overhang coming out of the fourth. As you might imagine, we take the markdowns when they're needed. That doesn't mean there won't be pressure in the first quarter by the way, but it's for different reasons.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the different reasons?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, no, I mean, it just has to do with the promotional nature of the first quarter. But again, we've talked about flattish margins, but we did not come out of the quarter with significant overhang.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, can you elaborate on My Macy's? And looking forward, additional layers of opportunity here, I think you've talked to the My Macy's initiative now in the fourth or fifth inning. So just looking for any color on the second half game plan here.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, the key thing as you think about My Macy's, 3 things are happening. One is the people in jobs have been there longer, and so they're getting better and better at not only understanding the opportunities in their markets, but also communicating with the central merchants to make them happen. So I think the more time in job the district people have had, the better the 2-way communication is happening. The second thing is that we continue to find new opportunities as we study markets in a more refined way, whether it be differences in the tourist customer in different markets, whether it be new strategies. For example, the need for cold summer assortments in places like the Pacific Northwest or Southern living strategies sort of across Atlanta and the Southeast. So the second point is that we're continuing to find new opportunities strategically as we look at market-by-market. And then the third point I would make is that we took a lot of time this summer and went back and surveyed all the store managers like we had done back in '06, which was the beginning of My Macy's, to try to understand how we could improve it further. And we have -- I think it's roughly 13 initiatives that our teams are busily working on to even make it work better. So a combination of those 3 factors, Matt, makes me feel really good that there's still a lot more to come from My Macy's.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wow, that's great. And then on the product side, you mentioned a little bit around private label. But can you speak to current and some upcoming initiatives which in the stores that we should keep our eyes on? I guess, particularly the Charter Club relaunch and any other category-specific noteworthy changes to just keep our eyes open for.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. No, I think there's a lot that's gone on in the women's apparel area, the Charter Club redo, or refresh is probably a better word. The Bar III launch has been terrific in the impulse arena. And we've recently launched a new active line, Ideology, which just looks spectacular, and we think will be an important part not only in the millennial strategy but also for older women as well.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On the SG&A and the credit portfolio tailwind, I think you gave some numbers in the prepared remarks. Looking at 2012, is there assumption that it will sort of flattish? Or do you think that, that portfolio can keep getting better, even below pre-recession levels?","Karen M. Hoguet","Is your question, credit?","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Karen M. Hoguet","I'm sorry. Yes, we had said that we expect there to be continued improvement in the credit profitability for us of $15 million to $20 million for the year.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm sorry. Okay. And then on the inventory store to door, I know you said that, that should improve turns because it's a centralized inventory. But if the sale that you're missing that's in the store and not in the centralized inventory, is that just a size? Or is that something that you didn't have in the centralized inventory? Because you did say you were going to make the inventory more like each other.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think the key thing is as you think about shipping merchandise from stores, the logic that will be built into the system as of this summer, which is consistent with the rollouts of the 290 stores, is that there will be a logic build-in that will pull the inventory from the store least likely to sell the goods. So it's frankly a markdown that would have happened had we not sold it as opposed to a lost sale. It's really quite cool if it works properly. And there'll also be a faster build-in for distance to customer. But the compelling part of the logic, the key driving factor, will be where the goods are selling through the slowest to pull it from those stores.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, understood. And then sorry to beat this horse a little more, but on the credit side, realizing you gave the number, the $20 million, but are you assuming that you go to better charge-offs and delinquency ratios than you had? And is that something that can keep going?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, the price portfolio continues to improve, but the major adjustments that happened in 2011 is done. But we don't expect it to deteriorate from where we are.","Operator","We'll go next to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple  questions. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the renovation plans for Herald Square and the time frame that, that will occur, and whether any disruption in sales are expected this year. And then secondly, we talked about some of the challenging areas from a merchandising front. But clearly, the drivers have been in the accessories, men's and part of the home area. Are you counting on those areas to outperform once again in 2012?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, let me answer the second question first and I'll go back to Herald Square. Obviously, we're expecting the businesses that have been doing well to continue to do well. And our hope is that we could also layer in a stronger of the casual traditional women's apparel as well. So in part, we think the momentum will continue to build as a result. In terms of Herald Square, there's really nothing more to report. We continue to expect to spend about $400 million over the next 4 years. And yes, we're factoring in some disruptions, although we frankly don't think it's going to be tremendous. But we continue to be extraordinarily excited about what we're going to be able to create here.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Are you seeing any changes in tourist traffic in the last 2 or 3 months?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't believe so, David.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Why don't you -- if you could tell us what the private label and branded exclusive penetration was for the latest fiscal year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I don't have it in front of me, Jeff, but I think it's still around the 20% for the private label and north of 40% for the limited distribution.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. And how about -- back to your capital spending budget for a moment. What percent of your budget will be IT-related this year compared to prior year?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't know that offhand, but my suspicion is it's fairly similar to prior years. We've been investing for a long time in omnichannel, as well as improving our core systems.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Got it. And I know, in each of the last 2 years, and this relates to SG&A, you've invested in the MAGIC Selling. Is it going to be similar in terms of the dollars you're going to spend to that effort in 2012? And then maybe you could address the issue of marketing spend year-on-year.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I believe that we will continue to invest in the MAGIC Selling at a comparable ratio -- amount that we've spent in recent years. And in terms of marketing, we're planning a flattish rate. So dollars will go up, rate will not.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bob Drbul of Barclays Capital.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Joan Payson standing in for Bob today. And just 2 questions, in terms of next year on that 3.5% comp. If possible, could you provide some sort of additional color on the AUR assumptions there?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, we expect the AUR to continue to increase, particularly in the first half of the year. A specific amount, I can't really tell. It's hard to forecast.","Joan Payson - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the Bloomingdale's outlets, just looking at how those have been performing and sort of what you're targeting for store number penetration in the long term.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, we're still developing how many we can add, so it's hard to answer. At the end of this year, we expect to have 12, and it will grow from there. How many we ultimately have, I just don't know at this point.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","As you begin to plan your inventory for the back half, just knowing that you're coming up against a 7% increase in AUR, how are you thinking about unit velocity and growth versus pricing as you come up against that very difficult comparison?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, obviously, we're spending a lot of time -- last year, we spent a lot of time thinking about the unit plans, given the price increases that we experienced for the first time in recent history. Now we're spending as much time thinking about what do you do the second year. So it's being thought through category-by-category, much like we did last year. And hopefully, our planning will pay off as well this coming fall as it did this year.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then as far as your credit penetration, does the guidance that you gave for credit income assume an increase in that? And what are your strategies around growing that this year?","Karen M. Hoguet","It actually doesn't. It actually assumes a slight decline, which is what we've been experiencing. In 2012, our penetration of credit was roughly 47.3%, down about 50 basis points from the year before. Part of that, we think, relates to the challenges with the new account approval that relates to a lot of the regulations coming out of Washington. I think also, as our market share is growing, we've got a lot more customers in our store who don't yet have a Macy's card. We hope to change that. But to some degree, it also relates to the new account approval process. It also appears as if some of our customers are deleveraging and using debit cards more than their Macy's credit card. And then obviously, the strength in the tourist business that we've been seeing, where customers tend not -- especially the international tourists -- tend not to have our credit cards, impacts us in some of the big tourist locations like Herald Square, Union Square, Florida, et cetera. But we -- so we are assuming it to be down slightly next year.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions in the queue at this time.","Karen M. Hoguet","Great. Well, thank you all very much. And if you have other questions as the day goes on, just let us know.","Operator","Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"13855":["Macy's, Inc.

Welcome to Macy\u2019s Incorporated Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead."," ","Karen Hoguet","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Macy\u2019s conference call scheduled to discuss our second quarter performance. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited.","A replay of the call will be available on our website www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company\u2019s most recently filed Form 10-K.","The key metrics for the second quarter performance include a 4% comp sales increase on an owned plus license basis, a 30-basis point increase in EBIT as a percent of sales and an 11% increase in earnings per share on a diluted basis. Those together make for a good quarter and we are in line with what we expected.","While our stronger sales performance in the quarter was in part due to the shift in the timing of the friends and family event at the beginning of the quarter, we were pleased that the tone of our business in the second quarter improved relative to the first quarter.","However, we weren't able to make up the sales shortfall from the first quarter. However, given the improved trend in the second quarter and our fall holiday strategies, we feel good about the back half of the year and did not change our sales expectations for the fall.","We did lower our guidance for the full-year to a comp increase of approximately 1.5% to 2% for the full-year, which incorporates the spring's season actual results. On an owned plus license basis, the annual comp is expected to be 2% to 2.5%. The good news is, that in spite of the lower sales guidance, we're comfortable maintaining our annual EPS guidance of $4.40 to $4.50.","Let's talk about the second quarter and then we'll move on to our key planning assumptions for the fall season. Sales in the second quarter were $6,267 million or up 3.3% over last year. Comp sales increased 3.4% in the quarter and on an owned plus license basis, comp sales were up 4%.","As I said, we are pleased with our results overall and we were particularly pleased with the continued strength in the center core categories, especially handbags, the good performance of our back-to-school businesses, including junior, Impulse, Active and kids and the rebound in our Furniture and Mattress business after a tough first quarter.","The weaker categories in the second quarter included both, women's and men's sportswear as well as non-athletic shoes.","Geographically, sales continued to be strongest in the South, particularly in Southern California and Texas. There are also individual stores in the North that also performed well, most notably Herald Square. We continued to be very pleased with the customer reaction to the remodeled areas of our flagship store.","Average unit retail was up 1.5% in the second quarter and the number of transactions was up 2.7% with the units per transaction down 0.3% or essentially flat. However given the shift in the friends and family event, it's more representative to look at these metrics with the two quarters combined.","For those six months, the average unit retail was up 0.7%, the number of transactions was up 0.5% and units per transaction up 0.4%. While we had hoped that the number of transactions what have increased more, we were pleased with the balance performance.","Bloomingdales had a stronger second quarter as well as Macy's, and the Internet-generated demand continues to grow rapidly and we believe that will continue, particularly now that we have rolled out Buy Online Pickup in Store, which some people refer to as click and collect, to all the Macy's and Bloomingdales stores.","We haven't even marketed this capability yet, and we are already finding that many customers like this option. Once in the store, these customers are often buying other items as well. It's really premature to provide color on how it's being used by customers or how big it could become, but hopefully as the fall season moves on, we will understand better how it's being used and its potential.","We are excited though by what we have seen so far and expect it to be a help in the holiday selling season. Omnichannel strategies are clearly enabling us to accelerate growth and we are just at the early stages of exploring all the opportunities.","The gross margin rate for the second quarter was 41.4%, down 40 basis points from last year. The merchandise margin rate was down approximately 30 basis points in the quarter and the impact of delivery expense lowered the margin rate further. For the spring season as a whole, the gross margin rate was flat which is in line with our annual guidance at the beginning of the year of a flat to down slightly gross margin rate. We feel good with where we ended the quarter with inventory being 1% over last year or 2% higher than last year on a comp basis.","SG&A in the quarter was $2,024 million, up 1.3% over last year and as a percentage sales expense was 70 basis points below last year. Relative to last year, we benefited from approximately $40 million lower retirement related expense and savings from the restructure that we completed a year end. These both helped to offset our ongoing investment in Omnichannel strategies and technology.","Credit income was also favorable in the quarter to last year by $6 million, reflecting continued strength in our portfolio. Operating income was $571 million in the quarter or 7% above last year. As a rate to sales, operating income was 9.1%, up 30 basis points over a year ago.","Interest expense in the quarter was $100 million and tax expense $179 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 37.9%, which is 200 basis points over the rate last year, due to the timing of some settlements. This higher rate cost us approximately $0.250 cents per share relative to last year in the quarter.","We still expect though that the annual effective tax rate will be 36.4%, but as you know this tax rate is very hard to predict by quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $292 million and diluted share count was $365.4 million shares, therefore earnings per share, on a diluted basis, was $0.80, which is up 11% over last year.","Cash provided by operating activities net of investing activities in the first half of the year was $358 million, which is $10 million higher than last year. We issued $500 million of debt earlier this year and we repaid $454 million of debt in the second quarter. We also bought back 8.9 million shares of common stock for approximately $517 million in the quarter and we have repurchased 16.3 million shares for approximately $949 million year-to-date.","The earnings and cash flow were strong in the first half of the year in spite of the lower than expected sales. We are confident in our strategies for the fall season. As a result, we did not reduce our regional sales expectations. We are expecting comp sales of 2% to 3% for the fall and the license businesses should add 20 basis points to 30 basis points to their comp growth in the back half of the year.","Earnings per share on a diluted basis for the fall season, the combination of Q3 and Q4 is expected to be $3.04 to $3.14, which would then result in annual guidance of 440 to 450 for the full-year.","Here are a few additional planning assumptions to help you with your models. One, we expect the third quarter comp sales to be lower than the comp sales in the fourth quarter given the last year's strengthened third quarter and a tougher fourth quarter. Two, our total sales growth in the back half of the year is expected to be approximately 30 basis points lower than the comp growth due, to lower outside revenue from our private brand merchandise. Three, we expect gross margin rate to be flat-to-down slightly for the season, as well as for the year. Four, we are still expecting depreciation and amortization of $1,040 million for the full-year. Five, the effective tax rate is still projected at 36.4%. Six, interest expense is also still projected at approximately $390 million. Seven, as in prior years, we are not including in our guidance any store closing related costs or asset impairment charges that could incur at year end.","As Terry said in today's news release, our outlook for the fall season reflects our confident optimism tempered with the reality that many customers still are feeling the impact of an economic environment that at best is improving very gradually Macy's and Bloomingdales are doing what it takes to win with the customer and that includes delivering newness in our merchandise assortment creating excitement with terrific marketing, deploying new dimensions in technology and helping our customers stretch their dollars with great value. These elements and many others are wrapped up in our MOM strategies, My Macy's, Omnichannel and Magic Selling.","We have learned that our success is greatest when we do things big and when we emphasize great brands to draw customers to Macy's and Bloomingdales. Example include, making Macy's America's destination for handbags. The development of our powerful active strategy and all we are doing our business with Millennial customers.","We continue to grow our business with major, most wanted brands through increased collaboration and innovation. I am talking about brands like Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Est\u00e9e Lauder and (Inaudible). It is brands like these that truly differentiate our assortments.","Behind the scenes, we are also managing expense prudently, so we can continue to invest to advance the progress in our core strategies. We are taking a more holistic view of inventory, so we can effectively and efficiently fulfill customer demand from all directions.","We are applying our $1 billion-plus annual CapEx budget to projects that will continue to build our infrastructure for growth. We have made a lot of progress. Take a look back at our financial report for the first half of 2007, the period before the recession hit.","First half 2014 sales are well above the level of 2007, our operating income has nearly doubled, even when you factor out the last of the May company integration costs. We have actually lowered her SG&A even on the dollar basis.","We have maintained our gross margin level even though factors like free shipping hadn't yet entered the equation back in 2007, and our earnings per share of more than quadrupled. This demonstrates the resilience of our business and it underscores the ability of the Macy's Inc. team to manage change effectively, so that we gross sales profitably.","Best of all, our team continues to approach each fall season with a level of anticipation and genuine excitement that is greater than the year before. Our level of adrenaline has not let up. The holiday season is when we shine. I hope you will be watching us closely this fall in store, online, on mobile and across these channels. We believe you will continue to be impressed by what we are able to accomplish.","I will stop now and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Paul Swinand of Morningstar.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just real quickly so I understand on the SG&A, was just the $1 increase, is that all the marketing shift and I am just trying to think longer term. You just said that you have got lower SG&A on a dollar basis than when you would - can that kind of continue to leverage or hold steady for the long-term without increasing the store base?","Karen Hoguet","I am not sure I understand the questions, but we feel very good about the fact that in the quarter we were able to reduce our SG&A as a percent of sales by 70 basis points, even while investing in growth. We will continue to do what we can to control expense, but we are investing in the future at the same time.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Is that investment more in the marketing and the online\u2026","Karen Hoguet","Well, it's really more technology and building the Omnichannel strategies, delivery, expense, things like that Buy Online Pickup in Store, all of the new initiatives that we are doing to help the customer find new ways of shopping and engaging with Macy's.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Okay. Thank you. Then quickly on the handbags, is that still a very promotional area? Obviously, a lot of a lot of other stores do well in that area. Why do you think you will be better with this new initiative?","Karen Hoguet","No, no. We have been doing spectacularly in handbags for a long time and I do think we are the market leader. I think it's a combination of terrific brands, the online in-store presence, the display we have -in-store, the sales associates in store, we are just very strong in that area, but that's not new. That's been the case.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar","Great. Thanks again and best of luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Charles Grom of Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Hi, Charles.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Just again on the SG&A, a lot of the components, the retirement expense, the savings from other store closings and the credit was basically the same as the first quarter, yet to Paul's question you were up $25 million, you were down $41 million. In this quarter, you were down $41 million in the first quarter. Can you just help us a little bit on the technology spend, how much was it in the second quarter relative to the first quarter?","Karen Hoguet","The difference, Chuck, is the fact that the sales grew more, so the sales variable expense are going to be higher in the quarter when you have in terms of dollars when have 4% sales growth.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay, so there is no major change 2Q versus 1Q\u2026","Karen Hoguet","Correct.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Then just merchandise margins down like you said about 30 basis points in the quarter. They were up 15, I think, in the first quarter, yet you had a better comp. Could you just flush out the delta. It's great to see inventory levels\u2026","Karen Hoguet","The trick is we were flat for the season, which is consistent with what we had told people, so I think stick with our guidance and again a flat gross margin rate for the quarter is what we had expected.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. Then any early thoughts on back-to-school so far?","Well, the end of the second quarter back-to-school was extremely strong at the start will see as it goes through the season, but we feel very good about it. Our Junior's business, we really think now has turned around and has been terrific. Kids did well, active is on fire, finished line doing very, we are. Hopefully that will continue through the third quarter.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","All right great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Lejuez of Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Thanks. Hey, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Morning, Paul.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Morning. Just wondering if there were any particular categories that you actually saw more gross margin pressure this quarter versus those that might have been stronger. Also wondering just about your performance from a top-line and gross margin perspective, when you were running friends and family versus the periods that weren't. Thanks.","Karen Hoguet","You know something, I don't look at it that way. Again, we look at the promotional strategy in total and what does that do for the quarter, I am not sure I can help you with that question.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Got you, and how should we think about gross margin third quarter versus fourth quarter. We heard your guidance for the second half as a whole. You gave us some color on what to expect on the sales line third quarter versus fourth quarter\u2026","Karen Hoguet","Well, it's hard to forecast by quarter, so I don't anticipate any major swing, but that doesn't mean there won't be any and I would just urge you to think about the season as a whole and the years as a whole.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you. Good luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Binetti of UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Just with everything we have seen and we have heard a number of people saying at a minimal level promotions in the quarter were definitely high still to get the consumer in the door. Can you talk to us if you guys have changed your view at all on how promotion you need to approach the market in the second half of the year based on just update your thinking for the second quarter.","Karen Hoguet","I can't remember a time when it wasn't promotional, so I don't see anything different in the second quarter of the fall season. This is a very promotional business. Our customer very much wants value and very much responds to promotions, so I don't see a change happening there, but it's very promotional. Maybe could you help us think about what might have driven the acceleration in AUR in the quarter versus what we saw on the first quarter?","Karen Hoguet","I think that's why I said focus on the two quarters together, because I think that's a more representative time period. ","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay. Then just lastly, could you help us think about where we are as far as the run rate on the cost savings that you announced earlier in year. How much of that is going through the P&L right now?","Karen Hoguet","That's going to run through all year.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Is it up to the full amount of savings at this point there is nothing incremental to come in the back half from that?","Karen Hoguet","That's correct.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay.","Karen Hoguet","But it's still (Inaudible).","Michael Binetti - UBS","Right. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul of Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Hi, Karen. Good morning .","Karen Hoguet","Hi, Bob. Good morning.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","The first question is when you think about the Omnichannel initiative, are radiated sales from Buy Online Pickup in Store, are they impacting certain categories more than other categories?","Karen Hoguet","I think, they are, but I think it's happening, it's just too early to say, Bob. Give us a little more time with that. We have only had it rolled out to off-stores for a couple of weeks now and I said we really haven't even marketed, so I think we need to wait and see.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Okay. Then as you look at - you didn't change the sales expectations for the back half of the year. Are there some product launches or categories that you are excited about or new products, or new brands that you are excited about that you are looking forward for Macy's to have overall?","Karen Hoguet","I think there are, but I don't want our competitors that they are, so I think should just leave it there.","If you look at the second quarter, the run rate in the second quarter is consistent with what we are expecting for the fall, so there is this misperception that we are expecting this huge increase in sales in the [fund] that's not the case.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Got it. Okay. Then last question just the Bloomingdales outlet business. Can you just talk a little bit sort of about the learning there, the updated thoughts around the opportunity and how that business is perform for you?","Karen Hoguet","Yes. I mean, I think we are feeling better about it. The performance is good and we are beginning to develop real estate plans to expand it further.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thank you very much, Karen.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Hey, good morning Karen. Just a couple of ones real quick. First of all, Bloomingdales versus Macy's, which segment of business was stronger in the quarter?","Karen Hoguet","Bloomingdales has had a strong quarter just like Macy's.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. As far as kind of the pattern of sales during the quarter, what we've been hearing now for about a year is that during special events, fourth of July and Mother's Day and so forth that that's when the customer comes in. Then there was kind of a low in between special events. Are you seeing that in your business. Did you see that in the second quarter?","Karen Hoguet","Well, you always get more traffic when you are promoting, but relative to our plan I would say no, Jeff. I mean, but you are always going to have less traffic when you are not doing a major promotion, but it's as we would have expected.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","What I meant was do you have more challenges getting customers to come in and shop during kind of the low periods.","Karen Hoguet","No more so than usual.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. Final question is just a clarification on the SG&A. You mentioned a $40 million of savings from retirement and was it retirement store closings, so 40?","Karen Hoguet","No. The $40 million is the retirement.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. How about store closing, store restructuring?","Karen Hoguet","Well, it's the amount that we had said we would save at the end of the year. We didn't break it out by quarter.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","It was $100 million for the year?","Karen Hoguet","For the year.","Jeff Stein - Northcoast Research","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks so much, Karen. Just so I understand the SG&A savings that would benefit the second half of the year. The $40 million savings on the pension and $100 million on the store closing those were both, annual figures. Correct?","Karen Hoguet","The $40 million, no, that's in the quarter, so we had said we would save approximately $150 million for the full-year on the retirement side.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thank you for that clarification, and that you are expecting to flow fairly evenly quarter-by-quarter in the back half?","Karen Hoguet","Yes.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. We were wondering about the shift in merchandise margin. Obviously Q1 was up Q2 was down and the net of which was basically flat in line with your expectations. Was that shift simply the friends and family shift or did you feel like the business was a little bit more promotional outside of the shifting around for friends and family\u2026","Karen Hoguet","No. I don't think it's the impact of friends and family and all. I mean, think it's partially as you recall at the end of the first quarter, we did not clear the inventory as rapidly, because we were waiting for the warm weather day hit, so some of those markdowns were shifted into the second quarter. Again, the spring season was consistent with what we had expected. The timing just changed a little bit.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Great. The inventory here coming out of Q2 was looking fairly lean and running below your second half sales target, do you feel comfortable that you have got enough inventory to drive that 2% to 3% growth you're looking for in the back half of the year?","Karen Hoguet","Yes. We do.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thanks, Karen.","Operator","Next question is from Oliver Chen of Citi.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Thanks, Karen. Regarding the gross margin guidance for flat to down slightly, is the main driver there merchandise margin as you look forward. Also, if you could just comment a little bit on the Millennial strategies and which ones, which efforts would you prioritize in terms of driving the ongoing progress there, that would be great?","Karen Hoguet","Yes. I mean, the merchandise margins, I think, should be flat-ish, maybe down slightly and then you have got the delivery expenses being the two factors that are impacting the year-to-year comparisons. In total, we expect the gross margins as I have said to be flat to down slightly.","In terms of the Millennial, at this point, our strategies are working well. I am thrilled with the progress in the junior arena, the continued very high growth in Impulse, which is the older Millennial that's and apparel component cosmetics, shoes, handbags et cetera. Also, in fact, here is the component in home now, so we are feeling very good about our efforts to attract that sort of older Millennial customer.","Kids has done well as well as on the men's side, so you know at least in the second quarter and hopefully ongoing, we shall go to that all components.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Thank you. Just as a follow-up, in your comments in your press release and in the call about the customer still not feeling comfortable about spending more, does that change the way in which you work with vendors you as you develop an exclusive proprietary kind of product and how you think about planning product with the vendors given this environment?","Karen Hoguet","I don't think it really changes it. I mean, you know the customers today are looking for great, new, fashion and products at a great value, but that really hasn't changed all that dramatically but obviously we are constantly looking to work with our vendors in new ways, looking for innovative ideas. Again, the good news is, I think, we and the major brands are working very effectively together on these strategies.","Oliver Chen - Citi","Thank you. Best regards.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Lorraine.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","You were able to maintain your full-year EPS guidance even though you lowered the comp, so can you talk about were cost issues or what changed to the back half view that allowed you to keep the range where it was?","Karen Hoguet","Well, I think it's the expense performance in the first half as well as our plans for the second, so the sales came was lower, the margins stayed the same, so it's the expense that is enabling us to do that.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Can you help us understand the underlying second quarter comp trend? What was impact from the calendar shift that started off the quarter? Also, just to clarify your back-to-school comments, which I believe you said were strong. Was there a recent acceleration in the comp trend over the last few weeks?","Karen Hoguet","I was committing only on the quarter. We will talk about the third quarter when we finish the third quarter, but we feel good about the back-to-school business. As I said, all the components were doing well, are doing well.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Okay. What was the impact from the calendar shift?","Karen Hoguet","You know, it's hard - the only shift is the change in timing and friends and family.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Right.","Karen Hoguet","We are not quantifying it, but is obviously significant enough that we had called it out at the beginning of the year.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Okay. I know you mentioned that Macy's and Bloomingdales, both had sold quarters. Just when you look at your Macy's business, however, are there any callouts or can you compare\/contrast your how your higher end brands are performing versus opening price points? Do you see any differences there?","Karen Hoguet","Not really.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Hey, Matt.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","As we think about the bottom-line opportunity here, are you still comfortable with 14% EBITDA as a goal and would we need to macro improvement to start to move toward 15% over time?","Karen Hoguet","We are still comfortable with 14% and we have taken 15% out of our discussion, so I don't think 15% is going to be possible at this point given the investments making to grow the business, so if I were you, all I would think the 14% and yes we will get there and we are making progress, but I don't think we will get to 15%.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Okay. Then as we think about the\u2026","Karen Hoguet","By the way you wouldn't want us to get to 15%, because it would require not investing in the business the way I think we should to get to get the growth.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Got it. Then as we think about the competitive backdrop, as you think about online, any changes that you have seen with Amazon or others? Then anything with the off-price channel, is there anything you can do pricing perspective that you think you need to do to maintain the value proposition?","Karen Hoguet","Yes. I mean, we have really have not seen much change in the competition, but we are constantly looking at value. Obviously, value relative to the off-price channel becomes relevant, so yes we are looking at that, Matt, but don't really have anything to update you on.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Best of luck.","Karen Hoguet","The next question is from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Hi, Dena.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Hi. You talked a little bit about you are in the early stages of exploring the Omni opportunity. How do you see that going forward in the investment spend that you are making and what benefits should we see given it seems like it's helping in terms of top-line, helping in terms of driving sales. Lastly, as you think about the core categories that performed well and the rebounding in furniture and mattresses, was that rebound in furniture and mattress is big ticket, was it the weather improved when you got them out there? How did you see it? Thank you.","Karen Hoguet","There's a lot of questions there. I think the Omni opportunity is first and foremost sales growth, but what we are also finding is that this gross margin opportunity as well as turnover opportunity from again better coordinating across the company and looking at inventory across channels as well as marketing across channels, so I actually see it as a huge opportunity across the whole P&L and balance sheet and very exciting.","In terms of the businesses had improved, I don't think it's weather-related. I just think that, again, I can't tell you what happened to big ticket in the first quarter, but it certainly rebounded in the second and we feel better about that going forward.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Liz Dunn of Macquarie Capital.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie Capital","Hi. Good morning.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie Capital","I am interested in the Herald Square renovation. Obviously, it's still ongoing and will take a few years, but so far it looks like the parts of the store that you have renovated look terrific. I was just wondering, is the outperformance that you saw in the quarter from Herald Square that you called out was that specific to those departments that have been renovated or can you just give us any more color there?","Karen Hoguet","Yes. I mean, the good news is, the areas that are renovated are obviously seeing the biggest pickup, but we are seeing in the areas that were completed earlier, we continue to see outsized growth, so after they, year-end, continue to do better. Obviously once people are in the store, they are buying in other areas as well, so we are seeing strength across which is really exciting.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie Capital","Great. I am also interested in your efforts to sort of specifically market to consumers via digital methods. How sophisticated are your digital marketing efforts in customizing a message for consumers based on purchase history or even when they log on to give them a specific homepage? What are you doing to improve those areas?","Karen Hoguet","I would say that today we are very sophisticated relative to our peers, however we are constantly investing and looking to hire talent to even accelerate those efforts, because we do believe it's very important for competing effectively going forward, but I would say today we are very good at that but are investing to get even better.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie Capital","Okay. Great. Then just one final one, the continued improvement that you saw in Juniors and Impulse, is that driven primarily by some of your investments in private and exclusive brands or is it sort of shared with national brands?","Karen Hoguet","It's shared across the board.","Liz Dunn - Macquarie Capital","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Next question is from Bernard Sosnick of Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","Good morning.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","I don't think I have ever heard a lineup of good news that included all that you said today about Juniors, Kids, Impulse, Activewear. I mean, you have put in a lot of effort to develop the Millennial strategy and to make the department store younger in feel. I am wondering if you can give us a broad-brush view of how your thinking might be changing along these positive lines going forward.","Karen Hoguet","I am not sure I understand what would be changing.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","Well, I mean, you are doing so well, I am wondering whether or not you are feeling that there is a success in making the store younger in feel and could you share with us any forward-looking thoughts?","Karen Hoguet","Well, I think, you know, we have said all along that investing in this Millennial customer was important for going forward and that's part of the reason we feel so good about the future for Macy's. By the way, the same is true for Bloomingdales in their own way. Again, I think it's important for us going forward. I am thrilled to be seeing the success.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","You called out Finish Line is doing very well. I know it should be up to around 400 stores with shops by October. What does it mean to have brands like Nike in the store where you didn't have it before? I am sure it is mainly for women, but what are the prospects for men's and kids athletic footwear?","Karen Hoguet","It's actually not primarily for women. It's doing extremely well across men's women's and where we have it in kids. We are beginning to grow that more aggressively now. In most cases, we had the brands. We just didn't have the right shoes and it is making an enormous difference and really giving us credibility that's helping us with our overall active strategy also.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities","Correct. Thank you very much.","The next question is from Richard Jaffe of Stifel.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","Thanks very much. Stifel, we say Stifel. Hi, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Hi. Good morning.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","Good morning. Just a follow-on on the Internet business. As you guys have led the charge, if you will, to an Omnichannel vision clearly you are learning a lot of things that work and don't work. I would love you to share that with us and I suspect you won't, but wondering just from a dollars and cents standpoint you have been investing a lot. Has it been well invested, is there more investment ahead that you have learned that you need to do or is the investment that has been done now going to be harvested or beneficial without additional investment for the next couple of years?","Karen Hoguet","No. It's a complicated question, but we will continue to invest and there is different parts of the investment. The first would be how to make our strategies between .com and stores and the systems work well together. That's one piece of investment. You've got the warehouses that we have been investing in. As you know, I just started building a new one in Tulsa, so those will continue.","You will have store technology, which we are testing like crazy and will continue to test and rollout things that work, so I think you should assume that Omnichannel and technology investments are going to be an ongoing part of both, our capital budget and also our expense.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Stacie Rabinowitz of Consumer Edge Research.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Hi. You had mentioned that the back-to-school categories in some of the younger age demographics were doing very well. I was just wondering as we sort of moved through the end of the summer, was there any change in the cadence of back-to-school versus last year or do you think the momentum could continue until school starts?","Karen Hoguet","I don't know, we will have to wait and see. The momentum didn't change. I mean, it was strong throughout the quarter. Obviously the back-to-school business really started towards the end of July. There is still a lot to come.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from David Glick of Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, Karen, just a couple of category follow-ups. You mentioned, I believe, it was men's sportswear, women's sportswear on the weaker categories as well as fashion footwear. Women's sportswear, not a new you mentioned, I was just wondering, in your men's sportswear commentary, are you including some of the better brands or what you consider more classification sportswear?","Karen Hoguet","It's just overall apparel business did not do as well both, men's and women's.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","On the footwear side, obviously the composition of the assortments changes pretty dramatically from fall to spring. Are you feeling any more optimistic about footwear as a category based on some of the ideas that you are seeing?","Karen Hoguet","Yes. We are.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Okay. Then finally, the risk of beating a dead horse, I know that there was a significant impact in the Q2 comp from those two days of friends and family, but is it fair to say that the underlying, you guys look at the underlying run rate in Q2, axe that event, still within the guidelines of what you are forecasting in the second half of 2 to 3?","Karen Hoguet","I think the horse is dead, buy yes.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","But yes?","Karen Hoguet","Yes.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we one question remaining in the queue. (Operator Instructions) We will take our next question from Craig Hutson of Loop Capital Markets.","Craig Hutson - Loop Capital Markets","Yes. Just a balance sheet question. We have seen a number of tender offers in the last months, including from some big retailers like Target and CVS. CVS announced a tender last week, where the highest coupon in the tender offer was 6.25%. You guys have 21 issues in your capital structure greater than 6.25%. What's the rationale for why specifically you have not gone down this path to pursue tender offers for your high cost debt?","Karen Hoguet","We are always looking at the net present value of these kinds of transactions. If positive, we would entertain one. If not, we wouldn't.","Craig Hutson - Loop Capital Markets","By net present value, we estimate you could save $100 million of annual interest expense. Can you just walk me through this calculation?","Karen Hoguet","No. I mean, you are obviously looking - even you have to look at the premium, you are going to have to pay et cetera.","Craig Hutson - Loop Capital Markets","Great.","Karen Hoguet","I mean, it's a cash flow question for us.","Craig Hutson - Loop Capital Markets","Okay, and more sort of cash flow question then just the overall improvement in interest savings and earnings.","Karen Hoguet","Correct. We are driven by cash flow, not earnings per share.","Craig Hutson - Loop Capital Markets","All right. Thank you.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Hoguet, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen Hoguet","Okay. Well, thank you all for your interest and support. If you have additional questions, feel free to call us. Have a good day. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation."],"13945":["Macy's Inc.

We look forward to taking your questions after our prepared remarks.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you, Monica. Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining the call. First, I want to introduce Paula Price. Paula joined Macy\u2019s Inc. as the Chief Financial Officer in early July. Paula is a strong addition to the team and she has hit the ground running. I also want to thank again, Karen Hoguet for all that she is doing to help make this is a smooth transition before her much deserved retirement. Karen has been a great partner to me and an exceptional leader for Macy\u2019s Inc. and for the industry.","So, this morning I\u2019m going to share a perspective on the second quarter, then Paula will take you through the details of the quarter, as well as updated guidance, and then we\u2019ll open up the line for your questions.","As you saw in this mornings press release, Macy\u2019s Inc. had another strong quarter. This was our third consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth and reflects ongoing improvement in the business that we saw first in the fourth quarter of 2017. It is early innings, but I feel about feel good about the progress that we\u2019ve made, the focus and energy of the team, and the positive response our customers have to our strategy.","Before we get started, I want to note as we said in our press release, last weeks or last year's 53-week calendar caused some shifts in our 2018 promotional calendar. Today, in my comments and in those of Paula, we will provide you with both second quarter and first half views where we think it is helpful. So, this is how we\u2019re gauging the strength of the business and we want to give you the same level of detail.","For the second quarter, comparable sales were up 0.5% on an owned plus licensed basis, but when adjusted for the Friends and Family shift from the second quarter to the first, comparable sales were up 2.9% on an owned plus licensed basis for the quarter. For the first half of the year, comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis were up 2.3%. We delivered adjusted EPS results of $0.70 per share for the second quarter and $1.19 per share for the first half of the year.","Based on the first half performance, our strong execution and the anticipation of continued healthy consumer spending, we are raising both sales and earnings guidance for the year. Paula will give more detail around guidance, but to sum it up, we are raising annual comparable sales guidance for owned plus licensed to 2.1% to 2.5%. We are also raising EPS by $0.20 and anticipate that annual EPS will be in the $3.95 to $4.15 range.","Overall, I\u2019m feeling good about where we are today, and I\u2019m encouraged by the momentum we have heading into the back half of 2018. At the heart of our improved performance is a consistent focus on the customer. The North Star Strategy is built around improving our customer journey, every step of the way, ticking out points of friction and dialing up the things that she loves about Macy's.","As I\u2019ve said before, our recipe for success is healthy stores, a robust e-commerce business and a powerful mobile app. Our customer wants a great experience anytime and anywhere she shops with us. It\u2019s especially encouraging to see another quarter of trend improvement for our brick-and-mortar business. This improvement was led by the Growth50 stores, but we also saw a trend improvement across much of the fleet.","Our digital business clocked another quarter of double-digit growth, including a very strong July. And we continue to see increased engagement with Macy's mobile app. Sales were up more than 50% on our app in the first half of the year versus last year. We continue to emphasize and edit in an elevated assortment with a heightened focus on fashion through our merchandising initiatives and our customers are responding well.","Average unit retail was up nearly 5% in the first half of the year. And operationally, we continue to improve execution in the quarter. It was encouraging to see the organization flex and respond to opportunities to drive additional sales throughout the quarter. All of this activity laddered up to a strong performance across all families of business, every geography, and all three of our brands; Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury all turned in a strong second quarter performance.","At Bloomingdale's, we saw particular strength in men's, handbags, and cosmetics. And like the Macy's brand, we\u2019re seeing good regular price sell-through through on all of our fall trends and that\u2019s really across all categories. The newly renovated shoe floor at Bloomingdale's 59th Street flagship has continued to gain momentum after the first quarter opening.","Across the store, renovated areas are performing in total above expectations and we look forward to the completion of the renovation by year-end. New Yorkers and tourists alike love the vibrancy of this iconic store. Bluemercury continued to perform well and we are pleased to see comparable sales growth in both freestanding stores and the Bluemercury shops within Macy's stores.","We\u2019re now going to turn to the Macy's five strategic initiatives. First, we\u2019re very pleased with the loyalty program that we launched last year. There has been a meaningful positive change in behavior at the platinum tier, which are our best customers. We\u2019ve hit a rhythm with the exclusive experiences we\u2019re able to offer our platinum members. Access to VIP sections of the New York fireworks, exclusive cooking classes with local chefs in Miami, L.A., and San Francisco, a preview of Broadway shows, these are just a handful of examples of the unique experiences we can offer the platinum customer.","And at the bronze tier level, that was the tender neutral offering that we launched last quarter. We now have more than 1 million new members. These are new customers to Macy's. So, within the loyalty program, our best customers are spending more. And new customers are coming into the program. We will continue to expand and refine the Star Rewards program throughout the year.","Next, our backstage expansion is continuing at pace. We opened 47 backstage stores in the second quarter for a total of 65 opened in the first half of the year. We\u2019re now on track to complete 120 openings this year. This includes the expansion of backstage to the West Coast and to some of our premium doors. Opening a Backstage store within the Macy's is a significant operation, since we need to relocate departments to carve out space and then construct and merchandise backstage. This process does create a ripple effect in the store and to date the teams have been handling it very well with minimal disruptions. And all work will be complete by the end of the third quarter.","Based on the ongoing sales lift we see from 2016 and 2017 Backstage locations, we feel good about our on-mall off-price strategy. Adding backstage makes existing stores more productive, gives our customers an exciting new experience, and will bring new customers into the brand. Next up, is vendor direct or the expansion of our online offerings. It is also on track.","By fourth quarter, our customers on Macy's.com will have access to a significantly expanded assortment. This includes more selection of products from great national and private brands that Macy's is known for, plus the addition of new brands and categories that we know our customers will love. We're building on our merchandising strengths and adding selection where our customer already signaled interest.","Next is the expansion of our store pickup program. This is doing well. This includes Buy Online Ship to Store or what we call BOSS and Buy Online Pickup in Store which we call BOPS. BOSS expanded to 50 stores in the second quarter and will be in almost every store by the end of the third quarter. We\u2019re also refining BOPS to improve the customer experience. And to support both programs, we are nearly complete with the rollout of the at your service, service stations in every store to make pickup easy and quick.","Our fifth strategic initiative in 2018, is the Growth50. And I'm pleased to report that our Growth50 stores are performing as we had expected and leave the improved trend in brick-and-mortar in the first half of the year. We also see an outside improvement in customer satisfaction scores in the Growth50, which tells us that our customers are noticing and appreciating the changes that we're making.","The investment we\u2019re making in these 50 stores is paying off, and supports our thesis that with the right talent and investment, our stores can be vibrant, productive, and profitable shopping destinations. I have visited almost every Growth50 store over the past few months and I'm very encouraged by what I see. The stores look great, the merchandise is right, customers are engaged, and the teams are committed to win.","The early performance of these stores is strong enough to give us confidence to line up the next batch of stores that will give get the Growth50 treatment in 2019. While we have this intense focus on the Growth50, we\u2019re also making investments in stores across the fleet to improve the customer experience.","As mentioned, At Your Service Centers and Mobile Checkout are going to be in almost every store. Stores are receiving more fashion, a more edited assortment, and they are being allowed more localization. We\u2019re also activating 60 virtual reality furniture locations in the third quarter via our significantly increases transaction size, and reduces returns. And importantly, it allows us to put big ticket in roughly half the amount of space.","We are committed to bring in exciting and fresh new experiences to our stores on a regular basis. In the second quarter, we announced our investment in Beta, a technology powered retailer that allows us to scale the market at Macy's faster. We\u2019re excited by the impact of the market and will be opening up two new markets in the fall. One in Atlanta, and one in Los Angeles. Between the market in Macy's and STORY, which we acquired in the first quarter we feel good about our opportunities to bring new content and experiences to our stores.","We also had a good start to the back to the school season at the end of the second quarter. Our integrated marketing campaign time to shine has resonated with customers. The merchandising strategy is solid and our kid\u2019s business is thriving. By brand, by category, by geography we see improved performance and momentum in the business, which we will carry into the third quarter. We wouldn't have this momentum without the effort and support at our teams.","I want to say thank you to all of our colleagues who are more engaged in the business than ever. Their hard work is paying off, both on our results and in our customer's attitude towards the brand. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve improved our net promoter score by seven full points versus last year with our Growth50 stores up almost over 10 points.","That\u2019s a big improvement and I'm proud and grateful to the 130,000 colleagues who are motivated and dedicated to serving our customers every day. And all that work is paying off for our people to. For the second quarter nearly 80% of our colleagues will receive a payout in the path to growth incentive plan. As part-time, full-time, seasonal every colleague has a role to play, and a stake to win in our success.","We are still only early in our journey, but as I look at the progress, we\u2019ve made on merchandising, our strategic initiatives, the reengineering of our marketing machine, and our company culture, I feel good about the work that\u2019s underway and optimistic about Macy's Inc.'s future.","And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Paula to discuss our financial performance.","Paula Price","Thank you, Jeff. I am so pleased to be a part of the Macy's Inc. team and I\u2019m looking forward to updating you on the financial progress of our journey. I too would like to congratulate Karen on her retirement, and to thank her for the effort that she has put into making sure that I have a great beginning at Macy's Inc. I truly appreciate her support.","As Jeff mentioned, I will provide some detail on the second quarter, and also offer some perspective on how we're thinking about the year. And then, I will share a few of my very early observations on the business. I remind you that my commentary includes certain financial measures adjusted for the impact of impairment, and other cost, settlement charges associated with our defined benefit plans, and losses or gains on the early retirement of debt. ","Sales in the second quarter were $5.57 billion, up 50 basis points over last year and an owned plus licensed comparable basis, which was better than we expected. The quarter was negatively impacted by the shift of Friends and Family promotional event into the first quarter of this year, as compared to the second quarter last year.","Excluding the 240 basis points of negative impact, due to this shift comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis increased an estimated 2.9% in the second quarter. Due to the materiality of the Friends and Family shift, which impacted the first quarter positively and the second quarter negatively, as Jeff mentioned, we are providing first half metrics where appropriate to facilitate a more meaningful comparison to the prior year.","For the first half of the year, sales were up 1.1% in total, and up 2.3% on an owned, plus licensed comparable basis, much stronger than we expected at the start of the year. Comparable sales on an owned basis were up 1.9% for the first half of the year. Our North Star strategy and strong executions are driving our improved performance.","Our brick-and-mortar business continued the positive momentum that began in the fourth quarter of 2017 and our digital business continued to grow double digits. We are also benefiting from strong consumer confidence and spending, including growth in international tourist spending.","In the second quarter, our international tourist sales were up 3% over last year, less than the 10% increase seen in the first quarter in part due to the Friends and Family shift. For the first half of the year, we saw a 6% increase in international tourist sales. Macy's, Bloomingdale\u2019s, and Bluemercury, all delivered strong sales. Sales were also strong across all geographies where top performing markets spread across the country.","The strength in our categories was also broad-based across fine jewelry, fragrances, active dresses, kid's men's luggage and furniture, while our performance in mattresses was lower than expected. For the first half of the year total transactions were up 50 basis points. Average units per transaction were down 2.6%. Average unit retail was up 4.6%. These metrics reflect strong regular price selling helped by our disciplined inventory management. ","Credit card revenues in the quarter of $186 million was 11% higher than last year, due to higher balances and an increase in card usage, driven by the enhanced star rewards loyalty program. The penetration or usage rate of our proprietary cards was 46.6%, up 60 basis points from last year. This is in-line with the goals that we set for the new loyalty program, and as Jeff mentioned, we are pleased with the heightened engagement of our best customers and healthy growth of our credit portfolio.","Gross margin in the quarter was $2.25 billion or 40.4% of net sales, 80 basis points higher than last year, benefiting from our much-improved inventory position this year, as well as our strong sales performance. We ended the quarter with inventory down 40 basis points on a comparable basis. This year-over-year decline in inventory is less than it was in the first quarter, as we cycled the clearance of excess inventory during the second quarter of 2017 creating a more difficult comparison.","Additionally, we were one week deeper into the back-to-school season this year, due to the 53rd week calendar shift, and therefore needed fresh merchandise to capture those sales. The calendar shift will have a greater timing impact on our receipt flow at the end of the third quarter when in fact we expect inventory to be up on a comparable basis versus last year as we prepare for the holiday season. By the end of the fiscal year, however, we expect inventory to be down again.","We continue to be disciplined about managing our inventory as doing so benefits our sales, fulfilment processes across channel, and gross margins. Further, our customers react positively to fresh merchandise receipts. SG&A expense in the quarter was $2.16 billion or $3 million higher than last year. On a rate basis, SG&A expense was 38.8%, compared to 38.4% last year. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives to accelerate our growth, and our lower taxes continue to help fund these investments.","Asset sale gains in the quarter were $46 million, $3 million higher than last year, including continued recognition of the deferred gain from the Brooklyn transaction that we closed in 2015 and other property sales that we closed during the second quarter. For the first half of the year, asset sale gains were $70 million, as compared to $111 million last year. Proceeds from asset sales were $88 million year-to-date, compared to $150 million last year.","We booked approximately $17 million in restructuring, impairments, and other costs, which included the impact of changes we made to our China business, which we shared last quarter. Benefit plan income in the quarter was $11 million, compared to $14 million last year, and we also booked non-cash pension settlements of $50 million in the quarter, which is approximately the same amount as last year.","Consolidated EBIT in the quarter was $264 million, compared to $245 million last year. Adjusted EBIT of $331 million was 12% higher than last year. Excluding asset sale gains as well, EBIT of $285 million was up 13% in the quarter. And on the same basis, EBIT for the first half of the year was $529 million, compared to $417 million last year, a 27% increase. ","Interest expense in the quarter was $62 million, compared to $79 million last year. This excludes debt premium charges of $5 million associated with the $344 million of debt repurchase completed in the open market in the quarter. Tax expense in the quarter was $33 million or 17% of pretax income. This compares to $60 million or 36% last year. We also benefited in the quarter from the resolution of certain state tax examinations.","Net income in the quarter was $166 million, compared to $111 million last year. Adjusted net income was $219 million. This is $78 million or 55% higher than last year. For the first half of the year, net income adjusted on this basis was $369 million, compared to $221 million last year. Excluding asset sale gains as well, adjusted net income of $316 million in the first half of the year was more than double the adjusted net income of $152 million last year.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.53 in the quarter, compared to $0.36 last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.70 in the quarter, compared to $0.46 last year. When excluding asset sale gains as well, adjusted earnings per share were $0.59 in the quarter, compared to $0.37 last year, and on this same basis, earnings per share were $1.02 for the first half of the year, compared to $0.50 last year.","Cash flow from operating activities of $544 million for the first half of the year was consistent with the prior year. We also had $36 million more invested in capital expenditure and $62 million less, received in proceeds from asset sales, compared to prior year. We ended the second quarter with $1.1 billion in cash, $286 million more than last year.","As you heard from Jeff, we are very pleased with the performance of our key strategic initiatives, the Growth50 stores, Backstage, store pickup, the enhanced Star Rewards loyalty program, and the growth in our vendor direct assortment.","As a result of the strong first half sales and earnings performance, we have again raised guidance for the year. We are gaining traction earlier than we expected and this combined with a healthy consumer spending environment gives us the confidence to increase our outlook. Our assumption for total sales for the year is now flat to up 0.7% with 2017 having had one extra week of sales.","Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis is now expected to be up 2% to 2.5% for the back half of the year, which translates to 2.1% to 2.5% for the full-year. This is consistent with the strong growth seen in the spring, but also considers that we are cycling a very strong fourth quarter from last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to be $3.95 to $4.15, up from our previous guidance of $3.75 to $3.95.","Key assumptions behind our revised full-year guidance include the following. We expect our gross margin rate as a percent of sales to be slightly up for the year. This means that the gross margin rate is assumed to be slightly below last year in the fall. This is because we expect the increase in fall 2018 merchandise margins to be smaller than the increase we experienced this past Spring as we cycle this strong fall 2017 comparison.","And the anticipated increase in fall 2018 merchandise margins will not fully offset the increase in delivery expense associated with our fast-growing digital business, which ramps up in the second half at a higher penetration. Further, since we launched our enhanced loyalty program in October 2017, we anticipate more delivery expense impact on our gross margin rate in the third quarter of this year, compared to last.","SG&A dollars for the year are expected to be higher than last year, due to our investments in the business, and in support of the expected sales growth. We expect this to be more pronounced in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter because the fourth quarter benefited from one less week than last year. Credit card revenue is now expected to be $720 million to $735 million on the strength of performance to date.","Interest expense, excluding any debt premium charges associated with debt repurchases is now assumed to be approximately $245 million, which is lower than prior guidance, due to the acceleration of our debt reduction. Our expected annual effective tax rate is now expected to be 23%, which is 25 basis points lower than prior guidance. The other assumptions provided in May remain unchanged.","While we are pleased with the strong start to the year and our ability to capture benefits from our strategies earlier than we expected, we know that we have a lot of work ahead of us. Nonetheless, it is great to enter the back half of the year well-positioned for growth. Before I hand it back over to Jeff, I want to share a few of my early observations about what I see at Macy's Inc.","I see growth. Our strategic initiatives are gaining traction and the financial results are showing up consistently and positively in our stores, online, and through our mobile app. I see potential. We have cost and productivity opportunities that are already beginning to be unleashed by analytics and technology.","Our business generated strong cash flows, we have a healthy balance sheet, and these all give us the flexibility that we need to fund our future and reinvest in our business. And, I see in my highly motivated colleagues throughout the organization who are aligned on one path to restore this iconic company to sustainable profitable growth. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming weeks.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jeff for some closing remarks.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, Paula. So, before we open up the line for questions, let me sum things up. We're delivering strong operational performance, which is amplified by a healthy consumer spending environment. Our brick-and-mortar business has shown meaningful improvements and our digital business continues with strong consistent growth. The North Star Strategy strategic initiatives are gaining traction, and drove the third consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. We have momentum heading into the back half of the year.","And with that, we\u2019ll open up the line and Paula and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Matthew Boss, JPMorgan. Please go-ahead sir.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. Jeff can you help us break down the improvement in first half same-store sales, maybe between the stronger underlying consumer you are seeing and your company specific initiatives? And just also, how you're thinking about back half international tourist sales given, I think you mentioned a roughly 700 basis points sequential slowdown versus what you saw in the first quarter?","Jeff Gennette","So, I think Matt that, certainly the trend of the business in the first half was buoyed with a strong consumer sentiment and good spending across all of our retail. And so, I think that\u2019s a piece of our trend, but when you look at Macy's performance to general market, in 2018 versus what we were in 2017 you definitely see a big narrowing. And our, I believe that gap that narrowing of gap is really related to our strategies. And so, our strategies are really related to, how we're going to take care of a customer and that\u2019s across anyway that she shops with us. So, really happy with the strong digital growth.","We continue to invest there. We're getting double-digit growth there, both in the first and the second quarter. Putting a lot of investment into mobile. And we're going to pass in 2018 $1 billion in mobile sales, but it\u2019s much more than that. You know how the customer really uses that for really understanding the brand, checking out customer reviews, navigating the store Mobile Checkout, mobile app is a real gateway for us, and we're going to continue to strengthen that, but the part of the strategy that I\u2019m most excited about is the firming up of brick-and-mortar trends.","And really across the fleet it is we saw improvement and that\u2019s the big difference in our business in 2018 versus 2017 is what\u2019s happening in brick-and-mortar. So, very excited about that. And I expect that to carry us into the back half of 2018. To your international tourist question, I think we have to also look at what happened in second and first quarter, what happened in international tourism is what happened in Macy's customers at large that there was a shift as a result of the international tourism or excuse me of Friends and Family, and so what we want to look at is really the first half performance of international tourism, which is up about 6% when you look at the Macy's and Bloomingdale's plates. So, we expect that international tourism will remain up in the back half of the year around that Spring level.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up on the P&L. On the expense front, I guess as your offensive initiatives accelerate into next year, should we be thinking about also a step-up in SG&A as we think about next year on the expense front or do you see continued operational efficiencies to offset this?","Jeff Gennette","We're looking at that right now. We haven't finalized all of our 2019 planning, but we\u2019re obviously looking at, where are those inefficiencies that we have in our overall strategy that the customer doesn't value, and making sure that we're making those appropriate cuts like there\u2019s a lot of opportunities that the customer is voting on that we want to make sure we're fueling, but I just wouldn't remind you that we\u2019re good at cost control. We\u2019ve done a great deal with getting out extraneous expense. We\u2019re a much linear organization then we were even last year, and we\u2019re totally focused on doing what\u2019s right to drive profitable sales and taking care of a customer that expects out of us.","Matthew Boss","That\u2019s great. Best of luck.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks Matt.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Paul Trussell, Deutsche Bank. Please go-ahead sir.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. I wanted to enquire about the EPS revision higher for the year, if you can just walk through all of the components that led to the increase? Certainly, we see your confidence on the top line and I think you also mentioned a higher credit revenue expectation, but if you could just walk us through all the puts and takes as we think about asset sales and kind of below the line items, just so we have a full understanding of what\u2019s led to the incremental raise [ph]?","Paula Price","Okay. So, our sales and earnings guidance for the full-year reflects our strong performance in the first half, as well as our increased confidence in our fall expectations. And so, our sales guidance for fall is up 2% to 2.5% on a comparable owned licensed basis. And this is fairly consistent with our strong performance in the first half where we performed better than we expected, but it also considers that in the fall we\u2019re cycling a very strong quarter from last year.","We also guided our credit revenue up and our asset sale gains continued to be the same at $300 million to $325 million for the year, and we\u2019re making progress against that. And our interest expense is down, and that\u2019s based on the debt repurchase that we did earlier than we expected. So, we\u2019re already seeing that effect, and so, as we stated at the beginning of the year, we are investing in the business and we\u2019re continuing to do so in the fall season. For example, in our enhanced loyalty program and in our strategic initiative. ","And fall SG&A will be impacted by investments in our strategic initiatives, while our fall gross margin will be impacted due to increased delivery expense for our most loyal customers. And then gross margin will also be impacted by our growing digital business, which ramps up in the fall season and this along with our reduction in our tax rate is all reflected in our guidance for the year.","Paul Trussell","That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you. And as we just think about the composition of the comp, AUR was up meaningfully, if you can just discuss the drivers of that gain and how you think about or how we should think about transactions in UPT over the balance of the year as well?","Jeff Gennette","So, I would say on that Paul is that, our inventory is in great shape and so when you look at the first half of the year, as Paula mentioned, we brought in a lot of residual inventory in 2017 from the holiday season of 2016 that didn\u2019t sell. So, I would tell you that the AUR in the Spring of 2017 reflected that. We had to liquidate a lot of inventory. We came in really clean in 2018. So, we were cycling \u2013 and cycle through that. So that gave us the option of really making sure that by making sure that our stock was in parity with the sales that would follow it, we call lag receipts.","We can stay really close to the customer in terms of what she was expecting of us, which she wants tasty, new fashion that we put in front of her, and so that\u2019s what we did. So, what we found is that, we\u2019re rarely farther along and pricing the analytics than ever, we're able to gauge customer demand, we\u2019re able to make a lot more out of regular price, and first markdown selling, and that\u2019s what you saw drove the AUR increase of almost 5% in the first half of the year.","So, keeping our inventories in line, keeping completely sync to customer demand and seasonal changes, selling more regular price, selling more fashion that\u2019s where our AUR, you saw the beat there, and what I expect to take into the balance of the year.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. Best of luck.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you, good morning. You spoke on the call about earlier inventory receipts to address an extra back-to-school week in the second quarter, how much does that extra week benefit your comp in 2Q?","Jeff Gennette","We think it\u2019s slight Lorraine. I think what\u2019s important is just to understand what happened in the month of July just in general. So, July was definitely our strongest month from a comp performance of the quarter. And so, we certainly wanted to accelerate back-to-school receipts and be ready because we had a lot of customers that were going back earlier, and just because of the calendar shift we were there and ready with all back-to-school receipts.","We obviously had a strong digital business. Black Friday in July played well for us, but we had great strength in some of the other businesses where we were in a much better inventory position with fresh goods. So, when you look at fine jewelry, you look dresses, men\u2019s, certainly kids as mentioned. So, had a good performance in the July season and a lot of those because we had the inventory and freshness there for our customer.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. And when you\u2019re thinking about the Growth50, where these stores completely up and running throughout the entirety of the second quarter or was that one of the drivers in July that could persist through the back half?","Jeff Gennette","Yes, what happened with Growth50 was we made a lot of changes in the beginning of the year. I give the stores organization a great deal of credit for what they did with talent, and when you look at the management talent, and you look at the focus on that frontline colleague talent, all of those efforts went into play all the way through the spring season and we got good traction from that. The things that are coming on right now in Growth50 is the capital expenses.","So, we've improved lighting levels, surface levels, rest rooms all that, that really came in in the second quarter, but with respect to what we\u2019re doing with furniture and what we\u2019re doing with backstage, those are changes that are coming online right now. That\u2019s going to happen really in the third quarter. We\u2019re looking to mitigate the disruption that that\u2019s going to cause in our third quarter business and those particular stores, we\u2019re going to do as much of that work at night as possible, but all those changes are coming now. But I will tell you that we\u2019re getting better traction out of the Growth50 that we initially anticipated in the first half of the year, as well as many of our other initiatives, but we do think there is some, that will continue into the back half of the year, but also with new capital that is going to also help us with fourth quarter business.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Right, thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Tunick, Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Tunick","Great. Thanks very much. Was hoping maybe you could give some perspective around the Growth50, and the backstage stores. Maybe talk about even on the first half basis, how they performed versus the balance of the change? Just curious. And then maybe if you could help us understand how much digital penetration grows in Q4 versus the first nine months of the year. Just so we have an understanding of how much delivery pressure there should be on gross margins in the fourth quarter? Thank you very much.","Jeff Gennette","So, Brian, let me just take both your questions. So, the first thing on Growth50, so just to go back that \u2013 I think the Macy\u2019s competitive mode is robust digital growth, healthy brick-and-mortar, and a great mobile app. And so, I felt buckets one and three there, we have an investment strategy, we're winning in both of those categories continue to see us do well there. It was really how we would solve brick-and-mortar and very happy with the early testing that we did in 2017 and then what we\u2019re learning from the Growth50 strategies.","So, all of our Growth50 strategies is a 5P approach, it\u2019s focusing on product and value, it\u2019s focusing on presentation, it\u2019s focusing on process, it\u2019s focusing on promotion, but the most important one it\u2019s focusing on people. And with all the efforts that we put against that, we\u2019re very satisfied with the results we're getting. To your question about trend change, our trend change in brick-and-mortar has been marked since 2017, and it\u2019s even more marked when you look at Growth50 versus the balance of brick-and-mortar. ","We expect to carry those trends into the back half of the year. The other thing that\u2019s important to note about growth 50 is how the customer is responding to the changes that we\u2019re making, and what Paula quoted in terms of our net promoter score is up seven full points in Growth50, it\u2019s up almost 10.","So, the customer is really liking what we're doing with respect to that. With respect to your question, we don't break-out digital growth. Digital growth is a more penetrated piece of our business on the fourth quarter. And when you think about Cyber Monday, you think about Black Friday that fuels a great deal of volume that we are doing, as well as what we're doing with vendor direct.","So, when you think about vendor direct, as one of our five initiatives, we\u2019re basically almost doubling the amount of skews that we had in our inventory, and at the back half of 2017, and where we\u2019re going to be by the \u2013 going into the fourth quarter of 2018. So, that\u2019s a lot of sales that we\u2019re banking on that\u2019s going to be digital, that\u2019s going to be fulfilled by a vendor. We want to own the inventory until we consummate the sale, but that\u2019s part of the digital growth and then there are shipping costs that are recorded to that. So, that\u2019s how I\u2019d respond to digital.","Brian Tunick","And I think just my question on backstage, you know what you're seeing in the first half in those stores that now have it versus a year ago, what kind of comp lift are you seeing in either year one or year two now?","Jeff Gennette","So, in backstage this has been a good story for us. We came into the year with an investment thesis. We\u2019re now executing that. So, as we said in our comments we\u2019ve got 65 doors that we\u2019ve opened in backstage in the first half of the year. We\u2019ve got another 60 or so that are coming in by the end of the third quarter. So, we\u2019ll have about 120 that we will have added in 2018, added to the 40 some that we had in prior. ","So, that\u2019s all making our plans right now, we're going through a lot of adding this, lot of construction, lot of making the openings in each of the stores, building that out, and we\u2019re satisfied with our results there. I think one of the things that I talked about on previous calls was how would backstage perform in its second full-year and so one of the things we watch very carefully are those doors that were opened in 2017 and 2016, and how are they lapping that first year's business. And I'm pleased to say that we\u2019re getting positive growth in the balance of those doors.","So, this is clearly a strategy that\u2019s resonating with our customer and really having the only half-price full-price store that\u2019s on mall, it is a competitive advantage we believe and our history and our progress with Backstage is giving us further confidence on that subject. So, as mentioned, we're going to be bringing backstage to the West Coast. West Coast we had some ads in the second quarter, and we\u2019re starting to put it into some of our premium doors. So, this is an evolving story of Backstage at Macy's.","Brian Tunick","Thanks, and good luck guys.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Chuck Grom, Gordon Haskett. Please go-ahead sir.","Chuck Grom","Hi, thanks, good morning. Paula, on the guide, your front half of the year comps were up about 2%, you are basically guiding to that level in the second half which is a little bit different than your former review, which I think was a second half greater than the front half, any reason for that change and then just any early reads on back-to-school line, I know it is early for you guys, but any update on the trend there?","Paula Price","So, I\u2019ll take the first part. The performance in our first half was really quite strong and so when we looked to our second half, it\u2019s still very strong. So, we are continuing with that momentum into the second half, but we are performing basically on the early delivery of all of our strategic initiatives, and so that gives us confidence about the second half, but our first half was really very strong. In the second half, we are also cycling a very strong fourth quarter, and so we are considering all of that in our fall guide.","Jeff Gennette","And then Chuck on the back to school question, it started out well. You know, to Lorraine\u2019s earlier question, we were in a good position with back-to-school receipts, and so the customer that was in our stores really and starting in June for some of our southern markets as well as the entire month of July we\u2019re getting great traction, and our kids business is one of the strongest in the entire store, and that\u2019s across boys and girls that\u2019s not just active that\u2019s uniforms, that\u2019s sportswear, very strong. We also repositioned denim in our millennial world. So, that\u2019s really juniors and some of the price points in missy sportswear. And that denim area is doing quite well, which is triggering back-to-school business. So, happy with how it has started.","Chuck Grom","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then, lot of talk here about Backstage, I think you said, going to go into 125 stores this year, and obviously the Growth50 is going to be in 50 stores this year, but you have about, close to 700 stores, when you think out to 2019 and 2020, what do you think that the pipeline looks like for our deeper rollout of both Backstage and Growth50 into more doors down the road?","Jeff Gennette","Well, first-off, I would say that we\u2019re happy right now with our portfolio and we like where our brick-and-mortar is positioned across the nation, and so every store has a role to play. And so, what you hear is we are not just investing in Growth50 or Backstage, but we\u2019re also looking at what are the opportunities that we have in each of our buildings. So, At Your Service, Mobile Checkout, really what we're doing with merchandising value and all the other doors. But think about Backstage is really \u2013 Backstage really went into some of the lower tier stores in 2000 [ph] and really for the full rollout. We would continue with that.","So, when you look at some of the doors that are not our tops doors Backstage is in many of those. We're now starting to experiment with Backstage in our most premium doors, and so that\u2019s coming online right now and in the beginning of third quarter. So, we\u2019ll be measuring that very carefully. So, then with respect to Growth50, we\u2019re learning a lot. What we wanted to make sure of in Growth50 is that we had a scalable investment that all the testing could be scaled into a lot more doors. And so, we're learning from what is working, what the customer is voting on, what they want to see more off, and that which they\u2019re not as excited about. So, we're learning from all of that. We expect to continue with those learnings through the back half of this year and be ready with the right level of investment in more doors in 2019.","Chuck Grom","That\u2019s great. And just, Paula, just real quick on guide. You guided last quarter asset sales to $300 million to $325 million just wanted to make sure that hat view is unchanged on that line item?","Paula Price","Yes. We're sticking on our guidance for the full-year of $300 million to $325 million at the annual guidance, and I Magnin, we\u2019re expecting some time in the fourth quarter in case you're curious?","Chuck Grom","That's helpful. Thanks","Jeff Gennette","And just to make that clear, Chuck this is the size of the I Magnin. That\u2019s the bulk of that 300 million to 325 million is I Magnin. So, we expect that to go through in the fourth quarter.","Chuck Grom","Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities. Please go-ahead sir.","Bob Drbul","Good morning. Just a couple of questions for me. First, when you look at the traffic trends, excluding the shift in the second quarter that you had, can you just talk to that briefly, adjusted when you move the Friends and Family out, and I think for the extra week, so wonder if you could talk to that first. The second question is, on the credit card income, can you talk \u2013 in the 720 million to 730 million assumption, what\u2019s your assumption on the penetration rate going forward? And then third question I have is just on the beauty category. I was wondering if you could talk to ex-Bluemercury the beauty category at Macy's, the promotional levels that you\u2019re seeing and the margins that you're seeing in that category? Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","So, Bob I\u2019m going to take one and three of your questions, and Paula will take credit. But let me just talk about transactions. So, I think the number that Paula was quoting is a really good sign for us. So, the fact that transactions were up in the first half to last year is a very good sign for us. And then once they are on our site or in our buildings, I feel good about our ability to convert them at deeper levels with the right merchandise, and the right services. So, we are tracking with that. So, we expect that to continue into the back half of the year. You know, when you think about how many customers you have in our building, and how many we convert on, we always have opportunity with that and with the right service levels, the right content, the right values, I like our chances there.","I\u2019ll talk about beauty, and then let Paula take credit. But with the beauty category, what I love about beauty is that it\u2019s fairly broad. It\u2019s our front door. Its color, its treatment, and its fragrances, and you\u2019ve heard us talk about fragrances as one of our strongest categories in the front half of 2018. We\u2019re banging on all cylinders with respect to the fragrance business. We\u2019ve got all the launches. We got exclusive product. You know, we're selling jumbos, which is the bigger size, our customer loves that. So, our fragrance business and we expect that to continue into the back half of the year.","We\u2019re also winning in a number of our color and treatment lines. We're really migrating our strategy from a brand centric to a customer centric strategy and really liked the leadership of our team, and how we're approaching that. Our Growth50 stores is a laboratory for. We had early testing that went into our Woodbridge store. So, you will have a dedicated beauty advisor by line, but then they are cross-trained against other lines. Our customer is liking that. The customer service score with a net promoter score is way up and beauty, as a result of the service that we\u2019re providing and we\u2019re also going to more opening south.","So, we\u2019re able to get more content and more newness into more doors as a result of all of those measures. So, we're still working through color and treatment. We\u2019ve got some formidable competition and we're very focused on taking care of our customer. So, fragrances will continue and we\u2019re continuing to work on everything we\u2019re doing in beauty.","Paula Price","And so, Bob on the credit revenue, we are guiding up to 720 million to 735 million as I mentioned, and that business continues to perform in a very healthy way. We had 46.6% of penetration, up 60 basis points from last year and so we\u2019re expecting that business to continue to perform in a healthy way and so that\u2019s what it is reflected in our guidance.","Bob Drbul","Okay great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.","Dana Telsey","Hi, good morning everyone, and welcome Paula. Can you talk a little bit more on delivery expense, how that\u2019s progressing, how you see that expense development going forward? And then Jeff you mentioned about the vendor direct offerings, where are we in that, how many SKUs, how many categories should it be? And lastly, just anything more detail on category performance, what\u2019s doing well, what didn't do as well? Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","So, let me take the last two, and we\u2019ll talk about delivery after that. So, we talked about category performance. So, it\u2019s what we put in the press release on that Dana. Really men's and kid\u2019s standard-outs in the front half and really across all categories. When you look at some of the fine jewelry business, it was very strong. I mentioned fragrances are being very strong, women's shoes was strong, Big Ticket furniture was quite strong, our home categories are performing well beyond our expectation. Parts have already went to dress business, active across the entire store has all been good. So, happy with that. You want to talk about vendor?","Paula Price","Yes, sure. So, we are seeing the benefits of our loyalty program. It shows up in our increased retail sales, and it also shows up in our credit income, and it shows up in our higher delivery expense, and so, as we mentioned, we expected our digital business and loyalty business to ramp up in the second half of the year. So, we\u2019ll see a progress, a progression over the second half of the year. ","And also, in the third quarter, we\u2019re launching the \u2013 we're cycling the launch of our Star Rewards loyalty program, which comes with extra shipping, which our customers greatly appreciate, but that will impact our delivery expense as well and will impact our gross margin.","And so again, there are two factors, one is that in versus October in the third quarter, we are launching \u2013 we're cycling the launch of the Star Rewards program and we\u2019re expecting to see the impact of our digital business, which naturally ramps up in the back half of the year.","Jeff Gennette","And then Dana to your question about vendor direct. We\u2019re in the early innings of this, but we are making great progress. We are at our target of new vendors that we are adding. Just to remind everybody that we had about a 6 to 1 ratio of the number of SKU units that were online versus an average store, where that is low, compared to virtually every one of our multichannel competitors. And so, we were adding significant amount of new content, and this is really, you know we look first at what the customers said. Where did we have failed searches, where did we have great brands that are in our portfolio that we could add more assortment based on what they offered on their own sites? What are categories that customers expect of Macy's that we could and should add?","So, we\u2019re in the beginning stages of all of that, but we\u2019re well on track. So, we\u2019ve added. We\u2019re on track to basically almost double the amount of SKUs by the end of October, and we\u2019re already seeing early signs of customers responding to that amount of content. So, you know the way we look at it is that we curate for customers and store. She curates for herself online and so having a wide assortment or endless aisle just makes us competitive, the customers expect more content from the Macy's brand and this is the right strategy for us.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse. Please go-ahead sir. Your line is open","Michael Binetti","Hi, good morning and let me add my welcome Paula.","Paula Price","Thank you, Michael.","Michael Binetti","Assuming you help us just straighten out something for the modelling, just there is no confusion coming after this call, I think you helped tell us the gross margins would be a little low for a few reasons in the fall, and we have characterized that as third quarter, but I think a lot of that seems drivers and dynamics that you just described through Q&A should continue in 4Q, so can you just help us just clarify whether you think, you see gross margin expanding or contracting relative to 4Q last year when we get to the fourth quarter this year?","Paula Price","So, we expect the fourth quarter, overall, to be down. In terms of gross margin, we expect it to be done more in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter. Again, we're cycling the launch of the Star Rewards loyalty program last year, and so that\u2019s sort of the dynamics for the half year, but for the full-year we expect gross margins to be up slightly.","Jeff Gennette","So, Michael, just \u2013 I would add to what Paula said. We expect that merchandise margin is going to continue to increase versus last year in both third quarter and fourth quarter. It is just the offset of the increased delivery that we\u2019re getting from the new loyalty program and then the highly penetrated digital business that\u2019s growing at a double-digit rate in the back half of this year. So, again, we will be up slightly on overall gross margin on the full-year but we're going to give back some of the increase that we had in Spring, based on where shipping is growing and how much traction we\u2019re getting in this loyalty program. So, this is all good. It\u2019s all factored in our guidance to you and we feel good about our strategy here.","Michael Binetti","Right. Okay. So, I guess more fairly, thinking multi-year, I think the dynamics that you mentioned in merchandise margin and how that rounds up to a gross margin, if, I think if you look back at this year and say gross margins for you and for the industry you are going to catch up year after some inventory cleaning in 2017, but as you look out to 2019 on a multiyear basis, on a more apples-to-apples comparison for your business and consider those initiatives, do you think gross margins continue to expand in 2019 or do those dynamics like the growth of digital loyalty backstage, I mean the blended gross margins are more of like a flat to down based on the business mix change that you see?","Jeff Gennette","So, let me take it in a couple of parts. I would expect the delivery expenses going to continue to rise, just based on the momentum that we're getting in digital, and what\u2019s going on with our loyalty program. So, I would expect that\u2019s going to be a rise, but I also expect merchandise margin to go up as well. So, when you think about our path to getting great product for our customers, and our ability to control that in many cases, you know we're moving towards a 40% exclusive mark with our content.","So, I would expect that when you look at our private brands and you look at our exclusive brands and capsules that we can get more margin growth in those as an offset to some of the increased expenses that we\u2019re getting on the shipping line. So, too early to tell you exactly where we\u2019re going to land in 2019, but we're working on both those ends.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","We would now take our next question from Brian Callen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Brian Callen","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Paula, in terms of thinking about the back half and debt reduction relative to your comment about this quarter's acceleration of debt reduction, I guess how are you thinking about leverage relative to your target range now? And then separately, is there more proactive debt reduction to occur or sort of how do you manage that against thinking about your credit ratings?","Paula Price","Thank you. Let me just take a step back, and talk about our capital allocation strategy, which is what I think you\u2019re getting at here. Our capital allocation strategy has not changed, and we continuously make our capital deployment decisions consistent with the strategy as our business results unfold, and so our priorities for deploying capital continue to be first investing in our business to fuel profitable growth and for example in 2018, we intend to invest $1.05 billion in capital expenditures. ","Second, maintaining our healthy balance sheet for a financial flexibility. We want to be prepared for both opportunities, as well as a potential economic downturn. And our target leverage ratio continues to be 2.5 times to 2.8 times. And third, returning excess free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends, which we are doing and our share buybacks. And so, at this point, we\u2019re still anticipating debt reduction being the use of excess cash in 2018.","Brian Callen","Okay. Thank you very much.","Paula Price","Thank you.","Operator","Jeff Gennette","John, anybody else?","Operator","Apologies sir. We will now take our next question from Paul Lejuez of Citi. Please go-ahead sir.","Paul Lejuez","Hi thanks guys. Can you maybe talk about the comp performance, during the Friends and Family promotion lined up against the same promotion last year versus how comps trended outside of that promotion in the first half? And then second, I just want to make sure I understood something that you said in response to Lorraine's question, I think you said, July was your strongest month, but I want to make sure, when you guys talk about July, are you including the first week of August in this year's July versus last year when it did not have the first week of August? I just want to make sure I understand the calendar impact in terms of how you get that answer. And maybe if you can just provide the first half comp on a lined-up basis that would be helpful? Thanks.","Jeff Gennette","So, Paul Friends and Family was the increase we had when you look at the actual event is consistent with the increase that we got in the full first half. So, it was about the same penetration as we had in the balance of the business. So, satisfied with that, with respect to that last week of July versus the first week of August at Macy's is not a big difference. So, it had a slight effect on the second quarter, slight negative effect on the third quarter, but it is very slight. So, for us it was just, it\u2019s the mix of the business that\u2019s been ready for the back to school businesses, it\u2019s having your inventory in place and ready for that. So, that\u2019s how I would say that. And then your last question?","Paula Price","I think it had to do with\u2026","Paul Lejuez","First half comp lined up.","Paula Price","Yes, our first half comp is a lined-up. 2.3% for the first half it neutralizes the Friends and Family promotional shift.","Paul Lejuez","It neutralizes the Friends and Family, but you also gain a week of August and lose a week of February. So, was a benefit to the [indiscernible]?","Jeff Gennette","Paul, we mentioned there is a slight change to second quarter, it\u2019s a slight change the third quarter. It\u2019s not meaningful.","Paula Price ","Yes.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. Thanks guys. Good luck.","Paula Price ","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Co. Please go ahead.","Oliver Chen","Thank you, so much. Thank you, Jeff and Paula. Regarding the curation factor, there is a lot of great initiatives, what are your thoughts on speed and test read and react? And also, I know you\u2019ve made some really innovative steps in terms of utilization of data, how will you partner data with buyers because the whole buying function and the merchandising function is rapidly shifting and a lot of newer competitors are using coding attributes, as well as customer interactions to drive a decision-making and speed, would love your thoughts there?","Jeff Gennette","So, we\u2019re definitely operating with more speed as we have mentioned in the past Oliver, really the structure has changed dramatically in our merchandised organizations. So, you have, the speed of decision-making is significantly just shorter than it used to be. So, if you were to talk to our vendors they would all tell you that Macy's is operating with more speed than ever. And because we\u2019ve got so much liquidity in our receipts to be able to respond to customer needs, we were able to respond in getting more customer wanted products the wanted trends into our stores faster. ","We\u2019re definitely working on supply chain with our own private goods to shorten those cycles. We\u2019re definitely using our consumer panels to help define what is the right assortment and right trends for us to get into. We have a very developed fashion office and trend forecasting it\u2019s working with consumer panels. We\u2019ve got our style crew, which are colleagues of ours that advises on that that are out there in their own social space getting information on that. So, we\u2019re a dramatically leaner organization and we\u2019re operating with more agility and we\u2019re much more customer centric in how we\u2019re responding to their needs and desire for trend.","As it relates to analytics, what we did over a year and half ago of consolidating analytics into one center of excellence that serves the business is really paying off for us, not only in all pricing decisions, and really looking at out date and expected sell-through and defining what we want to do with point-of-sale discounts, as well as markdown pricing and cadence of that helping us improve our terms margin and sales, but also what it means in terms of seating \u2013 customer demand over a longer view. What it means for, what you need in the south in January, what you need in the North in February, and making sure that we're getting those analytics built into buy plans just based on history and forecasting. So, we\u2019re in the early innings of this, but we have appetites to continue to use science really married with the art of a retail fashion business. And if that art and science that I think is what our success formula is going to be at both Bloomingdale's and Macy's.","Oliver Chen","That\u2019s really helpful. Just a follow-up on the long-term story, what do you think is key to driving sustainable positive traffic in transactions and as you speak to a Lord of the initiatives throughout this call, how would you re-orientate them in the context of ensuring that you\u2019re attracting younger customer as well, and balancing your appeal to millennials and Generation Z? Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","I think long-range, it\u2019s really the combination between robust digital growth, you better be online and you better be in a way that you are top of mind for your customer. Your mobile app is going to be incredibly important in the future, and so when you think about how the mobile app is being used as wallet and how transactions need to go through that, how it needs to be done is kind of their guide to a store and all product categories and then how it gives them access to services or stylists or a style crew, your mobile app has got to play all three of those buckets effortlessly, and at the same time removing friction in the customer journey between off-line and online.","So, I would give that a, you know and then when you marry that with a healthy brick-and-mortar fleet, so strong digital, really strong mobile app, and healthy brick-and-mortar that\u2019s Macy's and other multichannel retailer\u2019s competitive moat, and that's where we are really focused. As that relates to the younger consumer, it\u2019s interesting when you look at the Macy's brand. You know, we\u2019re very attracted to the younger consumer in certain businesses and we have opportunity and others. We know where that is. We know what we need to do and that\u2019s what we're working on. If you look at the men's clothing that\u2019s a great example. ","We are one of the headlines in terms of the men's clothing business and it\u2019s amazing when you look at the amount of younger customers that are entering our store through men's clothing purchase. So, we have \u2013 that\u2019s a headline, we have others, but we are very focused on the customer of tomorrow. While doing that, we want to make sure that we're not alienating the customer that\u2019s already in our tent. And so, when you look at our payment terms and loyalty, if you think about the bronze program, you think about what we're doing with Backstage, vendor direct, those are all initiatives that will broaden our customer profile to get to younger customers.","Oliver Chen","Really helpful. Thanks a lot for the details. Best regards.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you.","Paula Price","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Gennette","Thank you everybody. Appreciate everybody's time and attention.","Paula Price","Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"14000":["Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) Q3 2016 Earnings Call November 10, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Analysts","Randal J.

Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Great, thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Macy's, Inc. conference call scheduled to discuss our third quarter earnings. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company.","Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.MacysInc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","We are pleased with our third quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations. As we have said all year, we are in the process of setting ourselves up for a comeback, and we remain on that path. We are on track to deliver our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.40. And we are increasing our sales guidance to an annual decline of 2.5% to 3% on an owned plus licensed basis versus our prior guidance of minus 3% to minus 4%. And in addition to feeling good about our operating performance, we're also pleased by the progress we've made on the real estate front. We'll talk more about this later.","So let's start with some commentary on the third quarter. I'll then update you on our progress with our real estate strategy, talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter, and then end by taking your questions.","Sales in the third quarter were $5.626 billion, down 4.2% from last year and down 2.7% on a comp owned plus licensed basis. Our growth strategies are beginning to gain traction in our top doors and in key areas such as fine jewelry, shoes and home. Plus, we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our apparel businesses; men's, women's and kids'. We were pleased that the performance improved for many of our major apparel brands during the quarter, including our exclusive brands such as INC and Tommy Hilfiger.","We also saw strength in shoes, fragrances and soft home, which includes textiles, tabletop and housewares. These trends are offsetting some of the weakness in handbags, cosmetics and fashion watches.","It's actually was encouraging that our fashion watch trend did improve, as our expanded tech watch assortment hit our stores and websites late in the quarter, including products from brands like Apple and Michael Kors. The category trends were generally similar at both Macy's and Bloomingdale's.","Our digital business had another strong quarter, with double digit gains at both Macys.com and Bloomingdales.com.","Geographically, our business was strongest throughout the West. International tourist sales stabilized during the quarter and were down in line with the rest of our sales. As a result, the international tourist business did not have a meaningful impact on our sales in total, although it still represented a headwind for our major international tourist stores for both Bloomingdale's and Macy's.","Average unit retail increased 3.5% in the third quarter, which is great news. This compares to a 1.6% increase in the first half of the year. This helped offset the impact of 6% fewer transactions in the third quarter. This was the same reduction in transactions as we saw in the first half of the year.","As we discussed after the second quarter, we continue to be optimistic about Bluemercury as well as our Backstage shops within our Macy's stores. In the fourth quarter, we are testing putting Backstage pop-up apparel shops in approximately 45 Macy's doors, with merchandise being procured by our Backstage team. This merchandise will be put adjacent to our Last Act clearance areas and, like Last Act, will be coupon free.","In addition, in 13 of these stores, we're also adding some new categories of merchandise being procured by the Backstage team, including toys, home decor and queue products. Those are the items you often see as you're waiting to check out at various retailers. We've put this queue product adjacent to the highest-traffic POS locations in these 13 stores. We think these could end up being additive to many of our Macy's locations.","We also remain encouraged by the learnings and progress being made in China. Not only are we developing a potentially large high-growth business, but, as importantly, we are learning about ways we could improve our digital business in the United States as well as how we could assort our stores and websites to better serve the Chinese consumer, whether living in the U.S. or traveling here.","Gross margin rate in the third quarter was 39.8%, equal to a year ago. We are very pleased with this performance. It reflects the benefit of lower inventory levels and the impact of our Last Act clearance strategy. At the end of the quarter, comparable inventory was down approximately 3%. This gives us great liquidity, providing us the flexibility to react to trends during the fourth quarter.","SG&A in the quarter was $2.071 billion, up 5.2% versus last year. Much of this increase is related to lower asset sale gains this year. We recognized $41 million of these gains in the third quarter this year, which compares to $78 million last year.","As you know, asset sales will be lumpy by quarter and are hard to forecast. Most of the gains in the quarter this year relate to the transaction announced last week with General Growth Properties as well as the $9 million booked relating to the Brooklyn transaction in the quarter. If you exclude these gains in both years, SG&A dollars were up 3.2%. This is consistent with what we expected, but I suspect it may seem high to you, given our performance earlier in the year.","We continue to benefit from both the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015, and also the store closures, but these benefits are being more than offset by other increases including selling, where we are investing in our key locations as well as in the strategic families of business I mentioned earlier. This staffing is supporting our growth strategies and incorporates the omni-channel activities that we now ask our store associates to perform. This investment is resulting in improved customer service scores, and we expect higher sales, albeit on a lag basis.","We're also continuing to invest in digital growth as well as in our Bluemercury, China and Backstage initiatives. And our earnings from credit were $165 million in the third quarter, which is $12 million lower than a year ago. Our overall sales reduction hurts our credit income and this was magnified by a reduction in the usage of our proprietary card.","Proprietary card penetration was still very high in the third quarter, at 48.5%, but it was 80 basis points lower than a year ago. The lower credit sales, combined with slightly lower portfolio yields, continue to negatively impact the income produced relative to a year ago. Having said that, our credit portfolio continues to be very strong in terms of its return on assets.","Operating income in the quarter, excluding settlement charge related to our retirement plans, was $169 million. The non-cash settlement charges in the quarter were $62 million on a pre-tax basis, or $0.12 per share after-tax.","Interest expense was $81 million; tax expense, $11 million. So net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $17 million. Excluding settlement charges and impairments from both years, net profit was $54 million this year, down from last year's $186 million. Average diluted share count in the quarter was 310.6 million shares.","Earnings per share were $0.05 this quarter as compared to $0.36 last year. Excluding settlement and impairment charges, earnings were $0.17 per share in the quarter this year, down from $0.56 per share last year. And while well below a year ago, this performance is consistent with our expectations and the annual guidance which we had provided.","For the nine months of this year, cash provided by operating activities was $308 million, which is $30 million higher than a year ago. This is primarily due to the reduction in inventory net of payables, which resulted from our store closings and our efforts to improve inventory turnover. And, as you heard earlier, this reduction in inventory is helping not only our cash, but also our gross margin rate and potentially our sales as well.","Cash used by investing activities was $491 million this year, $370 million lower than last year. This is due to $159 million lower capital spending, higher proceeds from our asset sales and last year's acquisition of Bluemercury. Therefore, our cash flow before financing activities is $400 million above last year. We did resume our stock buyback in the quarter, buying back 3 million shares, utilizing $108 million of cash. And year-to-date, we have bought back 6 million shares for $238 million.","At the end of the quarter, we had accessed the commercial paper market for $52 million, which was a lower amount than we had anticipated. And we expect to be out of the short-term debt market by early December, following a $577 million debt maturity payment on December 1.","With the strong cash flow and the proceeds from asset sales expected in the coming months, many of you are asking about how we plan to utilize this cash. As you know, we always start with funding our business needs. We then look to utilize excess cash for returns to our shareholders through our dividend and through repurchasing stock. We may also repurchase debt at some point, to help make sure that our credit ratios get back to within our targeted range in a reasonable amount of time. We are currently above our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 2.8.","This ratio was 3.3 at the end of the third quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis. Remember that that does include the weak fourth quarter last year. But we will look at the balance sheet and the ratios at year-end, in conjunction with our plan for the next few years, before we make any decisions on our future utilization of excess cash.","In addition to our as-expected operating results in the quarter, we made a great deal of progress on real estate. Our real estate strategy can be divided into three parts. The first is our flagship assets which, as you know, we have defined as Herald Square in New York, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago and our downtown Minneapolis store. We have signed a contract to sell our Union Square men's building. This separate building is approximately 250,000 square feet, and we are selling it for approximately $250 million. We expect this transaction to close in January.","We will utilize a part of the proceeds to consolidate our men's merchandise back into the main Union Square store and to make it an even more exciting shopping experience. We will be leasing the men's building back for two to three years as we complete this construction. We will receive the cash for this transaction in January when it closes, but under GAAP, we will be not be booking the approximately $235 million gain until January of 2018.","We also are continuing to explore options for downtown Minneapolis, Chicago and Herald Square. Of the three, we expect Herald Square will take the longest to determine the best approach for potentially creating value, given its size and complexity.","The second component of our real estate strategy relates to the approximately 100 stores we intend to close. As we discussed last quarter, most of these are under-performing stores and are less critical to our footprint, but a few represent opportunities where we believe the real estate value exceeds the value as a retail entity. We announced today that we have a signed contract to sell our downtown Portland store. This transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter, with proceeds of approximately $54 million and a book gain of approximately $36 million. This store will be closed in early 2017.","Additionally, as you saw last week, we sold five locations to GGP for a total of $48 million. One of these stores is already closed. Three will close in early 2017, and we will continue to lease back and operate Tyson's Galleria while GGP determines the best use for this property. There are also two other stores that we will be closing: Douglaston in New York; and Lancaster Mall in Salem, Oregon. These are being closed based on the timing of lease terminations and expirations.","So, in total, as of today, we have closed or announced plans to close eight stores as part of the 100 stores discussed last quarter, with Tyson's Galleria being sold in leaseback. We are working on many other transactions like these for the locations that we believe we should close.","While Eastdil Secured continues to advise us on the flagship properties and other significant assets, we have also now engaged CBRE to help facilitate the disposition of the majority of our closed or to-be-closed locations.","That brings us to the third component of our real estate strategy, which is to create value from our remaining real estate portfolio. Macy's has real estate assets with significant value creation opportunities, but we recognize that realizing these opportunities will often require alternative uses for the property and some amount of related development. We sought out a world-class partner with both capital and strong platform capabilities to help us with this component of our strategy, and we found this in Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield is one of the leading global investors in real estate, spanning all major sectors; office, multi-family, hospitality and retail, particularly regional malls.","As you can imagine, there was tremendous interest among real estate investors to partner with Macy's. We are very excited about the potential of this alliance. We believe that the potential risk-adjusted value from pursuing this path on these assets could be significantly higher than the outright sales today.","We have kept this alliance as simple as we could. In short, we are giving Brookfield an exclusive right for up to 24 months to create a pre-development plan on each of approximately 50 assets that are initially included in this agreement. We have the option to add additional assets to this alliance in the future.","These to-be-redeveloped assets are a combination of: stores; portions of stores; and outparcels, both adjacent to our stores and, in some cases, in our parking fields. While we might close stores in some of these locations, it is more likely that we will create value with surplus land or through improvements alongside an existing store.","The locations initially chosen are varied in their quality. These are just not all our A mall locations. This should give us insight into the potential of our total portfolio. And, in most cases, the assets that we initially have selected are not in malls with the major mall owners.","Potential redevelopments in this strategic alliance can range to what we would call modest to more substantial opportunities, and will factor in feasibility as well as impact on store operations.","On the modest side, Macy's has successfully done this ourselves, for example: adding restaurants within the Bloomingdale's in South Coast Plaza in Southern California; or putting in a Louis Vuitton shop outside our flagship store in Union Square in San Francisco. The great thing, though, about this alliance is it allows us to keep our focus as a top retailer while optimizing our real estate, doing it in scale and potentially thinking much bigger.","And a hypothetical example of a more substantial redevelopment opportunity could be the following. Take an eight-acre standalone 100,000 square foot furniture store. One idea might be to move the furniture operations back into a nearby Macy's mall location, demolish the furniture store, and then densify the site with a newly-built, for example, 100,000 square foot of retail, a new parking garage and a mid-rise residential tower.","Brookfield will clearly help us think big and then will help us execute redevelopment opportunities more quickly. So as a first step with this alliance, we, and a dedicated team at Brookfield, will work together to assess the feasibility of the development of assets.","Once a plan for a particular asset is developed, Macy's will have the ability to proceed or not to redevelop this asset. If we choose to redevelop the asset, the property will then be contributed into redevelopment joint venture. Macy's can then, at that point, decide to take a cash settlement or contribute and participate in the redevelopment joint venture. And if we stay in as a partner in the joint venture, it is likely that upon stabilization, the redevelopment project would be sold and then profits distributed.","We are very excited by this alliance, and look forward to starting the work. We believe that having this single significant partnership will align interests and improve both communication and execution as compared to working with separate developers for each opportunity.","Terry, Jeff and I have confidence that Brookfield's senior management is committed to making this alliance successful, and they share our optimism about the potential. We will continue to update you as we move forward on all three of these components of our real estate strategy. Our real estate team, along with our advisors, are doing a terrific job maximizing opportunities in our portfolio in a thoughtful way, while balancing the desire to move quickly.","Let's now move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. The trend improvements relative to the spring season that we saw in the third quarter, combined with a more normal weather pattern, stabilization in international tourist sales and the mix benefit of the higher proportion of digital sales that happened in the holiday season, make us confident that we will be able to deliver an improved comp owned plus licensed sales trend in the fourth quarter. We are expecting comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis to be down approximately 0.5% to down 2% in the quarter, and we are expecting at least a 100 basis point improvement in the gross margin rate this year in the fourth quarter. Given our inventory position and our Last Act strategy, we believe this to be achievable. Remember, last year, our gross margin rate dropped 290 basis points versus 2014, so we do have a lot of room to improve.","SG&A is expected to be up over last year in both dollars and rate in the fourth quarter. The investments in growth will continue, and we expect the income to be worse than last year by approximately $50 million to $60 million in the quarter. We recognize the expense investment needed to support our growth initiatives is not insignificant, and we are very focused on identifying opportunities for profit improvement in 2017, including decreasing our non-payroll spend, improving the efficiency of our store operations and making sure we are structured to be both agile and cost-effective. We don't have any specifics to report at this time, but know that this is an important part of our setup for our comeback.","Also, we are experiencing an additional delay in the construction of Brooklyn, and, as a result, the timing for booking of the gain is getting delayed more into 2017 and 2018.","We now expect to book only $27 million this year. This is $59 million, or $0.12 per share, lower than what we expected early in 2016 when we originally gave earnings guidance. While not insignificant, we remain comfortable that we can cover this shortfall and are sticking with our earnings guidance, but not changing guidance is actually a $0.12 per share increase in our expectations from operations.","In the fourth quarter, we expect to book a $4 million gain associated with Brooklyn. We are also anticipating other non-flagship asset sales, including the Portland gain of approximately $100 million, which will take our annual number to approximately $150 million, which is consistent with the guidance at the start of the year. As you can tell, we are expecting quite a few transactions to close over the next few months.","Depreciation and amortization for the year is now estimated at approximately $1.055 billion. We are still tracking to our guidance for capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year. We expect interest expense of roughly $365 million and still the effective annual tax rate of approximately 37%. All of these assumptions support our guidance for our setup year.","Our top management team here at Macy's is stronger than ever. The combination of some very experienced executives and recently-added talent is very powerful. The new senior executives bring important capabilities and experiences to the team, complementing those of us with deep history with the company. We are all energized by the new perspectives and know that this will have a positive impact on the business going forward.","As we outlined today, our organization is focused on doing all that we can to execute our strategies and drive the strong performance that will lead to a successful fourth quarter and improved results in 2017 and beyond. We head into the holidays with some momentum of some positive trends and with optimism in our assortments and marketing strategies. We have a lot of distinctive product and newness in our stores for holiday. And we feel great that our customer proposition is compelling, including our new Brookstone shops, our investment in the tech watch business, including Apple and Michael Kors, and our new Holiday Arcade, full of wonderful gift ideas.","We love this time of year. Macy's is the destination for great holiday gift-giving. And we are uniquely equipped to deliver the complete experience: great product; best-in-class omni-channel capability; and the store animation and holiday traditions that are so cherished by customers across the country.","And now, why don't I open the call for your questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our first question from Randy Konik with Jefferies.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Oh, thanks a lot. Hi, Karen. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","A couple things; one, I think it's very encouraging you're seeing these AUR trends improve. So I just wanted to get a little bit more color on if you think \u2013 obviously, the inventory control is very positive as well. Is this more of an inventory control factor? Are you seeing more firmer pricing acceptance by the consumer or is it mix related, just a little bit more elaboration there? And then, within the...go ahead, I'm sorry.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Oh, go ahead...","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","And then, lastly, just to elaborate on the trend in apparel, just so we can get some perspective on, it sounds like that category picked up. The weather wasn't as favorable. Now we're getting more favorable weather. So just kind of curious on, holistically, the inventory control, those are more long term factors where the consumers act from a price acceptance perspective and then a little bit more near-term on just the trends in apparel, given the weather, et cetera. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I think the AUR increase is a combination of inventory control and having the right inventory and mix. And in terms of the apparel trends, we have seen really good business, and, again, across the board: men's, kids' and women's, lots of good things in denim and dresses and active, as I mentioned, the major brands. So it really is across the board. And frankly, the weather hasn't been so favorable, so if the weather turns cold \u2013 and today is a little colder, at least in New York \u2013 hopefully, that helps as well. But it's very encouraging.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Karen. A lot of your department store CFO peers are retiring. Certainly hope that you are able to hang out with us a little bit longer.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Certainly wanted to ask about the SG&A. I know there's a few components and moving pieces here, but if you can just kind of maybe walk us through some of the changes. I believe that earlier in the year, you highlighted expectations for dollars to be down year-over-year. If you can just speak to SG&A expectations now, both what happened in the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter, with real estate and excluding it, what's changed?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, we actually had said early in the year that we expected it to be flattish, not down. I think now the year will be slightly up. But, again, if you focus on the annual, the increase feels reasonable, and that's the way I would think about it, if I were you. The credit performance has been worse than we had expected, so that's one piece of the reason for the increase; still a very strong profitability, but with credit sales declining, harder to keep the credit income dollars. And, as we've said, we are investing in some of these growth initiatives, which are great from a bottom line perspective but do add to expense. So I would say focus on the annual as you're thinking about SG&A and not necessarily the fall season.","The other thing I would say to you is that we continue to want to keep investing in these growth initiatives, so we are looking really deep to find additional SG&A reductions that, as I said, either are low-hanging fruit, if there are such things at this point, but also trying to make the organization more cost-effective, more agile and things like that. So it's sort of a combined message, but I don't think, on an annual basis, we're going to be that far different from what we had said at the start of the year.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Morning.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Why do you think the private label credit card penetration has gone down? And did you say credit income would be down $50 million to $60 million? I guess I just wanted to know if that's simply the sales or if you're expecting any deterioration in metrics there.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No. We had always expected the fourth quarter drop to be significant, having to do, frankly, just with quarters and the way it flowed last year. So the fact that it's down by more than it has been in other quarters is not new news. That's how we had expected it from the beginning of the year. It has been lower than we had expected, but we always expected that big drop in the fourth quarter.","I think on penetration last year, it was up quite a bit in the third quarter, so it may just be on a two-year basis, it looks fine. But we are working hard to think about strategies for improving that metric in terms of the penetration. And again, it's still at a very high level, but I think you'll see us focus on this as we go forward.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","And I know that there's a lot of moving pieces around SG&A, but I think there's some debate out there as to when we think about next year's growth rate, would it be closer to your full-year flat or the exit rate, which will be up low single digits?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I'd focus on the annual.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","Okay, great.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","As we go forward. And again, we'll give a lot more color to that as we proceed.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research","All right. Thanks, Karen.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","...so much, Karen. Macy's is uniquely positioned as doing a great job with merchants and vendor relationships. So as you think about long-term investors and the long-run strategy, what are your thoughts about being un-Amazonable in terms of what you'll continue to do to innovate, just to make sure that your value proposition and convenience proposition is leading? And how should we think about the long-run in terms of traffic? Like, do you think the setup for next year is going to be a positive traffic year? I'd just love your thoughts on that long-term factor, as we want to see you gain share.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, I think the first question is a good one, one we think about, but I do think that our organization and, as you said, our merchants be able to curate the market, find the right product really is a competitive advantage relative to Amazon. And when you combine that with the really terrific store organization that we have, I do believe for fashion, customers still love going into the stores, trying things on. Even if they end up buying online from our apps, they still experience the store. And so I think both of those will allow us to always compete effectively against an Amazon; doesn't mean that an Amazon won't do a lot of business. I'm not saying that.","But I think in the categories that we carry, most of them, I do think the omni-channel is a benefit and the quality of our merchant team, both in terms of our private brands. Our MMG team is spectacular. And developing product that will only be available at Macy's will be a piece of that as well. And also given (37:49) the customers, frankly, that you can only get at Macy's. So it's a combination of those factors that I think will enable us to compete effectively against an Amazon.","In terms of the traffic and transactions, that's obviously a harder thing to predict. And that's partly why we're so happy to see the AUR doing well, with our inventory levels and clearance strategy working. So I think we'll do everything we can to grow the number of transactions, but it don't think we'll count on that as we go into next year.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And, Karen, can we get your take? Now that the election's over, is that a positive catalyst? It's very hard to answer this, I believe, but would love...","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Therefore, I'm not going to answer it. I have no clue. I have no clue. We'll all watch together.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, it's great to hear the green shoots on apparel, so people are out there and interested.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I agree.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. Karen, I'm wondering if you could perhaps look out over the next one, two, three years and talk to us about how we should think about just SG&A growth from here. What might be the puts and takes? Obviously, we would expect to see some savings from store operations, as an example, as you work through the next 100 closures, but I'm wondering if you can just sort of give us the pluses and minuses on the SG&A ledger as we go forward. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","That's a hard question, Kimberly, to answer sort of off-the-cuff, and we're in the process, obviously, of developing plans for next year. But I think you're going to see factors similar to what we've seen this year. We do want to invest in growth; digital, you know, both software, but also, obviously, delivery costs and things like that that add to expense. Also, obviously, wage pressure, particularly in the field, is an issue. But we are working hard to find offsets to all of that.","And so I think when we give guidance next year, we can be more fulsome in terms of the puts and takes, at least as we go forward. But I think we're being realistic about projecting what we think we need, both to spend and also save, as we move forward.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, Karen. And just to follow-up on the real estate, if I could, obviously, you've got an ambitious plan of this next 100 store closures that you've already announced. I'm wondering as you continue to evaluate the rest of the fleet beyond the 100 that you've targeted, do you have any thoughts on additional opportunities for real estate actions beyond that next 100? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Do you mean that, Kimberly, in terms of closures?","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Potential closures...","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Beyond the 100?","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, potential closures beyond the 100. Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, when we announced the 100 a couple of months ago, we had looked out a couple of years, and so at this point, I do believe that's roughly the number of closures we expect. Having said that, as I talked about with the Brookfield alliance, we are looking to potentially redevelop area around stores, parts of stores beyond that. But in terms of closures, at this point, the 100 is what we anticipate, roughly.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much, Karen.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Good morning.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to ask a little bit on inventory. It's been an important topic for apparel retailers and vendors across the last couple quarters, and whether, as you think about over the next couple quarters or longer-term, what the opportunities are to get more efficient, maybe how you're working with some of your \u2013 either in your private label or with some of your most important partners to do that.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, we're always trying to make decisions as close as we can to when the merchandise is going to arrive in store, so we're doing that both with private brand and also working with the vendors. And, in part, that's why we like the flexibility that the lower inventory is giving us. But we're constantly looking for ways of making the whole supply chain more efficient, whether it be private brand or with our major partners. It's one of the benefits of the great partnerships we have, as Oliver mentioned a few minutes ago.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And just a follow-up on your loyalty programs or your credit card, whether there's any special initiatives we should be looking forward to in the next couple quarters?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","At this point, no, but something we are working on.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Hi, Paul.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, there. Karen, you'd mentioned, I think, positive trends heading into holiday; I think what you said. So can you maybe talk about the sales trajectory over the quarter? Sorry if I missed that.","And then separately, can you quantify the gross margin benefit from Last Act? And maybe as you think about fourth quarter specifically, how much of the improvement that you expect is from the Last Act strategy versus just being in a much better position from an inventory perspective? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I'm not sure I could answer that question in terms of what's Last Act and what's being in a better \u2013 it all works together. So, sorry, I'm not going to be able to help with that one.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And on the sales trajectory over the quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I think I would look at the quarter in total. Promotional events move around, so it's really hard to give an answer that would be helpful, but we were pleased that the third quarter was better than what we had experienced in the first half of the year as we head into the fourth quarter.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, just one follow-up; you closed 40 stores last year. Can you talk about what you've seen on the sales recapture? Whether or not you're getting the levels that you were hoping for? Where's it coming, either at another store or online? And how does that make you think about the 100 to come this year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, I would say we're doing a little bit better than what we had anticipated with those stores. One of the good things that has happened is in a multi-store market, when we close a store, we are no longer losing business online, which was something we had experienced a couple of years ago. So we've been able to improve on that. In a single store market, we'd still lose .com business when we close a store, but at least in a multi-store market, that isn't happening. So that's really good news.","We're also finding that we're able to retain more of the sales; in part, because we're making these decisions and thinking about our assortment earlier, which is helpful. So I think we feel better about our abilities to do that, and we keep refining our assortment strategies and our marketing strategies so that we can even retain more of the sales as we go to close, obviously, a much bigger number.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, Karen. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Hey, Matt.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So on capital allocation, you resumed some share repurchase this quarter. Can you just talk about the criteria that you considered and then, just how to think about debt paydown versus buyback versus dividend as we think going forward?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, I think you all will remember that the first quarter was a worse quarter than we had anticipated, and that was the time at which we lowered our sales and earnings guidance for the year. And we, frankly, just said, you know what? We don't know what's going to happen. Let's wait and see if the second quarter improves, just to be sure, before we head into the fall. The second quarter, obviously, improved quite a bit and gave us the stability and confidence to resume the buyback. So that's really the thinking there.","In terms of allocation going forward, as I said, use for the business always comes first, but, again, we don't see a dramatic increase in spending needed to do that. And so there will be lots of cash available, both for the dividend, buyback, and also we may do some debt repurchases depending on how we end the year, because we've always said having a healthy balance sheet is really important to the company. And we just may decide to do that. But, again, we're not making those decisions until we get through the end of the year.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then, just a follow-up; if we think about this quarter, so if we think about sales, gross margin and SG&A, what was actually above or below your plan in the third quarter? I know there were some moving pieces on the street.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Honestly, it was all just about as we anticipated. Sales were as we anticipated. Margin was, as was SG&A. Asset sale gains moved around a little bit, but that's the only thing. And that's always going to happen.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Good morning.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Two questions; I guess one is on your Q4 comp guidance. I guess listening to some of your vendors talking about quality of sales initiatives, pulling back on friends and family, just curious; have you already contemplated some of those vendors not participating as much in the Q4 events around holiday? And then the second question, we had a chance to go visit the Easton store prototype, and we were wondering what could be the pacing of some of those initiatives that we saw in that store rolling out to the majority of the fleet next year, if you could just maybe highlight some of the key takeaways.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, in terms of the sales guidance, the answer is yes. If you think about our guidance of minus 0.5% to minus 2%, on a two-year basis, the minus 0.5% is, frankly, comparable with year-to-date. And the minus 2% on a two-year basis is consistent with the third quarter. So I think it's all very reasonable as you're looking forward. And, yes, we have contemplated the changes that you're referring to.","In terms of Easton, we're obviously still monitoring the results. One of the things we've seen a lot of success with was the tech watch installation and that has already been rolled out as we head into the holidays, as we got very quick feedback. Also, some of the fine jewelry initiatives that, as you know, we had piloted in California but did some new things in Easton that we're also rolling out, so, yes, we are beginning to take those learnings and move forward.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much, and good luck for holiday.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move on to our next question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Hey, Bob.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just got a couple of questions; when you think about the fourth quarter competitive environment and your gross margin comparison versus last year, I think you said up at least 100 basis points. What are the biggest opportunities to recapture versus that almost 300...?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","All of it relates to the inventory position.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. And in terms of like cold weather inventories, can you just talk about your positioning there going into the next six months? (49:50)","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, so we had a few very cold winters than we had last year with the 70 degree weather in most of the country in December. And so this year, we tried to sort of take an average of the two and think about it that way. But if it ends up being a lot colder, there's no question we'll get more inventory if we need it. And if it ends up being as warm as last year, we'll probably have some excess inventory, but, hopefully, we'll work our way through that.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then, on the Backstage piece of the business, can you just talk about how you're buying inventory there, sort of the collaborative efforts throughout the organization...?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, we've got a whole separate organization, very small, by the way, but quite busy doing our Backstage buying. And in most cases or in a lot of cases, going to completely different vendors and, in some case, merchandise that we don't even carry in the store. So, in part, the test that we're doing this fall with those 45 stores in putting men's and women's apparel purchased by our Backstage buyers the way that they do, and putting that merchandise next to Last Act and, like Last Act being coupon ineligible, we think is going to be an interesting test to see about bringing new product in. In the 13 stores, we're actually putting categories in that we don't carry in the store.","So, for example, in toys, we'll have high-end scooters or Big Wheels. In home decor, things like decorative figurines, pet accessories, the kinds of things that we don't sell in a typical Macy's that we think the Backstage buyers are better equipped to buy, and we'll see how it sells in the stores. So we're actually excited about these tests, and we'll see.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. And then, just one last question is on the shipping expense, as you think about the holiday season this year, can you just talk about how you're approaching minimums in terms of shipping or free shipping or how we should think about that piece of the business in gross margin?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, there is going to be a lot of, as you might imagine, reduced shipping thresholds offered throughout the holiday season, but relatively comparable to a year ago. So I don't see any major change, unless the business grows a lot more than we're anticipating, which we hope happens.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, Karen. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Good morning.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a question for you with respect to your comment in your prepared remarks about getting your leverage back to the leverage target range within a reasonable time. Can you tell me, is that reasonable time something that is determined internally or in concert with the rating agencies? How are you thinking about that?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, obviously, we always would take rating agency views into consideration, but it is something that we'll talk about internally. Our desire to have a healthy balance sheet is internally-driven. And so, we will take feedback, but we will make the decision ourselves.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And I think I heard you also say in your prepared remarks that you're planning to pay off the maturity that is coming due December 1, as opposed to refinancing that. Is that correct?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","That's correct.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you, Karen.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move on to our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Karen. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Hi, Michael. Good morning.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for all the detail today, very helpful. If I just look at the average unit retail trend, I know it was asked a little bit, but if I look back over a couple of years and just try to think of multi-year average unit retails, so snapping back a bit. That's correlated with you guys getting lean and mean on the comp inventories. But as we look ahead to next year, there's going to be some new inputs to that line, namely, you're shutting down stores that I'm guessing are in markets where you'd have a lower AUR. Can you help us think about as we look out to next year, do you feel like as you go into the strategic initiatives that you have with the store closures and now that we've lapped the AUR reductions a year ago, do you think we're going to end up in a place where AUR is still contributing in a positive basis or even contributing substantially next year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","We expect it to contribute positively as we go forward.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And that's because of the store closures or are lower AUR or not? I just want to be clear on that. (54:38)","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","It's everything. It's everything.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","And then, let me ask you similarly on transactions; were you surprised to see the transactions not lift off a little bit in the third quarter as the compares got easier? And how are you thinking about that as you go into next year, again considering you have some smaller stores you'll be closing that I'm guessing have traffic issues?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, and look, our hope is that a lot of these growth initiatives and the things that we're doing in terms of improving service in our stores, as well as improvements on our apps, will actually help improve upon that trend in terms of traffic. So we'll see as we go forward.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Karen.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move on our next question from Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much, guys. And, Karen, could you talk about the partners you have in stores, starting with Lids and just going through the list and how they're performing, how the partnerships are working out and opportunities you see in that way as a, I guess, a partner or a landlord with some these companies? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, look, we have had great success both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's with these licensed partners, whether it be Sunglass Hut, Finish Line or a lot of the vendors that are licensed at Bloomingdale's. And it's a great way of bringing product into the store where we can't have access or don't have access to it on our own. And so, we continue to look for ways of bringing either new categories or new vendors or new products into our store in that way, if that makes the most sense. So I think it will be an important part of our strategy as we go forward.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Anything you can share with us for either holiday or for next year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Not at this point.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you, Karen. Couple questions; Backstage, is it fair to say that that strategy seems to be going forward less focused on standalone stores and more kind of utilizing your asset base on your existing stores?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes, because, again, we can't do everything. And we're getting such success in store because not only is Backstage doing well, but it's improving the productivity of most of the base stores, which is a good thing. So that's where we've decided to put our focus, at least for now.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Next question; it would seem that you're getting a better recapture rate in your closed doors this year, and it seems like that would be a tailwind for you guys next year with a greater number of store closings. What kind of recapture rate, or range of recapture, are you seeing? And what would you expect so we can think about what kind of comp lift you may be able to get, all things being equal, for next year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","It is not significant, even though it's 100 stores closing, in terms of the lift on total stores. It's a little bit, but not as much as you might think, in terms of the impact. So even with significant retention, it doesn't do that much for the comp growth.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So tens of basis points as opposed to anything like a hundred.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes. Exactly.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then, a lot of investors are trying to get their arms around sort of the value creation potential from your real estate and, obviously, a significant step forward with Brookfield. I mean, should we think about this in terms of hundreds of millions, more than $1 billion? Like what's kind of the range of potential value creation that you could get from this setup?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I don't know the answer to that. We're obviously just starting to explore. We do think it's significant. And we do also hope that it helps the retail operation as we do this, so the value could come in a couple of buckets, but, at this point, it's just premature.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then, last question, if I could sneak it in. The fashion watch business was a big driver for you, then a big headwind. Do you see this business potentially comping positive again with some of the innovations you're seeing in tech watches? And is this something that could help lift your center core business?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, it's a little early to be judging, but it feels good. Whether it gets to that point, David, it's just too early to tell, but it does feel good.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much. Good luck in the fourth quarter.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Wayne Hood with BMO Capital.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Morning.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I was just wondering, as you think about Macy's contribution to redevelopment capital into a potential JV with Brookfield, are those: one, would you be willing to put up a significant amount of capital; or are some of those assets that would be put into that JV, are they leverageable so you really wouldn't necessarily have a big high capital redevelopment cost?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Way early too early to make those decisions. We have to see what the plans look like and what value creation opportunities we think it provides for us.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And would you anticipate retaining control of any JV structure that you put together with them?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","It's just too early, Wayne.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Another question, unrelated to Brookfield, was just on Michigan Avenue; when you look at what your competitors have done there and you look at your location, it looks like it \u2013 obviously, you've talked about it in the past. Maybe remodel capital may be needed. What's your current thinking about the remodel capital for that store? Can you also enter into a JV where you have a partner that comes in and contributes capital and the timing of anything that might need to take place there?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Are you talking about Water Tower or the Bloomingdale's?","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","No. Water Tower.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","We have remodeled the store. I can't imagine us bringing in a partner to remodel a store.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","No, I know you did.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","We have sufficient cash.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, I know you did, but I guess my point is you still feel like it's competitive in that marketplace, even with that remodel?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","The store is doing well.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Final question; the $900 million in capital spending that you expect this year, should we be thinking about that as a trough number or given things like redevelopment capital, that that number probably goes to $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion? How should we be thinking about that number?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I'm not sure what you mean by trough, but, as I said, part of the proceeds, for example, at Union Square men's, are going to go to putting men's back into the main Union Square store. So that spending would be incremental to the capital budget, but, at this point, I don't anticipate it going up as high as what you're talking about.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. So relatively stable. Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes.","Lowell Wayne Hood - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. Thanks, Karen.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our final question from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay, good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","A couple of real quick questions; first of all, good to see that the tourist markets are stabilizing, but if my math is correct, if you adjust out the impact from the tourist drag in Q2, your comps in Q2 were down 1.4%. And let's say it was relatively neutral in Q3. That would make minus 2.7%. So it looks like sequentially, you've actually seen a weakening in comps, and I'm wondering, am I looking at that correctly?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No. What you have to do, Jeff, and I said this after the second quarter, is really looking at the spring season rather than just the second quarter, just because of some shifts. The first quarter was worse than it should been. The second quarter was better. So I would look at the spring season and how that flows into the third quarter.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Got it. And wondering if you could just comment on two businesses; one, cosmetics, and the other, footwear; I think earlier in the year, you indicated that you're doing some tests similar to what you did in jewelry on the West Coast in footwear, and wondering how that's working. And exactly, what are you doing differently in footwear? And secondly, what your thinking is with respect to the weaker performance in cosmetics relative to some of the performance we've seen from other specialty retailers, like Sephora and ULTA, which seem to be taking some share, and what you might be doing to mitigate that?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, on the shoe business, you're correct. We did start a pilot earlier in the year that is doing extremely well. And our shoe business was actually one of the callouts in total for strength in the third quarter. So we feel very good about what we have done there. And as a result of the strength in fine jewelry and in shoes based on our changes in the business trends with our strategies, we've now moved on to cosmetics.","And so cosmetics was one of the weaker businesses in the third quarter. And we're now focused on improving that, like we've done with jewelry and like we've done with shoes. Oftentimes, you guys think of cosmetics as both sort of color, skincare and fragrances; should point out that the fragrance business has been very strong of those sort of three components of what you tend to think of as cosmetics, which, by the way, is great as we head into the fourth quarter, which is a heavy penetration of fragrance. But cosmetics, Jeff, is next on our list of attacking to figure out a strategy for making it stronger.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Perfect. And what exactly have you been doing differently in shoes on the West Coast?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","It's been a combination of: editing the assortment; in some cases, displaying the product more by category than vendor; and also, frankly, utilizing technology as well as some more staffing behind-the-scenes, meaning in the stock rooms, to make the shopping experience more friction-free for the customer. So it's sort of the combination of improved assortment, greater editing of the assortment, better service, but it's working extraordinarily well.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","We're also testing, in some stores, open sell, which, for a smaller store, appears to be a very good answer for us. So lots more to come on that, but we feel really good about the business.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Great. Thank you, and, everybody, have a good day.

Today's call is being recorded. And I'd now like to turn the call over to your host Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks, Becky. Good morning and welcome to the Macy\u2019s call. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the Company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the Company, including the risks specified in the Company's most recently filed Form 10-K.","As you saw in our press release, our sales in January were very disappointing. But in spite of that, we ended the quarter and the year very strong in terms of our operating income, earnings per share, and cash flow. Our adjusted earnings per share grew by 16% in 2013, which is our fifth year of double-digit EPS growth. Starting in 2009 when the restructured the Company and began implementing our M.O.M. strategy, My Macy\u2019s, Omnichannel and Magic Selling.","This morning I will talk first about the quarter and then the full-year. After that, I'll discuss our key assumptions in planning 2014. Sales in the fourth quarter were $9,202,000,000, up 1.4% on a comp basis and up 2.3% on a comp basis together with sales and license department. The 2.3% is really the best metrics for gauging customer demand.","Given the conversion of some of our businesses from owned to leased such as the Athletic Shoes during the year. This is really the only way to attract customer purchases on a comparable basis to last year. And on an ongoing basis, even after a conversion, customers make shoes a licensed item versus owned in a similar category. So we'll continue to focus on this metrics.","Also you will note that total sales were down 1.6% in the quarter, because we are comparing this year\u2019s 13 week quarter to last year's 14 week. We were pleased with our November-December sales, but in January our sales fell well short of what we had planned. As a result, we miss the sales guidance that we had provided at the start of the month.","Clearly, much of this weakness resulted from the bitter cold temperatures and the frequent snow events in January, but we\u2019d not attribute all of the weakness to the weather. Back in August, we were assuming 2.5% to 4% comp sales increase for the second half of the year, which we then updated to 2.8% to 2.9% after December.","However, the weak January brought our comp sales for the second half of the year down to 2.3% or 3.2% including sales in license department and well below what we had hoped 3% is feeling like a good performance compared to our competitors. The strongest businesses in the quarter were handbags, cold weather apparel and accessories, our older Millennial apparel or Impulse area, Men's dress apparel and shoes, luggage and furniture and mattresses.","I should also add that we continue to see strengthening in the women's apparel categories overall, which is a very good sign. Private brands were part of the reason for the strengthening in the women's apparel category. The weaker businesses in the quarter relative to their prior trend included watches, fragrances, housewares and tabletop. Juniors continue to be weak, but we did see some improvement in trend, especially the dressier parts of the business.","Geographically as you may suspect, our strongest sales performances were across the South, where weather was not as much of a factor. We also continue to see strength in all of our Omnichannel transactions, whether it would be online purchasing, including transactions on mobile devices, shipping from stores to satisfy online demand and shipping from warehouses to satisfy store demand.","We also tested \"buy online, pickup in store,\" this fall and based on the positive results we\u2019re not -- now rolling this out to all of our stores during the spring season. We continue to find our stores to be important even into our online only buyers whether it would be to check out a color, try something on, browse to get ideas, or make a return.","Bloomingdale's had a better fourth-quarter than Macy's, in part because we experienced less weakness in January in these stores. As with Macy's the Omnichannel transactions helped fuel Bloomingdale's growth.","Average unit retail in the fourth quarter was up approximately 1% with transactions down just under 1% and units per transactions up a little more than 1%. The gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 40.6% flat with last year. We are very pleased with that result, which was better than expected.","Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 4.7% or 4% on a comp basis. This is higher than we had planned as a result of the weak January sales. But this inventory is in the right category, so it doesn't pose a significant markdown risk. We will move this inventory out during the first quarter and hopefully without a noticeable margin impact.","SG&A in the quarter was $2.3 billion, down $99 million or 4.1% versus last year. This reduction is in part due to last year\u2019s extra week in the quarter. But as a percent of sales, SG&A was 25%, 70 basis points below last year. We did benefit in the quarter from $58 million in asset sale gains, a little more than half of which had been planned and included in our prior guidance.","We did not include the other transactions in our guidance even in early January because we were not sure that they were going to close in 2013. This was one of the reasons we were able to beat the upper end of our previous guidance in spite of the weaker sales.","We were also pleased with our credit results in the quarter. Credit income was $6 million above last year consistent with expectations. The usage of our card as measured by penetration was 47.2%, up 20 basis points over last year. This is a positive trend that we hope will continue into 2014.","Operating income excluding impairments, store closings and other costs in the fourth quarter was $1.437 billion, or 2.9% above last year's $1.396 billion. And as a percent of sales, operating income in the quarter on this basis was 15.6%, 70 basis points over last year.","We booked in the quarter $88 million of impairment store closings and other costs of which approximately $45 million are non-cash charges. This is significantly less than the original estimate of $120 million to $135 million. This is largely because we were able to place many more associates than we had expected into open jobs after their positions were eliminated. In the end, we laid off approximately 1,800 employees instead of the original estimate of 2,500, and this will not impact the expectation of the $100 million in annual cost savings.","Interest expense in the quarter was $99 million; $7 million lower than last year. Tax expense was $439 million, $17 million higher than last year. As a rate though it was 35.1% compared to last year's 36.6%. Our tax expense in the quarter included a $13 million adjustment to evaluation allowance because we now anticipate being able to utilize more state loss carryforwards than previously expected. This added $0.03 to our earnings per share and had not been anticipated in our guidance.","Diluted EPS excluding the impairment store closing costs and other costs was $2.31 in the fourth quarter, 12.7% above last year's $2.05 on the same basis. For the full year 2013, our sales were $27.931 billion, up 1.9% on a comp basis or 2.8% together with sales from licensed businesses. This fell below our expected 3.5% comp guidance at this time a year ago, but our earnings per share excluding the impairment store closing and other costs was $4 for 2013, which beat the guidance that we had provided at this time last year of $3.90 to $3.95.","As you'll remember we had lowered the guidance to $3.80 to $3.90 in August after our weak second quarter. We are very happy that we were able to make up that quarter's shortfall during the fall season even without above expectation sales and were able to beat our original guidance. And while our sales were below our own expectations, we hoped that our performance relative to competitors looks strong when we see what everyone reports as it did through the first nine months of the year.","Our gross margin rate for the full year fell 20 basis points below last year due largely to the impact of shipping charges associated with our Omnichannel transactions. Merchandize margins were just slightly down as a result of increased promotional activities needed to fuel the business, especially in the third quarter. SG&A ended up below last year in dollars and 50 basis points below last year as a percent to sales. This was due to a good expense management throughout the company together with asset sales gains, $68 million of higher credit income and $29 million lower depreciation and amortization. In part, these benefits were offset by our continued investments related to our Omnichannel strategy.","Operating income excluding impairments, store closing and other costs for the full year was $2.766 billion, up 3.8% over last year and as a percent of sales up 30 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales was 13.6% for 2013, up 20 basis points over 2012. We continue to march towards our 14% target for EBITDA as a percent of sales. Average share count for the year was 385 million shares which is 7% below last year as a result of our buyback during the year of 33.6 million shares for approximately $1.6 billion. And EPS on a diluted basis excluding the charges previously mentioned was $4 or 15.6% above last year on this basis.","Return on invested capital was 21.4%, 20 basis points over last year. We are very pleased with our performance over the past four years on this metric. Cash provided by operating activities net of investments was $1.761 billion or $363 million higher than last year. This was due to higher EBITDA, lower capital spending as well as higher asset sales. The capital spending did fall below our expectations by $62 million due to timing and much of this will carry over to 2014 as I will discuss in a few minutes.","The cash flow generated by the company is very strong, enabling us to invest in profitable growth while still returning significant cash to our shareholders. In spring of 2013 we increased our dividend by 25% to $1 a year and we also bought back $1.6 billion of stock during the year which is approximately $200 million more than the prior year. We are proud of our performance this year and our confident in our strategies.","We are focused on identifying growth opportunities whether it be in a specific store or an entire market, with the third party vendor or a private brand and owned business or a licensed business, in-store, online or a combination of both and I can go on and on.","Our M.O.M. strategies, My Macy's localization, Omnichannel and Magic Selling, continue to gain traction. The retail environment is evolving rapidly and I believe that our 2013 performance demonstrates that we are making the necessary changes to our business model so that we can continue to compete effectively and profitability.","But let's now look to 2014 so you can hear some of what we're doing to accelerate our progress. Let's start with My Macy's. We continue to find ways to leverage technology to help us better localize assortments. We also continue to refine our ethnicity strategies for localized growth. There are so many opportunities to accelerate our growth by applying a My Macy's lens to all of our merchandized strategies. Importantly, we remain committed to stores which we believe are important for us to connect with customers and local communities.","We are also very focused on developing Omnichannel strategies that will enable us to better serve our customers and attract new customers as well. Increase collaboration between our stores and dot-com teams is enabling us to identify new growth opportunities and ways to be more productive. The key to Omnichannel's success will be the combination of the digital world with our stores to make both better shopping experiences for our customers.","Magic Selling also continues to be important to us and we have expanded the mindset beyond stores to include all customers facing environment such as phone, live chat and big ticket delivery. We need to make Magic in all of our customer interactions not just on the selling floor.","We're confident that our MOM strategies and our focus on our major power house brands many of which are exclusive to us will continue to help us perform well. There is lot of feel good about for 2014, and fortunately starting around Valentines Day our sales trend began to recover. Our guidance for 2014 sales and EPS is unchanged. For comp sales growth, we are assuming 2.5% to 3% and we are guiding for earnings per share on a diluted basis of $4.40 to $4.50.","Let me now list off, I think it's 11 other key planning assumptions. First, for the year we're expecting comp sales including sales from licensed departments to grow only slightly faster than comp sales as we year round on the finish line conversion midway through the first quarter. Two, we expect total sales growth to be approximately the same as comp sales through this year. Three, our sales plan for the first half of the year assumes a higher comp gain in the second quarter than in the first quarter.","This is due to the fact that we are year rounding a stronger first quarter and a weaker second quarter as well as a promotional shift at the end of the first quarter. The same is likely to be true between the third and fourth quarters. Four, for gross margin rate we are assuming a flattish to down slightly gross margin rate for the year. Five, credit is expected to produce more EBIT than last year, but with significantly less of an increase than we\u2019ve experienced in prior years.","Six, depreciation and amortization is assumed to be approximately $1,040,000,000 which is slightly above 2013. Seven, interest expense is assumed to be approximately $390 million for the year. As the tax rate for 2014 we are assuming a lower effective tax rate of 36.4%, this is lower than our normal assumption due to tax credits we are now receiving relating to a remodel of our Herald Square store.","Nine, with the pension plan now frozen our retirement expense will change dramatically. Pension expense is assumed to turn into income in 2014 and the 401k match will go up significantly as we\u2019re shifting our retirement benefits more to our defined contribution plan. Net-net, we are assuming approximately $150 million of lower expense in retirement expense in total much of which is being used to offset higher healthcare costs.","Ten, we have $453 million of debt maturing in July which we expect to refinance during the year. Our target leverage ratio remains 2.4 to 2.7 times. And the eleventh assumption is that CapEx is assumed to be $1,050,000,000 with that $50 million being pushed out from 2013. So that\u2019s a quick overview of our key planning assumptions for 2014.","I always find the year end to be a good time to just stop and reflect. To fully appreciate where our company stand\u2019s going into 2014 consider the contrast to where we were just five years ago when we started our journey as a restructured company with our MOM strategy. Concurrently we were continuing to invest aggressively in online infrastructure, talent and fulfillment.","Since that time we have become a fundamentally different company that is able to serve customer needs no matter how that customer prefers to shop. We can strategically access and manage inventories across channels. We have balanced our ability to offer localized fashion, differentiation and newness while also delivering the value and service that our customers expect and demand. We have built a strong and talented organization at all levels.","We have returned value to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends while also achieving investment grade ratings. We are today a strong and stable company with a consistent track record in growing sales, earnings and cash flow. We have been able to reliably increase our ROIC and EBITDA as a percent of sales. It goes without saying that we are very proud of our people and our accomplishments, and we appreciate your strong interest in and support for Macy's and Bloomingdale's as we embark and what we expect will be another successful year in 2014.","I\u2019ll stop here and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question today from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Hi, Karen good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Something that seems like it's definitely that Macy\u2019s apart is the brands and the partnerships that you\u2019ve established; can you talk about some of the notable collaborations in the fourth quarter as well as some of the learning\u2019s from the marketing changes that you made out of 2Q so far.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we have got spectacular vendor partnerships with all of the major brands and again if I start listing I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll drop somebody accidentally, also by the way our private brands. But one of the major changes that happened in \u201909 when we centralized all of the merchandise functions was the ability to collaborate much more closely and we believe passionately in what we call these power brands and we\u2019re working very hard with them so that they can grow our business aggressively within our stores and online.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Great. And then, look I think we all understand weather and the impact that it's had on retail. Can you talk a little about what you saw in less weather impacted areas during the quarter and obviously you commented on some of the business post Valentine's Day, but was this broad based and clearly a better sign it sounds like?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, I mean in January -- in November and December our business was strong really across the country, whilst that continue to strengthen this out. In January there was much more of a difference between sort of the north and the south. There was some weaker business in the non-weather impacted areas, that\u2019s why I said during the call that I don\u2019t think its all weather in January but the good news is starting in Valentines Day our boats are rising and so we\u2019re feeling very good about the trend.","Matthew Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co.","Great. Best of luck and hopefully those boats continue to rise.","Karen M. Hoguet","I agree with you. Thanks, Matt.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Hi, good morning guys.","Karen M. Hoguet","Good morning, Charles.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Fantastic performance obviously on the gross margin, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the big surprise this morning. So just when you look at over the next couple of years what do you think the puts and takes are for the company?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well I think the key thing is, the hope is that we will accelerate sales growth and continue to increase the EBITDA rate up to the 14%. And I think it will be terrific performance continuing to earn profits as well as the cash flow that we generate.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay. And anything like longer term structural changes with ecommerce as it continues to grow and what the implications could be for gross margins?","Karen M. Hoguet","I\u2019m not sure about the gross margin piece. One of the things we continue to work on is how to make our inventory more productive across channels. That may in fact lead to helping us get that EBITDA rata. Not sure that it would be gross margin or expense, but that is going to be an important strategy.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay. And just a couple of clarifications, I appreciate the 11 points on guidance but the buyback, how much we assume or what do you guys assuming in that 4.40 to 4.50?","Karen M. Hoguet","We don't disclose that though it is included in the 4.40 to 4.50.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay, that's what I thought. And then just on the fourth quarter, that 58 million, geographically that goes as a contra SG&A, is that where it placed?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet","It was multiple asset sales and as I said, a little bit more than half of that had been planned and we were happy that future transactions did close right at the end of the year.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.","Okay, great. Good luck. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Heather Balsky with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Heather Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet","Good morning.","Heather Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I guess first on the gross margin, you guys had gotten a little bit more promotional in the third quarter and you had expected that to continue into the fourth. And then also given the growth of ecommerce, how were you able to keep gross margins steady in 4Q?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think we have a spectacular merchant organization that works very closely with our vendors as well as our marketing team to plan out profitable promotions and I think they just did a spectacular job in the fourth quarter.","Heather Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you had spoken also that you're getting smarter about using data to plan your promotions. Any learning during 4Q using that strategy and how do you think about it in the first half of next year or this year I guess?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think every major event is benefiting from that because we learnt from the prior ones what items are generating what we call radiated sales and things like that, what kinds of promotions are impacting which customers. So that's just constantly helping us and to do a better job at growing the business profitably.","Heather Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Operator","We'll now go to Oliver Chen with Citigroup.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc.","Karen, congratulations on a great year.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thank you.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc.","Regarding your comments and your details as you think about your inventory positions, could you just elaborate on some of your strategies to move the inventory out? And also on your comments on a look forward to a more normalized pattern of shopping and your competence there, what are the things that we should fixate in terms of that happening in the marketplace given relatively kind of confusing consumer spending environment we're undergoing right now?","Karen M. Hoguet","To that one, don't know that I would use the word confusing. I think the key thing is we'll just see what sales look like at the end of the first quarter, we'll take note and keep moving from there.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc.","Okay. And then as you move inventory out, what's the main kind of tactical levers that you're pulling in order to\u2026?","Karen M. Hoguet","We have major events planned throughout the first quarter and so we'll obviously use those events to clear inventory.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc.","Okay, thank you. And regarding the later Easter, could you give us any comments there and things we should think about as we look at our models regarding expectations?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I do think the later Easter is good for retail, so that could be helpful. And I had said earlier, we do expect the second quarter comp to be higher than the first quarter. Beyond that I think that really is all I can say.","Oliver Chen - Citigroup Inc.","Thank you. Best regards.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks. Nice cap to a really terrific year, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks, Kimberly.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about your Omnichannel initiatives. I know you're testing any number of different ideas or strategies at any time. Are there any of those tests that are going on here in the first half of 2014 that you can share with us? And then reflecting back on 2013, ecommerce continued to be a really nice contributor to your sales growth. Is there evidence that you have that you're able to capture a new customer through some of these Omnichannel initiatives? And what were the sort of strategies that you think helped drive growth in that channel last year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Wow, that's a lot of questions. Let me try to summarize some of it. I think the key thing is we are testing lots of things as we go through the first quarter, whether it be relating to our assortments or how to be more efficient in terms of the store fulfillment. We talked about the buy online pick up in-store. We're also testing strategies for intensifying our service levels with in-stores, so sometimes it's not all Omnichannel but related to that. And again, we're trying to scientifically measure all of these results as we go, so that's going to be very important. If I think about things that are making us successful online, frankly it's very similar to what's making us successful in-store, which is merchandizing strategies and without the right assortments and the right service levels, it almost doesn't matter if you have sexy technology and I think that's what's driving our Omnichannel business today.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","You mentioned that your ecommerce, your dot-com merchants and organization are working very, very closely with the store teams. I think that's a little bit of a change over the last three to five years. Is there still more opportunity in that partnership to either yield better in-store benefits, better online benefits or just broadly speaking say other sales or margin benefits?","Karen M. Hoguet","Absolutely. We're really at the beginning stages there. We've tested it in some areas. We've got a major test going on right now in the dress area where we actually have one combined inventory between channels. We think that's going to be very important as we go forward. The other thing that we're doing which I think is important is that we're moving people around so that they get different experiences, whether it be store merchandizing or dot-com and that's helping also to enhance really this collaboration. So I would say we are at the very early stages of that and that's why I'm so excited about the growth going forward because I think the combination of these teams working together is going to be very powerful.","Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley","Terrific. Thanks, Karen.","Operator","We'll go to Paul Swinand with Morningstar Investment Research.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Investment Research","Good morning. Thanks for taking all the questions.","Karen M. Hoguet","Sure.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Investment Research","I want to ask about some of the \u2013 in your prepared remarks you have \u2013 I think you said watches, fragrances, home and juniors were tough. Do you think that had something to do with the weather or do you think those are delayed purchases, because maybe people will need to browse the stores for them and have they picked up with the Valentine's Day list that you were talking about?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, that could be the case. Fragrances has certainly picked up, so that's one example where there has been a change in trend. Watches, as we know, we've gotten spoiled with. It's been unbelievably strong and I would say it's still good relative to much of the store but not nearly as good as it had been. So, again, there are different juniors I talked about, we are making improvements there, so it's still weaker relative to last year but making a lot of progress. And house wares and table top we hope will get better this year.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Investment Research","Any comments or any color about the price points or the geographies on watches or home?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. I don't think either of those are really the issue. By the way it's not all of home. We had great business in furniture and mattresses. We had very good business in home textile, sheets and towels, so it's not all of home that's weak. Much of home is in the very strong category.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Investment Research","Okay, interesting. Thank you. And quickly about the online business, when you've got through your extreme weather events, does online actually pick up a little? In other words, did your strength online actually offset what was maybe even a weaker actual traffic environment than we realize?","Karen M. Hoguet","I wish, no. I mean it did pick up but I think people were watching the weather and not focusing on shopping. Yes, it did pick up but not anywhere close to \u2013 I mean if you think about how much of our business is done in-stores, that just isn't going to happen, at least not yet.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Investment Research","Right, okay, great. Thank you and best of luck.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll go to Paul Lejuez with Wells Fargo.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, Karen. It's Paul Lejuez. Let me think about your 2014 guidance. What are your assumptions as far as the competitive landscape, just overall promotional environment, particularly as you think about how next holiday will look relative to this past year since it was such a promotional one? I know you had said specifically on the comp drivers, how do you think about transactions versus average ticket size in terms of what would drive your comp assumption? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet","Honestly, I think every year is promotional in this business, so I don't expect it to get better or worst in terms of our guidance. And in terms of AUR for 2014 we've got lots of different assumptions that could get us there. We are not expecting a huge increase in AUR for the year but hopefully not a decline.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Got you. And maybe just a last one, inventory; how should we think about your plans throughout the year, inventory versus sales?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, you tend to want your inventory increase to be comparable to your comp growth expectations and obviously we\u2019re high right now at 4%. So that\u2019s why, the expectation is that, that will come down by the end of the first quarter.","Paul Lejuez - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. Thanks and good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next is Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research","Hi, good morning Karen. Just a follow-up on the last question. If you look at weakness in mall traffic and you\u2019re kind of thinking perhaps about a flattish maybe up slightly AUR. It would seem that, that creates quite a gap to get into that 2.5% to 3% comp increase even with the benefit of stronger online growth. So, I am wondering kind of how you\u2019re thinking about that, how you get to the 2.5% to 3%?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I mean I think it's a combination of things. I do think that transaction should go up this year and units per transaction we\u2019re always trying to increase. So again there\u2019s lots of different formulas that can get us there mathematically, also mix is a big part of that also.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research","Right.","Karen M. Hoguet","So we\u2019re feeling pretty confident, Jeff.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research","Okay. And as far as the Millennial collections that you launched last year, can you talk about which ones did well, which ones did not and plans to roll the successful ones out to additional doors that\u2019s here?","Karen M. Hoguet","No, this year was very good about many of them, and I probably won't hit all the ones that we\u2019re feeling good about, but certainly Bar III and Maison Jules are private brands. We do feel great about and we\u2019ll continue to roll them out. As I said a few minutes ago, the impulse part of our business was very strong in 2013 including active which was also very strong which again we consider is part of that business. So we're feeling good about that and the younger millennial as I said we're making some progress, albeit fourth quarter wasn\u2019t quite where we\u2019d like it to be yet but we think that a year from now we will be feeling much better about that.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research","Great. And one final question Karen, can you just bring sub to date on how many Finish Line lease departments you have now and what the plan is for the rollout for the remainder of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, I don\u2019t know the specific number. I\u2019ll have Matt call you with it, Jeff sorry.","Jeffrey Stein - Northcoast Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to Robert Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities","Hi, good morning Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet","Hi, Bob.","Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities","Just got a couple of questions. On the overall business, can you talk a little bit about how the collection businesses are performing in some of the Denim businesses? And then Bloomingdale\u2019s and the Bloomingdale\u2019s outlet, Karen you said Bloomingdale\u2019s actually did well, I think in specifically January when things got a little choppy. Just maybe a little bit more insight into that business for us.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes the outlet business had a good fourth quarter but hurt by weather in January, but November, December was feeling stronger which was very encouraging. And then on collections in Denim not as strongest we have liked in the fourth quarter but I wouldn\u2019t put it in the weakness category.","Robert Drbul - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thank you very much.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks, good morning Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","In the guidance you provided, I believe you mentioned that interest expense would be roughly in line with the 2013 totals. And so I just wanted to enquire about your thoughts on adding back to the balance sheet given such a strong operating performance this past year, it does seem like you're on track to be at the very low end of your targeted leverage ratio if not below as we look forward over the next 12 months?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think what you say is correct, we're at the low end of the range and our plans are that we haven't decided exactly yet. Obviously a lot of that will depend on market conditions and we\u2019ll see as we go through the year.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Got it. But not included in the guidance at this point in time?","Karen M. Hoguet","Refinancing the $453 million is, and should we do more if that could go up a little bit.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Understood. And then just for clarification with SG&A, the $58 million was assets sell gains, that was about $0.10 or so in my quick math, you said that was they were included when you gave.","Karen M. Hoguet","A little more than half of it had been included in our original guidance.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet","And a little bit less than half had not been.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just going forward though, obviously you have the reorganization providing some expense savings throughout \u201914. If you can just kind of walk through some of the headwinds and tailwinds on some of the other line items that\u2019s going to impact expenses whether it's, healthcare or just overall.","Karen M. Hoguet","But I think as we said credit should be helpful, the savings and retirement expense. The savings from the cost savings program all are helpful. On the other side we\u2019ve got healthcare going up, and also we have got the continued investment in the Omnichannel world, those are probably the big factors.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Got it. All right. Thanks a lot Karen.","Operator","Next is Michael Exstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Lauren Thompson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Good morning, Karen. This is Lauren Thompson on Michael\u2019s behalf. We just have one question, you said your license department commissions are included in net sales. Is there any other line items in your P&L we should be thinking about that are impacted by the licensed category?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it goes into gross margin as well.","Lauren Thompson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll go to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Good morning, Karen thanks for taking my question. Just a follow up on that, to take Paul\u2019s comments about SG&A, are there any additional opportunities to streamline the organization longer term. I think you also discussed how we should be thinking about flow through next year, should the environment maybe a key plan?","Karen M. Hoguet","I am not sure. Well, in terms of the first question we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to more cost deceptively operate our business. I don\u2019t see any major changes. Obviously we just announced a major restructuring. But we\u2019re constantly looking to improve incrementally as we go. And again as we march to that 14% EBITDA rate, that\u2019s always a piece of it, but I don\u2019t see any major changes happening in the near future.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","And then on the second question, which was just how we should be thinking about flow through depending on the top line?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, hopefully if the sales are higher that will help achieve a higher EBITDA rate, because it should be at a higher rate and obviously help accelerate earnings growth beyond what we said.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then one other clarification, just on the Omnichannel, how is the assortment changed online, is there anyway you can quantify that in terms of the skews and additional opportunities other than ones you\u2019ve already outlined with private label?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I don\u2019t know how to quantify the -- I am not sure exactly what your question is, but what we're trying to do is have our assortments online, be representative of what we\u2019ve got in store and have them -- have more available online and what's available in store, but to be congruent.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Richard Jaffe with Stifel.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Thanks very much Karen and just a follow-on question to Omnichannel, a lot of initiates in place and a lot of success. I am wondering how far along perhaps on a percentage basis you're in terms of including Omnichannel where you think it should be, and also how much it might cost to get there?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think I mean the cost we\u2019re absorbing as we go, and fortunately I\u2019ve been able to do that and still generate profitable growth. I would say we\u2019re just really in the early stages of accomplishing all that we think we can do. As I said during the call, the key will be picking the best of the digital world and putting it into our stores and at the same time picking the best of our stores and putting that into the digital world. And it's complicated and will take time but we\u2019re very much committed to making that happen.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","And have you been able to broaden any assortments online compared to what's in stores and how much broader are they now?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well somewhat so, but within the categories primarily that we offer. So often we can use online for extended sizes, often we use online to test and if the test is successful we\u2019ll put it into the stores. Or if we find that the online sales of lets say extended sizes does very well we\u2019ll bring that assortment into stores. So it's really very interesting to see how the two can interrelate.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","And we should interpret early stages as not even half way there, is that fair to say.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, I don\u2019t even know what there will be, because I think the world is going to continue to evolve. But I think the key thing to remember is, the keys to success in Omnichannel are going to be the keys to success in retailing in general, and again the strong merchant store organization technology groups that we have is really going to what will pay us here for us as we go forward.","Richard Jaffe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Right. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Good morning, Karen. Congrats on a great quarter and great year.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thank you.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","I hate to bore you with a quick accounting question, but could you explain to me how pension becomes an income line and is that just related to funding levels last year versus change in interest\u2026?","Karen M. Hoguet","It has to do with the benefits going forward being frozen, but if you want we can talk to you later and take you through the detail.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Well, is it an income line beyond 2014 is the quick question, I suppose?","Karen M. Hoguet","You know what, I don't have that in front of me but I suspect it is.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then maybe more interestingly on the women's business, it's obviously an area\u2026?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's much more\u2026","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","I think you waited a long time to tell us\u2026","Karen M. Hoguet","You bet.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Can you tell us what you think is helping drive that \u2013 I mean it's just the old fashion wardrobe refresh or has there been an adjustment on brand, on promotional strategy or perhaps\u2026?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, yes and yes. I don't think it's just \u2013 it happened accidently. I think our team put together a great strategy. A lot of it was relating to items and also I would say more focused on opening price points. But we've done very well at the better price points too. Our I&C brand had a spectacular year last year, but so did Style & Co and Jennifer Moore. So again, I think the team just is working very well on the assortment strategy as well as the marketing.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And if I can have one last question, since you mentioned how reflective you are at your end, if you look back on the year, could you talk about any of the categories that you could have seen better results in 2013 that could be an opportunity as we look ahead to '14 we say this is where we could improve?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's a good question. My hope always is that the categories we did well and we'll continue and we'll fix everything else, but I've spent 30 years in the business I think that maybe too optimistic. So I think again wherever you see weakness, for example juniors I do think we're going to see improved business this year. I like what the merchants are thinking about. That should be helpful. I think we're going to continue to see great results in impulse particularly on some of the new brands and also active. The coat, cold weather business will be interesting next year now that we finally had a great year after two horrible years and I think women's apparel was just poised to take off, so I feel really good about that. Based on our core, we'll continue strong, so I guess I'm fairly optimistic throughout the store.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank","All right, thanks a lot. Congrats.","Operator","We'll go to Liz Dunn with Macquarie.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Hi. Thanks. Let me add my congratulations on a great finish to the year.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks, Liz.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess I'm interested in your comment that you see multiple opportunities for an acceleration of sales growth. Obviously the millennial strategy is a big piece of this. Am I right that this ethnicity strategy that you sort of referenced is something you haven't talked a lot about in the past and are there others that you're comfortable \u2013 other strategies that you're comfortable naming at this point?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think we had started with My Macy's beginning to think about that. We started with the tourist strategy which is very different in different parts of the country and obviously as you look at the population base, there are stores in local areas where you need to think through the Latina strategy or an African-American strategy or Asian. But interestingly there isn't one Latina strategy because in different parts of the country and different countries of origin, it can be very different, same for the Asian. This is where My Macy's is just helping us so much with that local input coming from the field is terrific. So we have been working on this but it just gets better and better and better and we incorporate not only the merchandizing but the marketing which is a big part of the store events and also visual in the stores. So we just get better and better at it every year.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then relative to the restructuring and cost savings that you've outlined, in the past when you've done any sort of restructuring or merging of divisions, the cost savings have actually turned out to be better than expected because there is sort of best practices and that sort of thing that you don't necessarily model in. Is it fair to assume that you've taken the same sort of conservative approach to how you've planned out the cost savings this time?","Karen M. Hoguet","I hope so but I don't think so, because this is different than a division consolidation but hopefully I'm wrong. But at this point I would not count on that.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then finally we haven't talked about Bloomingdale's Outlet for a while. Could you just update us on where that stands?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, sorry, we had just talked about it. I think the Outlets had a good fourth quarter. January was tough with the weather but we're feeling better and better about the business there.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I'm sorry, I meant in terms of like gross expectations or \u2013 I apologize if I missed it, I got pulled off the line for a second.","Karen M. Hoguet","No, that's fine. I think that we're beginning to think about where else to put the Bloomingdale's Outlet stores, where have they done the best, where would that work do [ph]. My guess is it's probably not '14 but in '15 we'll start to see acceleration of that growth.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Great, thanks.","Operator","Next is Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Good morning, Karen and congratulations.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thanks, Dana.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","As you think about Omnichannel and learning from it, what's the marketing impact from it? Is there any qualitative implications that makes sense for marketing and expanding the customer base whether it's from your credit cardholders or from non-credit cardholders?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, absolutely. And in the way the marketing team is thinking about how the best markets for our customers is changing dramatically with Omnichannel and all the digital technologies available to them. So we're thinking about how can we market better across channels and really trying to get \u2013 the word we're using now is Omnichannel engagement because very often we'll find people, as I said earlier, who only purchase online and yet we know they're spending a lot of time in our stores. And so as the marketers are thinking about that and driving Omnichannel behavior, it's becoming very interesting changes in the strategy.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Does the change in marketing spend at all?","Karen M. Hoguet","Has not yet.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Got it. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go to Stacie Rabinowitz with Consumer Edge Research.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Hi. I was just wondering as you add licensed departments very slowly but \u2013 I was in the store the other day and it felt like almost the whole first floor was starting to become licensed. Do you see additional opportunities there?","Karen M. Hoguet","Of Macy's?","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Of Macy's, yes. I was trying to return something and especially with the \u2013 there was the cosmetics, there was the sunglasses.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, cosmetics is all-in owned business, so \u2013 anyway keep going with your question.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Just as you're talked about sort of other business models I guess and more different structures in terms of how the vendors operate your space and how leeway you give the vendors in their \u2013 I know Michael Kors has been talking about how they've been sort of in the retail department space having some successes with being more involved in the operations there.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, as part of our vendor collaborations we're always trying to work more closely with vendors to help obviously make our stores more successful. And obviously Michael Kors would be an example of that. But we're still operating with the owned model. So actually if you think about the first floor of Herald Square, we do have the luxury shops sort of around the floor that are leased but most of the first floor is not a licensed business model, it's still owned.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet","And again, from our perspective with licensed businesses what we do is identify what we call white space and where there is a business that we think we can find our need to add to this store or we believe someone outside could do better. So if you think about Sunglass Hut, when we decided to license that business, part of it was because they had access to brands that Macy's could get without the licensed model and we think they've done a fabulous job; similarly with Finish Line. So again, we start with what does the customer want and where is there an opportunity and if we don't think we're the best at delivering that to the customer, we're more than willing to partner with somebody as we've done in athletic shoes, sunglasses, et cetera.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Okay. And did you see those opportunities up ahead or so far nothing?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we're always looking for at new ideas, so I certainly don't want to say nothing. We have the whole team of people that is focused on where are the white spaces and what businesses could we add to our stores to either satisfy customer demand, make them more interesting, bring in the new customer, so that's an important focus of what we're working on.","Stacie Rabinowitz - Consumer Edge Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Valerie Brown with Alliance Bernstein.","Valerie Brown - Alliance Bernstein","Hi, Karen. It's Valerie.","Karen M. Hoguet","Hi, Valerie.","Valerie Brown - Alliance Bernstein","Hi. Just a question on the working capital efficiency. You've talked a bit about your inventory levels and obviously they're elevated now relative to your increase in sales. Do you have any specific initiatives that we should look out for that would really drive those inventory turns particularly given the Omnichannel strategy, there just seems to be some room for improvement there, that would also help drive your cash flow?","Karen M. Hoguet","I believe that there is Valerie. I don\u2019t think it's going to be 2014. With that said, earlier we\u2019re testing having one inventory across channels which I think will be an important part of bringing the inventory levels down over time, but we\u2019re just beginning to test, so it will not happen in \u201914.","Valerie Brown - Alliance Bernstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will now go to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Thank you, Karen. Just a quick follow-up on the licensed model. I'm curious and -- footwear obviously is a big important business and you had to make some tough decisions in terms of space allocations to put their shops in. Have you looked at the performance of the -- of your footwear business in locations that have put the shops in versus not, and how you evaluate sort of the trade-offs in terms of sales productivity and whether you look at profit dollars per square foot and how do you think this investment is paid off?","Karen M. Hoguet","We are very happy with the investment and I will also say it\u2019s brought new customers into the store, which is also helpful. So we feel very good about that decision.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","And we\u2019re also starting to see some new shops, we really haven't seen in addition to Finish Line some vendor shops, show up in footwear, I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s helping drive productivity as well and maybe that could be one of the leading categories for you guys that could replace one or two of the other center core categories that are still good, but maybe not quite as productive?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I hope shoes does well and so do those other categories.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Right. Okay and then just finally, just a quick clarification I believe I just wanted to double check you said similar to -- you said Q2 comps would be greater than Q1 and I think you said Q4 greater than Q3 that -- is that what you\u2019re \u2026?","Karen M. Hoguet","That is what I\u2019ve said.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","And first half roughly equal to second half?","Karen M. Hoguet","I didn't say that. I didn't answer that one.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Is the first half comparable to the second?","Karen M. Hoguet","We're not commenting.","David Glick - Buckingham Research Group","Okay. Thank you, Karen. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yep. Thanks.","Operator","We will now go to Rob Wilson with Tiburon Research.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Yes, thanks for taking my call, Karen. Can we go back to the gross profit margin in Q4 and drill to that a little bit deeper? Was there any impact from the licensed business on gross profit margin in Q4?","Karen M. Hoguet","There was and it was also impact of the increase in delivery fees, so both of those factors are offsetting.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Was the core merchandise margin higher or lower?","Karen M. Hoguet","Oh, it\u2019s about flat.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then did you have any asset gain sales last year?","Karen M. Hoguet","In the fourth quarter, that's a good question. I don\u2019t know the answer, but if so, it was small.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet","We will check that and get back to you.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","And one final question, the pension expense $150 million, was that flow through evenly throughout the year or is it lumpy?","Karen M. Hoguet","I don't know the answer to that. We can check that.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Okay. I will follow-up.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes.","Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research Group, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions.","Karen M. Qoguet","You bet.","Operator","We will now go to Richard Church with DISCERN Investment Analytics.","Richard Church - DISCERN Investment Analytics","Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet","Hi, Rich.","Richard Church - DISCERN Investment Analytics","How are you?","Karen M. Hoguet","Fine.","Richard Church - DISCERN Investment Analytics","I just wanted to -- I\u2019m good. With respect to Omnichannel, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about the sort of the last mile challenges that I think you and everybody faces with getting that product into the consumer\u2019s hands. How are you thinking about that? How that's reflected in your guidance of course and then were there any unusual expense pressures associated with that in December?","Karen M. Hoguet","One of the things that has us excited about the buy online, pickup in store test and that's going to help us really lay this foundation for same-day delivery, because we have the capability now of knowing exactly if that inventory that a customer is ordering is in a specific store. And if that inventory is in a market, obviously it\u2019s easier to get to the customer on the same day. So that is laying the foundation. We'll probably test same-day delivery in a few other places this year. And I don't know where that will lead.","Richard Church - DISCERN Investment Analytics","Are you working with any smaller transportation or shipping companies that are even going to step further and trying to deliver in certain categories within an hour?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, we had -- I don\u2019t know if that was in an hour, but we're working with a few in different markets trying to test different ways of doing this.","Richard Church - DISCERN Investment Analytics","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will now go to Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Oh, hi, Karen. Just sorry, just one quick follow-up. You mentioned at this time a year-ago that the promotional shift between 1Q and 2Q was material and that should lead to 200 to 300 basis points type of gap between the performance of those two quarters last year. Should we think about the gap between 1Q and 2Q this year to be similar?","Karen M. Hoguet","We're not commenting on this specific difference.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. I just wanted to ask.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, thanks Paul.","Operator","And we will now go to Laura Starr with Nuveen Asset Management.","Laura Starr - Nuveen Asset Management","Good morning, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet","Hi, Laura.","Laura Starr - Nuveen Asset Management","Yes, several people have asked this question on the online versus in-store. I noticed when I go online to Macy\u2019s and I look at the SKUs available there is so much more than what\u2019s in store which is obviously the -- what you want to do but how are you conveying that to customers, how do they know that there is so much more there to pick from? Is that something that you feel that that you\u2019re at the right place at or is there more to do there? And then my second question is on your credit card. I got a mailing from you, it's a new card with a reward program where I can get points back or money back or something, buying groceries and all these other things. Is that something new that you\u2019re starting?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, let me answer that question first and then I'll go back. We have reissued the Macy's Star Rewards program and I would say we have, I guess the right word is tweaked the program that we had before and frankly communicating with customers better about what benefits she is already getting. We do think it's an enhanced program, but I wouldn't call it a major launch of a new loyalty program there.","Laura Starr - Nuveen Asset Management","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet","The cards are red, which I think is pretty cool with the Macy's red. But it is an improvement over what we had before, but I would not call it a major launch of a significantly different program.","Laura Starr - Nuveen Asset Management","Okay. And the number \u2026?","Karen M. Hoguet","On the online, it\u2019s interesting in some categories, what you're saying is right, another categories that\u2019s actually not the case. It just feels that way when you\u2019re shopping. But we're trying to do is help customers whether it would be frankly in-store or online, find what they want easier and more quickly. And that's always a challenge. So I would say, we continue to try to showcase our inventory in a way that the customer finds what she wants, but isn't so overwhelmed, that it's hard to do so.","Laura Starr - Nuveen Asset Management","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And Karen, there are no other questions. So I'll turn the call back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen M. Hoguet","Okay. Well, thank you all for your interest, your support. If you have follow-up questions, you can call me, Matt, Sarah, and we'll do our best to try to answer them. And again thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today.

Given the time constraints and the number of people who want to participate, we ask that you please limit your questions to one with a quick follow up.","In addition to this call and our press release, we have posted a slide presentation on the Investor section of our website, macysinc.com. The presentation summarizes the information in our prepared remarks, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, our Form 10-Q will be filed in a few weeks and that too will be available on our website at that time.","I do have one administrative note to share and that is that we will be adjusting the timing of our typical quarterly earnings release beginning with our next quarterly earnings call, which will be on Thursday, November 21st. As a rough rule of thumb and barring any minor conflicts going forward, we plan to release our results for the first through third quarters on the third Thursday after the quarter end. However, the timing of the fourth quarter call is not planned to change.","In addition, we will now be publishing our earnings release one hour earlier and moving up the time of our call to 8 o\u2019clock a.m. Eastern Time for all quarterly results. So please mark your calendars accordingly.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today. A detailed discussion of these factors and uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In discussing the results of our operations, we will be providing adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share amounts that exclude the impact of impairment and other costs. You can find additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as others used in our earnings release and during this call on the Investors section of our website.","As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being webcast on our website. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call and it will be archived there following the call for one year. ","Now, I\u2019d like to turn this over to Jeff.","Jeff Gennette","Well, thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. So, Paula and I will take you through our second quarter results and then we will open up the line for Q&A. As you saw in our press release this morning, Macy\u2019s, Inc. delivered another quarter of comparable sales growth. We achieved a 0.3% increase in comparable sales on an owned plus license basis. Our earnings per share was $0.28, well below our expectation.","As we communicated on our first quarter earnings call, we walked into the second quarter with elevated spring inventory. The second quarter got off to a very slow start. As we moved deeper into the quarter, it became clear that inventory was a amounting problem due to a combination of factors, a miss on fashion in our key women\u2019s sportswear private brands, slow sell-through of warm weather apparel and the accelerated decline in our international tourism business.","We took the necessary markdowns to clear inventory. The unanticipated markdowns impacted our gross margin for the second quarter by almost one full point. We now enter the fall season with the right inventory level and mix to meet anticipated customer demand, with improved freshness and liquidity to respond to in-season fall trends.","We remain confident in our annual comparable sales guidance of flat to up 1%. That said, in light of our second quarter results, we are lowering adjusted earnings guidance by $0.20 for the full year. We now expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.85 to $3.05, including asset sale gains or $2.60 to $2.80 minus asset sale gains.","When I step back and look at the business more broadly, while we had our seasonal inventory challenges in the second quarter, there are many areas of the business that are performing well. Our brick-and-mortar business is healthier, led by our Growth50 stores and Backstage expansion.","Our digital business delivered its 40th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We made good progress on our 2019 strategic initiatives. All are on track and expected to contribute to comparable sales growth in the back half of the year so to quickly review them.","Growth150, 100 additional Macy\u2019s stores are receiving the Growth treatment. Work on these stores will be complete and ahead of last year\u2019s Growth50 roll out well in advance of the holiday season.","We continue to see strong performance from the original 50 Growth stores and expect a similar sales lift in the 100 ones that are where the work is being completed. These 150 stores make up approximately 50% of Macy\u2019s brick-and-mortar sales.","Backstage, in 2019 we are expanding Backstage to another 50 stores with 47 of them already complete. We now have more than 200 Backstage within a Macy\u2019s across the country and it\u2019s encouraging to see that the Backstage locations within Macy\u2019s store open for more than 12 months continue to comp mid-single digits. We are getting better at off-price every day.","Our Backstage distribution center in Columbus, Ohio is now up and running. This DC operates on the Google cloud platform, getting us improved efficiency, speed and scale to support the continued growth of our off-price business. As part of our supply chain strategy, we will roll this Google cloud platform out to our other distribution centers in 2020, providing additional network flexibility and speed for both Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s.","Third, Vendor Direct, we continue to aggressively grow the SKUs and brands we are able to offer our customers on macys.com through Vendor Direct. We are now halfway to our goal of adding 1 million SKUs this year. Our customers love the expanded selection.","Vendor Direct only has upside. It adds sales and gross margin, and increases both customer satisfaction and traffic to the site. The zero capital and inventory investment make for a very high ROIC rate.","Mobile, Mobile helps us create a better omni-channel experience for our customers, enabling them to shop more easily and frequently both in our stores and online. Our app is our customer\u2019s valued assistant for interacting with the Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s brands, and we continue to see significant increases in usage and conversion.","Mobile remains our fastest-growing channel and we have a regular cadence of new features with My Wallet, My Store, and My Stylist. Many of these will improve the in-store customer experience, like quick barcode pickups of online orders, localized product recommendations and in-store rewards that are exclusive to the app.","And lastly, destination businesses, our six destination businesses as a group were up 5% for the second quarter, with the strongest performance in fine jewelry, men\u2019s tailored and women\u2019s shoes. The six destination businesses account for nearly 40% of our total sales at Macy\u2019s and all six are higher AUR businesses.","All six continue to outperform the balance of the business on market share, return on investment and profitability, and we are putting additional resources behind these six categories, to drive growth through great product, top-performing colleagues, improved environment and enhanced marketing. These destinations are the point of entry to the Macy\u2019s brand and we see significant opportunity to drive cross-shopping, which is one of the competitive advantages of being a department store.","While we are pleased with market share growth in these businesses that we have seen to-date, we won\u2019t be satisfied until Macy\u2019s is taking market share overall and we will get there business-by-business starting with these six. So with these initiatives, the team are hard at work at implementing them and we are confident that we will be important contributors to our back half performance.","Bloomingdale\u2019s had a more challenging quarter, driven largely by declines in international tourism. Women\u2019s and men\u2019s shoes and Bloomingdale\u2019s The Outlet were standouts in the quarter, and in the third quarter we are going to be opening two additional outlet stores.","Bluemercury had another strong quarter. We have opened three new stores for a total of 167 stores across 26 states. Bluemercury free-standing stores and shops within Macy\u2019s stores both grew sales in the quarter, with the shop-in-shops showing considerable growth. Bluemercury.com continues to have significant runway, growing double digits.","We will continue to innovate across all channels to strengthen relationships with our existing customers and to bring new customers into our brand. In July, we launched the second generation of STORY at Macy\u2019s, Outdoor STORY, and we are pleased with the customer response so far.","STORY brings in new customers and gives current customers another reason to visit more often. It also opens doors to new partnerships with local and niche brands, as well as major players. For Outdoor STORY, we partnered with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Scott\u2019s Miracle-Gro and these collaborations allowed us to offer our customers unique product and experiences.","We are also testing opportunities in both e-commerce and rental to tap into the changing customer behavior, especially among millennial and Gen Z consumers. This month, we began a pilot with thredUP, the world\u2019s largest fashion resale marketplace in 40 Macy\u2019s doors across the country.","We know many consumers are passionate about sustainable fashion and shopping resale. This partnership gives us the opportunity to reach a new customer and keep them coming back to shop an ever-changing selection of styles and brands that we don\u2019t typically carry.","As it relates to fashion rental, we know that our customers want variety and discovery. Tapping into this, Bloomingdale\u2019s is launching My List, a subscription rental service with our partner Castle. Learnings from Bloomingdale\u2019s will inform the development of a similar rental service at Macy\u2019s in the near future.","So as we look ahead to the second half of 2019, we are confident that we have the right plans in place to continue to grow our business. The second quarter gross margin was tough, but we now have the inventory at the right levels.","We have laid down holiday 2019 as a must-win for the entire organization and we have the levers we need to be competitive in today\u2019s environment. While consumer spending remains healthy, there is significant noise in the macroeconomy, tariffs, currency fluctuations, declining international tourism to name a few. It\u2019s a dynamic situation and the team is prepared to respond to changes in the consumer environment.","As it relates specifically to tariffs, we are currently assessing the details that the U.S. Trade Representatives Office released yesterday related to the fourth tranche of tariffs on goods imported from China.","We have confidence that our scale gives us the leverage to find mitigation strategies that work for us, our vendor partners and our suppliers in China. We know from the earlier tranche of tariffs though that today\u2019s customer doesn\u2019t have much appetite for price increases.","So in closing, the first half of 2019 has been challenging, but I am proud of the work the team has done to drive the business in this dynamic external environment and course-correct when needed. We are committed to delivering in the back half of the year.","We remain focused on continued top line growth, market share growth and the growth of our customer base. But as importantly, we also have a clear line of sight into profitability growth and are hard at work on our productivity initiatives. Paula will touch on these shortly and we will share more details together in early September.","While we know there is negative sentiment on our sector, we are confident in our plans. There is strong consumer demand for high quality affordable fashion. We are strengthening our relationship with our current customers and bringing new customers into the brand.","Today\u2019s consumer demands the ability to shop anytime and anywhere, and we know we can deliver that convenience as an omni-channel retailer. We have stabilized the business and have a strong and aligned team. Our balance sheet is healthy and we have the resources to invest to create long-term shareholder value.","Now I am going to hand it over to Paula to review the second quarter and provide more detail on our outlook for the year.","Paula Price","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. While we achieved another consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales, we were not pleased with our overall performance. That said, we are fully focused on a successful fall season and confident in the benefits we expect to deliver in the second half of the year from our strategic initiatives and our Funding Our Future productivity program.","In the second quarter, we delivered sales of $5.5 billion, an increase of 0.3% on an owned license comparable basis. As Jeff mentioned, we saw strength within all of our destination businesses. We experienced some softness in the home category while ready-to-wear continued to be a challenge.","We saw our strongest performance in the North Central region and digital continued to deliver solid growth. International tourism sales were down approximately 9% in the quarter, accelerating the headwinds sequentially.","It is encouraging to see that growth of total transactions continues to be a key driver of our positive sales comp and we are up 5.3% in the quarter. Average units per transaction were down 1.8%, as our platinum customers purchased fewer units on average when they transact with us, but importantly, continue to spend more with us in aggregate.","Our average unit retail was down 3%, driven by the growth of Backstage, our heightened markdowns in the quarter, as well as a challenging comparison to a very strong AUR performance in the second quarter of 2018.","We generated credit revenue in the quarter of $176 million, down 5.4% from last year and in line with our expectations. Our Star Rewards loyalty program continues to drive good momentum in our credit revenue, with credit card penetration up 10 basis points to 46.7% in the quarter. However, there were slight upticks in fraud and bad debt.","We monitored these metrics closely and strategies are in place to mitigate our exposure over the balance of the year. We remain confident in our annual credit revenue guidance range, which remains unchanged.","Gross margin for the second quarter was 38.8%, down 160 basis points to last year. Combined the additional markdowns Jeff mentioned and the growth in delivery drove the vast majority of this decline.","The increased delivery cost supporting online growth in our Star Rewards program were anticipated and their impact on our margin was roughly equal to what we saw in the first quarter. However, it was the additional markdowns that were largely responsible for the much-steeper decline in gross margin than we expected at the start of the quarter.","With an inventory overhang to start the quarter and a tougher sales environment than we anticipated, our teams took the necessary markdowns to clear that excess spring inventory. While these markdowns resulted in a significantly lower gross margin in the quarter, we ended the quarter with comp inventory nearly flat at up 0.1% versus up 2.4% in the first quarter.","Taking the markdowns was certainly tough medicine, but it was important that we enter the fall season with aligned inventory and sales plans. We have achieved that and we are confident in our plans to deliver more normal levels of markdowns in the back half of the year.","Our confidence in protecting margin is supported by several factors. First, inventory is well-positioned and our fall received planning is much leaner, allowing us to maintain liquidity to use opportunistically as customer demand dictates.","Second, the majority of the unanticipated second quarter markdowns were related to women\u2019s sportswear private brands, which is now in a much improved inventory position and is being managed with much greater discipline. This is a problem that we can control. We have put new leadership in place and are doing a deep examination of all aspects of this business. But it will take some time to get the sportswear business growing as healthily as other areas of ready-to-wear.","Third, we are being more strategic in our inventory allocation and marketing. For example, we continued to challenge this status quo to drive effectiveness and efficiency in our media, doing more with less. This includes simplifying our offers, leveraging strategic partnerships and improving our segmentation and targeting of customers. We have already taken several actions to simplify or eliminate less effective marketing promotion, saving us a few million dollars of incremental EBIT on an annualized basis.","And fourth, we are making good progress on our productivity initiatives. One initiative that we discussed many times is hold and flow, which enables us to dynamically reallocate inventory in season based on need, resulting in fewer markdowns and out-of-stocks.","The initial results of our test have been encouraging. We found that hold and flow products on average generated more than $4 of incremental margin at a cost of $2, and that benefit of more than $2 each that could translate into tens of millions of dollars of incremental EBIT on an annualized basis. This gives us great confidence in operating the program at scale during the fall and we expect to see significant EBIT benefit as a result.","Additionally, we are enhancing our data analytics capabilities and getting to a more granular understanding of pricing and markdown decisions, which will also enhance our margins. We are now rolling out our new pricing capabilities at scale following our successful spring test, also with sizable EBIT benefits expected.","Moving on to SG&A, we recorded $2.2 billion of expense in the quarter, an increase of $13 million or 50 basis points on a rate basis over last year. The increase in SG&A dollars was primarily driven by investment in our strategic initiative.","As a reminder, given the front-loaded nature of these investments, we continue to expect the growth in SG&A year-over-year to be weighted towards the spring season and the benefits of the $300 million in restructuring and normal ongoing cost reductions that we previously discussed to be weighted more towards the fall season.","Interest expense continued to benefit from lower debt levels and our balance sheet remains healthy. While our effective tax rate was 25.9% in the second quarter, we expect it to be 23% for the year. The variance is caused by certain normal and discrete tax benefits that occur unevenly through the year.","Summing it all up, we delivered $88 million of adjusted net income in the quarter versus $219 million last year. Included in these net income figures are asset sale gains of $5 million and $34 million respectively.","Adjusted EPS was $0.28 in the quarter, compared to $0.70 last year, of which asset sale gains represented about $0.01 and $0.11, respectively.","Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities was $350 million, compared to $544 million last year. The variance is due to lower merchandise payables and adjusted EBITDA offset by lower tax payments.","Capital expenditures were $501 million, compared to $408 million last year. We remain on track to achieve our existing guidance of approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures.","Cash used by financing activities was $239 million less than a year ago, as we paid down less debt this year than we did last year.","Here is our guidance. For the full year, we continue to expect approximately flat total sales growth and comps of flat to up 1% on an owned plus license basis. We are confident that we can deliver in the upper end of the sales range. We will be at full strength with our strategic initiatives. We have learned from our challenges during the holiday season of 2018 and consumer spending continues to be healthy. Although, as Jeff noted, we are mindful of being up against some macro uncertainty, which our full guidance range contemplates.","Looking at the fall season sales specifically, we expect the fourth quarter comp to be meaningfully greater than the third quarter comp. In the third quarter, we will be cycling our toughest comp necessaries comparison of the year, in large part due to the benefit we saw from cooler temperatures last October.","On the flipside, in the fourth quarter, we will be cycling the disruption caused by the fire in our West Virginia mega center and the underperformance of our pre-Christmas promotional event. Gross margin in the fall season is expected to be down slightly to a year ago.","Our confidence in this trend improvement is based on the four factors I mentioned earlier, inventory parity, merchant team liquidity, enhanced provision in our fall promotions and our productivity program.","Regarding inventory, we are expecting it to rise as we end the third quarter as we are intentionally bringing in receipts to support early November sales and a truncated holiday season. We still expect to be below last year by the end of the fall season.","As we look at asset sale gains planned for the back half of the year, we anticipate the balance of our $100 million guidance to occur in the fourth quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.85 to $3.05 or $2.60 to $2.80 when excluding asset sale gains.","Any potential impact from a fourth tranche of tariffs is not contemplated in our guidance as we are still processing the details released yesterday, as Jeff noted. We are in active discussions with our vendors and suppliers to mitigate tariffs, and minimize customer impact in 2019 as much as possible and we will know more in the coming weeks.","With respect to our overall guidance, we are confident in the outcome of what we can control. We are also mindful of what we cannot control and we are providing guidance with prudent ranges that are cognizant of the current macro uncertainty. You can find our complete guidance in the slide presentation we posted on our website earlier this morning.","As we committed, we will be sharing more details in our Funding Our Future productivity program in early September. I along with Jeff and Hal Lawton, our President, will layout our productivity strategy more fully, including detail on the six work streams and anticipated total savings over the next three years to five years.","To wrap up, while the second quarter was indeed a challenge, I am confident that we are on the right track to accomplish both our short-term and long-term objectives. We strengthened our balance sheet through steady debt retirement and it is in a healthy position that allows us additional flexibility.","We are making the right investments in the business and we are hyper focused on profitable growth. We are making good progress on the initiatives that will enhance both customer and shareholder value.","Our strategic initiatives are growing our sales, our productivity program will transform the way we work and diligent inventory management and capital allocation are top of mind, day in, day out.","We are improving our management disciplines every day with data analytics, better tools and better processes and we have a strong team that is working together to win every day.","With that, Jeff and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So, Jeff, you are seeing comp lifts from Growth50 stores and Backstage. You cited comps up mid-single digits at your six destination businesses and also commented that the consumer spending remains healthy today, despite some of the cross currents. I guess higher-level, what\u2019s preventing better aggregate comps today at Macy\u2019s and if consumer spending were to take a step down in the back half of the year or into next year, what\u2019s your confidence in sustaining positive comps?","Jeff Gennette","So, Matt, I think, you hit the headlines about what is good in our business right now. The one you didn\u2019t mention was the digital overall is quite strong, really led by Mobile. But when you look at the other pieces of the business that are a challenge right now, ready-to-wear, particularly ready-to-wear sportswear and some of the soft home categories definitely depressed the strength of those winning categories to the comps that we are quoting.","So when you look at the quarter-to-quarter definitely got off to a slow start and you see the combination of factors that we are quoting on that that led us to the decision that where we expected strong sell-through, stronger sell-throughs in seasonal product, that didn\u2019t happen as we worked all the way through May and into early June. So we made the decision mid-June to take the appropriate markdowns.","So that we entered the fall season with the right inventory levels on all of our spring and summer and we were able to flow all of our fall products that we have a lot of confidence that are going to get us ready for the fall. So we now have our inventory in line. We took the medicine. It did affect our overall gross margin by a full point in the second quarter.","Now let me take you through why we are confident about the back half of the year. So, first off, we are entering the back half of the year with a comp above 0.5%. We guided the full year at flat to up 1.","We just to mention what Paula just said, we do expect the fourth quarter is going to be meaningfully better than the third quarter. Third quarter last year we -- was our strongest quarter and that was mostly was buoyed by the cold weather that we had in the month of October. The month of October was a very strong month for us.","But on the flipside, as you remember from the fourth quarter of last year, we are cycling all the disruption that we saw, I mean, the fire, as well as the promotional event change that we made. And what we quoted last year was that it was about a 70-basis-point degradation to the fourth quarter comp so we are lapping that.","So the holiday 2019 we are very focused on that. The entire organization is aligned and engaged to make that happen. It\u2019s a must-win for us and we have a lot of confidence in looking at our content.","Looking at our promotions, we take every opportunity to test what\u2019s going to be important in the fourth quarter. So you saw just now in the Black Friday in July. We were really testing item price velocity, using all of our analytics capabilities to make sure that we have got the right items built.","We are very confident in our seasonal hiring, our entire fulfillment network. What we are doing with customer events and engagement. We also know that our digital business is a much higher penetration in the fourth quarter than the other three quarters. It penetrates higher. It\u2019s worth about 90 basis points of comp in the fourth quarter.","And just, lastly, Matt, to give us confidence is that we are bringing into the fall the full complement of all of the strategic initiatives in 2019 that we have been building and will be building and complete by the end of October, so that comes with us and that\u2019s why we are confident that we are going to have a positive comp in the fall season to add to the positive comp that we had in the spring season.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you so much. Good morning. Jeff, I wanted to just ask about the store base and how you are thinking about it. You talked about the brick-and-mortar fleet being healthier. I\u2019d love to hear what you mean by that. It would seem if the digital business is still growing double-digits, it would seem that the stores are still negative, but as you look at the fleet, what is it that you are seeing that\u2019s healthier and do you need to take another look at your store base with maybe a potential eye towards some additional store closures? Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","Yeah. Kimberly, so let\u2019s just talk about stores in general. So just to repeat our store segmentation strategies. So we have our flagships, which include Herald Square. We have got our magnet stores which really are touched on by our growth initiatives. And then we have our neighborhood stores which are very important for fulfillment and convenience for our customers that live in those localized areas.","So we really have a line of sight on what growth looks like for magnets and flagships. The growth strategy really led by our Growth50 gave us all the confidence in getting growth out of those buildings. We talked about how those Growth50 stores have outperformed the other stores in the Growth100 by 3 full points. Those stores are positive comping.","The customer engagement in those particular stores is much higher than our other store fleet. So what we have done is we have applied all of those learning to the next 100 stores, which is what we call the Growth100 and what you are quoting, that Growth150, which will be complete by the end of October, touches about 50% of all of our brick-and-mortar sales.","Separate from that is what you have many of our flagships that are classified differently that add to that 50%. Clear line of sight about what we need to do to make those better so we have got a lot of initiatives with what we are doing with new experiences like Beta and market and STORY, trying new concepts like thredUP that are all adding new opportunities in these stores, many of these stores are touched by Backstage.","The neighborhood stores, I would expect those to continue to negatively comp, but they are becoming more profitable, because we are operating them more efficiently with less square footage. The customers are really using them big for fulfillment, a higher percentage of their sales are moving through fulfillment, so we are handling their expectations in those particular stores.","We are always looking at our portfolio to look at does it make sense. We are never going to say we are done. But we do believe this national footprint that we have we are servicing a national customer. We know that when we close the store. We are firing customers. We lose their business online. We will make all those decisions very carefully.","So this segment\u2019s dictation strategy really serves a customer that shops between our stores, satisfying her needs. It also satisfies how we are building the omni-channel business through digital and Mobile and so we will be very careful about any exodus that we do in future store closures.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up, Jeff, on the comment you made about the consumer not wanting to see price increases.","Jeff Gennette","Yeah.","Lorraine Hutchinson","And can you just give us a little bit more information on your expectations around the tariffs? What are the mitigation strategies?","Jeff Gennette","Yeah.","Lorraine Hutchinson","And are price increases off the table for you or will you try to do some selectively?","Jeff Gennette","So let me just tell you what our experience has been. So, obviously, tranche one and two, there was no significant impact. And tranche three, there was very limited impact when it was at 10%, but on May 10th, that went to 25%.","And so we did play with selective price increases in categories like luggage, in housewares and in parts of furniture, and we learned from that experience that the customer had very little appetite for those cost increases so we had to make adjustments.","So to answer your question, Lorraine, I think, when you are talking about tariffs going to 25% then you get into what do you do? How are you working with your vendors? How do you get more make and value into those products that gives you the permission from a customer\u2019s perspective because of how they are looking at the value of those goods to raise prices?","So when we are thinking about tranche four, we have had some time to digest this even into this morning, we are looking at which of the remaining pieces that are touching our business that come in from tranche four are being effected as of September 1st versus December 15th. I would tell you that we are looking at no price increases on any content that is touched by tranche four.","So we are looking at then what is our risk for the way that its now been, because you have got some categories based on one fiber that\u2019s being taxed or by on September 1st for the other same category, but different fiber that is being effected as of December 15th. So looking at all of that and I think we recognize that our risk to annual guidance in 2019 would be no more than one nickel.","I think on a long-term basis, we believe that we will work through solutions on 10%. We are working closely with our manufacturing partners. We are leveraging our scale and our strong relationships with our sourcing partners, as well as our vendor partners, who source out of China.","So I think that 10% is manageable in the short and long term. I think when it goes to 25%, you are dealing with a whole other series of dynamics that I would not say we wouldn\u2019t have to raise prices.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning and thank you for taking our question. I wanted to circle back on to the digital business, which is performing well. You mentioned that the Mobile business did over $1 billion last year. Just curious on any update on the total size that you are driving now through e-commerce? And also on Vendor Direct, maybe discuss in a bit more detail the type of product and SKUs that you have been adding to the website as you expanded the assortment and now that Vendor Direct is 10% of sales, I mean, help us understand how much the Vendor Direct business is driving the e-commerce growth and also how you are accounting for that in terms of taking on the whole sale versus a take rate in your top line? Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","All right. Hi, Paul. So let me take you through Mobile first. No surprise Mobile is our fastest-growing channel so what we told you last year, $1 billion in sales we expected it to grow 50% in 2019 and we will get to $1.5 billion. We are on track for that when you think about our performance in the first half of the year.","So when we get into Vendor Direct, on this one, we are on track, what we said is we have a goal of adding 1 million SKUs. We are halfway to that goal so we have added 450 new vendors, $640,000 of new SKUs, of the 640,000 new SKUs.","So we started really primarily at home and we are now implementing more broadly. We are expanding to the full catalog of our brand partners. We are also adding new categories that we look at failed searches and really what our customers expect of us.","We always look at what our competitive set is, and as we mentioned, our peers have a larger ratio of SKUs online to SKUs in store, so we have a ways to go. But I think the benefit of this is it\u2019s giving our customers an endless aisle. This is all really driven by data driven personalization, and it\u2019s given us we have to make sure that we are hitting Macy\u2019s high standards of quality and customer satisfaction.","I think in aggregate I see nothing but upside with Vendor Direct. I don\u2019t -- I am not going to speak to where we see it going over the long-term. I will tell you in kind of yearly increments. But we are on track to achieve all of our objectives.","I think that it adds sales, it adds profit, it increases satisfaction and traffic to the site. There\u2019s minimal capital and no inventory investment, so it really makes for a high ROIC rate. And so when we quote our digital business as being up double-digit, that includes what we are doing with Mobile. That includes what we are doing with Vendor Direct and we can see continued growth in the entire digital channel with Mobile and Vendor Direct being two of the big accelerants.","Paula Price","And so just to clarify on the accounting, Paul, to your question as well. This is a wholesale model from an accounting perspective so it adds sales, it adds gross margin. As Jeff said, there is no inventory, no capital, so it\u2019s really quite good in comparison to say owned. It\u2019s similar gross margins. It just depends on the categories that you select in terms of what the actual gross margin is. But again, no inventory, no capital makes for a very strong ROIC and so this is all good.","Paul Trussell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Chuck Grom","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering if you could impact for us the oppression in gross margins in the second quarter, I think, it\u2019s around 100 basis points for markdowns and 60 basis points for delivery, just wondering if that\u2019s correct. And I guess, if you could just hold our hand for the third quarter and fourth quarter, what offsets you could have against that 6-basis-point delivery headwind? Thanks.","Paula Price","Yeah. So just again just to step back a little bit on gross margin, when we last talked to you in May, our margin guidance factored in our expectations around the delivery expense, the pressure from that related to our growing digital business and the Star Rewards program, as well as the clearance of the excess spring stock that we had at the time.","As we moved deeper into the quarter, it became clearer, as Jeff mentioned, due to the factors that he mentioned, the fashion miss in key women\u2019s sportswear, private brands, the slow warm weather product sell-through the accelerated decline in international tourism that we needed to take the fast action to put us in good shape for the fall season.","And then just keep in mind that this was fashion apparel that had in and out dates that we really needed to hit and so when the sell-throughs did not improve as the quarter went on, we took these additional markdowns that got our inventory down to nearly flat on a comp basis, which is a really good place to be, as we head into the fall season.","So just a little bit on the numbers. Gross margin as you noted was down 160 basis points. Again that\u2019s about 90 basis points, almost a full point. That was related to the additional seasonal markdowns.","And the rest of it relates primarily to delivery headwinds, which is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, and was consistent with our expectations. So we took the markdowns thoughtfully and as we are entering the fall season, our inventory levels and mix are in line with what we expect our customer demand to be.","Then just while we are on the topic, let me give you the thoughts on how we are looking at the fall. So I will just reiterate the four points that I made earlier that gives us confidence in the fall gross margin improvements.","So private brand women\u2019s sportswear is in a much better position and we are allocating inventory more strategically and with better tools as we head into the fall season. We see planning is leaner and we will have merchant liquidity as we move through the fall season to buy opportunistically so we feel good about that.","Our fall promotions are more precise. Again, better tools there, and the productivity projects that we have been testing up to this point and sharing with you like hold and flow and markdown optimization, they really are ready to scale in the fall and so we anticipate benefit coming from those as well.","And then just regarding the guidance, just in general, as you know, we didn\u2019t change our sales guidance. We finished the spring season with comp above 0.5%, and as Jeff mentioned before, we have confidence in our fall strategies to continue the positive trend.","So if we hit the upper end of our sales range, we see gross margin down slightly. And then to be prudent, if sales are at the lower-end of our range, we would expect the gross margin rate to be a bit worse. But as I have said, we are confident in the fall plan.","Chuck Grom","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS.","Jay Sole","Great. Thanks so much. Jeff, I asked about your comment that, I think you said that, you see the risk to the annual guidance for 2019 to be no more than one nickel from tariffs. Could you talk about the algorithm to get there that if you don\u2019t change prices the vendors basically absorb all of the price increases or is there an element of maybe gross margin being a little bit under pressure, but you can offset it with SG&A, any help around that would be great. Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","Yeah. So on that, Jay, we have got -- we are looking at our own private brands where we are bear the full risk of any changes that we make and so we looked at that. We are obviously talking very intensely with all of our vendor partners and have been really on the whole subject of tariffs for some time now.","So we have gotten into a good place in terms of what price increases they are going to hoist on us, what they are absorbing themselves or what they are believing they are getting concessions from their own sourcing partners. So I think those are kind of in the, we are looking at that in three parts.","We are looking at what we are doing in our own private brands, what that means. And as I mentioned, what we have found is there\u2019s no customer appetite for price increases, so what are we going to do to mitigate that.","And so in the short run, where we have already taken our mitigation strategies, we believe that we might have additional risk of up to a nickel when you look at between our brand partners and our private brands, based on what we learned yesterday. That would be for the balance of 2019.","We are hard at work that if we continued with all of the 10% tariffs that are landing as of mid-December onward. We are looking at opportunities to mitigate that in 2020 and beyond, and we will keep everybody posted as we work through all those scenarios.","Jay Sole","Got it. Thanks so much.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Next question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citi.","Paul Lejuez","Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you talk about how big Vendor Direct was as a percentage of e-comm sales this quarter versus what it was in the second quarter of last year? Also what the plan is for the second half, how much of a growth driver that can be due to the comp? You did mention just secondly that second quarter results got off to a slow start. I am curious if you could make any comments about how 2Q finished and how 3Q started? Thanks.","Jeff Gennette","What I\u2019d say on, Paul, we are not quoting what Vendor Direct is through the first half of the year. We will definitely give you guide at the end of the year. As mentioned with the previous caller, it was about 10% of the business for 2018. It is growing at a rate bigger than the average of overall e-comm which is double-digit. So we don\u2019t break that out in kind of midstream on that.","As to how I characterized the sales flow within the quarter, it started out very slow in the month of May. And so the month of May was we don\u2019t often talk about weather, but in the month of May it was particularly cold and it was particularly wet and it was across the entire country.","So generally with weather, you get some pockets of the country that are experiencing warmer weather than others and they kind of cancel each other out. In this particular month, it was pretty tough across the Board.","So that\u2019s really the whole conversation about those are really important weeks in sell-through, in seasonal goods, like, spring and summer fashion deliveries, particularly shorts, tanks, tees, those types of deliveries. So very important that we responded to that.","It did get better in the month of June and the positive continued into the month of July. So what I would tell you is tough May, got better through the course of the remaining two months, which led to our positive comp for the total quarter.","Paul Lejuez","Thanks. Anything on 3Q?","Jeff Gennette","I am sorry?","Paul Lejuez","Can you talk about 3Q?","Paula Price","Yeah. We don\u2019t comment on in quarter results as you know, Paul.","Jeff Gennette","What I\u2019d say, Paul, is that we said earlier that we do expect that the four quarters can be meaningfully better than the third quarter from a comp perspective.","Paul Lejuez","Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Paula Price","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs.","Alexandra Walvis","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question on tourism. You mentioned that sales to foreign tourists are down 9% in the quarter. I wonder if you could give a little more color on that and whether the shape of that tourist spend has been changing over the last few quarters? Is it more a function of traffic or more a function of basket size there and how are you expecting that to trend?","Jeff Gennette","Hi, Alex. Let me give you some context on international tourism so and how it affects our business. So it is a significant driver of volume in 40 of our Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s stores. So it\u2019s the gateway cities. In many of these stores, virtually all of them are really touched by our growth initiative. So we are built and ready in both Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy\u2019s for those markets.","When you look at these international tourist sales, they are really some of our best transactions, because they are high AUR, more apt to buy full price and there\u2019s virtually no returns. So it\u2019s a very high margin sale that you are dealing with here.","So as we mentioned, our business across Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy\u2019s was down 9% in the second quarter and that was an acceleration from our trend from the first quarter where we were down 3%.","Now we are lapping four now consecutive quarters of negative comps, so we are going up against an easier fall compare than what we were up against in spring. And as I think, we get -- we are pretty good at this. We see that international tourism always has its ebbs and flows. This decline is not unprecedented. We have navigated through this before.","But just to be on the prudent side, we took our comp from the second quarter and we pulled that all the way through our fall expectations, just to be prudent. So even though we are up against a negative, a much easier comp in the back half, we did pull that through, just to be prudent.","And then what we are really focused in these 40 stores is what can we do to offset that international tourism. So we are really focused with those teams and our corporate teems on how we get more domestic tourists and how we really win more local customers in these very important doors.","So, then when you look at the composition by country, certainly Brexit is affecting us, China is depressed, there\u2019s always ins and outs depending on what country. But I am calling it as I see it right now. We are taking the trend from the second quarter and carrying that through the back half.","Alexandra Walvis","Great. Thanks. That\u2019s super helpful. And then one more here for you in ways that it\u2019s related, I wonder if you could comment on trends in the New York market. I am sure that tourism is having an impact there. But I wonder if you could also comment on the incremental supply in this market as there\u2019s been a few new openings of retail areas, there\u2019s some more coming up, how are you thinking about the New York market in that context?","Jeff Gennette","As expectations, I am sorry, if you look at the Manhattan, we have seen little change in our business in Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy\u2019s as a result of the new competition coming in there. We have some of our best performing stores are in the metro area and I would attribute that to customer satisfaction scores being up, growth initiatives being in place. So we have fought hard in those communities we are winning and that\u2019s not different in New York City or New York Metro versus other parts of the country.","So Bloomingdale\u2019s is while they had a more difficult quarter, where they are making investments you see it in New York City, they are having great strength in all the areas of the Bloomingdale\u2019s 59 Street store that they renovated, very happy that we have seen very little effect with the competition increasing in Manhattan with Bloomingdale\u2019s 59 Street. So I would say the metro area is unaffected by what you are describing.","Alexandra Walvis","Thanks so much.","Operator","Next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask some follow ups on inventory, but maybe a little bit more from a structural standpoint. Jeff, could you talk to and following another build up in inventory they need to markdown to clear it, could you talk about why Macy\u2019s maybe hasn\u2019t seen more benefits from technology -- using technology to run the business with less inventory, omni-channel capabilities, is that something we can look forward to in the future around inventory? And then you also mentioned Vendor Direct, the returns efficiency of that model where you don\u2019t have to own the inventory. As you think about your physical business as well, is there an opportunity to do more concessions, marketplaces at least with some of your big vendors where you can run, they can run the business owning the inventory and create working capital opportunities for Macy\u2019s in that way as well. Maybe you could address those things. Thanks.","Paula Price","So I will go ahead and start on this question, Omar, and then, Jeff, if he wants to add, can do so. One of the biggest things we are doing with funding our future is developing more tools to manage our inventory and our supply chain in a much smarter, more efficient way. So it\u2019s very much powered by technology.","And we already use advanced fulfillment logic to get our customers their products in the quickest amount of time at the lowest-cost for us and with the most effective inventory strategy. We use a combination of our mega centers, stores, vendor partners, to offer the customers the best experience, while allowing us to move inventory efficiently and cost effectively.","And we are taking that a step further by taking inventory position and markdown risk into consideration as we make fulfillment decisions using data analytics. So we are really excited about our supply chain and the transformations that we are seeing.","We are also getting ahead right now of the peak holiday season by allocating more of the high volume inventory and distribution centers to operate at full capacity and using our store fulfillment logic and options more effectively.","And we are also sort of efficiently consolidating box shipments to stores to reduce shipping costs. So when we think about the supply chain transformation and Funding Our Future productivity there are a lot of different initiatives that sort of fall under that.","In addition, in terms of inventory management, we are applying data science and data analytics to our markdowns in pricing, so that we can really measure the price velocity, how the inventory is moving at what prices and really get very, very smart -- smarter about how we manage our inventory. So this is a really big opportunity for us.","Jeff Gennette","And just to add one thing, Omar, to what Paula just said. I think the thing we are most excited about with markdown optimization is the ability in fall season to do that at a store level. So we have been doing it at the zone level.","We have tested it and we are now ready with all of our technology to be able to do that at a store level which is really going to help take markdowns on certain SKUs where you don\u2019t need to or you go to different levels where that\u2019s prudent. So that\u2019s going to help us with overall margin both in sales as well as gross margin improvement, with markdown optimization.","And then the second part of your question about, what are you learning from Vendor Direct and shifting some of the economic burden into lease or hybrid models. That is definitely always -- we are always looking for opportunities with that. And so when you look at what we learned from the market, kind of retail as a service, we don\u2019t own any of that inventory.","We basically are renting space and we are doing that through our partnership with Beta and so that platform is really running all the kind of different retailers that are coming into that space. They basically pay a fee, basically to be a part of that and that\u2019s giving customers new opportunities, new things for them to see, but with no risk to us.","When you think about lease, always looking at different lease options, the Bloomingdale\u2019s lease percent of their overall business is higher than Macy\u2019s. I know that Macy\u2019s will go higher over time, and we are looking for opportunities there.","We definitely, although, always want to make sure, that whatever we are doing with lease gives us the opportunity to make shifts where customers go, and so making sure that we are not tying ourselves into long-term commitments, that may not be customer focused. So we are always looking at this and expect this to continue.","Omar Saad","That makes a lot of sense. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi. Thank you. You have been really innovative, Jeff, in thinking about e-commerce and subscription. You have done a lot of work with thredUP. Why is now the right time and what are your thoughts on balancing your relationship with thredUP and Castle against your vendor Matrix and also thinking about consumers looking for new items and the cannibalization risk balancing that against the opportunity? And Paula, just a quick follow up, the precision and the fall promotions and thinking about that, sometimes the challenge can be in making sure you still get your fair share of traffic when you alter promotions, would love your thought on how you are balancing the precision against the traffic risk? Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","So, hi, Oliver. Let me go first on your questions about kind of e-commerce and rental. This is a -- when you think about that kind of acquisition strategies, we have a very developed core customer who loves our brand and basically we just got stickier with her decisions about shopping with us with our loyalty program.","We have got a customer base in what I would call bucket two, which is an occasional customer that we are trying to get them to migrate up in our spend and then we have got an entire acquisition strategy.","And when you look at acquisition, e-commerce and rental is really at the heart of that, and so there is many customers that love from a sustainability perspective, as well as just having new content at great prices, they love what the real world is doing or in the case of our customer, what thredUP has been doing for some time.","And so when we met with James and really said, okay, what\u2019s our opportunity, he was looking at opportunities with brick-and-mortar and his own or partnerships and this was a good connection for us to come together. So we are doing it now. It\u2019s rolling in. We are doing it for the back-to-school time frame and 40 doors is really when it\u2019s starting.","And I will tell you that with the products that are selling best are those that we don\u2019t turn carry. So to your question or concern about how do you in-line vendors feel about it, it\u2019s just giving these customers additional brands that we don\u2019t carry at great prices.","So I am very encouraged. We are testing it in different parts of the store, where it\u2019s best, how it\u2019s best received. So we are going to be -- we will have a full analysis of it as we get through the fall season, but I am very encouraged by this.","As it relates to rental and what you see with what Bloomingdale\u2019s just announced, which is My List and our partnership with Castle, we needed to play in this game. I am really happy with what Tony and Denise, and their teams created here and this has been under development for about a year and a half. I think it\u2019s got some unique characteristics. But it takes the full complement of strengths of contemporary vendors at Bloomingdale\u2019s. The vendors themselves are thrilled to be a part of this.","So and then the broader play would be what does this do to inform a similar opportunity in Macy\u2019s future. So staying on kind of the acquisition, we are really focused on digital-first strategies. What that means with influencers. What we are doing with our own colleague population with Style Crew, reinventing beauty with respect to Instagram. So these initiatives I think really help us with acquisition.","Paula Price","And so, in terms of your question regarding balancing precision and traffic risks. So what I meant by that is that we are really using better tools, better data to understand all of our promotions in terms of what\u2019s working and what\u2019s less effective.","And so we are simplifying our promotions, we are measuring how effective those are, what kinds of results and outcomes they deliver, we are delayering where it\u2019s appropriate our promotions, we are partnering to get better data around the outcomes of our promotion, we are segmenting the customers in looking at how we target different customers with different promotions.","So that\u2019s a piece that I mean when I say we are doing this with greater precision and we are balancing that with the outcomes. Outcomes like traffic, and ultimately, what sales these promotions drive. So we are getting better at that. It\u2019s just another way of how we are using data and data analytics to support our decisions.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Paula Price","Thank you.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, Oliver.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.","Bob Drbul","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple more questions, on the thredUP relationship, how much square footage are you allocating in the 40 stores that you are doing. And the overlap with Backstage versus thredUP and I guess if you could talk about that? And then, just the question on national brands, like you had some pressure in your private brands, but I was just wondering if you would comment on national brands and maybe even denim a little bit as a category? Thanks.","Jeff Gennette","Okay. Thanks, Bob. So square footage in thredUP is approximately 500 square feet in each of these 40 stores. Very little impact, it\u2019s when you look at the content of Backstage, the content of Macy\u2019s, the content of thredUP, is mostly discrete.","So when you look at thredUP, we obviously gave them a list of vendors that we don\u2019t need products because we have either got them expressed and Backstage or in last act or as part of our regular portfolio.","So really we are merchandising into where we sell holes in our inventory with this e-commerce play and this idea that it was pre-owned is very attractive to many customers, not just because of the price, but also because of the sustainability, so that\u2019s how we approach that.","When you talk about national brands, like, anything, you have got some national brands that are totally on the pulse of their customer and they have made all of the right decisions from a value and a content perspective, and they are winning and others that are finding their way or their customer shifted and they are having to make adjustments.","So I wouldn\u2019t characterize one seer it of vendors one way or another. It really depends upon the business that you are in and where they are in their own evolution and so that\u2019s how I would -- and then with respect to denim. What I\u2019d tell you is that when I look at denim from the second quarter there were really positions of strength in a number of areas.","When you look at our kids business, our kids business is one of our stand outs in the first half of the year and some of that was a result of denim and then denim is mixed in the women\u2019s apparel area and doing quite well in men\u2019s.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all of the detail here. Can I just ask, on the categories that you guys spoke about, what confidence is there in, I guess, what\u2019s different between the spring and the fall women\u2019s apparel trends and I know you said that you are confident you are clean on inventory. I am trying to figure out what you see that helps boost your confidence the new assortment can drive improved traffic? And then just sticking with the topline for a second, I want to ask about the comps again, Paula. Should we think about 3Q comps within the full year range of flat to up 1 or should we be thinking more like 3Q comps negative switching to positive in 4Q, just to help us understand some of the dimensions.","Jeff Gennette","Michael, let me start. So what I tell about ready-to-wear is that ready-to-wear is really in kind of two pieces. There\u2019s the classifications piece which is dresses, suits, activewear, coats, swim, those in aggregate are showing really healthy growth and they have been strengths of Macy\u2019s. We see those continuing all the way through the back half of the year.","When you look at sportswear, which is where we had our problem with private brands of sportswear which is the bulk of that business, the bulk of sportswear business is private brands. What I\u2019d tell you is that we are in a really good inventory position for the right expectation for fall season.","So what I would expect this is not a rapid turnaround. I would expect that the trend that we have experienced in the sportswear business would continue through the back half of the year without the inventory overhang that\u2019s going to create a margin problem for it. So that\u2019s how I would characterize ready-to-wear.","Paula Price","And so what I\u2019d say about the quarters, Mike, is that we don\u2019t guide the quarters, as you know. But as I said earlier, we do expect the fourth quarter to be meaningfully better than the third quarter and so Q3 could be outside of our annual guidance range, so I would think about it in that way.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And if I could just ask a follow up maybe an easier one on the SG&A leverage in the second half. I know you have got some cost initiatives flowing through, have a little better control over that after some investment in the first half. So I guess if sales do come in above the plan, how should we think about SG&A relative to your guidance and if sales come in light, do you have more room you can pull back on SG&A or are there other still some fixed costs from the initiatives running in there that make it a little bit inflexible if sales are to the downside of the plan? Thanks.","Paula Price","Sure. I would just repeat at -- our guidance. In terms of SG&A at the high end of our guidance, we would expect the performance to be better in the fall than in the spring. And again as you know our expenses are weighted more heavily to the first half of the year, because we began our investment earlier in the year and will benefit from expenses later in the year.","Sales are higher, then that you would see that in our SG&A leverage. If sales are lower, yes, we always manage our expenses prudently and think about different sales scenarios and what we would do there. And so, we have demonstrated that we can flex our sales in different sales environments or flex our expenses in different sales environments.","Michael Binetti","Thanks for all of the help and detail there.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, Michael.","Paula Price","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from Brian Cowen with Bank of America.","Brian Cowen","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I just wanted peel back on your perspective on balance sheet health. Debt reduction has been strong, but 2019 leverage looks like it could be at or above the high end of your target range, so what options should we consider being available near-term to keep the balance sheet in line with investment grade ratings, you don\u2019t seem to be getting credit for the, I guess, 10% dividend yield, so would you consider altering that dividend payout?","Paula Price","So, again, I would just reiterate our capital allocation strategy, which hasn\u2019t changed. We do continue to generate strong cash flows and we use that cash flow prudently. And so just to reiterate what our priorities are, first and foremost is to invest in the business and so we have guided that we will invest about $1 billion this year.","Second is to maintain a healthy balance sheet so we are significantly -- we have been significantly reducing our debt. We plan to use excess cash in 2019, as we said before, to further reduce our debt, to be well within our target leverage range of 2.5 times to 2.8 times and we look at that with and without asset sale gains and that\u2019s important as we face into any economic environment and being in this range gives us flexibility as well.","And next we will continue to return a competitive cash dividend to our shareholders. We are doing that and we are committed to continuing to do that.","And then the last thing is that as our cash position warrants, we will consider along with our Board resuming our share repurchase program. So that\u2019s how we think about our capital allocation strategy and it hasn\u2019t changed.","Brian Cowen","Thank you.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to your host for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Gennette","Thanks, everybody.","Paula Price","Thank you, everyone.","Mike McGuire","Thank you.

Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Macy's conference call. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited.","A replay of the call will be available on our website www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company\u2019s most recently filed Form 10-K.","We are very happy to report that we have reached our long-term profitability target of 14% EBITDA rate for fiscal 2014. As you know, this has been a goal on which we have stayed focused even after the setback in the 2008-2009 recession.","We also were able to achieve 10% adjusted EPS growth in 2014 and hit the low end of our original guidance from a year ago, a $4.40 to $4.50 for annual EPS and exceeded our revised guidance of $4.25 to $4.35 that we had provided at the start of the fourth quarter.","We at Macy's had put together a string of very good years and we have no intention of stopping now.","Think about Macy's journey over the past 10 years as having three phases. The first phase began in 2005 with the May Company acquisition. We took two very good retail companies and put them together to form a really great company with a huge depth of talent, great store location, an early stage online business and relationships with most wanted merchandise brand including our own private brands. In the first phase, we converted a disparate collection of regional name plates into a nationwide Macy's brand and a somewhat larger Bloomingdale's brand.","The second phase began 2008 and 2009 as we molded ourselves around the MOM strategy, My Macy's, Omnichannel and MAGIC Selling. In these past six years, we have made enormous stride in adopting and involving localization creating a truly Omichannel business with seamless integration across stores, online and mobile and deepening customer engagement through MAGIC selling. In this second phase, we found growth in both owned and license businesses. We put together five consecutive years of comp sales growth, six consecutive years of double digit growth and adjusted EPS, and now hit a longstanding target of the 14% EBITDA rate.","Coming into 2015, we entered our third phase. Having now reached one of the industry's highest profitability rate we are focusing ourselves on accelerating top-line sale growth while maintaining this best in class profitability rate. You have seen this restructure merchandising and marketing with an Omichannel view of our customer, inventories and business. We also brought all of our technology functions under one senior leader. We have aligned all the elements of our base business so we can act faster and be quicker to decision in driving organic growth, and we also now set up a new structure with top talent to foster innovation and new business opportunities such as international and off price.","The upcoming acquisition of Bluemercury creates an entirely new channel to reach additional customer segments while also helping to grow beauty in our base business. As exiting and gratifying as the first two phases have been, this new phase we have entered has the opportunity to take our company to a whole new level of success. We have the ability to create a larger relationship with existing customers and make inroads with customers that have not traditionally shopped either Macy's or Bloomingdale.","So let's talk now about the fourth quarter and the highlights of the full-year performance. I will then talk about our outlook for 2015 and end, as always, by taking your question.","Our fourth quarter sales were $9.364 billion, up 1.8% over last year. As we announced on February 3, our sales increased 2.5% on a comp own-plus-license basis in the quarter. Our stronger businesses in the fourth quarter were coats, active, dresses, handbags, younger millennial apparel, shoes, both men's and women's, cosmetics and furniture mattresses. Interestingly, two of those, dresses and shoes, men's and women's, were areas where we tested the single view of inventory between stores and our direct-to-customer warehouses. This is what we just rolled out company-wide as a result of these successes. This gives us great optimism for our ability to accelerate growth. The weaker businesses in the quarter were Housewares and Top of Table.","Geographically, we did the best in the southern region, as well as the Midwest. Our strongest growth markets were throughout the southwest but also included Colorado and Midwest markets such as Chicago, Detroit and Indiana. Our tourist stores for both Macy's and Bloomingdale were heard in the quarter driven by weaker international tourist spending in light of the stronger dollar. In spite of this though, Bloomingdale had a good quarter and improved versus their third quarter trend.","Our digital channels at both Macy's and Bloomingdale did extremely well in the quarter. We were very focused and pleased with what we accomplished with buy online, pickup in store, both because of the number of the customers who utilized this new way of shopping but also for the radiated sales that we got when the orders were picked up. And our Same Day Delivery test was successful and we will expand in 2015 to additional markets.","Average unit retail in the quarter was 1.4% versus last year with total transactions up 2.5% and average units per transaction down 1.3%.","Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 40.3%, down 30 basis points from last year. Merchandise margin was down by approximately the same amount. The growth in delivery expense due to the Omni transaction was offset by the increase in income from the license businesses and other miscellaneous factors. Recall though that I told you to expect a decline in gross margin rate in the fourth quarter and for the back half of the year our gross margin rate was down 10 basis points which was consistent with our guidance.","Inventory at year-end was down 0.7% below last year and on a comp basis it was up 0.9%, a little less than 1% of last year. This is consistent with our strategy to improve inventory turnover. At year-end, we were not yet experiencing a problem from the West Coast port slowdown. Since then, however, our inventory levels have been negatively impacted particularly in apparel and accessories. Approximately 12% of our first quarter merchandise receipts are being delayed and this will have some impact on our sales, gross margin and expense in the first few months of the year, but we have incorporated our expectations into the guidance we provided today.","SG&A in the fourth quarter was $2.324 billion, up 1% over last year and down 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. This is better than we had expected. The primary reasons for expense being lower than we expected were lower medical and retirement expenses and stronger than expected credit performance. Credit income in the quarter was $240 million, up $22 million over last year. The usage of our proprietary credit cards reached 47.4%, which is 30 basis points above last year. Retirement expense in the quarter was $12 million which also was better than expected.","The quarter also included asset sale gain of $36 million, which is $22 million lower than then asset sale gain last year in the fourth quarter. Operating income excluding impairments, store closings and other costs was, therefore, $1.451 billion, up from last year's $1.437 billion on the same basis. This increase was 1%, but remember, there were shifts between the third and fourth quarters. And for the second half of the year, operating income on this basis was up over 4%.","Impairment, store closing cost and other costs were $87 million, which is better than the $100 million to $110 million we had expected when the announcement was made in early January. This is primarily because severance came in lower than anticipated. Of this amount, approximately $33 million relates the non-cash asset impairment.","Interest expense in the quarter was $97 million and we also paid a $70 million premium on the early retirement of the debt in the quarter.","Tax expense was $457 million in the quarter and net income was $793 million. Excluding the impairment, store closing, debt premium and other cost, net income was $857 million in the quarter, down slightly from last year's $865 million.","Average diluted share count in the quarter was 351 million shares, which is 6.5% lower than last year. During the fourth quarter, we utilized $470 million to buyback stock, brining the full-year stock buyback amount to $1.9 billion. And during the year, we bought back 31.9 million shares.","EPS in the fourth quarter on a diluted basis was $2.26 or $2.44, excluding the items mentioned earlier. This is up 5.6% over last year on the same basis. So as I said earlier, the fourth quarter performance helped to make 2014 another good year for Macy's.","Let me just summarize five key highlights as I look back on 2014. Comp sales on an own-plus-license basis were up 1.4% for the full-year. And while we think we fared well versus competitors, we did not achieve our original expectation. We achieved 10% adjusted EPS growth in the low end of our original guidance. Our adjusted EPS has grown 26% per year since 2009.","We hit our long term goal in 2014 of reaching the 14% EBITDA rate and we achieved a return on invested capital of 22.4%, 90 basis points above last year, and we generated over $1.7 billion of cash flow after operating and investing activities which is about the same as we did last year. CapEx in the year was $1.068 billion which was a little below our $1.1 billion budget due to timing.","We are very proud of this performance, but as we look forward we are focused on accelerating growth. The changes made to our organization in January and in early February were made with this in mind. We reorganized our merchant and marketing organizations to make them faster, more nimble and better connected between the stores and the digital world. While we now have Omni buyers and planners who span both channels, we also have digital merchants who are 100% dedicated to working with the Omni merchants to drive digital growth. Just to be clear, we did not eliminate .com merchants at Macy's.","We do realize that we have lots of people learning new parts of their jobs but we believe our teams can make these changes and still deliver the expected result this year.","We also made changes to our senior team to enable two key executives to focus more on growth, Jeff Gennette, our President and Peter Sachse.","Jeff replaced himself as Chief Merchant, so he could have more time to strategize growth. He will be focusing on organic growth including subjects like digital growth, key families of business like beauty and jewelry, as well as how to grow more aggressively with our private brands as well as our key vendor partners.","Peter will be working on new growth initiatives and innovation. This is the first time we have had a senior person assigned full-time to focus on growth. Short-term Peter is working with his new team on piloting and off price concept and developing our approach to innovation. They also will be studying international opportunities both store and digital.","This is all very exciting and these changes have really energized our organization. Adding to the excitement is the pending acquisition of Bluemercury. We see such opportunity for Bluemercury to expand their business rapidly across the country in the digital channel and also maybe perhaps overseas down the road. We also look forward to opening Bluemercury shops within our Macy's stores. This accelerated growth won't happen overnight, but we do expect it to make a difference in our top-line results over the next two to three years. We will be testing different ideas and will rollout those ideas that have potential. We are all very excited about this and much like our MOM strategy we expect our team to execute this well and deliver outstanding results.","Our guidance for 2015 a transition year and straightforward. And even though we see it as a transition year, we are still guiding to sales and EPS growth. We are assuming comp growth of approximately 2% for 2015 on both an owned and an owned-plus-license basis with total sales growth of approximately 1%.","We're guiding to a flattish EBITDA rate as a percent of sales and earnings per share on a diluted basis of $4.70 to $4.80 per share. In terms of capital spending, we are increasing our budget by approximately $100 million to $1.2 billion to help fund the growth initiative. We are making investments in growth but the key to our approach is balance. We want to accelerate growth but it needs to be profitable growth. By planning ahead we were able to offset these growth and technology investments as well as headwinds from higher expected benefit cost and information security with the $140 million savings that we're expecting to get from the restructuring that we announced in January. And as you are building your detailed models for 2015, here are three other key planning assumptions that help.","Interest expense we're assuming at approximately $380 million. We're planning a tax rate of approximately 37%, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $1.060 billion in 2015.","We also will be closing the Bluemercury deal hopefully during the first quarter. This guidance does not include Bluemercury, but while that acquisition will add sales obviously to 2015, we don\u2019t expect it to be accretive to earnings in this partial year.","As I said earlier, we are very excited by the opportunities to accelerate sales of our base businesses of Macy's and Bloomingdale\u2019s, and going forward we see opportunity to accelerate our growth in other ways as well. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters and years ahead.","And before I pause for questions, just one piece of housekeeping. We have decided to change the time of our earnings calls going forward to 9:00 am Eastern Time beginning with our first quarter 2015 earnings call in May. We had talked to many of you about this and concluded that it makes sense. We think this will enable us to get information out to all of you faster after we release our earnings at 8:00 am.","And with that, I'll open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Oliver Ken with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Ken","Congrats on solid results and on the evolution of model here. Regarding the next steps in thinking about how you're looking at Macy's in a more growth orientated fashion, on the off price side, could you speak to the customer target and how vendor relationships may evolve and if online will play a role here? And just as a question for our models, as we're thinking about the 2% comp guidance, did you have an inclination in terms of how we should think about UPTs versus transactions in terms of what you're seeing and what we may extrapolate? Thank you.","Karen Hoguet","Yes, on the second question, no, we really -- its -- we don\u2019t expect major change in average unit retail units per transaction etcetera as we looked at '15. I mean in terms of the off price pilot, I think it's pretty mature to really answer those questions. We're obviously looking at stores and digital as we think about it going forward, but not sure exactly yet how that will look. So as we get to test and the pilot started we'll talk more about that.","Oliver Ken","Okay, thank you. Best regards.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Karen, you called 2015 a transition year. So guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. Is that a year of increased cost and then we\u2019ll see that investment come down --","Karen Hoguet","No, because remember we're holding to the 14% EBITDA rate. So the key is holding the profit rate and trying to strategize to get greater growth. So we don\u2019t expect to see the accelerated growth in '15, hence the 2% comp guidance, that\u2019s really where the transition is. As I said, we expected to make the investments in growth and, therefore, the restructuring is funding those investments. So anticipated and then planned for it, but again holding both for EBITDA rate and also earnings growth.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Great. And then as we look to our longer term cash flow model, is $1.2 billion the new level of CapEx or is that -- would that be just for this year and then perhaps fell to come down a bit?","Karen Hoguet","Well I don\u2019t think it will come down. I think the question is how is the model going to evolve going forward, but I don\u2019t anticipate it going down. Well there is going to be ongoing investments in technology for ever, so I can't say you what they are going to be but year whatever was we budgeted last year there's new subjects to go in. And so we believe that the technology spend will not go down at least as far out we can say and, obviously, we\u2019re continuing to maintain and add new stores where we can. So I really don\u2019t anticipate a reduction.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And from Morgan Stanley we'll go next to Kimberly Greenberge","Kimberly Greenberge","Great. Thank you. A really fine end to the quarter or rather and for the year here in Q4, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you, Kim.","Kimberly Greenberge","I'm wondering obviously the new strategies and initiatives you got, you have in place to drive an accelerated revenue growth over the next two to three years, 2015, if I could read between the lines, is sort of seed year if you will to put the things in place that will drive that growth and I'm wondering what metrics internally will you all be looking at to gauge whether or not you are on track to deliver that acceleration and growth, and are there ways that you can share some of that information with us along the way so that we can understand how you are performing relative to your expectation?","Karen Hoguet","So I think I mean the easiest way to track is going to be our comp sales performance. So achieving that 2% will be very important as a signal as to whether things are working. We will also be testing various things throughout the year but we won\u2019t know the results until we get through the fourth quarter next year. So it's going to be hard to keep you up-to-date. Obviously, if there's something we're either very excited about or we\u2019re not going to pursue we'll tell you, but we are testing what the concepts and ideas that we hope to rollout next year. Much like if you think about the single view of inventory, we tested it last year. We started with dresses on the spring season of '14 and then added four or five business until the fall so that we would know whether we could roll it out this year. And as I said earlier, we were so excited by the results of those tests we rolled it out to the whole company.","Kimberly Greenberge","Great. Just a follow-up on your comp guidance for 2015. The 2014 rate obviously fell just a fraction of a point underneath that 2% goal. You've got a lot easier comparisons in 2015 but is there a something else feeding into that 2% comp target it 2015 that wasn't really there for 2014?","Karen Hoguet","No, I mean '14 we did 1.4%, so the 2% is actually higher than 14%. So I don\u2019t think there's anything unusual about the year 2015 when it comes to the comp guidance.","Kimberly Greenberge","I mean anything unusual that could help it reaccelerate to the 2% level?","Karen Hoguet","Sure. I can give you a whole list of things. It gives me great confidence that it could do better, but at the same time you just don\u2019t know.","Kimberly Greenberge","Okay. Thanks, Karen.","Operator","And we'll go next to Paul Swinand with Morningstar.","Paul Swinand","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions as always. Wanted to just -- sorry if I'm beating the horse here, but the CapEx at $1.2 billion, if you are going to hold at the same I'm assuming that the top-line is getting better, is that you are targeting a rate of sale or a percentage of sales?","Karen Hoguet","No. Just as we don\u2019t know what is going to happen going forward in terms of the capital budget as I've listened to various investors call lately there's something fusion around technology and some have implied that it should come down over time, and the point I'm trying to make is I don\u2019t expect that to go down nor do I expect the investment we\u2019re making in our store business to go down over time.","So the only question could be might there be more rapid spending on some growth initiatives, and at some point there could be if we see the opportunity, but at this point I wouldn\u2019t know what it was or how to quantify it.","Paul Swinand","And with the risk of you not wanted to reveal all your plans, is the $1.2 billion more leaning towards the technology? And then can you give us any color and the composition of the increase and how its go look on forward?","Karen Hoguet","Well if you think about the $1.1 billion, I mean that encompass the technology that we've been spending that we'll continue to spend. The extra $100 million roughly is for growth initiatives whether it would be to expand Bluemercury, whether it would be the off price pilots that we are talking about and other things like that.","Paul Swinand","Okay, great. Thank you and best of luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you very much.","Operator","And from Wells Fargo, we'll go next to Paul Lejuez.","Paul Lejuez","Hey, thanks, Karen. Can you maybe talk about some of the major buckets of expenses in 2015, where you expect to see leverage versus delverage, and specifically, if you could touch on your assumption for credit income and retirement expense, how those factor in to guidance this year?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, credit income, my suspicion for next year will be flat to down slightly, and as often is the case of credit it maybe lumpy because if you think about the roll-out of the chip cards that will come most likely all in the third quarter. So you may see some odd quarterly progression on the credit line, but in total for the year, we would expect it to be flat to down slightly.","On the retirement expense, after obviously huge reduction this year we do expect it go up modestly in '15 but not by a huge amount. Healthcare is obviously going to go up significantly which again shouldn\u2019t surprise anybody. I think those would be major factors as we've talked about headwinds. And then obviously we continue to invest a lot in information security, and then also in these growth initiatives which obviously dumped their sales yet, and so we\u2019re investing in those, but we are covering with the restructuring that we had announced earlier at this year.","Paul Lejuez","Got you, thanks. And then how should we think about asset dispositions offsetting CapEx in 2015 and beyond, and how that might factor into the P&L as well?","Karen Hoguet","Well we've had significant asset sale gain for last couple of years, as you know, and I would expect that to continue as we go forward; I think that's just going to be a piece of the business. I can\u2019t tell you what the amount is, but we are assuming in our guidance that we will continue to monetize stores.","Paul Lejuez","Okay. Thanks, Karen. Best of luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","And from Northcoast Research we'll go next to Jeff Stein.","Jeff Stein","Given the fact that you are planning kind of flattish EBITDA margin, can you talk a little bit about kind of what's going on within the P&L, kind of outlook for gross margin and SG&A? And also wondering if you have given any thoughts now that you have achieved your target EBITDA margin, is there any thought being given to kind of resetting the bar?","Karen Hoguet","Oh, my goodness, let us enjoy it for five minutes. The really answer is look it could go up a little bit, but we are not aiming to go higher. We believe we've hit the right balance between growth and profitability in achieving this, but as we said repeatedly, when we originally were thinking about going a lot higher that it was going to impede growth. So our judgment is staying around 14% is the right answer. And again, it could go up but we are certainly not going to strategize to make that happen.","Jeff Stein","And taking a look at gross margin this year and SG&A directionally, how would you make a deal?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, we are not going to give a lot of guidance here yet. We are still formulating the plans, but I wouldn\u2019t expect significant change on either line at this point.","Jeff Stein","Okay. And final question, the women's sportswear business is just kind of been in the doldrums for a number of years now. Any thoughts in terms of what might possibly reignite a stronger trend there, and do you have anything or have you seen anything in your business to give you encouragement on that side?","Karen Hoguet","Did you say women's sportswear?","Jeff Stein","Yes.","Karen Hoguet","Well, I think used to think about defined by what women are wearing today, and actually if you think about that dresses has been extremely strong and continues to be so, both their dresses and evening dresses, so active, at leisure. So I think we all need to think about women's apparel differently, and actually it had a pretty decent year last year when you think about it more broadly.","Jeff Stein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","You mentioned the impact from the West Coast port issue on 1Q. Just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that and how we should think about the cadence of comps during the year given that impact as well as any timing of marketing shifts or the launch of any particular initiatives.","Karen Hoguet","Yes, we are not providing guidance by quarter that way. So I'm sorry that I really can't help you there. Clearly sales margin and expense will get impact for some degree in the first quarter, because of the port situation, but I'm not going to give guidance by quarter.","Paul Trussell","Understood. And then as we look at the balance sheet obviously you discussed modestly higher Capex. Is there any change to the cadence of buyback, just how you are thinking about usage of cash as well as your targeted leverage ratios? Any changes there?","Karen Hoguet","There is no change in our targeted leverage ratios, and the way we use our excess cash as you know in addition to paying the dividend has been to buyback stock with the cash over and above what we are using for Capex. So while we don\u2019t get guidance for specific buyback number, you can't expect this continue to be aggressive in terms of buying back stock.","Paul Trussell","And just lastly, you have mentioned international as one of your initiatives. Obviously, there are some license stores to be opened in the UAE area this year. Is there a potential for a owned international store, just how are you thinking about that particular initiative?","Karen Hoguet","Yes. And at this point, we have one Bloomingdale's store in Dubai and we have the Macy's and Bloomingdale's license locations opening in 2018. So they are not opening this year. And at this point, I'm not really even sure we have a good answer to that yet. We have been extraordinarily successful with the Dubai partnership. Our partner there runs a terrific Bloomingdale. And it's been great not only for sales there and the profit we get from the license agreement but, more importantly, it has helped our business here in terms of international awareness, as we all know the world has become so global. So we are very excited about that. But we may very well end up owning our own stores in other parts of the world at some point; we just don't know.","And as I mentioned earlier, we are also looking at online and Omnichannel opportunity. But when you see how well our brands resonate with the international tourist in this country, it frankly seems like we should be utilizing that brand awareness and the popularity of the brand in some way. But we haven't figured out how to do that. And as always you'd see us do it in a balanced and rational way as we have done in fact with Dubai with Bloomingdale's.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Hey. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Boss","So larger picture, can you talk about the balance between multiyear growth investments and the earnings growth algorithm here? And more so, what's the best way to think about phases of the three-year growth map in 2015 versus maybe 2016 and 2017?","Karen Hoguet","Well, this maybe over simplifying it. But I separate sort of the organic base business growth and that hopefully will accelerate in '16 as SVI rolled out to the company as the new organization is better able to focus on Omnichannel growth, as well as some of the initiatives we are working on that we talked about -- that I talked about earlier.","The newer ideas that Peter is working on will probably take more time to have an impact on the company. And so those will less likely have a big impact in '16 or '17. But again, we are building for the future, I mean it's really the key here. But in terms of the organic growth, we hope to begin to see impact very quickly. And obviously comp growth is a very good thing for the bottom line of the company and the cash flow, so good that that\u2019s happening soon.","Matthew Boss","Okay, great, and then can you just talk about some of the learnings from the single view of inventory test that you did across shoes and dresses, and more so kind of the best way to think about the top-line and margin opportunity that we could see now that its rolled out across the chain?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, I mean a couple of things. One is that in one of the teams that began analyzing not just the demand in the stores in a given market but they also looked at the .com demand in that market and, as a result, they're now analyzing with, we call it trade area demand, and it's allowing them to allocate better the merchandise location to location.","In another test -- in another area we began testing online which gave us very quick results so that we can rollout a new product very quickly and so that\u2019s been helpful. Also we've been able to negotiate differently as we're working together. So there is lots of opportunities for growing the business that our teams have found and I think it's just only beginning.","Operator","And from UBS we'll go next to Michael Binetti.","Michael Binetti","Quickly on, obviously the Wal-Mart announcement major increases to minimum wages and I know a lot of the positions that you guys have are -- would be at above that rate but as I look around the web I can see some of your entry level positions are in a range of that I would say might have upward pressure on them with a big competitor -- I guess a big retailer like Wal-Mart having making some raises there. Can you talk to us a little bit about your thoughts on whether that will impact you or maybe how much of the work force could be upward pressure on the wage rate?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, obviously wage rates are subject we studied quite closely, and currently our wage rates are above the state minimum wages, and we tend to provide first jobs for many of our associates and we knew if these entry level associates up the wage scale as they can experience. Having said that, we're constantly studying what's happening and, by the way, its market-by-market and what we need to do to be competitive in terms of our hiring. So I think this will be an ongoing area of attention.","Michael Binetti","Okay, and I guess just a follow up on the off price initiative you mentioned, I find it interesting that consumers obviously showing that they appreciate that channel. Obviously, you have leadership position in your existing business but there is installed competition in that sector. What do you think about that attracted you guys to that space that could your advantage as you jump into a category with an installed base of competitors and maybe where some of the challenges in that businesses that will be new for your team compared to what they're doing today?","Karen Hoguet","Well obviously, there is always challenges in starting a new business and particularly one way there is very successful competitors, but our team thinks they have the opportunity to compete quite effectively against these players. Obviously, I'm not going to tell you until we started rolling that. But the team feels very optimistic that we will do well, but again this is one of those ends we will let the customer vote and see what she says.","Michael Binetti","Any perspective on the dividend before you go?","Karen Hoguet","No, I mean the dividend is an important part of our capital allocation strategy; there is really no change there.","Michael Binetti","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson","Karen, you mentioned tourism issue in the fourth quarter. Could you share either all portion of sales as that\u2019s related to tourism or how much of an impact that had in the fourth quarter? And then could you also provide some additional detail on the 2015 comp outlook and what's driving the plan for that licensing component?","Karen Hoguet","We don\u2019t break out the tourist business or the international business, obviously it's more of an impact in places like New York City or Downtown San Francisco but we don\u2019t break it out and total or the impact have had on the quarter. Obviously, we do everything we can to offset it.","And in terms of the comp guidance, we've given about the same guidance for the owned and the owned-plus-license. Well our license businesses are growing faster than the owned, so maybe there will be somewhat of a delta. We don\u2019t expect it to be like it's been in recent years because, at this point, we're not planning to introduce any new license businesses to our mix. So obviously, if we were to announce a new business that would change our guidances, but for now the guidance is about 2% both on a own basis and in own-plus-license, but we would expect the own-plus-license to be a little bit higher.","Joan Payson","Great, thank you.","Operator","And from Goldman Sachs we'll go to Stephen Grambling.","Stephen Grambling","Just one follow up on Matt's single source inventory question, how is this impacting your plan for the growth rate in inventory and maybe how that will impact turns, and is there actually an opportunity for ROIC at this point the whole they even improve as margins are flat and CapEx is up relative to sales?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, I mean that\u2019s the dream. And again I think as our buyers and planners are looking at inventory across the direct to customer warehouses and stores. They're being so smarter about where to put inventory or moving it channel to channel. So I think it's going to have a big impact on turnover which will be very good down the road. Now I don\u2019t think that will all be in '15. As I said, this is a transition year, but we are optimistic that this could make a difference.","Stephen Grambling","That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess changing gears, if we look at the ecommerce business, is there any detail that you can give on how the assortment online has changed over the past few years, and how you expected to change going forward perhaps aside from the Bluemercury deal?","Karen Hoguet","Well I mean I think we continue and try to offer both at Macy's and Bloomingdale's the best assortment we can. In some cases, we extend what we have in the stores what we call the endless aisle whether it'd be big and tall, sizes or small sizes that may not be in every single store, so that\u2019s been a big help. There is some merchandise that we have only online. But for the most part we're aiming for more congruency between stores and online.","Stephen Grambling","And is there an opportunity to maybe move to more drop shipping?","Karen Hoguet","Well we do a fair amount of that today from the vendors. Remember that if a order is combined, it's not only sufficient to ship part from the vendor and part from us, but we're always looking for those opportunities. And again, we start with what the customer wants and try to make these decisions in the smartest way we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul","Just a couple of questions. On I guess overall when you look at the business the health of the consumer in the trends of like opening price points versus some of the collection businesses, can you just talk about any of the trends that you're seeing there and any impact on GAF? And then in terms of the drivers to the comp for 2015, like what are the categories that you expect to really lead this year as we look forward?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, I mean in terms of the categories my suspicion is going to be the categories that we've seen doing well. We still expect active be very strong and the center core categories most notably handbags, cosmetics, beauty big ticket. So I think we're going to see a lot of continuation of what we have been seeing. Men's has been strong, shoes, etcetera, as we go into '15.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And how about just like general comments on the consumer?","Karen Hoguet","Sorry about that, I forgot, didn\u2019t listen your second question. I think that what's interesting is as we look back on '14 and we look at what we were expecting in terms of the economy. Our internal projections were right on the money in terms of inflation, GDP growth. Where they missed was GAF growth, general merchandise apparel and furniture and we actually were over a point -- we expect the GAF growth to be about a point plus higher last year than it turned out to be, and so as we look to '15 and interestingly in the fourth quarter we did see GAF growth beginning to strengthen which could bode quite well for '15 should that happen and in part due to the GAF prices and in part just to the how the momentum has changed. So that could be helpful as we go into '15.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And just give us any flavor on how February as gone for so?","Karen Hoguet","We don\u2019t comment on the month, I mean, obviously the weather has not been helpful, but hopefully it will be fine by the time we get through the quarter.","Operator","And we'll go next Matt Mckinley with Evercore ISI.","Matt Mckinley","Good morning. You've a lot of moving pieces with the restructuring versus the investment in 2015 I know that the restructuring that you did this year was effectively reinvested but you expect those benefits to accrue pretty evenly or does that save and spend program you have way more to the back half with the investment that was kind of make the front of it little bit better and the back half a little bit worse?","Karen Hoguet","I shouldn\u2019t answer off the cuff, but I don\u2019t think so. I mean I think we'll be making the investment throughout the year maybe a little bit or somewhat. Again the credit numbers are lumpy so that impact that capital little bit more; so hard to say. And then it always depends on the timing of the asset sales versus last year.","Matt Mckinley","And then on the new initiatives I know that it is part of the test and learn and process for these new initiatives you're going to have some spending with associated with that. But as you've done these tests in the past, and I assume you do these sorts of things in your stores all the time, how long does that typically take to move something from a test phase to more like a primetime? Is that something you've done that takes nine months or is?","Karen Hoguet","Testing theory would tell you we should wait a lot longer than we do. Retailers, as you know, are by definition impatient, so we do tend to react a little quicker than we probably should based on testing theory. So my suspicion is that this time next year you will hear about some things that we\u2019ve tested this year that rolling out. For example SVI Single View of inventory was one of those. We did a little bit in the spring, more in the fall and we were just so excited at that we rolled it out to the company now. So I think you will see moving with some of these things for '16.","Operator","And from Stifel we'll go next to Richard Jaffe.","Richard Jaffe","Given the aggressive CapEx and the entering of Phase III, could you talk about your internal thought process regarding investment and the return on invested capital both in terms of hurdles you would like to achieve and the timing you provide these new projects to achieve these?","Karen Hoguet","No, that hasn't changed and honestly I'm not sure I would characterize a $100 million increase in capital as aggressive but we have very disciplined standards in terms of what we expect. We judge all of these investments on an internal rate of return basis that obviously as to for exceed the cost of capital.","And then secondly, we look at a third and the fifth year returned on invested capital to make sure that all of that returned doesn\u2019t happen way out. You hate to seek in value and when I call that terminal value. And I think we have a very good process in a disciplined process to look at that. And that is not going to change.","Richard Jaffe","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And from Telsey Advisory Group we'll go next to Dana Telsey.","Dana Telsey","Can you a little bit as you think about the new growth opportunities, acquisition, new concept, international, is there preference in terms of capital allocation and how you are thinking of return to the different opportunities? And on the pick order online and store and same day deliver how do you think of same day delivery emerging as we go through 2015? It certainly seems like the speed of getting customer things faster is becoming even more important and popular.","Karen Hoguet","Well I think you are right about the same day deliver particularly in the bigger markets like Manhattan and San Francisco that's where you are going to see that, but I do think people want to receive their orders quicker and, frankly, that's where our store network is been so helpful. If you need something day and you are in a market it doesn\u2019t have same day deliver yet the online pick-up and store helps with that or even next day. And by having inventory closer to the customer that's a huge competitive advantage for us in terms of satisfying what the customers are looking for. So I see that's going to continue to be important and more obviously focused on that.","Your first question in terms of prioritization I would say right now we don\u2019t really have a prioritization we\u2019re looking for the highest returns we can get on the capital that we are going fast and we\u2019re also looking in these new initiatives of how it will impact the base business.","So one of the great things about Bluemercury for example is not is it going to be a great business in and of itself and they will expand and generate a great return on the acquisition. But also we believe it's going to help the core business, both in terms of the shops that will open in some of the Macy's stores as Bluemercury, but also frontally just learning about the beauty business will obviously help us as we go forward. So love the idea of these new growth ideas not only been great in and of themselves but also building off the base business and helping there.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Thank you, Karen. Just a follow-up on the off price opportunity just to clarify, do you envision this new opportunity as more the traditional off price retail channel versus the strategy that Bloomingdale's is pursuing as an outlet strategy? And then what are the core competencies that you think you can leverage from the Macy's organization whether its brand relationships, the Macy's, name private brand development to bring value to this new initiative?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, the Macy's will be more likely you are calling traditional, obviously, in the outlet world we have Bloomingdale's. So there was no reason to create Macy because we are also expanding the Bloomingdale's outlet concept. So we didn\u2019t want the competition between the two directly. And you listed a lot of the reasons why we think we have advantages in the off price business, the marketing prowess, obviously the way we were in stores the relationship with vendors, the private brand and on and on.","David Glick","And do you think that has an impact on you concern that it might have an impact on your base business, obviously the beauty initiatives you can see the synergies, how would this initiative help your base business?","Karen Hoguet","We think it may just because it may help in the whole new customer to Macy's. One of things we found with the Bloomingdale's outlet business, initially we were nervous about putting one of the Bloomingdale's outlet too close to a Bloomingdale store. And what we\u2019ve found is that served as an entry point for the customer and instead of taking business away from the base Bloomingdale's store we actually brought new customers who learned in the comfortable with Bloomingdale's outlet experience and then went to the Macy's store. So it's very profitable we could find that Macy's as well.","David Glick","Great. Thanks for the color. And just a housekeeping item what's the dollar sales of the closed doors that you are closing in 2015 or the volume from 2014?","Karen Hoguet","I don't know that off hand and we can comment on that later. But be careful because the difference between comp and total in '14 is a store closures but it's also the reduction of our private brand sales to [indiscernible] which we can really agreed to not do going forward. So it's not all the store closures.","Operator","And from Credit Suisse we'll go to Michael Exstein.","Michael Exstein","Couple of things one is where is the Blue Nile acquisition cost, is that going to be part of CapEx or is a separate item?","Karen Hoguet","It's Bluemercury.","Michael Exstein","Bluemercury side.","Karen Hoguet","Not Blue Nile.","Look Bluemercury and my suspicion is it will be a separate item. And that's not part of the $1.2 billion.","Michael Exstein","And then the other thing it noticed in the press release today is there a bunch of store consolidations where you had multiple units in one mall, you consolidated down to either one or two additional units in the mall. Is that part of an ongoing program? How many store opportunities potentially is there to cut down the numbers of stores you are operating in the same mall?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, I mean that has been something we've been doing on an ongoing basis where it makes sense. So that\u2019s not new we've been doing those but yes that is important [indiscernible] seeing what the right square footage, in some cases for example at Bridgedale we expanded the base store so we exposed one we actually expanded the other store but it's obviously more efficient as a one store opportunity.","Michael Exstein","And then do you have any thoughts in terms of the trends in the industry to these headquarter supply stores that some of your competitors have begun to invest heavily in?","Karen Hoguet","Well we have them and we've been investing for years, I mean that\u2019s not new for us.","Operator","We'll go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","I believe in the January press release you've outlined that in 2014 about $1 billion direct to consumer shipments originate directly from stores, that\u2019s a pretty big number, can you possibly shed some light on how that grew year-over-year and how that portion of business contributes to the company's margins?","Karen Hoguet","I don\u2019t know how to answer the margin question we wouldn\u2019t break it up separately but as I said a little while ago its obviously very important to us to be full filling from stores because we can get gods to the customer a lot faster that way and also we don\u2019t have to build as many mega centers. Now there is obviously a lot of analysis and complicated algorithms to decide the right way of shipping what from what place but store fulfillment is a very important part of our equation going forward and we'll continue to grow aggressively.","Laurent Vasilescu","And any color on what categories are driving that business?","Karen Hoguet","Which store fulfillment?","Laurent Vasilescu","Definitely.","Karen Hoguet","It [indiscernible] means the whole stores whatever we carry.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alexis Gold with HG Vora.","Alexis Gold","Hi, just a quick follow up just want a clarification, actually there is Bloomberg headline out right now that says that you will not be aggressive in stock buybacks and what I heard you say was just repeat the [indiscernible] we don\u2019t give specific buyback number you can expect a [indiscernible] continue\u2026","Karen Hoguet","That\u2019s correct, yes thank you for asking that, as I can see the headlines so yes, thank you for clarifying that.","Alexis Gold","No, great thank you very much.","Karen Hoguet","No, sorry about that.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back to you Ms. Hoguet.","Karen Hoguet","Well thank you all very much and we appreciate your interest in Macy's. Obviously don\u2019t hesitate to call Matt, Sarah or me if you have further questions or need further clarification on any of this. And as I said earlier we look forward to updating you on our progress in the upcoming quarters and obviously years ahead and remember change your calendars 9 'O clock going forward for these conference calls. Thanks very much and have a good day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"13767":["Macy's (NYSE:M) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  9, 2012 10:30 AM ET","Executives","Karen M. Hoguet - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Michelle L.

At this time, I'd like to return the call over to Ms. Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen M. Hoguet","Thank you. Good morning. I'm Karen Hoguet, CFO of Macy's, and on behalf of our company, I'd like to welcome you to our conference call scheduled to discuss our first quarter earnings. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K.","The team at Macy's continued to produce great results in the first quarter. We are very proud of our performance and the consistency in our results. The strategic investments we are making are working, and we continue to find new strategies to grow. We achieved a comp store sales increase of 4.4% in the first quarter, well above our expectation at the start of the year. Our operating income grew 18% above last year and 80 basis points as a percent of sales. And our earnings per share grew 43%.","I will take you through some of the details behind these numbers and give our current view of the second quarter and the rest of the year. And then I'll open the call for your questions.","Sales of $6.1 billion in the quarter continued to be strong in both of our brands, at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's and also in-store, as well as online. We are seeing more and more opportunity to satisfy demand from customers when they're in the store with inventory that comes from other locations and from our direct-to-customer distribution centers.","We are also beginning to be able to satisfy online demand with store inventory when the distribution center runs out of a particular item. It is really very exciting to watch. We now have over 80 stores equipped to fulfill orders from other stores or from online demand and by the holiday season, we'll have over 290 store fulfillment locations.","We think the sales potential from this omnichannel approach is enormous. In addition, over time, it should enable us to also improve the productivity of our inventory, as well as our store square footage. We have barely scratched the surface here, and we are very optimistic about the possibilities.","Our strong sales performance in the quarter was also very broad-based in terms of merchandise categories. Sales continued to be strong in Men's, Center Core, meaning categories like watches, jewelry, handbags, cosmetics, shoes, et cetera, and also in home. The feminine apparel business was stronger in February\/March than in April, but we are feeling better about these categories, particularly the classic parts of the business.","We saw strength during the quarter in what we call the impulse apparel area, which is geared at the older millennial customer, women aged roughly 22 to 30, although the junior business, which is aimed at the younger millennial customer, continued to be weak.","Private brands continue to perform well throughout the store, providing newness, exclusivity and value. Amongst our strongest private brands have been Hotel, Charter Club and Bar III which, as you'll recall, just launched last year. Our new Ideology brand, which is geared to the active customer, was recently launched and is doing very well.","Geographically, sales were also strong across the country, although the southern markets in general continued to outperform, including markets in Florida, Texas and Hawaii. But it is important to note that we also saw strength in markets not in the south like Cleveland, Ohio, Columbus and Long Island. This demonstrates to us the power of My Macy's. We are working hard to figure out how best to tailor our offering locally, and the results are paying off market-by-market.","Average unit retail in the quarter was up 8%, with units down about 4%. Gross margin in the quarter was 38.8% or 30 basis points below last year. Merchandise margin was flattish with last year. We have year-rounded on the impact of free shipping, but the growth of the omnichannel business continued to put some pressure on gross margin in the quarter. But keep in mind, that's great news. The more business we can do, omnichannel and on macy's and bloomingdales.com, the better for the bottom line. And in fact, you saw that with the increase in the EBIT rate, which we'll talk about in a minute.","Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 6%, driven by an increase in in-transit merchandise. Inventory net of payables, which adjusts for the in-transit, was up 3%, below expected sales to the second quarter.","Expense in the quarter was $1,995,000,000 or 32.4% of sales. This is 1.1% above last year in dollars, but 110 basis points lower than last year as a percent of sales. Relative to last year, credit was the biggest factor favorably impacting expense, with a $43 million benefit this year versus last. As we explained at the start of this year, we expect credit profitability to increase by $15 million to $20 million for the full year and that it would vary greatly by quarter. I'll talk more about this later, but the first quarter was consistent with the higher end of our annual guidance.","We also benefited in the quarter from $12 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense. Offsetting some of the favorable variances relative to last year was higher expense related to our investments in our Internet and omnichannel businesses, higher selling expense due to the higher sales, $16 million in higher pension expense and the year-rounding on last year's $12 million gains on the sale of our share of The Knot.","Operating income in the quarter was $391 million, 18% above last year. And as a percent of sales, operating income was 6.4%, up 80 basis points over a year ago.","Interest expense in the quarter was $112 million, slightly below last year. Book tax expense was $98 million or 35% of pretax income. This was below the annual expected tax rate of roughly 37% due to settlements during the quarter. These settlements were expected to occur sometime during 2012 and therefore, our expectations for the annual effective tax rate has not changed.","Net income in the quarter was $181 million, and the average share count on a diluted basis was 423.7 million shares. During the first quarter, we utilized $214 million in excess cash to buy back 5.4 million shares. We currently have $1.1 billion of authorization remaining. Our earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.43, up 43% over last year.","Moving on to cash flow. Our cash flow from operating activities was $265 million versus $67 million last year. There are 5 major variances between the years that together make up the almost $200 million increase in cash flow from operating activities. They are one, the higher net income; two, last year we made a pension contribution of $225 million in the quarter; three, tax payments and the reduction in deferred taxes together were approximately $246 million unfavorable to last year. This is a result primarily from the big increase in profitability in 2011 and resultant higher extension payments. Four, inventory net of merchandise payables was $118 million favorable this year versus last year; and fifth, the reduction in prepaid expenses was due to the use of the Lord & Taylor proceeds which we had put in escrow at year end to purchase 2 key parcels of our flagship location on Union Square in San Francisco. The leases on these 2 parcels, which face Geary Street and Union Square itself, were close to expiring and we felt that controlling them was critical. As a result, our capital budget will go up by approximately $100 million, but the expected cash flow should not go down since this purchase was funded through the escrow fund, as well as proceeds from the sales of closed stores.","That purchase explains why CapEx in the quarter was so much higher than a year ago. Largely due to this, the cash flow from investing activities was $138 million unfavorable to last year. But cash flow from operating activities net of investing activity was still $60 million over last year.","During the first quarter, we repaid $795 million of debt and utilized $214 million of excess cash to repurchase the 5.4 million shares. And at the end of the quarter, we had $1.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which is $739 million more than we did at the end of the first quarter a year ago.","So all in all, it was another great quarter. We demonstrated again the sustainability of our good results, as well as the earnings and cash flow potential that flows from strong sales performance.","As to our outlook for the rest of the year, we are staying with our earlier guidance of approximately 3.5% comp store sales growth for the remainder of the year, or 3.7% for the full year when you include the first quarter's actual sales results. As a result, our annual earnings guidance also remains at the $3.25 to $3.30. We feel great about the quarter. But remember, it is only the first quarter.","Also as previously mentioned, CapEx is now expected to be approximately $950 million, although next year it will return to this $900 million level that we had previously discussed for 2013 and beyond. For the second quarter in specific, we're assuming sales growth to be consistent with the 3.5% guidance, with May expected to be a little higher and June and July a little lower due to the shift of Mother's Day.","The gross margin rate in the quarter is expected to be flattish, even with the pressure from higher net delivery expense. SG&A is expected to increase more in the second quarter relative to last year than it did in the first quarter. This is primarily because the credit profitability is only expected to be up slightly versus last year, unlike in the first quarter. Remember that we are year-rounding big increases in credit profitability last year in the second quarter, and even more so in the third quarter. In fact, in the third quarter, credit profitability is expected to be lower than last year by approximately $40 million to $45 million. But again, for the year as a whole, we're still expecting a $15 million to $20 million increase in credit profitability.","We feel great about our performance and the outlook for the company. As Terry said in the press release, \"We are as excited about the future as we have been about the significant progress we've made over the past few years.\" We continue to see such potential to increase sales and profitability from our 3 key strategies: One, My Macy's, which continues to offer so many ongoing opportunities to better tailor our assortments to local needs; two, omnichannel. This is really changing the face of retail, providing us with so many interesting ways to better satisfy customer demand; and three, MAGIC Selling, which is allowing us to increasingly differentiate ourselves amongst our direct competitors.","Having sales associates with stronger selling skills and product knowledge combined with managers who are learning to be better coaches is clearly paying off. Our team is working together in unprecedented ways, and we are investing in growing the business strategically.","I've heard so many sports analogies in our meetings lately talking about our progress, whether these analogies come from rowing, soccer, baseball, football, or even basketball. But regardless of the sport, the key is that we are winning, and we are all committed to continuing to build on our strong performance.","And with that, I'll open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Go first to Michelle Clark of Morgan Stanley.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you update us on the competitive environment? And specifically, I know it's difficult to quantify, but how much comp lift do you think you saw at $0.01 in this quarter? And was there any change in trend as of late?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I think the key thing is in markets where we're competing against Penney's, we have seen an uptick in business. To your point, it's hard to quantify how much. But clearly, we are getting a benefit from what's happening there.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the renovation at Herald Square, that is underway. Can you tell us what you saw there in terms of disruption? And how big is Herald Square as a percent of total company revenue? Could it have an impact on the comp?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it will have an impact on the comp, but I would say it's relatively small, and it has been considered as we've given guidance and plans for the year. We do think there will be disruption over the next 4 years. We're obviously doing everything we can to minimize it. But there will be big chunks of square footage taken out at various points. So it has some effect on the total, but not enormous.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then could you provide us with an update on what you're seeing in terms of product costs? Maybe differentiate between the first half and second half of this year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, I think as we get to the second half of the year, we are expecting to see some relief in terms of product costs. And much like last year, we were strategizing what to do when costs were going up. We're doing the same thing in reverse. But like last year, it's really not until later in the third quarter where that would even begin to impact us.","Michelle L. Clark - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, Karen, can you just discuss with us your appetite for buybacks? You mentioned $1.1 billion remaining in the authorization. Could you complete that this year?","Karen M. Hoguet","We had not quantified exactly how much stock we will be buying back. But the idea is to use our excess cash to buy back stock. So frankly, you'll have some model and see from there, but there's -- you get some sense in the first quarter as to our buyback intent.","Operator","Our next question will come from Liz Dunn, Macquarie Capital.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","I guess first question, just the inventory increase that we saw. Can you just discuss that and how it sort of ties into your omnichannel efforts and when we could potentially see greater efficiency in inventory?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I mean, if you think about it, the inventory net of payables is up 3%. So it's below what we're expecting for sales in the second quarter. So we are funding the businesses that are doing very well so that we will be ready for May sales and beyond. I think to your bigger strategic question, I think it's going to take us longer to figure out where's the optimal place category-by-category to keep inventory. So I think that is probably at least 2013 and perhaps longer before we'll see the impact from major strategic changes in inventory as a result of omnichannel.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Do you think that the strategies that you've employed already are adding greater inventory availability online? Are we already seeing that piece of the benefit? Because you seem to specifically talk about greater efficiency in sales per square foot.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, what we're -- I'm trying to think about the end of your question, sorry. But as we've been adding more and more categories online that are available to be fulfilled from the store when they run out, we are seeing that there's a big opportunity and increased demand. In other words at macys.com, we may not have been buying enough inventory to satisfy the demand that was out there. So I think that's going to help significantly. I'm not sure I understand the question, though, on the store.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Well, you talked in your prepared comments about greater efficiency of inventory and greater efficiency in sales per square foot. So it sounded to me like you were talking more about an ability to be more in stock in-store, but I was wondering if the piece of it that was online had already benefited because you're already doing some door-to-store.","Karen M. Hoguet","No, that's just beginning. And there's one more piece to this strategy, the omnichannel strategy, that we'll begin to test this fall which is today, there are a big chunks of inventory that are in the store that are unavailable online. We've never sold them at macys.com because there wasn't a good use of warehouse space. But what we're going to start experimenting with is putting merchandise up on macys.com that you can buy that will be 100% fulfilled from the store, which I think is going to be hugely successful. When I talk about the store spacing more productive, that's, in many cases, taking advantage of an opportunity to perhaps take some inventory off the floor, use the direct warehouses and broaden the assortment that you're offering the customer on the store as opposed to using that space for inventory. There's lots of things we're thinking about category-by-category of how can we use the square footage better, where should we have inventory, how much inventory. It's really very, very exciting.","Lizabeth Dunn - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then one final one, just want to understand the guidance. So is it fair to assume that the third quarter earnings would be down year-over-year?","Karen M. Hoguet","We're not giving guidance by quarter. But clearly, having a $40 million to $45 million number to come up against is going to put a lot of pressure there.","Operator","And next we have Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Karen, excluding credit, can you walk through SG&A as we think about the second half of the year in 2013? And more specifically, how should we think about the difference between the spending associated with the rollout of omnichannel infrastructure versus the maintenance of the initiative in 2013 and beyond?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I can't help you with your first question. And your second question I'm not sure I even understand.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I guess the question is the spending that's rolling through SG&A and has been over the last couple of years, related to the omnichannel rollout. How should we think about that spending as we are -- as we have the initiative in...","Karen M. Hoguet","I mean, for the foreseeable future, we will be investing and growing the omnichannel business. Now I think it's important to keep in mind, though, that we're also committing to reaching the 14% to 15% EBITDA rate. And so even last year and again this year, where we are investing and growing, we're doing so without hurting the bottom line profitability in total. So I think the key thing to keep in mind, we do expect to continue to invest in growth. But we're also expecting to improve the EBIT rate, the EBITDA rates of the company.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then second question, with the underlying core merchandise margin rate flattish today, how should we think about the aggregate gross margin as we begin this cycle the rollout of omnichannel in the back half of next year and as the initiative progresses into later innings and more so around the inventory management opportunity?","Karen M. Hoguet","You mean the back half of 2013?","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","Karen M. Hoguet","Matt, it's too early to be forecasting margin 1.5 years out. I think the key thing to keep in mind is we think there is huge opportunity, as I said to improve the inventory, productivity, which should help gross margin. So for example, one of the things that were putting in place this summer is a logic that when we are pulling inventory from either a warehouse or a location, we'll pull it from the place that's least likely to sell that item at regular price, which should help margin. But it's premature to be forecasting exactly what that will do, although I'm pretty sure it's going to be positive.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And last question. Any upcoming fall merchandise initiative to be watching for in the stores? And do your buyers believe we might be in the first inning of a real turn in Women's traditional?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we're hoping so on the Women's apparel side. It may be too early to claim victory there yet, but we do feel very good about what we're seeing in terms of regular price selling of the new goods.","Operator","We'll move on to our next question, which comes from Michael Binetti of UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I guess on the comp guidance, as we think about the 3.5 guidance for second quarter, could you help us maybe just dimensionalize what you expect for AURs in the quarter versus units? It is significantly different than first quarter? And then the same question for the annual number I guess, just a little bit of help on how you're thinking about that with the guidance you gave us.","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. I don't really have a forecast for that. There's different ways of getting to that sales number. But I do expect AURs to be up this year. But beyond that, I can't give you a specific number.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just moving down I guess to the gross margin line a little bit, more color on the merchandise margins. As we think about all the puts and takes on that line, is the -- the comps, just the business changes, can you help us think about how you see the merchandise margin, specifically, flowing through the year as you roll off the higher input prices for apparel, but probably the AUR boost diminishes as we move quarter-to-quarter here through the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think all I can say is stick with the guidance of we expect the gross margin to be flattish for the year.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess on just a different topic, one thought is -- you mentioned that you saw some competitive responses in the markets your overlap with JCPenney. Are there time -- it seems like you should be doing better during discreet time periods like when you have promotional events like a holiday sale. And obviously, the April calendar really didn't have any with the Easter shifting into March and Mother's Day into May. I mean, do you feel like that's a better environment where you do have more promotions in the months around a discreet holiday like that with that brand -- with JCPenney's not really promoting via price point stimulus during holidays like you would be?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think the best thing to say is that we are seeing a pickup pretty much across the board, but I'm not going to get into specifics day by day.","Operator","And next we have Paul Swinand with MorningStar Inc.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I want to ask just about the credit portfolio. I know you're saying you're lapping several big increases. Are you noticing any difference in statistics from the online customer and their uptick of credit or use of credit or the way they use your card? And is that affecting the portfolio outlook at all?","Karen M. Hoguet","Not really. The penetration on macys.com has done well, as has bloomingdales.com. Overall, we're seeing pressure on our penetrations or usage of our card, we think in part due to the challenges of getting new accounts approved with the increased regulations coming out of Washington. But I don't see huge differences in trend there.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that's still a pressure. But is there a chance that lets up as you lap that in the late half of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","No, I don't think so.","Paul Swinand - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just trying to follow-up on Michael's question about the units and AUR. It seems like if your inventory is well controlled, your units have to be down a little bit. But as you plan the back half of the year, are you actually going to be a little light on units? And are you going to plan that up? Or do you think the units will be tight in the back half of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, the truth is this -- you have to look at it category-by-category and business-by-business. So I can't give you an overall comment. But I promise you, our merchants will make sure we have plenty of units to satisfy the demand.","Operator","And next we have Deborah Weinswig of Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you walk through some of the initiatives related the millennial customer? And what do you think you -- in terms of the differences between the older and younger millennial, what do you think are driving some of the differences you're seeing there in terms of performance?","Karen M. Hoguet","On the millennial customer, our belief is it starts with product. And so we're -- as you know, we're spending a lot of time rethinking how we get that product selected to the stores, how fast we can accelerate our whole process to pick out the inventory and find the fashion. As you know, we also launched for our 3 last year as a way of using the private brand market to help as well. And as I said earlier, that's doing very well. Again, that's geared towards the older impulse customer. But the first priority is product. We're also reviewing all of our marketing to make sure we're reaching this customer through the appropriate way. Obviously, digital and the whole social space is a big part of that. And we're also reviewing a lot of the store environment, trying to make it more friendly to that customer, given the research we've done on his and her needs. The reason I think the junior's business or the younger millennial business is doing less well is in part the market overall, perhaps competition. But also, I think we just needed to sort of reload that strategy and start over. So I think a year from now, we're going to feel a whole lot better about the junior business, but it may take a while to redo that.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then with regards to MAGIC Selling training, obviously as the Macy's story continues to evolve, especially the omnichannel, how are you going back and kind of, I guess, retraining your sales associates to maybe get the word out to customers? How is that process taking place?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, we're going to continually train and develop and add new components to the MAGIC Selling training and product knowledge work that we're trying to do. As you might imagine, it takes a long time to change behavior and change culture. But we think we are making huge progress there. And our Net Promoter Scores are going up considerably, which we do believe is part of that. So Deb, I guess I could say it's just going to be a continual process, and we're thrilled with the progress we're making. And we do think it makes a difference in the store experience.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then not to dive into one single marketing campaign, but I was pretty intrigued with the -- I think it was the Brazil, Brazil, Brazil campaign? If you could maybe elaborate on some of the results from that?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it's frankly just beginning. But early read is it's extremely exciting. It actually hasn't completely launched yet, so you're early. But if you go into any of our stores across the country you'll see Brazil, whether it be products that actually came from Brazil, which is doing very well in-store, or if it's products from our normal vendors that's inspired by Brazil. So we've got a little bit of everything, and I'm very excited about it.","Operator","And next we have Charles Grom from Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the 2Q comp cadence by month, I'm a little bit surprised you expect May to be above the 3.5% range. Should we kind of read into that, that you guys have bounced back from the 1-1 in April? Or is it just the earlier Mother's Day that you expect to kind of help you guys out?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well not to sound offensive, but we were thrilled with our April performance. So there was nothing that was bad about April. So it was clearly -- the April number was all a result of shift, Easter, the major cosmetics events, as well as the later Mother's Day. We expected it, we planned it, we told you, and there was again nothing bad about April. May has the benefit of the Mother's Day shift, so I'm surprised you wouldn't expect May to be better.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So at the end of day, it has bounced back?","Karen M. Hoguet","I wouldn't call it bounced back, but okay.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just curious, your thoughts on the consumer, obviously a lot of volatility inter-quarter, but you guys have a lot much better data than we have at our disposal. Just wondering here if you could give us some thoughts on kind of what you think about the 4-4 relative to your plan and kind of your overall thoughts of the consumer.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, I mean the 4-4 was clearly above what we had expected, and that makes us feel very good about the consumer and frankly, the market share that we're gaining given the competitive environment which, by the way, we've been doing for the last couple of years. So it's hard to ferret out what's the consumer and what's -- our strategy is working. But we feel good about what we're seeing.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And you talked a lot about -- like site-to-door, but when do you guys anticipate rolling out site-to-store-to-door? And when you think about them combined, what do you think your inventory turns could look like down the road? It still looks like it's a real big opportunity for you guys.","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, it is a big opportunity. But unfortunately, I can't give you a number yet because it's one of those strategies you really have to think about category-by-category-by-category, and we've not done that yet. We're just at the beginning stages here of even understanding the demand potential from that.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. And then on site-to-store-to-door, that's not a 2012 event?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, the site-to-store-to-door has 2 pieces, one is when the site is out of stock on something, using store inventory to satisfy that demand. What happens today, in most categories, is if we run out of the inventory at one of the D2C distribution centers, you can't buy it on Macy's or bloomingdales.com. We're beginning to roll out the functionality category-by-category, and we're frankly accelerating that rollout because so far it's been so successful of using store inventory to satisfy demand online. The piece that we haven't done yet and we're going to start to test hopefully this fall is for goods that macys.com never even bought but that are in the store. That's a little trickier, but I think there's huge demand that can come from that. So we would never have those goods in the D2C warehouses. It would only be fulfilled from store, but you still have the opportunity to buy it from your mobile device, from your PC at home or your iPad or what have you. So I think that's very exciting but again, premature to be quantifying the real upside.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And are your inventory systems, do they speak to one another? Are they on one platform at this point? Or are they still separate systems?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well, no. And in fact, one of the things that we've been talking about that's included in our capital spending is the capital to improve the omnichannel communication across macys.com and the stores, similarly bloomingdales.com and Bloomingdale's. So I would say today, the systems are not with a need to be to fully take advantage of this. We've got lots of work arounds, but it will be much more efficient once these systems get build over the next couple of years. But again, it's not stopping the strategic discussion.","Operator","And next we have Bob Drbul of Barclays Capital.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess the first question I have is on the overall macro environment, was -- is there a factor -- or what was the biggest factor for you guys for you to decide not to raise guidance? I mean was there one thing that you would call out or a concern that you would call out that you are most mindful of as you look at the remaining parts of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. The only thing I would call out is the first quarter, and I think our guidance for the year was more aggressive than usual. But I don't know that there's any factor per se, Bob, that impacted that.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. My second question is from Q4 to Q1, can you talk a little bit about -- has there been a change on the trend at Bloomingdale's at all? Has it remained very strong? Or has there been a slowdown at all that you would call out or anything from that perspective?","Karen M. Hoguet","I would say Bloomingdale's has continued to be very strong. So I'm not sure there's really any major callout there.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And my last question is, can you talk a little bit about the home business, the way you're planning home and maybe big-ticket trends and some of those items within the business?","Karen M. Hoguet","Big-ticket has been unbelievably strong, and we think it's going to continue.","Operator","And next we have Paul Lejuez of Nomura.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Paul Lejuez, Nomura. Two questions. One, just wondering how the Brazil promotion, or focus, I should say, ties into the My Macy's localization strategy. Will all stores stress Brazil the same way? Or will you alter that by market and by stores within market? And then just second, just wondering how you've thought differently about your marketing plan, given the state of the competitive environment with JCPenney changing its pricing architecture and how you've changed your marketing dollars and focus.","Karen M. Hoguet","I think the key thing is on the marketing strategy. We're winning. And as our marketing people look at our strategies and spending for 2012, we're sticking to our program, and we think that's the best way of continuing to win. In terms of the Brazil in My Macy's, while we are putting Brazil across the country, we are doing some tailoring by market, by location, mostly in terms of size of the Brazil campaign. Obviously, some markets will be bigger and more outsized than you would expect. But again, we think this is something that will have appeal across the country.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So Karen, you never changed your marketing spend or focus once you heard officially what JCPenney was doing?","Karen M. Hoguet","That's correct.","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","How come?","Karen M. Hoguet","I'm sorry?","Paul Lejuez - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Why not? I'm just wondering why there hasn't been kind of a shift on the fly, maybe you smelled the blood in the water, maybe go after them a little bit harder than you would have otherwise.","Karen M. Hoguet","I think we were going to go hard after them before.","Operator","And next we have Adrianne Shapira of Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Karen, you've cycled -- you've delivered 2 great years of spectacular beats and raises on sales and margins. And now, as you're continuing to make progress on the 3-pronged strategy and obviously some share up for grabs on the competitive landscape, where you sit now in terms of productivity and EBIT margins, where do you think -- where do you see the biggest levers of opportunity this year relative to your guidance?","Karen M. Hoguet","I'm hesitating. I'm not 100% sure I see what you're asking. But I think the key thing is we think we're going to continue to perform on the sales line and drop a lot of that profit and cash to the bottom line.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess my question is basically where is the line item, where do you think there's probably room for greater upside than others?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think with us, it always starts with sales.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is you've previously spoken about an EBITDA margin target of 14%, 15%, well on track to get there, probably sooner than expected. As you think about, again, the changing competitive landscape and the spectacular online growth, does that prompt you to think differently about long-term EBITDA margin targets?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. I think as I've said to people, that we have a game plan to get it to the 14% and that it will require new thinking to get to 15%. So I think that's where a lot of this omnichannel strategizing should help us. And we'll see. But at this point, our game plan is let's get to 14%, and then we'll figure out 15%.","Operator","And next we'll go to Bernard Sosnick of Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","You've outlined very impressively how Macy is changing and benefiting from omnichannel retailing, but there are also external events going on at the same time. And I'm wondering if you could give us some thoughts on Amazon's idea of getting into the higher end of apparel retailing?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes. The only thing I would say, and we're obviously -- we watch Amazon very closely. They're as much a competitor as Penney's or Kohl's or anybody else in terms of people we keep an eye on. I would say that in most of the businesses that we carry, the in-store experience is still very, very important to our consumer. And I think it will be very challenging for a pure-play Internet company if we do what we need to do in-store by the way, to keep up with technology and make the stores better and better places to shop, to compete. That doesn't mean that they won't do business, but I think that in fashion businesses, having stores is still going to be a competitive advantage.","Bernard Sosnick - Gilford Securities Inc., Research Division","I would agree with that. You're also the largest customer for each of your most important vendors. But if these vendors were to sell online to Amazon and initial prices looked different than at normal retail, that could complicate matters. What are your thoughts on that?","Karen M. Hoguet","Yes, we really -- I think it's premature to start discussing that. Obviously, we're watching the competitive environment but at this point, we feel very good about our positioning.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jeff Stein of Northcoast Research.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Karen, 2 questions quickly. One, given the strength that you saw early in the spring season in sell-through, I'm a little bit surprised that your gross margins, merchandise margins, weren't a little bit better. Can we assume that perhaps maybe you've stepped up the level of promotional activity to try to take a harder swing against JCPenney in the first quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet","Bad assumption. If you think about a strong first quarter selling, frankly, it helps your margin in the second quarter when you would've been clearing the goods that you sold in the first quarter. Also, you all need to keep in mind that while all the focus in February and March was on the positive from the warm weather, we actually did much less additional warm weather business in the first quarter than we lost in cold weather business from last year. So clearing the cold weather goods when the weather was so hot was what was costly.","Jeffrey S. Stein - Northcoast Research","Got it. Got it. Okay. Let me turn it around and ask just one more question, which is let's assume you're picking up some business from JCPenney. Do you have any strategies that you're thinking ahead about regarding how to hold on that customer? Because clearly, they're losing right now but their plan, I'm sure, is to try to get that customer back in some way, shape or form by their merchandising changes. Are you making any changes in the segment of your merchandising mix that would tend to overlap with them to try to hold on to that customer that you're gaining now?","Karen M. Hoguet","I think that the easiest answer is as you might expect, we've got strategies to make sure we keep winning. And that's really all I'm comfortable saying.","Operator","And next we'll move to David Glick of Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Karen, just a question about the Center Core business. Obviously, that's been a big driver for your comps, your average unit retailers, your productivity, and investors seem to constantly worry that, that momentum could slow down. You called it out certainly as a strong performer in Q1. Are you continuing to see that momentum? And if the apparel business improves, is there a trade-off there? And is that -- will that potentially slow your momentum?","Karen M. Hoguet","Well it hasn't happened yet, so that's really all I could say, David. We feel great about the newness in the category, and it continues to do well. And we are investing to continue to grow. So we're hopeful that, that momentum will continue.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just one quick follow-up on home. Is there any update you can give us on how you're thinking about your vendor structure given the uncertainty over the Martha Stewart brand?","Karen M. Hoguet","No. Nothing I can say there.","Operator","And now we'll move to Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays Capital.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's actually Priya Ohri-Gupta, Barclays. Just one quick one. You've had some recent ratings improvement this quarter, and I wanted to see if you had the opportunity to sort of start testing out the commercial paper market. And if so, could this potentially be a source to help support some of your share repurchase activity going forward?","Karen M. Hoguet","We're beginning to test to see if it potentially could be a source. Having said that, because of our cash position, it's not something we would be doing this year. So we are beginning to test to see if in fact that would be available to us now.","Operator","And it does appear at this time we have no further questions. So Ms. Hoguet, I'll turn the conference back over to you.","Karen M. Hoguet","Great. Well, thank you. And again, if anybody has additional questions, Matt, Terry and I are all available to take calls this afternoon. And thanks for your interest.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's conference call. I would like to thank you for your participation."],"13944":["Macy's, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead.","Karen Hoguet","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Jeff Gennette, our Chairman and CEO and I would like to welcome you to the Macy's call to discuss our first quarter earnings and our outlook for the remainder of the year. ","Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. ","Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for a discussion and reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning. Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings. ","I'm now going to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Gennette","Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the call. As you saw in this morning's release, we continued our momentum from the holiday season into the first quarter. In fact, exceeding our own expectations on most measures. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.48. Comparable store sales were up 4.2% on an owned plus licensed basis. And when adjusted for the estimated impact of the shift of Friends and Family from the second quarter to the first quarter, comparable store sales were up 1.7% for owned plus licensed. ","I'm pleased to report strong performance across all three brands, Macy's, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury. Across all families business and all regions of the country. And it's very encouraging to see the continued improvement in our brick-and-mortar business. We still have a lot of work ahead of us. But store by store, quarter by quarter, we are on the path to return Macy's Inc. to consistent comparable store sales growth. ","Based on the strong start to the year and the healthy macroenvironment, we are raising both earnings and sales guidance for the year. We now anticipate annual comparable store sales in the 1% to 2% range for owned plus licensed which is a 1 point lift from our prior guidance. And we anticipate that annual earnings per share will be in the $3.75 to $0.395 range which is up $0.20 from our prior guidance. Karen will take you through the details of the quarter and give you some additional context on guidance. ","But before she does, I want to give you some perspective on the first quarter and an update on our strategic initiatives. So looking at the quarter, we did have the wind in our back as consumer spending remains strong and we saw significant improvement in international tourism spending. We anticipate this to continue through the year. But in addition to healthy spending trends, the team is also executing really well. We have a very healthy inventory position which helps our margins and our fashion freshness. Our focused merchandising strategies had resulted in great assortments and great strong fashion in our stores. The new loyalty program is having the intended impact on the spending patterns of our best customers. And we are taking the necessary steps to improve the customer journey, both in our stores and when she's shopping online. And it's starting to pay off. Average unit retail or AUR was up 5% in the first quarter compared to last year. ","It is encouraging to see the continued improvement in brick-and-mortar. We also continued to see sales pick up in nearby stores and markets where we've closed stores last year. And our digital business continues with double-digit growth. We also saw strong performance across all regions of the country in all families of business. In Centocor, fine jewelry was a standout performer, including our proprietary Star Signature Diamond Collection. We also saw improvement in accessories, handbags and sleepwear, largely driven by our Private Brands. ","In beauty, we saw meaningful lift in AUR for the quarter, driven by fragrances for both men and women as well as skincare. We also saw standout performance in men's tailored clothing, in kids, dresses, active and home. So all in, the first quarter was a good one for us. And I'm pleased to see our fourth quarter momentum continuing into the New Year. ","So when we look ahead at the rest of 2018, our growth plan is built on ongoing improvements in execution, continued strength in merchandising and key strategic initiatives. I want to take a few minutes to take you through the 5 strategic initiatives. ","So first is our Star Rewards loyalty program. You'll remember in October that we launched the first stage of the Star Rewards program and our customers are responding enthusiastically. At the platinum level, our most valuable customer is spending more with us. And while it is still early, we are starting to see improvement at the gold and silver levels as well. Last week, we rolled out the second phase of our loyalty program, which includes a tender neutral option, allowing customers to participate in the loyalty program without having a Macy's credit card. This is what we call our bronze tier. There are no spending qualifications and this program is open to all customers no matter how they pay. We are also adding more unique experience-based benefits for our platinum customers. For instance we are offering, or we did offer private early store hours for iconic Flower Show in our New York and Chicago and San Francisco locations. These new benefits will increase brand engagement and customer retention. ","The second initiative is our Backstage expansion. Last quarter, we said we would open approximately 100 additional Backstage locations within Macy's stores in fiscal 2018. In the first quarter, we opened up 18 Backstage locations. We expect to open approximately 40 more locations during the second quarter. We are expanding Backstage to some of our premium malls and to the West Coast for the first time. We also announced that we are opening a new distribution center in Columbus, Ohio, dedicated to Backstage. This will allow us to move merchandise to our Backstage locations faster and with more flexibility. ","The third initiative is the expansion of products available for sale on our website shipped directly from our vendors or what we call vendor direct. We are significantly increasing our online assortment in select departments. In stores, our customers will continue to find curated, localized assortments. And on macys.com, they will have access to an endless aisle curated through personalization. In the first quarter, we started the vendor direct expansion and expect to have it fully underway by the fall season. ","The fourth initiative we are focused on this year is store pickup. We are offering more options for pickup and delivery, including the expansion of Buy Online Pickup in Store and the implementation of Buy Online Ship to Store or what we call BOSS. In the first quarter, we are focused on the rollout of extra service counters which makes picking up orders in our stores albeit Bob's or Bob's quick and easy. By August, these will be in almost every single store. ","Our fifth initiatives is what we call the Growth 50. These are 50 stores where we are implementing the best of what we tested in 2017. This work will complete in time for the fall season and we intend to come out of the year with a model that we can scale. We are making a point of visiting each of the Growth 50 stores and I'm very excited about what I'm seeing. From merchandising strengths and strategies, more staffing in key areas, facility upgrades as well as local marketing plans. And what's really striking is the renewed energy of our colleagues that they are putting into serving our customers. ","So those are our 2018 strategic initiatives. We do anticipate that much of the impact of these initiatives will fall into the second half of the year. But we are already beginning to see some benefits, including from the earlier Backstage openings. ","While the strategic initiatives are key components of our 2018 growth plan, we are also looking more broadly in what we need to do to improve the customer experience. A few weeks ago, we announced that we had acquired STORY, a concept store in New York City. For those of you that are not familiar with STORY, the space reinvents itself every 6 to 8 weeks, highlighting new themes that bring new customers in and keep existing customers coming back to see what's next. We are not in the commodity business. We are in the experience business and Rachel Shakman, who is STORY's Founder and CEO, is now Macy's first Brand Experience Officer. Rachel has a clear vision of how merchandising and marketing strategies come to life in the store and we are very excited to have her and the STORY team join us at Macy's. ","In the first quarter, we also introduced new technology, both on our mobile app and in our stores that will help us eliminate friction from store visits and improve the shopping experience. One of these initiatives is mobile check out. We know that the checkout process can be a pain point for our customer. With mobile check out, we are speeding things up. Customers can scan a product with the Macy's app, pay with a store credit card and then go to a dedicated counter to remove security tags. We call it Scan, Pay, Go. We've been testing and fine-tuning mobile checkout and we plan to roll it out to every Macy's store by the end of the year. ","We are also using virtual and augmented reality to help grow our furniture business. We like this business because it's high-margin but it's also very high touch business. And like many of our competitors who have been looking at VR and AR, in furniture, we have found a practical application. We've piloted VR in three of our furniture stores and found it significantly increased transaction size and also reduced returns. Using VR allows us to offer a full range of furniture in roughly half the space. So we are now scaling this to 60 more doors this year. ","We've also launched an augmented feature, reality feature on our mobile app that allows customers to see furniture in their actual living spaces. We've rolled it out to a portion of our app users as we test and learn. And to date, it's been very well received. ","So as you can see, it's -- a lot is happening with the Macy's brand. But let me take a minute to touch on Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury, both had a great first quarter. So Bloomingdale\u2019s opened its newly remodeled shoe floor at the flagship 59th Street location in New York City. All women's shoes have now been relocated to a single floor that's more than 25,000 square feet. This is a 40% increase over prior shoe floors. There are more than 100 brands, 17 that are new to Bloomingdale\u2019s and 34 that are exclusive. It's aligned with what Bloomingdale\u2019s customers want and love and initial feedback has been very positive. ","Bluemercury also had a great quarter. It's a small part of our business but it's growing at a rapid pace. They launched a number of new products under their private labels, Lune and Aster and M-61, which have performed well. We continue to see potential for Bluemercury stores, both freestanding and within Macy's stores. We anticipate opening approximately 25 additional freestanding Bluemercurys this year. ","Before I hand it back over to Karen, I do want to note that a significant factor in our improved performance is that we have the organization aligned, focused and growing in the same direction. On our last call, I described the path to growth incentives that we've implemented this year. This puts every Macy's colleague full-time, part-time, hourly and seasonally, on an incentive program tied to our growth plan. And I'm pleased to say that about 3\/4 of our eligible colleagues made bonus in the first quarter. I'm both proud and encouraged by the energy and engagement that I see that are out on the stores, in our call centers and in our warehouse. ","So overall, we feel good about the quarter and the path we are on for 2018. This is the most competitive retail environment I've ever seen. And we know that we need to get up every morning committed to winning our customers business. We are making the right investment in the business, focusing on areas where we seek the best returns and are confident this will support our commitment to growth in 2018. ","And now I'm going to hand it back over to Karen who will take you through the numbers.","Karen Hoguet","Thanks, Jeff. So Jeff said, sales, earnings and cash flow all surpassed our expectations in the first quarter. Sales in the first quarter were $5,541,000,000, up 3.6% versus last year or up 4.2% on a comp owned plus licensed basis. As Jeff mentioned, we benefited from the timing of the shift of our Friends and Family event. We estimate that this shift is worth 250 basis points. So excluding the shift, comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis are estimated to have been up 1.7%. ","We are getting lots of questions this morning about whether this adjustment includes the calendar shift as well. It does not. This is consistent with what we experienced in 2013. It's frankly hard to measure that because when we follow a 53-week year, we shift promotional events around. We do not think the impact is meaningful although there is a slight benefit in the first half and a slight negative in the second half of the year. ","As Jeff said, we saw improvement in both our digital and stores business with particularly strong performance to Bloomingdale\u2019s. In addition to our improved execution and our North Star Strategy, we believe we benefited from both stronger customer spending and an increase in international tourist business. International tourist sales were up close to 10% in the quarter, which is only the second time since 2014 when we experienced an increase. ","Total transactions were up 1% in the quarter, with average unit retail up 5% and units per transaction down 2%. This increase in average unit retail reflects the higher regular price selling and distorted growth in our strategic businesses like fine jewelry, dresses, handbags and furniture. Additionally, as a result of having significantly less and also much fresher inventory this year, there was less selling in the quarter of deeply discounted clearance merchandise. ","Credit card revenue net was $157 million in the quarter versus $161 million last year. This too was better-than-expected, primarily due to higher balances. This is resulting largely from higher credit sales and new accounts also. In part, due to our new loyalty program which, as Jeff said, was launched last fall. ","Penetration on our private label cards was approximately 45.5% in the quarter, which is just slightly above last year. This compares though to the 90 basis points decline in penetration that we experienced both in the fourth quarter and the full year of 2017. ","Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the quarter was 39%, up 70 basis points over last year. We benefited from the much improved inventory position during the quarter and we ended the quarter with 5% less inventory on a comp basis. ","SG&A dollars in the quarter were $2,083,000,000 or 37.6% of sales. This compares to $2,057,000,000 or 38.5% last year. This increase in dollars is driven primarily by the investments we are making to support the North Star Strategy, such as digital, the Growth 50 store, Backstage and the new path to growth incentive plan. The savings from the change in the tax law is helping to offset these sales driving investments. ","Asset sale gains were $24 million in the quarter, $44 million lower than last year. Remember that this year's asset sale gains are expected to be back-end loaded into the fourth quarter when we are assuming that we will sell the I Magnin building on Union Square and San Francisco as we discussed last quarter. ","We booked $19 million in impairment and other costs in the quarter, primarily associated with the decision to end our China joint venture. We will continue to have an ongoing presence on Alibaba's TMall platform as well as social media channels in China. But it will now be managed by our digital operation in San Francisco. We expect to book an estimated additional $10 million over the next few quarters related to this change in approach. ","Benefits plan income net was $11 million versus $13 million last year. Consolidated EBIT in the quarter was $249 million or $268 million before the impairment and other costs. This compares to $232 million last year. And excluding asset sale gains, EBIT on this basis was $80 million or 49% over last year. ","Interest expense was $66 million, down from last year's $84 million due to our debt reduction. Tax expense in the quarter was $52 million or 28.4% of pretax income. This represents a $16 million reduction from last year and approximately 19 basis points lower as a rate. ","Net income attributable to the Macy's Inc. shareholders in the quarter was $139 million versus $78 million last year. And excluding asset sale gains in both years, the impairment and other costs this year and the premium on early retirement of debt last year, net income was $93 million higher than last year. ","EPS on a diluted basis excluding the impairment and other costs in the quarter this year and a premium on early retirement of debt last year was $0.48 versus $0.26 last year. And when we exclude asset sale gains as well, EPS was $0.42 this year versus $0.12 last year. ","Cash flow was strong as well in the quarter with an $85 million increase in cash provided by operating activities. We spent $13 million more in CapEx and received $73 million less in proceeds for property and equipment sales this year. ","It really was a great quarter on every metric. We exceeded our expectations. And as a result, are increasing what we expect for the full year. For sales, we are now assuming a comp owned plus licensed increase of 1% to 2% for fiscal 2018 as compared to the assumed 0% to 1% previously. Comp sales on an owned basis are assumed to increase by approximately 20 to 30 basis points less than the comp on an owned plus licensed basis. And total sales are now expected to be down 1% to up 0.5% versus down 2% to down 0.5% previously. Remember the total sales are impacted by the fact that fiscal 2018 has 1 week less than 2017. The comp sizes however is stated on a comparable 52-week basis. We still expect comp sales on an owned as well as owned plus licensed basis in the second quarter to be negative due to the Friends and Family shift. However, comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis are now expected to increase 1% to 2% for the first half of the year, the first and second quarters combined. And total sales for the first plus second quarter, or the first half of the year, are now expected to be flat to up 1%. As we have discussed, we are benefiting from stronger-than-expected external factors as well as the earlier execution of some of our strategic initiatives. ","We still expect the comp sales in the back half of the year or what we call the fall season, to exceed that of the spring season due to the ongoing rollout of our strategic initiatives. Remember though that last year, we had a much stronger fall season and spring so that will impact the degree of improvement as we year around on the stronger performance particularly in the fourth quarter. ","We are also increasing earnings guidance by $0.20 a share to $3.75 to $3.95, excluding anticipated pension settlement, impairment and other costs. This increase is the result primarily of the strong first quarter performance, the better second quarter expectation, as well as an increase in our assumptions for annual credit card revenues to $675 million to $690 million. ","All of our other assumptions are unchanged. Like I said earlier, it was just a terrific first quarter all around. It's encouraging to see the business getting stronger and I feel good about both our own plans as well as the external environment in which we are working. Spirits are up and this is an organization that is committed to winning and getting better every day. ","So with that, Jeff and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Lorraine Hutchinson of Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Karen, I just wanted to confirm. So you talked about the second half comp guidance now being better than the 1% to 2% in the first half, is that correct?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, what we have said in February and we would say again now is that we do expect the fall season to exceed the spring. But I want to remind people that the second half is a much harder comparison. So you really have to look to some degree onto your numbers. So we do expect the fall to be better. But maybe not by the magnitude that you might have thought for 2 reasons. One is the fact that the fall, and particularly the fourth quarter is a harder comparison. But secondly, the spring has gotten better as well with the earlier execution of some of our initiatives. So we still expect Q2 to be higher than -- I'm sorry, the back half of the year to be better than the first half of the year. We are just cautioning on the degree of the difference between those two. And again, all of that is reflected in our guidance. So the big increase has been in the spring season as opposed to the fall.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. And then when you look back on the first quarter, were there any challenges posed by the very cold weather? Or is there anything that you can talk about in terms of cadence or how the quarter unfolded versus your expectations?","Jeffrey Gennette","So Lorraine, it's Jeff. I didn't see and we didn't see really any material difference in our business based on weather. You had some markets that were affected and you had some markets that were positive. So in aggregate, it did not have a significant impact on business at all.","Karen Hoguet","And the quarter was good every month. In fact, every week. So the consistency of the good performance was really important as we were looking at the first quarter.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Robert Drbul of Guggenheim security.","Robert Drbul","I guess the question that I have is on the Friends and Family. The year-over-year, was the 30% off the same as it was last year? And can you just talk a little bit...","Jeffrey Gennette","Yes.","Robert Drbul","So it was. And from the perspective of like the trend throughout the quarter, you said weather didn't have an impact. But around in the comparisons, as you look into the second quarter, can you just talk a little bit about how much you feel like you pulled forward? I think you said it was going to be a negative comp?","Karen Hoguet","No. The only thing that we pulled forward was the Friends and Family event. So in the first quarter, it's worth 250 basis points. In the second quarter, it's worth about 240 basis points because it's a bigger quarter but roughly the same. So the negative -- whatever the second quarter turns out to be, add 240 basis points to that and that would be the comparable to the 1 7.","Robert Drbul","Got it. Okay, okay, great. And just within the Backstage initiative, can you just provide an update on category learnings as you continue to roll this out versus what's in the traditional store?","Jeffrey Gennette","So Bob, it's as we discussed in prior calls, the strength of Backstage continues to improve. The standout categories were men's, shoes and homestore. But we are getting traction really across all categories which will be beauty and the apparel areas in kids and women's and men's. So what we're doing is we are tailoring the assortment depending on what building that we are in. And we are strongly advantaged by having Michelle Israel, who basically leads Backstage, but she also leads Bloomingdale's Outlet. So she's been at this for some time with the successful strategy that we are implementing at Bloomingdale's Outlet. And she has the full scope of vendor menu that really spans all different price points that we can now tailor based on whatever store it's in. So as you heard us say earlier, our objective with Backstage is to start to test that in premium malls in 2018 as well as entering the West Coast for the first time. So we are still in the early innings of Backstage and we've got -- we are layering on another 100 plus stores in 2018, 18 of which we opened in the first quarter.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Karen, if this happens to be your last call, congrats on moving to the next chapter.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Matthew Boss","Jeff, with two straight positive comps, I guess if you broke down the drivers of the top line inflection that you're seeing, I guess how would you rank the impact of the stronger consumer backdrop and some of the macro factors such as tourism versus what you're seeing and doing from a company specific execution standpoint? I know you have a laundry list of initiatives. I guess what's the best way to think about what are you seeing and where are you seeing the earlier-than-expected benefits and what are you the most excited about incrementally for the back half?","Jeffrey Gennette","Okay. So I think the backdrop of a very healthy consumer is the tailwinds that Karen is referring to. Certainly helping us. I think that the international tourism, it's good to have that in the plus column. And what we started to see in the fourth quarter and what we certainly showed up in the first quarter, that's going to -- that trend we believe is going to take us all the way through to 2018 at least. As you get to the execution issue, let me just kind of step back a bit. I think when we made the announcement last August, we really announced two things. We announced this, the new kind of massive simplification of three organizations that went down to 1 merchant organization and we also announced the hire of Hal Lawton and these two things have really helped our execution.","Starting with the kind of the structure. Massively simplified the merchant structure. We have five great merchants that are leading each of the families of business. They are veterans that I go into battle every day with them. And they are led by one amazing Chief Merchant which is Jeff Kantor, who really is just breathing new life into our merchant organization. I think if you asked our partners or our vendors, they would say at Macy's that we are operating now with courage and more speed and more agility that we are making calls and the divisionals are making calls without oversight. There's less meetings and here's more countable people. So I think the new structure is really helping us in execution. Then you ask, how are the mix? If you think, Howell is a very disciplined and he's got a very solid retail chops. I think we are getting on more disciplined operational cadence and you couple that with his deep technology background that is really primarily focused on improving the customer experience. And he's just very comfortable and confident in making decisions on tough calls and we are moving better and faster as a result of his leadership and his work with all of our veteran teams.","So as you think about the back half of your question which is which of these initiatives are, do I believe, give us the most continued traction, you'd have to put on her Backstage. Vendor Direct is a big opportunity for us and we start picking momentum up on that, we started that we've done vendor direct in the past. But the idea about adding new content and new categories onto that which we will do a lot through our relationship and new partnership with CommerceHub, that comes on in the back half of the year. And then the new loyalty program is obviously bringing us to customers that are more engaged with us. And then the last thing I'd say, Matt, would be, which is really the Growth 50 which is our brick-and-mortar initiative to get each of these 50 stores right. And you're going to see, and I can talk about that later. But that is really one of the most exciting things that we're doing right now.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up. Karen, on the gross margin front. Can you just touch on the drivers of the outsized merchandise margins this quarter? I guess how best to think about 2Q when we still have somewhat of an easier compare? And as we think forward, what's the best way to think about the spreads between inventory and sales on a multiyear basis?","Karen Hoguet","So let me start with gross margin in the first quarter. The merchandise margin was actually up a little higher than the gross margin because again, we are getting -- the gross margin gets negatively impacted by the growth in digital and the free shipping associated with the loyalty programs. What we said about margins for the year is that we expect it to be flat to up slightly. And so again, I'd hold with that and we will see from there. But there's nothing that happened in the first quarter that should reverse in the second quarter. So the first quarter is clean from that perspective. In terms of inventory, one of our key initiatives is to improve our inventory turnover over time and over multiple years. So Hal and Jeff Kantor and the teams are working very hard on that in part to help working capital but frankly, more so to improve sales and margin. And so I'm pretty excited about that. But I don't yet know the magnitude of that over time. But you could see that to be an important initiative for us going forward.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Congratulations, Karen. I wanted to just think about in hindsight, if you could provide insight on what your internal expectations were for first quarter comps, gross margin and EPS? Really just trying to better understand how we should think about the raise in full year guidance? To what extent it was related to the beat in the first quarter performance or your expectations or increased outlook for 2Q and beyond?","Karen Hoguet","Yes. I think I'm not going to tell you what our plan was for the first quarter. We did beat it on every line. But again, I would focus on these two key things we talked about. The increase in sales guidance with no change really in the margin and expense. It was really all driven by the extra point-of-sale and also the change in the credit revenue much of which happened in the first quarter. So that's not all incremental to the rest of the year.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then while you've touched on this, in terms of kind of ranking the impacts to the raise in the point of comp to the full year, how would you kind of break down or prioritize the impact of tourism or the loyalty program? You've mentioned Backstage and merchandising. How should we think about that order?","Karen Hoguet","Honestly, I can't give you a breakdown. I would just assume that fall in the mix as we raise the guidance.","Paul Trussell","Fair enough. And then lastly then on gross margins. As you just spoke about, the merchandise margins were very strong in 1Q. Why should the full year still end up in the flat to just up slightly range? I was surprised that wasn't adjusted.","Karen Hoguet","Well, remember. This includes the digital [indiscernible] and as the platinum customers and gold customers and our Star Rewards program keep increasing their shipments with macys.com that does go through gross margins. We also had a good gross margin performance in the back half of the year. And the first quarter, as you remember from last year, was really not very good. Some opportunity in Q2. But it was really Q1. And the comparisons get harder as we get to the fall season.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett.","Charles Grom","Jeff, incentivizing your employees is always a good thing. Curious how much you think that decision to tie comp to sales across the chain may have helped sales in the quarter?","Jeffrey Gennette","It made a difference, Chuck. I think it's hard to quantify that. And I think as we saw in the incentive program that we did in the pilot that, which, we basically did in the back half of 2017, and that's what really informed our decision to do it companywide in 2018. What we found is once you get that first paycheck, these front-line colleagues. And these are like part-time doc associates, these are front line associates, they are serving customers, call centers, warehouses, these are corporate colleagues that when they get that first paycheck for that quarter, that what it does to kind of reinforce great behaviors and how they can live the North Star Strategy in the next quarter, so we think this is nothing but good news. And again, it was almost 3\/4 of our full colleague population. We have 130,000 employees that benefited from this. They get that in their paycheck, particularly our front-line colleagues. They get that in their paycheck in the next week or the next two weeks. So we know that's going to make a difference in the reinforcing behaviors that we've seen them exhibit with such courage in this first three-month window of the quarter. So I do think it's made a difference. But hard to quantify how much of our momentum right now is attributed to it. It's all part of it.","Charles Grom","Okay, great. And just on tourism, when you look back, when the business from tourism starts to turn, how long do the benefit will last you and is it possible to quantify what the lift was?","Karen Hoguet","It's really hard to know how long it's going to last. We know that the negative lasted a long time. So my hope is that the positive does as well, Chuck. But I don't know the answer to that.","Charles Grom","And then one last one for your Karen. Just leverage ratio is around 2.8x. I think I touched above your comfort zone. But given back-to-back orders of good sales here. How are you guys thinking about stock buybacks in terms of capital allocation?","Karen Hoguet","I think the issue is we still need to get the leverage ratio to the target level and that continues to be the priority. Should the EBITDA significantly improve versus what we would have expected, such as that happens faster, that's a change. But at this point, we are still anticipating debt reduction being the use of excess cash.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger of Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Greenberger","Karen, I wanted to just follow-up on Lorraine's question on the monthly comp cadence here in Q1. And I think you mentioned every week was a good and there was consistent performance throughout the quarter. Is this compared to your plan? Or is this consistent performance relative to the 3.9% comp that you reported this quarter?","Karen Hoguet","No. Compared our expectations, obviously, depending on the timing of promotions, it can be up and down relative to the 4Q OL. But relative to our expectations, it was consistently a strong quarter week in, week out, month in, month out.","Jeffrey Gennette","And then Kimberly we had an Easter shift obviously. So the big shift despite for us in the first quarter was the Easter shift. So when you look at the combination between March and April, we got this -- we got the planning of this one right and that's what's Karen is referring to in terms of exceeding expectations and the way we plan the weeks. We plan the Easter shift, right? And then the Friends and Family shift that we described, it's affected the first quarter performance. We planned that right as well.","Kimberly Greenberger","Great. Okay. That's super helpful. And then I think you mentioned that the average unit retail price in the quarter was up 5%, Karen. I think you said that, that was because last year contained a lot of markdown selling. I think looking back at the comments you made last year, it was because of the carryover inventory from the fourth quarter. So given that it was such a significant driver here in the first quarter, I'm wondering how we should think about the AUR throughout the rest of the year.","Karen Hoguet","Well, I said it was good in two factors. One is the one you mentioned. The second was much higher AUR in regular price selling driven by this growth in our strategic categories, fine jewelry, dresses that I had alluded to and talked about on the call. So it's really both factors. One is ongoing and the other is more temporary. So we don't forecast AUR increases. But it isn't all due to the clearance merchandise being less. What really encouraged us was the strong increase in AUR in the regular price out.","Jeffrey Gennette","I think the merchants are doing a very good job of really putting all of our goods, packing them with value and really going after the fashionable spender which is really our sweet spot. And so the sellthroughs on that product at higher AURs is really healthy right now. So just to amplify the second part of Karen's point, fashion is selling. We are getting better sellthroughs and we are getting more value for it.","Operator","I will take our next question from Paul Lejuez of Citi.","Paul Lejuez","With the launch of the tender neutral card, can you build into your expectations any decline in credit penetration or would you assume that that stays consistent?","Jeffrey Gennette","We think it just stays consistent because you continue to get better benefit if you use our card. So if you're a cardholder, you're always going to want to use your card versus take advantage of the tender, the bronze level or where you don't have to use our credit card. So while I would say that is a risk we've considered, we think we have the risk contained and that should not be an issue. And we are hoping that it gets further engagement from the half of our customers who don't use a credit card which will help sales.","Jeffrey Gennette","I will just amplify that, Paul. We are staying very disciplined in making sure that the tiered benefits between bronze, silver, gold and platinum are really clear and the customer clearly sees the stepup of. So the fact that they are a bronze player, they can pay in any payment type, we are going to make sure they are very clear about what they get if they were to change what level they go to. And those will be increased benefits. So we are very hopeful that we are going to get new customers into our credit portfolio as a result of introducing the bronze program.","Paul Lejuez","Got you. And then Karen, I think the comp metrics that you gave for the quarter include that Friends and Family benefit. Is there any way you can talk about outside that Friends and Family period? What were the comp metrics and traffic ticket AUR basis?","Karen Hoguet","No, I can't. We will give it to you when we finish the second quarter when we do this spring. We don't have that we stated.","Paul Lejuez","Okay. And how about if you look at Friends and Family versus same promotion last year, how did it perform, right? We crossed over quarters now. But I'm just curious if you kind of just separate that one event and look year-over-year, how did it perform?","Jeffrey Gennette","It performed better for both Macy's and Bloomingdale\u2019s. It was -- to the earlier question, it was the same discount. And -- but the customers responded better to it this year based on the fashion content that we have as well as some of the exclusive products that we had about Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy's. So we're pleased with this performance.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brian Tunick of RBC.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible] on for Brian. First of all, I wanted to ask about the Backstage. You've been seeing as you added more stores. I believe in the past you had mentioned the high single digits lift for the overall store comp when you added a Backstage to an existing store. Is that sort of the lift you're still seeing and do you still have new customers coming in for that concept where the Backstage store has been opened now for over a year?","Jeffrey Gennette","So your question is suggesting one of the things that we were most interested in saying which was how would Backstage within a Macy's perform in the second full year after anniversarying its introduction? And what we talked about is that the introduction means a 7-point lift to the full building versus buildings of that control set. And what we are seeing now were those -- when we opened the Backstage in 2016. And at the beginning of 2017 that we are getting positive comps in those stores, in that Backstage location. So that is really good news for us. As to the conversation about existing versus new customers, so existing customers are clearly, when they are experiencing both Backstage and the full price side in the store that has both, they are spending more and they are visiting more often. So that is always good news for us. We have not marketed really Backstage outside of the inaugural opening in a particular market. We don't market it nationwide. And when we get to get more critical mass we will do that. And with that, we expect that we will be attracting more broadly new customers into it. But right now, it's working quite well with getting more spend with existing customers. And as mentioned, the growth rate of it is disproportional in those Backstage locations that have been opened more than 1 year. So that's all good news.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you. Then I believe you mentioned the strong recap of sales from closed stores here in Q1. Does this recap [indiscernible] opportunity and very strong obviously, e-commerce sales make you maybe reconsider the optimal store count for Macy's?","Karen Hoguet","I mean, that's always in the map as we think about the store count. So I don't think it makes us reconsider the store count. But it is great news that we have been able to retain the sales in nearby stores as well as online.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Regarding the brand experience and as you're thinking about what you can do there and through the lens of curation, culture and convenience, what are your thoughts on what will be more shorter-term opportunities versus more longer term opportunities as you reinvent the store in a customer-centric basis? I think related to that is the Growth 50 and would love your hypothesis on which are the more profound differences in the Growth 50 which could be ported over to your larger store base?","Jeffrey Gennette","Oliver, let me talk first. I think that if I had to kind of sum up, I think on the curation comment that you're making. That's certainly what we're looking to do with our brick-and-mortar portfolio, it's to make sure that we got the best possible assortment, localized at the store level and you're seeing us make much more aggressive edits and really amplify in the fashion of the trends and the brands that remain. And we tested that all the way through 2017. You've seen this do that in 2018. So that continues. So I think in terms of the convenience question, us being able to make sure that wherever our customer wants to shop, if she's browsing online but she wants to feel the fabric in store, if she wants to get into a store but get out, how could she transact without having to deal with any friction, that's why we have mobile checkouts, making sure that we've got all delivery models, including same-day delivery for that last mile imperative. We've got that very well focused. In terms of making sure that the store experience is heightened, that just leads you into kind of how we are thinking about that, it's really kind of the Nexus of what we're doing with the Growth 50. And really the recent acquisition of STORY and really all we are doing with Market @ Macy's. ","So let's just start with Growth 50. So Growth 50 is something that when we sat down and looked at how are we going to improve our trend in brick-and-mortar, it was all on the thesis that Macy's is going to do best when we've got robust digital growth, we've got healthy brick-and-mortar and we've got a mobile platform that connects customers to all channels. And so we had the mobile piece well on way. We have the digital growth obviously, percolating and we are driving that very successfully. Brick-and-mortar needed a lot of work. So we took 50 doors that are representative of a lot of other doors and we are focusing on the 5 Ps which for us are product, presentation, process, promotion and making sure that they are right. And the fifth is really people. And so what we're doing in each of those 50 doors is really looking at hyper curated assortments, making sure that the facilities are in great shape, that we are putting capital in those buildings but modest capital so that it can be scaled with what we learned, really making sure that the marketing localized. We're bringing communities into the store.","But the big win is really what we're doing with our teams. Great store managers, great operational and sales managers, great front-line colleagues, particularly in those businesses where the customer likes that touch, fine jewelry, Big Ticket, women's shoes, those, and beauty businesses. So all of those, we are in process of completing all that work. We are going to be done with that by mid third quarter and we can expect to have strong growth in those 50 doors. If we do, based on the expense and the capital we are putting into those buildings, that will form our thesis for how we take that into more brick-and-mortar in future years. So that is a very important initiative for us. As it relates to STORY, and as it relates to Market @ Macy's.","So STORY is obviously, you know the STORY in Manhattan. Rachel [indiscernible], the Founder of STORY is now the chief, she is basically the brand officer, Brand Experience Officer at Macy's. And we believe that not only will we see opportunities for the expression of STORY within Macy's stores but also her work in really helping connect marketing and merchandising within the store experience, which is really cut her teeth on over the years that she has been leading the subject. So very excited about what her leadership is going to be. She reports directly to Hal. Her peers are running marketing, running stores, running merchandising. She's going to work very closely with all of that. And then Market @ Macy's is really our opportunity to take unknown brands or categories that can be hyper localized in a space that we run and operate and it brings new ideas into stores in a scalable way with this kind of movable piece of content. And so far so good. We have like, 500 vendors in products that are in the Q to come into this. We've got it in 10 stores and it's working quite well for us. So expect to hear more about that in the future.","Oliver Chen","That sounds really innovative, Jeff. As I think about Growth 50 and different CapEx decisions you'll make as you test, read and react, how do you juxtapose that against thinking about different level productivity stores whether they be A, B and C stores and what you think your footprint should look like in the context of stores really transforming as acquisition points and rethinking the bricks and clicks in a modern way?","Jeffrey Gennette","So I think Growth 50 is representative of A, not all of our stores portfolio but a big piece of it. And certainly in all the premium malls of the nation, and certainly the stores that make up the bulk of our business and the majority of our store profits. So I think we've got -- our thesis on this is that we are going to test all this. We are going to take what works. But one of the driving ambitions of this thing was to make sure that whatever we did was scalable. So I've got confidence that we are going to come out of 2018 with what that looks like. There is going to be other stores in which we are looking at new ways to operate. They've got positive cash flow. But it would not necessarily make sense for us to invest in them like we are at Growth 50. But there's new ways that we can hit customer expectation, potentially operate them more profitably and we are hard at work right now figuring out what we are going to do with that subject. So more to come on that.","Oliver Chen","And lastly, as you know, we have been focused on big data and data driving personalization and loyalty and data also driving convenience. And you've made a lot of strides with prioritizing data in your organization. Could you just brief us on what we should focus on in terms of your priorities in this subject and how it may impact our models over time?","Jeffrey Gennette","Yes, I think what -- again, is the notion that hyper curation at a brick-and-mortar level is data [indiscernible] format. It's going to be the cross breed of art and science and great merchants to understand what's ahead. But then also look at past history. And to look at the particular community of that store and make sure that we are sorting appropriately. Endless aisle is a long line. And where vendor direct is taking us is the opportunity to massively expand our SKU counts online and then use data to hyper personalize that at a customer level. So we are in the beginning stages of that, both in expanding of the -- right now, we are at about 6:1 of online SKUs to an average store. You're going to see us take that ratio much higher and you're going to see us use data to then personalize that messaging to a customer in the future so that that also is curated like the store brick-and-mortar experience would be. So expect to hear more from that from us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Omar Saad of Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","I wanted to actually ask you about a little bit deeper on the inventory. I mean, they've been running really lean for the last couple of quarters and it seems like all the initiatives you put in and the growing kind of centralized e-commerce business are giving a greater ability that kind of turns inventories faster and do a little bit more with less. Can you expand upon that and how you're thinking about the inventory management, and how it's evolving in the digital area, giving single potential, single view inventory, et cetera?","Karen Hoguet","I think as I said earlier, it is a high priority for us but not prepared yet to tell us how low we think it can go. But we absolutely agree with your premise that both through technology as well as looking at our business in a way that focuses on curation more, we should be able to bring the inventories down. But again, I can't today tell you how much or on what timeframe.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Binetti of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Michael Binetti","Let me add my congrats on performance in the quarter. And Karen, I'll add my best wishes for you as well. I know you wouldn't normally comment on matrons. But some other areas of retail this week have seen some really big growth rates as we get into fiscal quarter. If we run the back half math that, Karen, you helped us with, it looks like you're pointing to about flat to negative 2% in the second quarter which -- with the help you gave us on the shift implies that you guys feel like the core is just fine. Do I have the components there correct? And have you seen any context you can play around May here as we get in the quarter?","Karen Hoguet","We are not going to comment on May. And again, the guidance for the spring season, you have to do your own math. It's about 1% to 2% comp and then flat to 1% total sales growth.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then I guess Kimberly asked earlier but on the AUR and I know you don't forecast that either. But that obviously had kind of a strange quarter last year in the first quarter and baseline. As this year rolls on, you said a couple of these components are continuing and some rolloff but you do start accelerate backstage which I would imagine would be somewhat of a neutralizing impact on the strategic lift you are getting to the AUR that you think would continue. So I guess the longer-term question is if that is something that you think fades from the 5% level through the year a little bit as we think about our models? And then may be just a longer-term question is the first positive transaction count quarter you've had in a while, is that something that you see a sustainable? You added a lot of components [indiscernible] about in the traffic in the stores I'm just curious how you're feeling about that line.","Karen Hoguet","Well, as I said earlier, we don't forecast AUR. So I'm not sure I can help you with your first question. The second question on transactions, I think we need to see the whole spring season before we can respond to that.","Michael Binetti","Okay, fair enough. I guess thinking out a little bit getting away from the [indiscernible] here in the near term. Are you ready yet to talk about more of how you're thinking about the margin outlook for the business over multiple years, I won't pin you down on the timeframe. I think when you look at the dollar amount the real estate has added -- real estate gains has added a lot in the last few years. I'm assuming you'd say that that probably were past the peak on the gains there and that will be less of a contributor starting in 2019 and beyond. So how -- it becomes more important for us to think what the multiyear margin outlook [indiscernible] think about this.","Karen Hoguet","It's already the assets against are already forecasted this year to be significantly less than last year. So that's already happening, which is why you hear us talking more about net income and EPS excluding the assets sale gains, just so you see the comparables. But when you think about the fundamental profitability, the net income excluding asset sale gains should grow particularly as we return the company to comp growth and growth. That's really the key message here. And that's what we're focused on.","Operator","We will now take our final question from Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","On the private-label side of the business, anything that you're seeing there that we should be looking forward as we go through the balance of the year? And Jeff, as I think about the store, the mix of apparels versus other categories in the future, where should it be? And then Karen, just on the platinum doors. Did they perform any -- were their performance more accelerated than the chain average? How do you look at it?","Jeffrey Gennette","So I'll take your first two, Dana. So private brand is healthy. And you've heard us say that in the second of our five North Star Strategy points, which is Must be Macy's, it's really all about taking our poster Private Brands as well as exclusive product with other brands up to a 40% from its current 29% and we are well on our way on that. And when you look at that and what we are doing it right with a number of our Private Brands, our margins are better. Our supply chain is shorter and we are getting more value in the products. The AUR is higher than the average. We are doing some, we're having some really great success with a number of our Private Brands and it's our objective to get all of our Private Brands performing that way. We feel like we have the right number. They're spread across the right FOBs, they are addressing the right lifestyle for our customers. So we feel good about that. With respect to the mix of apparel versus balance of store, we talked about the 8 businesses that we are really focused on, a number of those are apparel. We have some that are in the Center Core world. There are some that are in home and what I tell you is that there's good success stories in each of those. When you look at the overall mix, apparel is not going to grow in to penetration because right now when you're thinking about Vendor Direct, our Vendor Direct first big initiative is to go after the home store because there's a lot of non-cannibalizing categories that we will bring into the mix with that. But we are happy with our overall apparel business. And very happy with our accessories business. And so we're going to be looking at individual components to grow them more profitably.","Karen Hoguet","And relating to the -- you said platinum doors, I'm assuming you meant Growth 50 doors. The first thing I would say stores of all sizes and [indiscernible] did well in the first quarter. As Jeff said, close to 75% of our associates made the bonus which means they exceeded their sales plan. So -- everybody did better across the company. Relative to last year, the Growth 50 doors are accelerating beginning to which was we said is a bit earlier than we had anticipated. So we feel really good about the outlook for those stores.","Jeffrey Gennette","And I add, Dana, the range of store sizes that are touched by Growth 50 is 20 million all the way to over -- to much bigger than that. So we are testing through the Growth 50 All Star sizes.","Operator","As there is no further questions, I'd like to turn the conference back to your host for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen Hoguet","Great. Thank you all for your interest and support and as always if you have other questions, come on and call me and we will do what we can to get your questions answered.","Jeffrey Gennette","Thanks, everybody.","Karen Hoguet","Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"13941":["Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) Q1 2017 Earnings Call May 11, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Karen M.

First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Good morning. Joining me on the call today is Jeff Gennette, our new CEO. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today, due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","So, on this morning's call, I'm going to first take you through our results for the first quarter, and then I'm going to turn the call over to Jeff to make a few comments. We will then both take your questions.","Our sales and earnings in the first quarter were consistent with our expectations and keep us on track to achieve our annual guidance of a comp owned plus licensed sales decline of 2% to 3% and earnings per share of $3.37 to $3.62, excluding retirement plan settlement charges and premiums on debt repurchases. This includes the approximately $0.47 per share gain expected on the sale of the Union Square Men's building that will be booked in the fourth quarter. Remember that we sold this building in January and received the cash at that time. Sales in the first quarter were $5.338 billion, down 7.5% from last year. On a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 4.6% and down 5.2% on an owned basis. The back half of the quarter performed better than the first.","Sales in the quarter continued to grow double-digits in the digital channel. While the sales performance in our stores were consistent with our expectations, the sales declined versus last year. The Southwest region based out of Los Angeles was strongest, and the Northeast region was weakest. International tourist sales declined at about the same rate as our comp sales, meaning it didn't have an impact. We had hoped, however, that the uptick we saw in the fourth quarter would help us in 2017. By family of business, our sales were strongest in women's apparel, most notably active and dresses, in fine jewelry, fragrances, women's shoes, furniture and mattresses. Weaker businesses in the quarter included handbags, fashion jewelry and watches, housewares, and top-of-table. Trends at Bloomingdale's were similar to those at Macy's in the quarter.","Bluemercury had a strong quarter with continued successful store openings, as well as double-digit comp growth. In the quarter, the number of transactions declined 7.5%, while average unit retail increased 0.7% and units per transaction increased 2.2%. We now have 26 Backstage stores open within our Macy's stores and are adding 19 more this year. We are encouraged by the performance of these combined stores where the total store sales are being lifted versus control group. This performance, as well as, the results of our Last Act clearance strategy, are both encouraging. We see customers liking the everyday deep value opportunity being offered within our mall locations. We are testing a few variations of our strategy this year, but we believe from our tests so far that this will both add incremental spend from existing customers and also lead to the addition of new customers, and whichever model performs best this year, will be rolled out aggressively next year.","The gross margin rate in the quarter was 38.1%, 100 basis points below last year. The decline was due in part to ending 2016 with inventory higher than we had anticipated, compounded by weak sales trends in February and margin pressures in a few families of business. We are experiencing gross margin declines in the beauty business due to increased promotional activity; in housewares, due to price competition; and in fashion watches, due to the strong customer demand and, therefore, growth in lower margin tech watches. While we do not expect to have as much margin pressure going forward due to the inventory level, the pressure in these three categories is expected to continue. We are working to offset this margin pressure through speeding up our inventory turnover, accelerated growth in our private brands, as well as from our Last Act clearance strategy.","Comp inventory at the end of the quarter was up approximately 1%. SG&A in the quarter was $1.812 billion, or $154 million below last year. We benefited in the quarter from $54 million more in asset sale gains compared to last year, reduced expense from closed stores, and the impact of our restructuring. We offset some of the reduced expense with our investment in growing our digital and mobile business and expanding Bluemercury. Depreciation and amortization was $243 million in the quarter, or $17 million below last year. We are pleased with our expense performance and note that it helped to mitigate the gross margin rate decline.","Credit income in the quarter was $180 million, approximately flat to last year. Credit penetration was 45.4%, which is 50 basis points below last year in the quarter, but 50 basis points above 2015. Operating income in the quarter was $220 million, down $56 million from last year, or down $69 million excluding the settlement charges from last year's operating income. Net interest expense in the quarter was $84 million and tax expense was $63 million. The effective tax rate of 47.4% is higher than our annual estimate due to the adoption of the new accounting rule for the income tax effects of stock-based compensation. We still expect the annual effective rate to be approximately 37%.","During the quarter, we repurchased $146 million of debt in the open market, paying a premium of $3 million. Approximately $135 million of this was in our 6.375% senior notes due 2037. Net income in the quarter attributable to Macy's shareholders was $71 million. The average share count on a diluted basis was 306.9 million shares in the first quarter. Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.23 as compared to $0.37 per share last year. Excluding the premiums on debt repurchases, the earnings per share was $0.24. This compares to last year's $0.40 per share when excluding settlement charges. The cash provided by operating activities was $234 million in the first quarter as compared to $8 million last year. While there are other variances, this can be explained almost entirely by $249 million lower current income taxes. This results from the timing of our first quarter estimated payment, which was made in early May this year.","The net cash used by investing activities was $60 million as compared to a $211 million use last year. CapEx, including capitalized software, was $51 million lower in the quarter, while asset sale proceeds were $80 million higher. We are still expecting our CapEx to be approximately $900 million this year. So this resulted in cash flow generated before financing activities of $174 million as compared to a use of $203 million last year, or a $377 million increase. $149 million of the cash was used, as I mentioned earlier, to repurchase debt, and no stock was repurchased in the quarter. On a rolling four-quarter basis, our leverage ratio was 3.2 and our coverage ratio, 6.7. This compares to our target range of 2.5 to 2.8 for the leverage and 6.4 to 6.6 for coverage.","Let me now update you on the progress in executing our real estate strategy. During the quarter, we received $96 million of cash associated with real estate transactions and booked $68 million of gains. $47 million of the gain was related to Downtown Minneapolis, and $9 million associated with the Brooklyn transaction. In addition, we sold numerous other properties with lower proceeds as well as gains. We are making good progress in selling off properties that were previously closed. We are also continuing in our efforts to create additional value from our real estate holdings where we expect to continue to operate.","As you saw in the release, we are now under contract to sell an additional two floors of our downtown Seattle store, having sold floors five through eight in 2015. After this sale, we will operate what we expect to be an even more exciting store on the lower three levels of the building. This transaction is expected to close this fall. We are very excited by how this project is unfolding, and the opportunity that this provides to greatly improve our store there. We have also launched a marketing effort for the upper floors of our State Street flagship store in downtown Chicago. This will enable us to operate a more productive store while creating additional traffic from the utilization of the upper floors. We're excited by the opportunity to make our State Street store an even more vibrant shopping destination.","On our Brookfield partnership, there is a dedicated team at Brookfield who is fully engaged and working in conjunction with our team on feasibility analyses and pre-development activities related to the approximately 50-asset strategic alliance portfolio. We anticipate that we will make significant progress on formulating specific approaches for properties in this portfolio later this year. Execution would then obviously take us into 2018 and beyond. And finally, we are in the very early stages of our work to analyze the potential to enhance and energize Herald Square here in New York.","So that's an overview of the first quarter. As I said earlier, it was consistent with our expectations, and our outlook for the year remains unchanged. We're still expecting the annual comp owned plus licensed sales to decline 2% to 3%, and total sales to decline 3.2% to 4.3%. Remember, our total sales guidance incorporates a 53rd week in 2017, while our comp guidance is on a 52-week basis. Earnings per share, excluding settlement charges and premiums on debt repurchases, is still expected to be $3.37 to $3.62, or $2.90 to $3.15 excluding the gain on our Union Square Men's Store.","I am sure many of you are going to ask about our annual sales guidance, given the 4.6% decline in the first quarter, so I thought I would address that question now. We had expected the first quarter to be our weakest quarter of the year, primarily because of the rollouts of our strategic initiatives, which weren't starting until this month, and will continue through the second and third quarters. Also, the benefit from closed stores was not expected to help until the going-out-of-business sales were completed in late March. And while the first half of the quarter was disappointing, our trend improved, giving us comfort that we are on track. We expect the improvement in trend to start in the second quarter, and then continue to build in the third and fourth quarters for four key reasons.","First, as I mentioned, the benefit from the retained sales from closed stores just started to be experienced now, given that the stores are now actually closed. We expect this impact to help our comp sales starting in the second quarter. Second factor is the rollout of our pilots. So the rollout of our very successful shoe pilot began May 1. Between now and August, we will complete the rollout of the shoe strategy to all stores. Shoes in the pilot stores produced a nearly double-digit shoe sales increase in the first quarter, well above the shoe sales trend for the rest of the stores. And in jewelry, we expect to roll out the pilot initiative to the roughly 200 remaining stores this quarter, which will then complete the rollout of that initiative. There too, we've had very good results that we expect to continue. And we're also adding or expanding furniture and mattresses in approximately 60 stores. These are all categories of business where we took a new approach to how to operate them, and that we saw success in our pilots and are now rolling them out.","The third factor is our new marketing strategy, which will be rolled out in the third quarter, which we also expect to help drive our sales. As our new Chief Marketing Officer has learned more about Macy's, we've concluded that our current model is too heavily weighted to promotional marketing. Starting this fall, we are evolving to a model that heightens the engagement of our key customers with our brand. Part of this will include adding communications that will better build our product authority in fashion and in beauty, highlighting trends, exclusive products, and newness. We are also evolving our media mix to improve efficiency and effectiveness of our spend.","And then the fourth factor is on the digital front. We continue to improve our mobile app and the digital experience, and we're also strategizing to improve our Buy Online Pickup in Store experience to help us grow this business. Also remember that in the fall season, the digital business, which is growing rapidly, penetrates higher as a percent of our total sales, which then helps the total sales performance due to the mix.","So with that, let me now turn the call over to Jeff, and then we'll both take your questions.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, thank you, Karen, and good morning, everybody. I'm pleased to be here on this call. And I'm going to make a few brief remarks this morning, and then we'll open up the line for Q&A.","So, firstly, these are unusual and challenging times for retail, especially for mall-based department stores. And we certainly know that these changes that we're seeing are secular and not cyclical. On the consumer side, we see continuing shifts in shopping trends, driven by the rapid adoption of technology, and for some of our customer segments, a greater emphasis on value and on experience. As for the retail industry overall, we've known for some time that the United States is over-retailed compared to other markets, so it's not surprising to see the contraction in retail square footage. And it will take some time to tell how the consolidation and the closure of stores, and in some cases, entire brands will impact us.","On one hand, we have opportunity to acquire new customers. On the other hand, this contraction puts more pressure on some of our mall-based stores, where we already have seen a slowdown in traffic. At Macy's, we have a responsibility to bring additional traffic into these stores, and we're also going to be working on this in close partnership with our mall developers. But we don't have our head in the sand as to the significant challenges that we face in getting the business growing again. And we're looking outward as well as inward for the solutions, and I'm confident that we will carve out a successful path forward.","So, I want to give you a sense of how I've spent my first few weeks as CEO. I'm really listening to our customers, to our brand partners, to our associates, and to our investors, and I'd like to give you just kind of a highlight and sense of what I've been hearing. So, let me start with the front line associates. So, from the front line associates in our stores \u2013 so I do unannounced visits to our stores each week, and I've been in a lot of our great stores that are performing well, and in other stores that are not. And when I ask them, what help they need and what's working. What's working is where we have clear value. What's working is where we have exclusivity. Our customers love that. And simple is working. When we simplify and build and edit and promote great products that customers can only get at Macy's that our customers can easily see on the floor, we get the sell-through.","So, a big need and take-away from this is that we need to continue to make bigger meals out of fewer things for our stores, make them easier to shop. I've also done a tour of our various cities and town halls with our corporate and support associates, and I will just say that they're very engaged and they're eager to win again. And when I ask them what they need to do to succeed, it's really loud and clear. They're telling us, prioritize, give us clear direction, and then get out of the way so we can move more quickly. They know we need to move at the speed of our customer.","I've also spent time with our brand partners, and they've told me, be Macy's. Macy's should be the place where customers go for fashion and new ideas, and we need to own that lane again. They also tell us to go faster. Our brand partners want us to come with them with great ideas and insights. They're ready to lock arms with us. We need to push them to be more creative and them with us, and to share combined opportunities through data and innovation. And then our investors, you've been very clear. It's how and when will you grow again is what's on your mind. And what I want to tell you is that we certainly don't have all the answers yet, but we are working on them with a sense of urgency. And overall, the transition for me has gone smoothly, and I'm grateful to have had the ten months before this to build my core team and get a plan in place that we're beginning to address our current challenges, but there's certainly more to be done.","So let me just tell you about 2017. We're focused on delivering the plan to support the earnings guidance that we provided for the year. And doing that will require us to stabilize our brick-and-mortar business, as well as keep our digital and our mobile business humming. On the core business and stores business, I'm pleased with the progress we've made in scaling, as Karen just mentioned, the fine jewelry and women's shoe pilots. Both will be rolled out nationally. They'll both be across the fleet by August and we expect to have a modest but measurable lift on performance in the back half of the year, based on them.","And when we're looking at future improvements to stores, expect us to apply the same approach of testing in a few number of stores, iterating as we expand, and then be ready to scale with our learnings nationally in 2018 and beyond. We've done a nice job of really this mantra that we have of testing, iterating, and scale. When we get that rhythm right, we know we can accelerate our pace of improving the customer experience and driving improved store performance.","And, as Karen noted, our mobile and our digital business continues to grow at a very strong pace, driven in part by a consumer experience that just keeps getting better. In particular, our mobile app has been recognized as a top retail app. And if you haven't tried it lately, you should. We expect to get continued interest and growth through the mobile platform. Internally, we constantly challenge ourselves to deliver on an experience that integrates mobile, digital, and stores, and allows our customers to shop the way that they live (24:07). So, stabilizing the brick-and-mortar business and continuing the rapid growth of mobile and digital are key to delivering in 2017, but we certainly know that we will need to go beyond that to find new places for our brand to play and find new sources for growth. And that exploratory work is currently underway.","So, as you saw in the release this morning, we're having an investor meeting on June 6 where we will take you into more detail of how we were looking at the business. As Karen just mentioned, we'll provide at that meeting an update on the work we're doing to re-engineer the Macy's marketing machine, and then we're going to spend some time discussing key initiatives that we are in test mode right now, that we're iterating in 2017, like what Karen mentioned with Backstage, with the intent of scaling those initiatives in 2018 and beyond. And at that meeting, we'll also have Karen, myself, and the rest of our senior team will be on hand and available to answer your questions.","So with that, let's open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll pause for just a moment. We'll take your first caller from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Jeff, question on the brick-and-mortar front, and as we think about this over-stored retail backdrop domestically, I guess, what gives you comfort that your 100th store closure announcement was enough? And if sales declines were to continue, what's the best way to think about a potential plan B over time?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, what I'd say, Matt, is that we looked at the store closures in a couple of ways. The first place we looked was the cash flow that each of those stores were giving us. And that was more of a gentle pruning that we had done historically. The second way that we looked at it would be that if we were building the Macy's brand from the ground up, what DMAs, what major cities would we be in? What key malls would we be in? And with the strength of the internet business, what stores, frankly, will we not have built? So, we felt like we got to that when we made the decision to go aggressively and close and we made the announcement on the 100 stores, we did it thinking that the landscape was such that, and the portfolio that remained was the appropriate level of stores across the country.","But, as things go, we're watching all of this and we're watching how the store trends evolve. We're also looking at are there going to be advantageous opportunities for us where the value of that real estate is greater than the value of the retail that we do there. So, I'm not going to say that we're not going to close more stores beyond those 100, but we do feel like we got to the right level when we made the decision that we did in 2016 that we're executing now in 2017.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, and then just a follow-up. I guess, as you size up the decelerating top line performance that we've seen, do you think it's more company-specific execution, or is it the combination of off-price, online, some of the category killers? I guess the question being now that you've had some time to assess and step back, what's the best way that you think to lay out the step-stones to stabilize the business from here?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, let me take you through that. I think that our opportunity is really three-fold and then we have a strategy to address it. I think the first thing we have to do is we do have to stabilize the core brick-and-mortar business, because still the bulk of our business is being done in our stores. While we do that, we need to continue the high growth that we're experiencing in mobile and digital. That's really critical, and we've got good wind in our sails on that, and we will continue to do all the initiatives to keep that going. And the third thing we have to do is we have to explore new territory where we believe our brand can play.","So let me take you briefly through the strategy to address those top-line opportunities. Three of our five-point strategy really focuses on our best customer. And really the first piece of that is how we make our brand stronger with a re-engineered marketing machine. And so you're going to hear about our efforts on that in more detail in June. The second of the customer-facing pieces of the strategy are really amplifying the products that she loves and can only get at Macy's. And what we're doing with exclusivity and really working through the needs of our customer through the brands that we create or the brands we work with, with our partners that are exclusive at Macy's.","And the third thing we're focused on that are facing customers is the experience and gets to the belly of your questions about reasons why she comes to a store. And this is kind of a nexus of technology and the human touch and the experiences that we create in our best stores and those that we create in stores that are of lower tier. The fourth point of the strategy is then how we fund all that. And we're pretty good at that. We're pretty good at the expense piece. We have a real intense focus on cost management and efficiency. We've gotten $1 billion of SG&A out over the past couple of years. And then we're clearly showing that we can improve cash flow through our real estate monetization. So, some of those proceeds are basically helping us invest in those pieces that are customer-facing that will improve our overall business.","Then the fifth point of the strategy is recognizing that those first four points might have gotten it done in a different time, but in the time that we're in, we really haven't \u2013 we have a fifth point on how we're reimagining Macy's for the future, and where does our brand and our consumers give us permission to play? How can we transact outside of our store and digital boundaries today? What are the new kind of markets and experiences and models that we need to create? So, we're looking outward as much as inward on that. We believe that we have the right strategy to achieve what we set out to do for 2017, and though it was a disappointing quarter, we are on track to achieve that.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Good luck, guys.","Operator","We'll hear next from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Karen, I wanted to ask about two things. I think, you said e-commerce or digital commerce is growing rapidly. I'm wondering if you can provide any additional color around that here in the first quarter.","And then secondarily, given your leverage targets in the 2.5 to 2.8 times range, can you talk about some of the strategies and the things that you think Macy's needs to do to deliver on that? And what kind of timeframe we could think about? Thanks so much.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Sure. On the digital growth, we said that it was double-digits in the first quarter increase. As I've said repeatedly, it is almost impossible to truly break out digital from store, given all of the cross-channel activity. If somebody is using a mobile phone in store, having just worked with a sales associate, is that store or digital? Or the returns, et cetera, et cetera. But the growth continues to be quite strong, both mobile in store or digital at home or wherever. And as I had said, double-digit growth.","In terms of the leverage ratio, as we've talked about, we do expect to continue to reduce our debt levels this year, so that's a piece of it. But we also expect to grow the EBITDA over time. So, it's a combination of working on the numerator and the denominator at the same point and hope to get back in that target range before too long.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, Karen. Could I just add one on the e-commerce? Is there any change over time in the categories that you find consumers are particularly buying online? Because I think Macy's has delivered solid double-digit growth in e-commerce for a number of years now. But are the categories that are growing there the same? Are you seeing it across the category spectrum, or does that change over time?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No, I think, Kimberly, we're seeing growth in all categories, and it really has not changed over time.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll move to Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning. Karen, on the fourth quarter call, you had guided merch margins about flat for the year. It sounds like there are some challenging categories in the first quarter. Do you still expect to be able to get that flat merchandise margin, or do you think that that will decline for 2017?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, in the first quarter, the merch margin was down by about the same as the total margin. So, that was worse than expected, although we did offset it on the expense side. So, all in all, the quarter was okay from that perspective. I think, there will be continued pressure on the merchandise margin. As I had said earlier, we're hoping to offset it and still lead to that flat merchandise margin as we go through the year. But, we're also looking at the expense side too, to make sure that if that isn't feasible, we've got the opportunity to still do okay on the bottom line.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","What I would add, Lorraine, is that we had some unexpected fourth quarter overhang in our inventories coming into the first quarter. And obviously, we're dealing with that through the quarter. And to what Karen talked about in terms of a few categories where we are more challenged with margin that we see to continue, we're hoping that we have upside in how we're building some of our exclusive assortments that are more margin-rich. And we're really focused on making sure that that product is \u2013 it's got a customer in mind and that the value is there and consistent with what a customer expects. And if the benefit of it is that it's also enhanced margins, then we will take that. But we're really focused on creating products in our exclusivity portfolio that is really designed for particular customers. So far, she's responding to those. We expect that to help us offset some of the FOBs that we don't see improving in overall margin.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And could you give us an update on cosmetics and maybe talk through what you're doing to stabilize sales?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Let me talk about that. So, I think that \u2013 let's talk about color and treatment versus fragrances. So fragrances, our business is quite strong. And you've heard us on these calls talk about fragrances being a positive piece of our business. That continues. So, we saw that in the first quarter.","And when you look at the color and treatment line, that is what's under more duress. Then we have pieces of our business within color and treatment like Bluemercury that is quite strong. And we're getting double-digit growth out of that. We did add Bluemercury in two Macy's stores, and like the Impulse strategy that Macy's started about 10 years ago, it's taken awhile to get some traction. But we're starting to see some real firming up of that. And that give us confidence that that can be a much bigger play in Macy's in the future.","The Impulse strategy that's part of color and treatment has been quite strong for us. What we will be \u2013 we're rolling out more of those locations, more in the second quarter for the back half of the year. And then we're working with our branded partners that \u2013 on how we're going to change the experience or product mix to get better performance out of some of our lines that have not been doing as well in the balance of the Beauty strategy.","So, we have many task forces that have been formed on this. We've got very smart people that are working on it, both on our brand partners side as well as our side. And we're working towards this. We also believe there's an opportunity with loyalty, and so we're focused on that. And we hope to share those learnings with you in that direction when we meet in June at the investor meeting.","Lorraine Maikis Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Kara Szafraniec from Northcoast Research, your line is open.","Kara Szafraniec - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Had a couple of questions on Backstage for you guys. We are wondering if maybe you could give us just a little more color on how the Backstage productivity is in comparison to maybe the rest of the store? What categories are working best in that deep value section? And any cross-shopping commentary you could give us would be great. Thanks.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, I'll take that. So, there is a \u2013 let me kind of back up a bit on really what the off-price strategy is at Macy's. It really starts with our customers. And we \u2013 when you look at our best customers, those customers that shop with us up to 20 times a year, two-thirds of those shop in off-price on a monthly basis, and 70% of Millennials are shopping off-price on a monthly basis. So, Macy's needed to solve for that. So when we started the Backstage concept off-mall, we got some good returns on that. But we also \u2013 at the same time we were doing that, we also tested Backstage in some of our underproductive stores by kind of carving out a big cavity of real estate and putting Backstage in there. And that \u2013 we got some interesting results from that.","So, to get at the heart of your question, we really had this real estate, that we had excess space where we could add the Backstage concept, and so then we started to play with what the offering would be. And we were very careful about cannibalization, making sure that what we put in the Backstage section of that store wasn't just cannibalizing what was on the full price side. And so that brought for us categories that we weren't in in the balance of the store, that we could really exploit within Backstage. So we have a big chunk of the inventory that is not represented in the balance of the store. Things like home d\u00e9cor, a lot of things like toys and things in Baby. Opening price point in certain categories like cosmetics that isn't cannibalizing anything in the balance of the building.","And what we're finding with this is that, as Karen mentioned, that Backstage where we have it in a freestanding store \u2013 or, excuse me, when it's in a Macy's full-price store \u2013 that the entire building is lifting by a very nice level. And so we're looking really now at the customer behavior. Does that core customer, who is coming into those buildings, is she going over to the Backstage side? And is she building up her ticket or her basket on that particular visit? That \u2013 we checked that box. She's in fact doing that. The opportunity for that same customer to visit more often as a result of Backstage , we're looking at that one right now. And then the home run will be if you get a new customer that comes into that building because of Backstage.","So we've got a lot of tests out there right now. We have four, to be precise, of the 50 doors that are going to be fully engaged with Backstage in store. And we're hoping that by the end of this year, we're going to have a scalable model to aggressively roll out in the future.","Operator","Kara, do you have anything further?","Kara Szafraniec - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","No. Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Jeff, welcome. And, Karen, good morning. Thanks for the color you've provided on this call. Wanted to just circle back on some of your comments regarding initiatives to improve the comp trend over the balance of the year. Maybe if you can provide a little bit more color around your assumptions for retention from the door closings going on, and the potential expected lift to the digital or the remaining stores. Also, if you can maybe just be a little bit more granular on how we should think about the impact of the shoe pilot and the jewelry business more specifically?","And then, lastly, Jeff, you spoke about exclusivity as a real differentiator that the customers are responding to. If you can maybe give us some insight into the extent that you may be able to accelerate your offering from an exclusivity standpoint. Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, Paul, on the granularity, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to help you there. It's clearly these initiatives, though, that are going to help us go from our trend in the first quarter to the annual guidance we've given you. On the specific subject of retention, as we've discussed, it varies based on how many other stores are in the market, how similar the demographics of the customer is versus the store that closed in the nearby stores, as well as other factors that impact that. And it can range on a store anywhere from about 15% all the way up to 40% or 45%. So, again, there's not one answer to that. But between the retained sales and the pilots, as well as the marketing strategy, digital, et cetera, that's why we're confident in the annual guidance at this point.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And then, Paul, on your other three questions, let me take them in order. So the first one was on women's shoes. And this is one that has been surprisingly good for us. Shoes have been a real passion category for our customer. It's one of the two FOBs that she comes to us for, that really generates \u2013 it's the first place that she shops, and then she stays to shop in the balance of the store. So, not only if you get shoes right, but you also get a customer that is ready and willing to spend in other parts of the building, so it's a great place for us to focus on.","And we do believe that women's shoes \u2013 that a department store is still the best place for a woman to buy shoes in America. So, this was a category that we had to get right, and it was a category that we were losing share through 2015 and in 2016. So, as we do here, we have developed a pilot that we tested. We learned from that pilot, and now we're rolling it out to the balance of the country.","And when we take a pilot, we take a pilot that would be a flagship store all the way to a low volume store and test different things, so that when we take it into a district or a region of the country, we have a scalable model for all types of stores. And that's what we did, really, in women's shoes.","So we focused on three things within it. We really focused on product selection and making sure we had the right brand curation, that we really stood for the trends. Once we took care of the brands, we then took an approach of saying, okay, how do we want to curate it? So, we then looked at it from a classification lens. And instead of having everything by brand, we segmented the brands that mattered and everything else, basically, was then merchandised by classification. That got at a lot of editing that we could do. That gave us the opportunity, with the brands \u2013 or the items that remained, to really pump up the amount of quantity of size and color that we had. So we were ready for any customer in size and color, or that we could fulfill from that store. Then we focused on \u2013 so we got the assortment right.","Then the next thing we did is, we really focused on experience, and we really looked at the amount of management we needed, what the back of house had to be. What the \u2013 amount of sales associates, what their commission rates would look like, to give them the incentive to work with our customers. And then we really looked at that overall model that would say, how much of this could be self-serve, how much of this could be \u2013 needs to be high touch? So we played with all that, and that's what \u2013 we got some nice lifts that Karen mentioned. And that's what we'll be rolling out, and every store will have some version of this pilot by August of this year. So women's shoes, we feel very good about.","A year before that, we were really testing everything with fine jewelry, and we talked on these calls in the past, or Karen has, about our success with that. But what we've seen on that is basically about a double digit increase over control on these fine jewelry stores. Same thing from flagship all the way to opening price. And this is, again, where we've looked at it from edited assortments, we raised the amount and the caliber of the goods, some of those branded. We made \u2013 we said to you that we really wanted to go after the bridal business. And, as a result of that, you needed better salesmanship. So, we almost doubled the amount of sales associates in a number of our doors. We added training. We added management, we improved the environment, we improved the venting, and it's worked very well. So, that's what we are now rolling out to the balance of the country, and we will have this concept fully involved in every single store by August of this year. So that's \u2013 it's going to be a modest but measurable improvement in the back half of the year's trend.","As it relates to your third question about exclusivity, this is one that we can totally control. And we've really strengthened the caliber of our teams in private brands. And they've worked deeply over the past year and a half with their suppliers and really worked on the DNA of each of the brands that they create. And one of the reasons that we've been talking about some more consistent success in the apparel areas is based on the efforts of these private brand teams.","So they have focused on that. We've been able to really work with our supply chain, take out weeks of supply. We've worked with embedded teams on our side to really work on that. And we're just getting much faster and the value of the products we're now \u2013 we're able to put more make into these goods. We're getting higher AURs from these products. It helps us stem some of the traffic losses that we're seeing in stores, because we can get more in AUR, we can get more in that basket strength because of the strength of these private brands that our customer wanted.","In addition to that, we're working with our market vendors. So obviously, things like Tommy Hilfiger, they have been quite strong. We've talked about that. The teams that are touching that of our wholesale partners are doing a great job. They're marketing the brands really well, and we're getting good lifts in Tommy Hilfiger.","We made the decision on DKNY. So, DKNY now is being made exclusively for us in the deliveries that are coming up in the next number of months. And that filled what we believed was white space that we believe is going to give us exclusive product. But first and foremost, customer-wanted product that we weren't serving with other brands.","All of this leads to that we're going to be growing exclusivity. So, if it's X percent today, expect us to have aggressive growth there. We can control it. Our customers expect it of us. It gives us the opportunity to get into a third bucket of growth in exclusivity, which is capsule collections. So, we've had good success with that, with Y Yigal. We've got Cynthia Rowley coming up. We've got Anna Sui at the end of this year. All of those, we believe, cement Macy's as a place to get fashion, to get great \u2013 where we can kind of flex our fashion chops. So expect us to do that.","So, it's going to be a higher percentage in the future with all those things in play, and we think that will give us growth in the future at rates accelerating from where they are today.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And good look.","Operator","We'll move next to Paul Lejuez from Citi.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Karen, were there any sales in the quarter from the stores that are now closed? And if so, was there a gross margin impact as well? And I'm also curious about your performance in A, B and C malls? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No. There was \u2013 the closed \u2013 the stores that we closed are not in operations in the first quarter.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","And the question is, as I said earlier, our stores achieved the plan for the year \u2013 for the quarter. Sorry. And that I think I haven't looked at it quite that way. But we feel good about the performance of all of our stores at this point, relative to what we had expected.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, and then, Jeff, you said something about needing to find new places for growth and that exploratory work was underway. What does that mean? Can you expand on that a little bit?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","We'll share that color with you in June. We'll give you some \u2013 the beginning \u2013 our beginning thoughts on that.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, and then last one. Karen, on credit cards, can you talk about underlying metrics? What you saw on credit during the quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","It was a quarter that was pretty much as expected. No surprises. I \u2013 we were not surprised that the penetration came down a little bit because it had gone up so much last year. But really, not much change in terms of the portfolio.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And what was the offset in SG&A? Did you share that? Sorry if I missed it.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I did. And if you give me a minute, I'll tell you. $180 million, which was about flat with last year.","Paul Lejuez - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Charles Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Hi, thanks. Good morning. On the digital front, there's a little bit of a growing trend of some of the traditional brick and mortar guys buying some customer-facing e-commerce players. I was wondering, Jeff, if that's something you're contemplating to not only acquire customers but also some intellectual capital on the digital front?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I think, Chuck \u2013 It's Karen, obviously, not Jeff, but it's something that we've looked at for many years. And we've explored this over time. Obviously, haven't done anything. And we continue to look at all opportunities for helping that business.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, fair enough. And then, one for you, Karen. Back in February, you provided, I think, close to 10 factors that were embedded in the full EPS guidance. Wondering if there's any significant updates to any of those, particularly on the assets on the sales fronts?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","We're not updating the details today. I think, we're really focused on the total number in terms of sales and earnings.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. And then just you spoke a little bit about the sequential improvement. Kohl's this morning said that they saw about 800 basis point to 900 basis point comp improvement from February to the March\/April period. Just wondering if that was fairly consistent with the improvement that you guys saw.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Let me answer it a different way, which is that our March\/April trend was about a point \u2013 a little over a point better than the quarter as a whole.","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. Okay, great. Thanks, and good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] We'll hear next from Oliver Chen from Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi, thank you. Jeff, regarding the vendor relationships in the context of Amazon, how do you make sure that you really foster and have the specialness that is required in the marketplace, especially as Amazon does a good job upgrading their brands or making extremely aggressive efforts? Along the lines of Amazon, I know, Karen, you've mentioned you've really ramped up your hiring in terms of big data and using artificial intelligence. And Amazon has made some strides in voice recognition and is really looking to push fashion. So how would you articulate your competitive advantages in that context, since a lot of our research shows the majority of Americans shop at Amazon?","The other major question I had is speed. You speak about speed a lot quite insightfully, and you have, over a number of quarters just \u2013 what needs to happen in the organization, and how would you dissect speed in terms of where you think you should go versus now and the capabilities or the changes that the organization needs to undertake to really aggressively tackle speed, whether that be fulfillment or procurement? Thank you.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, Oliver, that was a mouthful. So, let me take on a couple of what you said. Let me just say that I think that with respect to the competition, let's talk about, I think, what \u2013 there's aspects of the department store that is as relevant today as ever. And I think it's not a question of what we deliver. It's really how we deliver. So this idea about great products at affordable prices, I think that we have \u2013 there's many brands that we can control our own destiny. And, certainly, when you get into the exclusivity, that isn't going to be in the competition. And if that's customer-wanted and we can make those a bigger piece of our business, we can win. So, there is \u2013 that's how we are focused. And I gave some detail about that, about the way we were approaching our partners with either capsule or exclusive brands or what we were taking on for ourselves.","I think that where we intersect as an omni-channel retailer versus where a pure play would be is really the nexus of store, and the kind of the social experience of being in a store. What we're playing with right now is what does a model store have to be for the future that is in a pop mall, and what does it have to be in another door? So, we're playing with that. We hope that we will have, by the end of 2018, a scalable model that really addresses the experience needs of our stores that we can scale to more in the future.","And then the other piece that we are going to be really amplifying is the role of the store in the community. And there's opportunity for us to be a bigger part of the community. The community basically is reaching out to us and we to them. They want us to be there. This opportunity of volunteerism and all of our engagement and our events and our opportunity to bring the community into our stores for richer experiences is how we believe that we can win. So it's really products, experience, it's community and store, while staying very aggressive with digital.","We use digital right now. A lot of customers are using digital to browse, and then the opportunity to take some of that demand and move it into the store through BOPS or Buy Online Pickup in Store is another way that we are going to be taking the advantages that we have of the digital customer and moving them into the store by making it advantageous for them to do so. So, that's how we're focused on that.","Another part of your question was about speed. I think, we're \u2013 that's one of the biggest mandates of the company right now. The thing about speed for us is making sure that everybody is crystal clear about the five priorities of the company, and what is their role to lift the strategy. So, we have spent a lot of time in making sure that everybody is clear on the Macy's strategy and what's their role, and then what are the impediments or roadblocks that's getting in the way of those individuals to lift the strategy in their particular role? So, we've spent time on reducing process. We've obviously in the beginning of the year, we reduced a couple of management layers. That is helping us. But, we know we need to move faster. We know we need to move at the speed of the customer. And we know we've been slow in the past on this. So I think that, culturally, us getting faster and fleeter and pushing the decisions closer to the customer is going to be how we're going to succeed. So that is a huge priority for me.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, Jeff, and just a follow-up, regarding Backstage. The market research clearly indicates it's a nice opportunity, but a question we receive is regarding vendors, and it's a different kind of process in terms of how you talk to vendors within an off-price concept versus full price. Can you brief us on the dynamics there and why this will be a good long-term path, and if there's differences we should be aware of, and how you're competitively positioned, given that uniqueness, and also given the uniqueness of the planning and supply chain in the off-price model versus full price?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, Oliver, as you know, that if we were approaching the off-price opportunity with the department store headset, I don't think we would be as excited about it and I don't think we would ultimately win. So, we have a separate team that is focused on off-price, that is working with our vendors. The bulk of that team basically came from the off-price world, and we really have segmented them as a piece of the company, giving them the resources that they need to really develop that on their own for the needs of that customer.","As it's intersected with Backstage being in store, we're now looking at all of those where a customer traverses between a full price and an off-price business. We're making sure that we're comprehending those influences and what it might mean in cannibalization. What it might mean in value. What it might mean in terms of classification penetration. And what it might mean in terms of new businesses that we need to put into the building. And so far all of that is going well.","So, I would tell you that we're getting encouraging signs with this. The teams are finding the vendors that are very different from the vendor matrix that Macy's is dealing with. And we're going to continue to support them. So, it's way too early for us to declare victory on this. But at the end of the day, we do hope that we will be \u2013 we will have a viable off-price concept that is on-mall. It takes advantage of a, still, a destination that millions of American consumers come to each and every day. They come to a Macy's. Now they can come and there's a viable off-price concept, we think that could be a competitive advantage for us in that most of our ferocious off-price competitors are off-mall right now. So, we have a lot to learn. We don't have hubris on this. We are really looking at who the talent is that can help us with this. We think we've got a lot of that on our team right now, but we're still in the learning stages.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you. Looking forward to the investor day and appreciate the comments.","Operator","Moving next to Todd Duvick from Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Hi, Todd.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Karen, I'm trying to get a sense for what we should expect on the debt reduction front. You paid down some debt in the first quarter, and I believe you previously outlined a plan to pay off the $300 million note that matures in July using cash on hand?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","That's correct.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. So, for debt reduction beyond this, should we primarily expect debt reduction after the holidays, when you generate the majority of your cash? Or are there some larger real estate deals that could result in further debt pay down opportunities?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes and yes. Honestly, we're not commenting on specific timing. But, as we've said, debt reduction is an important priority for this year.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Brett Levy from Loop Capital, your line is open.","Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys, most of the questions have been answered. Just, I mean, in terms of speed, I mean, have you ever just thought of taking the top three floors of every single store and either selling it or sale lease backing it or something like that? And I'm just kind of getting ahead of a trend.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, let me answer it this way. First off, most of our stores are less than three stories, so I'm not sure the question is exactly right. But, I think what you're saying is, should we be shrinking all of our stores? In some cases that may be the opportunity, and as Jeff said, we've put Backstage into many of these less productive doors. So it is, in essence, using the real estate differently. So, part of our real estate strategy is, in fact, looking for opportunities where perhaps a real estate value is greater than the retail and it may involve shrinking other stores, for example, like we've done with Seattle, with downtown Chicago, in terms of the marketing of where we're heading. In other situations we closed the stores, like Downtown Minneapolis or Pittsburgh. So, there's not one answer. But I think we are trying to be realistic in terms of looking at the retail square footage and how to maximize the real estate value.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","The other piece of it is...","Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets LLC","What are the usual alternative uses; is it residential, is it other commercial, I mean, I think that this sort of a picture of an uber environment of retail space kind of having a lot of residential and a whole bunch of small retail space and that sort of thing, is there....","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Again, you have to split it between the very few but big urban stores that we have like Seattle where we're putting office space above our stores. But in terms of our malls, the usage is completely different. I mean, square footage is more limited. Similarly with State Street, we're hoping to do the office space as well, but most of our stores that are mall-based, the square footage that would be freed up is a lot smaller in most cases, and the uses would be different.","Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets LLC","The last question is, in terms of the Internet or website-based business you're doing, are you feeling like your price points are truly the lowest price points when people actually go to the Internet to search?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I think it depends on what category you're in. I think that we're under what we communicated in terms of the housewares category is one that is really being footballed around right now on the net and we are obviously dropping our prices to be competitive. We don't want to have like products that are more expensive online or in our stores than our competitors. So that is why we have really pushed to make sure that we're getting customers' value and we're really focused on exclusivity because we think we can give them exclusivity and give them great value, but not have the same demands of pricing transparency that we do in those things that are more broadly distributed.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Also, as a promotional business, there are days where our prices are perhaps not competitive, if competitor X is on sale and we're not, but when we're on sale, we try hard to be as competitive as we can be.","Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Omar Saad from Evercore ISI, your line is open.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Good morning.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask maybe a little bit more color around the idea of what you're doing in the Seattle location, keeping some of the store for yourself and monetizing part of the store. How do we think about how that space is going to change? Are you getting out of certain categories in a location like that? Are you going to kind of basically shrink the footprint of each of the categories? That will be really interesting to hear more details around that, how you are thinking about it at least? Thanks.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","So, I think Seattle is a great case, because we can actually not only shrink, but also add categories into that store. So it's still a very big overall square footage on the three floors that will remain, which will be the lower level, 1, and 2. And it gives us the opportunity to take where we had low dollars per square feet and where we frankly had excess inventory in categories that we didn't need, to be able to size that appropriately, and also open up spaces to be able to add new ideas, new brands, new categories.","So I think Seattle is a great example of where we can be much more efficient and get more productive. Obviously, when you are more productive in your square footage, your sales associates show up, your management is able to manage that better, your customers are navigating it with more ease, so any time we're downsizing a store, unless the customer is telling us on that trade area that they don't want a category, we're looking to retain it. And in most cases, we're looking to add ideas, and we're doing that either through owned categories or through what we negotiate with our leased partners, that give us new ideas that, as an economic model, that is very attractive to us.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got it. That's helpful. And then if I could ask one follow-up. As we think about the store closures and picking up some of that customer traffic and spend in the remaining locations, are you seeing signs in your credit card and loyalty program data that you can migrate those customers to some of the existing locations or online, or how do you use that data, and that customer relationship that you already have there, to make sure you kind of capture as much of that lost revenue as possible?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, one of the things we've done over the last couple of years as we've seen a higher number of store closings coming is that we, in fact, did take that data to help us both market to the customer, but also plan and assort the stores so that if the customer is in a store that was being closed, liked a particular vendor that may or may not have been in a nearby store, our planning organization was able to bring that vendor into the nearby store. So, if you had gone back four or five years ago, we were not retaining customers or sales to the degree that we are today, but by utilizing the data, both from a marketing perspective but also, frankly as importantly from an assortment perspective, has made a huge difference.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then if I could sneak one last one in, on the new marketing strategy with the new personnel, you have their leadership to move away from more of a promotional marketing strategy to more around your product and fashion offering and capabilities. Do you expect to change the promotional cadence in the business as a result of it, or just the way you message it to consumers through marketing and advertising?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","We will forever be a promotional department store. So I don't want anybody to say that we're going to reduce the amount of promotiality (1:07:13) of this business. I don't think we'll ever see that in any of our lifetimes, but it is going to change the messaging and in some cases, we over communicate in a certain promotion. So we don't expect to reduce the promotional nature of the business. This is really going to be reallocating how we spend and how we talk to the customer, so that each communication is actually read and can be more effective, so don't read this as being less promotional.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thank you. Thanks for all the information.","Operator","We'll move next to Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks so much for taking our question. Just a couple of quick ones on \u2013 I'm thinking about the year here, on the inventory plan, can you just comment on how you're thinking about inventories in the fall, maybe in terms of units. And then, I just want to clarify something you said (1:08:08), Karen. So the stores that were closed in the quarter were not in the operations reported for the first quarter, so I believe those would be a net negative to the continuing operations, since they probably drew some attention away from the ongoing stores with an inventory liquidation sale.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, let me answer the first one while I think about the second. So in terms of inventory, as we get through the year, I think you're going to see the inventory relative to last year come down a bit as we go through the year. I can't comment on units, but in terms of dollars, that would be the case.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I think that our hope is that, as we get through the first quarter, not having these stores in the going-out-of-business mode will help our business. I think that's what you said, but I'm not completely sure. But it should help our business as we go forward.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So maybe a bit of a distraction first quarter (1:08:56). Then, I guess, if we could just kind of think about the, I'm kind of focused on the transactions number here. I know we talked about this in the quarter at one point, but when we look at the stacks on the transactions, that seems to be the area that needs the most urgent attention. In very simple terms, as you look at the basket of initiatives that you laid out that sound like \u2013 many of them sound like it would be very compelling to your customer in particular. Do you think, as those roll out through the year, the combination of those are enough to push traffic significantly \u2013 or transaction growth significantly better than what we've seen on a one-year, two-year basis in the first quarter?","And then, I guess just more broadly, if we look at some of your strategies, again, they sound like they'll resonate with your consumer, but there is only probably so much you can do with the foot fall at the malls where it's at. Can you maybe discuss your conversations with the REITs and what they sound like today, what they think about the urgency of the traffic situation, and any good ideas you hear that could help maybe from the broader mall?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah. I mean look, we expect the number of transactions to improve. I don't want to get into a debate as to what significantly means, but we do expect improvement as we go through the year, and we're also hoping for help on the AUR, as Jeff has been talking about. But again, all of that is in the mix of our guidance for the year. And I think we and the developers are trying to partner more and more in making our stores and our malls better, and so, not only attract more people, but to have them buy more when they're there. So it's really a combined effort there. And that's part of why Jeff talked about some of the things we're doing to make our stores more interesting, more exciting.","And some of it is with services. One of the reasons we like Bluemercury so much are the spa services that they provide. So we are working very hard to think about how to drive customers into our store, but also how to convert them. One of the things, for example, we're focused on is making checkout easier, so that customers can get in and get out. One of the things \u2013 I think I have talked about this on an earlier call \u2013 that we tested last year that was a huge and somewhat surprising success, which is that, when we originally started the Buy Online Pickup in Store, we put it, as you might imagine retailers would, in the second floor in a corner so that you'd have to walk through the store to get there and hopefully buy along the way. We experimented with moving the Buy Online Pickup in Store right at a parking lot door to make it easier for the customer to buy. Obviously, great for customer service, but what was interesting is, our radiated sales went up significantly. And again, because we made it easier for her to run her errands, and then she felt better about us and bought more.","So other things like that we're doing, which will help us convert business more while they're in the store. So, long way of saying, yes, we are doing everything we can with our partners to make our stores in malls better.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Can I sneak one more in on the model? I know you guys have been very generous with your time. But on the gross margins in the quarter, I think historically, we've been very surprised how stable your gross margins have been, even in some of the toughest quarters you've had. The 100 basis points of transaction, in your mind (1:12:13), are those just the specific categories you called out that came under pressure in the quarter versus historic levels? Is there something more structural in the composition of mix of the inventory today that changes how we should think about gross margin into the future?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No, I think the bigger part of it related to what I said about the inventory level and not only level but content going into the year combined with the weak February. Had February been stronger, we would have been able to clear a lot more of those goods at a better margin. So the combination of the content and the quantity of the inventory at yearend combined with the weak February is a big reason for that 100 basis point decline.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Good morning.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to ask on the handbag category which you called out as underperforming, overall revenue, it's been a category that's been under some pressure. But is there any color you can give us on sort of sequentially whether you're seeing any signs of life there, and if you expect to see some improvement there across the year against easier comparisons?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I'd say Lindsay, it's meeting expectations, so I think we saw the run rate of what it looked like all through 2016, and that's how we planned it. So what you see on this is, is that our supply is in line with demand. And it's less promotional than it was in the past, that is really the goals of our manufacturing partners as well as what makes sense for our customer. And so that's what we're seeing. So that's how I'd comment on it. Whether or not that continues, I think we've got it planned right for the balance of the year.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry, Jeff, just to clarify, you had planned it down consistent with 2016, and that's what you're seeing?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","What I'm saying is that based on 2016 we planned it as we saw it for 2017, and that's how it is playing out. I'm not commenting that the rate of what we planned it out in 2017 was the same as what we had in 2016.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, okay. I think it was the last caller, maybe one before, you had talked about addressing your coupon strategy and maybe making some changes there. I was curious if you had an update for us?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","We'll have an update for you at the investor meeting in June.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just one last one for me. The credit penetration rate in the stores that you closed, we had assumed that the credit penetration rate in those stores because less productive stores was lower. Is that the right way to think about it, was the percentage of sales done on credit in the closed stores lower than the fleet that remains?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I would not think about it that way, no.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Brian Callen from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Karen. Just a follow up on the debt reduction. Is the open market strategy what we should expect for the balance of the year and then I guess knowing that you repurchased the 2037s was helpful color. Can you talk about that decision in terms of looking at high coupon versus low dollar bonds going forward?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I'm not going to comment on our strategy for repurchasing debt in terms of timing or how we're going to do that going forward. I will say that we're focused on NPV as we analyze these transactions, though, as our primary driver.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up on the mechanics of leverage given that's such a focus. I may have missed this. The D&A dropped in the quarter, so the guidance is unchanged on D&A. And then just given the store closures, is there a point in 2017 where we start to see rent expense begin to fall or is that really an 2018, 2019 type event in terms of the impact on leverage?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Honestly, I don't know the answer to the question. I have not looked at rent expense lately, but we can talk later.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your last caller in the queue for questions will be Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much for the question. I'll try to make them quick. Karen, one for you, just a follow-up on again the leverage question. As we think about your debt reduction beyond this year, to the extent that you do realize proceeds from real estate transactions, should we expect that to continue to go to debt reduction, particularly if EBITDA isn't as strong as you expect? And then just a second question is around some of the time that you've been able to take out of your supply chain with regards to private brands? Can you just provide a little bit more detail on sort of which specific brands you're seeing that in, and how broadly that initiative can be rolled out and the total amount of time that can be taken out? Thank you.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, on the leverage question, we're aiming for our target range, so that's really the only way I can answer that. We expect that the EBITDA to do what we expect it to do or hopefully better over time and should that not happen, we'll revisit that. But I think I would focus on leverage ratio getting back to the target range.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And then with respect to the supply chain, we really focused on \u2013 we started with the I.N.C, which is probably our biggest and our best female brand as well as the Alfani brand for women. I'm not going to answer the specific about how many weeks we took out, but it's measurable. In both of those brands we're now seeing the fruits of the sell-through by being much closer in and being able to react to consumer trends by getting those products, and we've done that through really working at the supplier chain as well as looking at embedded themes. So the rest of your question is how much of that do we see? We believe that what we're learning right now in I.N.C and Alfani we can take to all of our private brands and we've already started that work as well as take some of those learnings and work with our vendors who are creating exclusive products for us through their third-party wholesale model.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no additional callers in the queue. At this time I would like to thank everyone for their participation in today's conference.

Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Great, thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Macy's conference call, scheduled to discuss our second quarter earnings. As she said, I'm Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Joining me on the call today is Jeff Gennette, our CEO.","Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.MacysInc.com, beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for a discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.","Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today, due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.","On this morning's call, I will take you through our results for the second quarter and our outlook for the back half of the year. Jeff will provide some perspective. And then, we will both take your questions. So let's get started.","Our second quarter performance demonstrates that we are on track to produce sales and earnings consistent with our annual guidance that we provided at the beginning of the year and affirmed at our June Investor Meeting. As the quarter progressed, we saw sequential improvements and continued to gain confidence in our strategies. We believe we are on the right track to achieve our objectives.","Sales in the second quarter were $5.552 billion, down 5.4% from last year. Comparable sales on an owned plus licensed basis were down 2.5% versus last year. This is much improved relative to the first quarter and is also somewhat better than we expected when we started the quarter.","As I will discuss in a minute, both the base trend as well as the initiatives that we outlined at the Investor Meeting helped to improve our sales trend. This is in spite of weaker international tourist sales, which we did not anticipate. In the second quarter, international tourist sales were down approximately 9%, which was much worse than in the first quarter and negatively impacted our comp owned plus licensed sales in the second quarter by approximately 40 basis points.","At our Investor Meeting in June, you will recall that we estimated that our base trend for our comp owned plus licensed sales on an annual basis was in the minus 3% to minus 4% range. And to that trend, we expected that our strategic initiatives to contribute $200 million to $260 million of additional sales in the last nine months of the year.","The second quarter results would indicate that our base trend is towards the better end of that range. And we estimate that the strategies discussed at the meeting contributed approximately $60 million to our sales in the quarter, consistent with the expectation for the nine months. These strategies that we highlighted included retention from closed stores, Backstage in store and our key merchandising initiatives.","Let's talk for a minute about each. First, retained sales; we are capturing sales from closed stores consistent with our expectations and better than what we produced in prior years. Retained sales from the closed stores in total represented about 12% of the closed store sales. And, as we discussed in June, the retained sales in multi-store markets was much higher than that.","Backstage, our off-price offering, is adding approximately 6% in incremental sales to the 38 stores in which we now operate Backstage stores within our Macy's stores. We believe that this strategy, which offers simplified pricing, a treasure hunt environment and lower price points, is resonating with many of our customers and adding to the Macy's experience. We continue to test different approaches and monitor the results and expect to decide by year-end how best to expand this concept within our stores.","And the third, the key merchandising initiatives which we've highlight in June, shoes, fine jewelry and furniture, mattresses, are the third part of that initiative. The shoe pilot rollout is now complete. All locations now have a more edited assortment, with more depth in the styles that we carry. And all locations also received added staffing and varying degrees of technology, but there are variations in the strategy beyond this across our stores depending on the location. For example, approximately 170 locations now carry elevated product, more in line with what our customer wants in those locations. And in 68 other locations, we converted them to an open-sell format. Both of these variations are proving to be very successful where they have been executed, but neither would work well in all locations.","Our shoe business overall was up mid-single digits in the quarter. And remember, the rollout wasn't even complete until the end of July. We are also working to improve our digital experience for shoes, which will also help accelerate our sales trend.","In fine jewelry, we completed the rollout to the final locations, having started this rollout close to two years ago. Sales in fine jewelry were up double digits in the quarter, which is terrific news particularly where the strategy has been in place for more than a year. And furniture and mattresses, another focus business, also had strong sales in the quarter. We are adding or expanding 58 furniture and mattress departments in our Macy's stores across the country this year, about two-thirds of which have already been completed.","So, in total, these initiatives are all on track and helping to change our sales trend. And remember, these estimates don't include the benefit from the new marketing strategy starting in September and the enhanced loyalty program, which is being rolled out in time for the fourth quarter.","In addition to the strength of shoes, fine jewelry and furniture and mattresses, we also performed well in the quarter in fragrances, active apparel and men's tailored clothing. The weaker categories in the quarter included cosmetics and housewares. Our digital sales continued strong in the quarter with double-digit growth. This is the 32nd consecutive quarter when that has been the case. We are generating outsized sales growth in particular on our mobile devices. And they are also being used increasingly to enhance our in-store experiences.","For example, a customer can scan an item on our mobile app while in store to see pricing, availability and any product reviews. They could also then buy the item straight from the app and have it shipped. Also, customers can access a myriad of features specific to an individual store on our mobile app, including a directory, special events, et cetera.","Geographically, regional trends were consistent across the country. Bloomingdale's also had a stronger performance in the second quarter relative to the first, in stores, digital, as well as in our outlets. During the second quarter, the number of transactions was down 5.5%, much improved from the 7.5% decline in the first quarter. Average unit retail was up 1.2%, with units per transaction up 1.8% in the second quarter. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 40.3%, down 60 basis points versus last year, better than anticipated, largely because of the stronger sales.","At the end of the second quarter, our inventory was down 3% on a comp basis. This positions us well for the back half of the year. SG&A in the quarter was $1.934 billion, down $92 million or 4.5% lower than last year. The SG&A includes $43 million of real estate asset sale gains this year versus $21 million last year. Excluding these asset sale gains, the reduction of SG&A in the quarter was $70 million, or 3.4%. This reduction is due to closed stores and the restructuring completed at the start of the year, partially offset from some timing shifts from the first quarter and our investments in digital growth.","Income from credit in the quarter was $183 million, which is $2 million higher than last year. Remember, this relates to income from Citi, our partner in the business and doesn't include all the expenses associated with the credit operation, such as charges associated with fraudulent purchases and the cost of new account origination.","For the first half of the year, SG&A excluding real estate asset sale gains was $170 million below last year, which is consistent with the net $300 million annual reduction commitment we made earlier this year. As a reminder, it was a $550 million SG&A reduction which we expected to offset with $250 million of reinvestment into the business.","As you know, we recognize the need to continuously find ways to conduct our business more cost-effectively and smarter. We will continue to make changes that free-up resources to invest in making our company more successful. These investments in digital and in our stores are necessary if we are to compete more effectively.","Operating income in the quarter was $305 million, excluding $51 million of non-cash retirement plan settlement charges. Interest expense in the quarter was $79 million excluding the net premiums and expenses associated with the early retirement of debt.","We have reduced our debt by approximately $550 million in the first half of this year, including the repayment of a $300 million maturity in July and the repurchase of approximately $247 million in the open market.","Tax expense was $64 million in the second quarter, with an effective tax rate of 36.2%. Net income was $116 million after adjusting for the net loss attributable to the non-controlling interest in our China joint venture. Excluding the retirement plan settlement charges and the net benefit associated with the early retirement of debt, net income was $146 million in the quarter.","Diluted share count in the quarter was 306.5 million shares, with earnings per share on a diluted basis being $0.38 in the quarter as compared to $0.03 last year. Remember, that last year in the quarter, we booked $249 million in impairments and other costs, primarily related to our decision to close approximately 100 doors, of which 70 have already closed or are announced to be closed. As we said last year, our intent was to look out a few years in deciding how many to close. And we are still planning to close the remaining approximately 30 locations.","We also booked $6 million of settlement charges last year in the second quarter. So excluding the quarterly settlement charges in both years, the net premiums and expense associated with the debt repurchases in the quarter this year and the impairment and other charges last year, earnings per share on a diluted basis were $0.48 this year, as compared to $0.54 last year.","Cash flow from operations net of investing activities was $323 million this year, as compared to $222 million last year, an increase of approximately $101 million. The major variances related to the decrease in inventory, lower CapEx and higher asset sales this year as compared to last year.","So the key message is that the second quarter was as expected and keeps us on track to achieve our annual guidance of comp sales of minus 2% to minus 3% on an owned plus licensed basis and diluted earnings per share of $3.37 to $3.62, excluding the impact of non-cash retirement plan settlement charges and any net premiums and expenses associated with debt repurchases.","Further excluding the gain on the Union Square Men's store, which is expected to be booked in the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share is still expected to be $2.90 to $3.15. Let me provide some color on what this means for our assumptions for our performance over the next six months. One, comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis in the fall season are assumed to be down 0.8% to down 0.6%, which would result in the annual guidance range of the minus 2% to minus 3% on that basis.","We are assuming that comp owned plus licensed sales in the third quarter would decline by approximately 2.5%, or slightly worse. Remember, that 2017 is a 53-week year, meaning fiscal January has a fifth week. Our total sales include the sales for this extra week, whereas our comp sales do not. For the year, this adds approximately 100 to 120 basis points to our total sales growth rate.","The annual gross margin rate is now expected to be between down 50 to down 70 basis points relative to last year, with the fall expected to be down 20 to down 50 basis points relative to last year. This is 10 basis points on the annual guidance better than what we had guided in June, because the second quarter beat our expectations.","We are expecting SG&A, excluding asset sale gains, to be down in dollars approximately 3% to 4%, versus last year in the fall season. Achieving a 3% reduction, combined with the results from the first half of the year, would be consistent with the $300 million annual commitment made at the start of the year.","We provided guidance in February for the book asset sale gains expected to be booked this year. You'll recall that the guidance at that time included the following: approximately $235 million associated with the sale of our Union Square Men's store that was sold last year. And the guidance included approximately $180 million to $200 million of additional gains, split between Brooklyn at approximately $100 million and $80 million to $100 million associated with the sale of other property.","Our assumption for the Union Square gain remains unchanged. However, as we said in June, we expect now that the other asset sale gains will be higher. The asset sale gains, excluding the Union Square Men's gain, are now estimated to be approximately $275 million to $300 million instead of the $180 million to $200 million of gains that we had estimated in February.","Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $350 million, excluding the net impact of any premiums or expenses associated with debt repurchases. This is lower than our original guidance, due to the earlier-than-assumed repurchase of debt. We are still assuming an annual effective tax rate of approximately 37%. And we are still expecting our capital expenditures to be approximately $900 million for the full year.","So those are some of our key assumptions supporting our earnings guidance. Let me now give you an update on real estate. While we continue to work very hard on maximizing the opportunities, there is not a lot new since our Investor Meeting in June. We are executing as fast as is reasonable our multi-pronged approach, as we have discussed previously. As you heard, with our higher guidance for asset sales gains this year, we are making significant progress in monetizing assets. As for the flagships, the marketing process is well underway for the upper floors of State Street in Chicago, and we hope to have an update by when we next report earnings. And the work on Herald Square continues. As you know, this is a very complicated and strategically-important asset. It will, therefore, take time to develop the best plan for this location.","As you might imagine, we are being very thoughtful in our approach to this location. And the work with Brookfield is also ongoing. They have performed a great deal of predevelopment analysis this year. Remember, our strategic alliance includes approximately 50 properties, which are intended to be representative of our total portfolio. They are studying each of these to see if the initial redevelopment opportunities merit proceeding.","Remember, most of these assets are related to strategic locations where we plan to continue to operate as Macy's. The intent is to create value and to improve the retail location. The preliminary work would indicate that it is likely that Brookfield will recommend proceeding on roughly two-thirds of these.","This development process takes a lot of time, but rest assured that we, and the dedicated Macy's team at Brookfield, are putting a high priority on bringing these projects to fruition and are making progress against our original goal for the strategic alliance of creating value from our real estate with little disruption to our retail operations.","With that, let me turn it over to Jeff for brief remarks, and then we'll open the line for your question.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everybody. So, as Karen noted, the second quarter came in as we expected, and we are on track for delivering the full year guidance. Since we provided a fair amount of detail on our strategy at the Investor Meeting on June 6, my remarks today are going be brief, but I do want to add some perspective.","So while we have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm encouraged by what we're starting to see. We're starting to get traction on some of our early initiatives. In particular, I'm very proud of the work that the women's shoe and fine jewelry teams did as they completed the new model rollouts across all of our stores and they did this at an accelerated pace. As you heard from Karen, this is having a positive effect on our results. And it's a great example of the benefits that Macy's gets when we test, when we iterate, and then when we scale nationally, each step along the way driven by data and the consumer analytics.","Now Backstage in store also continues to perform well, giving the full store a decent lift. The Backstage team is in the iterate phase right now, and we expect to have a model ready for rollout by the end of this year. And consistent with our vision of letting customers shop the way she lives, we remain focused on our goal of stabilizing the brick-and-mortar stores, while investing for accelerated growth in digital and mobile.","We're also excited about the launch of our new marketing strategy in September and our new loyalty program in October. Both of these are on track and we expect will help our sales trend as we move through the back half of the year. So I'm encouraged by the second quarter and we're on track for the year.","But I also know that we operate in an environment of intense and disruptive competition, and that our customer has more shopping options than ever, and we need to provide her with a compelling and a unique proposition. So winning in this environment requires us to act with a great sense of urgency to make changes in how we operate and to move faster. And as we do this, I am confident that Macy's will win again.","So with that, we're going to open up the line and Karen and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So as we think about your back half same-store sales guidance, I guess how would you rank the drivers of improvement as we think about the overall back half, but more so, the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? And with that, what's the expectation for traffic versus what you saw in the second quarter down mid-singles?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, Matt. I think it's going to be the traffic is going be pretty consistent with what we experienced in the second quarter. I think the initiatives and kind of ranking them, certainly, fine jewelry and what we're experiencing in women's shoes, big ticket, fragrance, some of the plays that we have in apparel in the classifications business like dresses, we expect to be a significant piece of the trend's improvement as we get into the back half of the year.","I think we expect that the new marketing strategy, we haven't really accorded additional sales to that, but we think we're going to pique a lot of interest from our core customer. And we're also anticipating, although we don't know what it is yet, about how the new marketing or the loyalty program will affect our business.","So I think within the initiatives that you've seen from us, expect those to become more important in the back half of the year. We're also going learn a great deal in Backstage in store, more for us to learn on what we will scale into 2018 and beyond. But we expect to get more clarity on that as we get into the fourth quarter.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow up, with inventory now reset exiting the second quarter, I guess how best to think about merchandise margins in the back half of the year and is the primary drag on overall gross margins, is it just the continued mix shift towards e-commerce, just any ways to offset this over time?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, let me start and then Jeff can add to that. I think there are certain businesses that are under pressure in terms of the gross margin. We talked about beauty in the past and that continues to be the case. And so, again, over time, we hope that we can offset that. But at this point for this fall, we don't think that that's likely and so, hence, our guidance being below last year.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I think the other thing, Matt, is that we're in a good position right now with our overall inventory level. We're set up well for the sales that are ahead of us. Our liquidity is in good shape. But what Karen said about beauty, there's also just some mix changes, as we talked about in the Investor Meeting, with tech watches at a lower margin rate than the balance of watches. And then really, the housewares category is under pressure with all the price transparency. So I think we're in good shape in inventory, but we do still have those businesses that are weighing down our margins from where they were last year.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck, guys.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Paul Lejuez from Citibank.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Hey, thanks, guys. Can you talk about the outlook for the credit card, the profit that you'll see there in the second half of 2017, just any changes that you might be seeing in the portfolio?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","No. In February, we had talked about credit income for the year of $740 million to $760 million, which was up a little bit from last year and that would continue to be our guidance.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Got you. And then, you made a comment about Brookfield, I think, wanting to move forward or you were expecting them to want to move forward on two-thirds of the 50 properties. What happens to the other third?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","The truth is I haven't looked at the specifics, but, in most cases, sort of no harm, no foul. These were just sort of excess real estate that we had that we were trying to prioritize where we could create value from them and so if something doesn't have a lot of value, we'll just leave it alone for now, maybe explore it down the road. But we're trying to prioritize the opportunities where we can create the most value.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Got you. And then, just finally, any color you can add on performance in California, Texas, Florida specifically? Thanks, Karen.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah. No, our sales performance, as I said, was fairly consistent geographically. So I would say fine across the country, including those regions.","Paul Lejuez - Citi","Good. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Grom from Gordon Haskett.","Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Thanks. Just on the down 2.8% comp, Karen, can you shed any perspective on how that trended during the quarter and any early read on back-to-school and particularly in some of your southern markets?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, as I said, it sequentially improved as we went through the quarter in terms of comp. I'll let Jeff comment on back-to-school.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","On back-to-school, good signs so far. There's a lot of good trends that are going on in the business. Charles, to your comment or question about we're not seeing any differences really between how the southern stores are, outside of the fact that many of them have gone back to school. And so you're seeing some lifts there that are encouraging for where stores go later around the east coast or in the northern states, but we expect they will all even out when the calendar is evened out.","Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, that's helpful. And then, on the store closure front, are you able to quantify what the benefit was in the second quarter? And then, when we look at the fourth quarter, it's a pretty big uptick to get to that down 60 to 80 basis points in the fall season against the tougher compares. Is it the expectation that the benefit from the store closing will increase in the fourth quarter?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I'm confused. So the store closing benefit on sales, I had said was about 12%. And at the Analyst Meeting, as we talked in June and we talked about the benefit from the stores being closed, we are on track for that number, which was $75 million to $100 million. So we got the second quarter portion of that, and we expect to be in that range as we get through the remainder of the year.","Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I think your second question related to gross margin rate, Chuck, but I'm not sure I understand it.","Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","No, just on the fourth quarter, just to get to the fall season comp guidance, it's a pretty big uptick against a tougher comparison. So I'm just trying to understand what the specific drivers are to get there.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, let me start for a second. As we gave guidance, we gave guidance for the fall, which is in the range of down 0.8% to down 2.6%. We said that the third quarter would be around the 2.5% from the second quarter, maybe a little bit worse. So, again, depending on what you think about the fall in total, you'd get to a fourth quarter that most likely would be improved. You know, again, depending on what you think or how you model it; if you're more conservative about the fourth quarter, you'd be presumably at the lower end of what we're guiding.","Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay. I got you. And then, just on a more favorable note, just on the Backstage lift of 6%. That's pretty impressive. How quickly do you think you could roll that out across the chain? And what's the target number of potential stores you could roll that out to?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","What we're testing right now, Charles, is we're looking at Backstage products in virtually all of our doors. So we've got 37 doors right now that have got the Backstage within a Macy's store. But we're also look at Backstage product in those doors that would never get a Backstage-dedicated location.","So we're testing different formats. The intent would be that we would have a scalable model that would work in all those doors that have available square feet where the dollars per square feet are such that you could open up a cavity of 20,000 to 25,000 square feet, but then we're also testing doors that are very productive for us that benefit from having really tasty designer values with Backstage pricing that we would be able to have that a model by which we put them into our strategic doors.","So we're also working on the capital costs. We're getting the capital cost down in those stores that would have a dedicated Backstage within a Macy's building and looking at the ROIs on those. So we've got four models out there testing. We hope to have two of those four ready to go in 2018 and beyond. Number of doors, we're still in the early innings of this. Let us get through the next six months, and then we'll have more clarity for you in a future call.","Charles Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Okay, great. And thanks for all the modeling color, Karen.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Just a few quick ones, and I apologize if I've missed this in your earlier remarks, just wanted to get some clarity on how Bloomingdale's performed in the quarter. Also, if you could just speak to owned brands and their performance and also, Jeff, if you can maybe just touch quickly also on Bluemercury and the rollout there, and just what you're learning from that acquisition, and how that might play a role in future strategy?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Well, let me take each of your questions. Bloomingdale's, number one; they experienced a similar improvement in second quarter from first quarter, as the Macy's brand did. And many of their initiatives, they're getting great traction on.","Amongst them really brings up your second question, which is what they're doing with their exclusive product or their private brands. Their 100% Bloomingdale's initiative is really popular with the consumer. And the more they're putting into that bucket, they've got very strong merchants that are working with their brand partners and the customers are really liking those choices.","The private brands on the Macy's side, we're in good shape there. As we talked about in the Investor Meeting, we've spent a lot of time on supply chain working a reduced number of suppliers, reducing number of weeks of production and really focusing on regular price and first markdown sell-through, making bigger brands bigger, working on more fashion that we get into most doors. And of our portfolio of 20-some private brands, we've got action strategies for each of those, and we're on track there.","And your last question about Bluemercury, we're very happy right now with the way the Bluemercury business is going. And we're looking, obviously, at their comps and what they do in their free-standing comps, and they're doing quite well there; so doors that have been open, obviously, more than a year, very strong comps. Their new stores are performing particularly well. We're making good real estate decisions. We're going into markets.","One of the things that we've learned in Bluemercury is the more locations you put into a DMA, the more it feeds on the success of that DMA. And so you're seeing that in the Island of Manhattan about how many Bluemercury's we can put into that, and it's doing great. You see where we really started that strategy was really in the Washington, D.C. metro area. So Bluemercury, there's lots of opportunities for free-standing stores, and there's also then Bluemercury within Macy's stores.","So one of the reasons we were very interested in the acquisition was what it could do as a beauty spa model in Macy's stores, and we're working through all of that. We're iterating on all of our early learnings on that, and the hope is, is that we're going to have an actionable model to scale into a lot more Macy's stores in the future.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's very helpful color. Thank you. And then, just another quick clarification, just, Karen, could you just circle back on the real estate gains expected for this year, and just how the thought process has changed at all, just given where you all are year-to-date?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","The thought process has not changed at all. We've just been able to make more progress relating to the monetization of some of the assets than we had expected to be able to complete this year. So the guidance had been $180 million to $200 million between Brooklyn and the other asset sales, and now we're taking it up to $275 million to $300 million.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Randy Konik from Jefferies.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, great. Thanks a lot. Just a couple of quick ones, just on thinking about the Analyst Day, you gave us some metrics about the sales lift from Backstage? I believe it was up 6.4% in 2017 versus 4.6% in 2016. Could we get some kind of color on do you think that continues to further accelerate in terms of lift in the back part of the year? That's number one.","I guess, second, when you think about giving us, again, back to the Analyst Day, the customer segmentation of about, let's say, 10% of the customers, those best customers, account for 50% of the revenues, thereabouts. And then, you have the balance of the customers accounting for a half, or something like that, effect. How do you think about the marketing strategy in the back half in terms of going after the best customers to retain them and have them shop more and higher average dollar sale versus activate some of the less good customers to drive incremental traffic in the back half of the year? Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Let me start on the Backstage and then I'll let Jeff respond in terms of the customer and the marketing strategy. At the Investor Day, we had talked about expecting a lift from Backstage in store of 4.5 points to 7 points, so the 6 points that we talked about for the second quarter is towards the upper end. And our hope is that as we go through the year that will build. And, as Jeff said at the meeting, while I was assuming 4.5 points to 7 points, he's pushing for 10 points, but, at this point, I think the 4.5 points to 7 points and, again, the higher end of that is what happened in the second quarter, would be what I would assume.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And the only thing I'd add on that before I talk about customer is much of the work as we're doing on the Backstage portion of the store, when we add that experience into a building, we're spending as much time on what we're doing on the full-price side. And the opportunity to lift the assortments there and really put more fashion in there, be more edited, more curated, and that combination is what we believe can lift the results beyond the 6% to 7% that we're getting today.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, remember, that 6% is the incremental including, so the Backstage less the impact to the main box. So, as Jeff said, as we're working on both pieces, the incremental could go even higher.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And then to your question about customer. So what we talked about in the Investor Meeting was exactly what you just quoted was that 10% of our customer base that's about half of our sales. And that really is what we have designed into for this loyalty program that we're going to be launching in the first week of October. So stay tuned on that. We're not ready to talk about the actual components of it, but it's launching. And it's tested very well with our best customers. We think all the things that she expects of Macy's and that she asked of Macy's or were places where she wanted in a loyalty program that she didn't get in our previous one, we have now solved to.","And then, to your other question about the balance of the customers, we're addressing that in different ways. We're looking at what our promotional strategy is going to be, simplifying our promotions, making sure we've got the right values in the very important fourth quarter. And making sure that that customer who comes to Macy's, either online or in our stores during the fourth quarter, that we are very compelling and we've got the right values and the right content. So we're very focused on that as well. But stay tuned on the loyalty program. That takes care of this top 10% and we're very hopeful that she votes as strongly as the focus groups did.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","So may I ask a follow-up?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Yes.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","So just on the allocation of marketing dollars, are you saying that the marketing for the top 10% customer will really be about highlighting the loyalty program? And then the balance of the customer base would be more about traditional kind of advertising techniques, while simplifying the promotional strategies, et cetera? I'm just curious. I'm really trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about back half allocation of marketing dollars between the two customer segments.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Let me just back up a bit and just say that when you look at the marketing strategy, we really wanted to reengineer the entire marketing machine at Macy's and it has a lot of moving parts as we look at the fall season. Number one, we're going to remain very promotional. And what we've spent a lot of time on is reducing the overlap of promotions, reducing the amount of overlap of discounts on top of each other. But we're doing that all the way through the back half and that really is a big focus of ours.","The other thing that we set out to do both for our core customer as well as our occasional customer is rebuilding our credibility as a fashion destination. So what you'll start to see with the new marketing strategy that launches in September, started with the back-to-school spots. It starts if you go onto Macys.com right now and you look at THE EDIT that really is a one-stop shop for all the hot trends, exclusives, newness. We also have our new fashion campaign that launches in the end of September that we're excited about.","So all of that is in this marketing machine. We've spent a lot of time with media weight (44:20) of really making sure that we're maximizing each of our both print and digital, all of our touchpoints. We talked about in the Investor Meeting what we were doing with television and how we're getting more production and weight out of fewer \u2013 as many spots, but spending less dollars to do that in order to fund these other opportunities. So I think the new marketing strategy that is coming up, the new loyalty program, that the core customer will be handled as well as the occasional customer.","Randal J. Konik - Jefferies LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brian Tunick from RBC.","Brian Jay Tunick - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. Two questions; I guess, one, just a little more color on the beauty side, I guess you're calling it out as a weak category, yet there's been a lot of notice on the promotional changes you're making in that category. So just wondering, as you try balance protecting your market share, how you're thinking about ongoing promotions if it continues to be weak? And the second question is on the tourist impact. We were just curious what kind of impact you're planning in the second half comp guidance? Thanks very much.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I'll take beauty, and then Karen will take on tourism. I think when you just look at the beauty strategy overall \u2013 let's go through the components. Fragrance was very good, positive comps. We expect that to continue. That's a big piece of our overall beauty business. What we're doing in Impulse are really in the color and treatment area, where you have the flexible format. We're getting that into a lot more doors. It's brand-agnostic. It's very flexible. You've got guides that are cross-trained across all of the brands. We're getting good traction with that. You're going to see that in a lot more doors.","Obviously, we just talked about Bluemercury and our success there and what we're looking to learn from with Bluemercury in store. And the idea about getting services into the Bluemercury format that is really, our customers are very wanted for experience in our main Macy's boxes. So the balance of the color and treatment business is really what we have yet to solve. We've got lots of tests in play. We've got new formats that are launching now that have been in place. We're working very closely with our beauty partners, and we hope that through the balance of the third and fourth quarters, that we're going to have a model that we're going to want to roll out into more stores in 2018 and beyond.","Do you want to take...?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Oh, I'm sorry. On the tourist impact, that's, in part, why you see a wide range in terms of the guidance for the fall. We were surprised by the second quarter and we're still analyzing whether we think that will continue. My guess is it very well could, based on what we know. But, again, that's part of the reason for the wide guidance range for the fall season.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask for, if you could provide a little bit more detail and color around the retained sales data point that you gave earlier. I assume you're getting a lot of that information from your loyalty and credit card data. Are you seeing any patterns in terms of which types of customers are staying with the Macy's brand as you close some of those stores or certain categories where you're seeing that sales retention? Any information there could be pretty insightful. Thanks.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yeah, honestly, I don't know all of those details. I do know that, as we had discussed, when we close a Macy's store in a single-store market, it has continued to negatively impact Macys.com sales, although by less than what it did a few years ago. But that's still a negative. And in the multi-store markets, as I said in June, it ranges from 15% to 40% of the sales that we can retain. And each one is somewhat of a different story, depending on how far away the retained store is, the one that didn't close, and also how similar the demographic is. So it's hard to be precise there.","But the good news is we are doing on the better end of what we had anticipated in those markets and better than what we did previously. My presumption is that it's the core customer that we're keeping as opposed to the occasional, but I am not versed in all of the details in terms of where we're retaining the sales by category. But the good news is we have been able to strategize looking at what people buy in the stores that we're closing and trying to make sure that we have that in nearby stores.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Karen.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti from UBS Investment Bank.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Karen, just a quick modeling question, as I think about what you're trying to tell us for the second half of the year on same-store sales. I think you said that if you were on the optimistic end of the guidance, it would leave room for positive same-store sales in the fourth quarter. And I think you answered one of the questions about just assuming the traffic levels we've seen here sticking around in the mid-single-digit negative area. I'm trying to think about, just given the last few years, how strange the fourth quarter is as far as promotional levels across the industry. I'm trying to figure out what you're trying to communicate to us gets better in the fourth quarter, if traffic stays at these levels, to get to the high end of that range.","I'm wondering if there's something perhaps that you know about how holiday worked in the stores that you guys have closed that will be a year-over-year mix benefit, or anything like that, that we might be missing.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, if I were modeling the fourth quarter, I don't think I would be modeling a positive comp. So you have to think of the balance of third and fourth quarter. If we do better in the third quarter, that would lead to the better end of comps. But we'd have to just start that in the third quarter. You'd have to beat what I'm saying in the third quarter to get to the better end of our guidance, is a different way of saying it. Now, it could happen in the fourth quarter, but I would not be modeling it that way, if I were you.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Go ahead.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Michael, the other thing that I'd say is that we expect the fourth quarter to be very promotional and we're going to have all of our fire power ready to go for that.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I guess some people have asked about the roll forward on gross margins, but if maybe I could just go back in time two months here and ask you, I think the second quarter gross margin was a lot more volatile than what you guys were thinking at the beginning of the year, and then even more volatile than you thought in June, when you told us it was going to be a lot lower when we met you in June, at down 100 [basis points]. It came in well above that. So clearly, it got better in June and July. Would you mind helping us think about what was so volatile intra-quarter that was a little harder for you to track perhaps?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, I think it's easier to forecast planned gross margin and the normal markdowns required in the business relative to our marketing strategy. When we're talking about clearing goods, remember, we had talked about the overage in inventory that we ended the year with, that we had hoped to get through the system in the first quarter and didn't. That's harder to predict how well that will sell and how fast you can, in essence, get it through the system. And I think that's the large part why you saw more volatility between June and the end of July.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could just end with one quick one on the jewelry strategy, obviously, you guys are very encouraged by what you're seeing there. As you roll that forward to the holiday with your numbers continuing to be up double digits in 2Q, how aggressive can you be with the jewelry strategy for the holiday, given the strength you've seen here? Is there anything we should keep an eye out for as we do our store checks through the second half of the year?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Hopefully, you're going to see it continue to do extremely well. And, obviously, it's one of our priority businesses, so we'll do all we can to strengthen it as we go through the holiday.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. Good morning.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Good morning.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Karen, I wanted to ask about the credit income. I think you mentioned credit income grew $2 million year-over-year. You noted it does not include new account opening expense and I think one other item. Could you just repeat that? And then, give us a sort of fulsome picture, if you could, on credit income including those items?","And then, Jeff, I just wanted to ask about the cosmetics business, if I could. I know you added a promotion or a couple of promotions, and are you finding that consumers are responding to that? And is it helping to improve market share or potentially stabilize that business? Thanks so much.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Yes. Starting on the credit side, the other item that I had mentioned was fraudulent transactions. And we don't quantify those amounts, but I just wanted to remind people that what we report relates to the Citibank income, as opposed to sort of the total profitability of credit. Credit penetration in the second quarter was approximately 46% or down 100 basis points. However, because people are paying slower, the balances were still quite high and enabled us to have the income that was $2 million above last year. So, obviously, as we go to roll out this loyalty program, we're hoping to have a big impact on what's happened in penetration during the spring season.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","And, Kimberly, I think just bridging what Karen just said about the loyalty program, I think that's the right answer with respect to cosmetics. So one of the things that we're most interested in seeing is how with the new loyalty program launched in October, how that affects our beauty customer. Because I think when you look at our competition, I give them some high marks on the loyalty programs that they have and I would say that ours was lacking. And so one of the things that we wanted to make sure was that the loyalty program we're launching in October gave us the foundation by which we could speak to the beauty customer with more authority. So, yeah, certainly, the promotions that we have done to respond to competition in cosmetics has worked. But I would rather solve that by getting additional value through a loyalty program and we're going to start to see the seeds of that in October.","Kimberly Conroy Greenberger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much, Jeff.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple questions, on the digital and the improvement in digital, can you talk about buy online, pick up in store penetration and ship from store, how that's trended within your digital business? And the second question I have is I think from the June meeting, there was some discussion around a move to get more exclusive merchandise. I was just wondering if there are any updates or anything you could talk to on successes that you've had in that initiative. Thank you.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Okay. Let me talk about BOPS, or buy online, pick up in store. So it really is three-pronged. The first one is making sure that you have a larger percent of your inventory in all of your doors that's congruent with demand that is online. And now, today, 25% of our entire digital demand could be satisfied in a door that is in the ZIP Code that is generating that online sale. And so that gives us huge fire power opportunity to convert that to a buy online pick up in store if that's what the customer would like to do. We love that because when they're in that store, they generally upsell about 25% of additional goods. The omnichannel customer is clearly a potent one when they buy in both channels, so all good things come from that. So the first thing was having the inventory availability to do that.","The second piece of it was making sure then that you have a function on your mobile app or online that gives the opportunity for a customer to see all the inventory in an easy way in the store that is near them. And it's really called Shop Your Store. So that has been in beta mode for us. We're ready to launch that. And that will give the customer a really quick and easy way to be able to see what their local store has in their size and their color.","And then, the third thing that we've worked on that will drive this penetration up through the back half of the year is changing the physical environment of the BOPS locations in our stores. And going from a tertiary location to a main number one entrance really put some assets against it, make sure that it is ready to go, that it's got staffing. And so all those three things give us confidence that our BOPS penetration will grow through the fall season and that it will be very customer wanted.","Ship from store, we're always looking at that last mile and the opportunity to have same-day delivery in more and more metro markets if a customer chooses to do that. Once again, the same thing that I talked about with the first prong about BOPS about having available inventory, the way that a customer is going to put together their order is the first step and we've done that well. And obviously, increasing functionality and making sure that we have the logistics infrastructure in more markets, we're checking all those boxes, so that gives us the option to be able to do that for the customer in the back half as well.","And then, I guess your question was about exclusives. They're working well. I think that Avec Les Filles by Joyce Azria was one that we launched about three months ago. And that is doing very well. We had the Anna Sui collection that is coming up for INC that launches in the fourth quarter that we have high hopes for. We have many others that are all part of the private brand arsenal. So what we told you in the Investor Meeting in June that we wanted to take the exclusivity quotient from 29% to 40% over time, we're on track with all of our work there with our private brands and our market partners.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Thank you, Bob.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I had two. First of all, handbags were not called out as an under-performing category this quarter. I was just hoping for an update on what you're seeing there. And then second, on the asset sale contribution to guidance, I just wanted to clarify. So you think that contribution from asset sale gains will be up. Are you expecting some offsetting factor somewhere else in the P&L, which is why you're not raising overall guidance? Or just help me understand the moving parts there. Thanks very much.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Well, no. If you think about it, when we talked in June, we had talked about the gross margin risk, which we quantified in that we had planned to offset that between SG&A and the asset sale gains. So all we're doing now is providing some color around that. And obviously, there's a lot of the year yet to come, but there's no other change. On handbags, Jeff may want to comment, but relative to last year, that business has still been tough, but it has stabilized and it's pretty much as we had expected. So that's why I wouldn't call it weak. When a business performs as we expected and it's stabilizing, that puts it into a different category.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, Jeff, any color that you have on what you're seeing in handbags?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Lindsay, it's as expected. So we're actually getting some green shoots in some of the regular price products and in some of the new brands that we're bringing in, but it's as expected. So it's not a strength, but I see good signs of life in that category.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Callen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Karen, nice progress on the debt reduction year-to-date. The premium on the debt repurchase was pretty modest again. Did you repurchase additional 2037s (61:19) or was it other notes?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","You know what? I don't have that in front of me. We'll call you back and give you that detail.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then in the outlook comments, you mentioned the debt repurchase occurred earlier than assumed for interest expense. I guess what drove this timing? And then...","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Just opportunities in the open market.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, do you maintain this sort of $100 million to $150 million pace in 3Q or should we assume that, I guess, the cash seasonality would affect what we see in the back half?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","I can't give you any forecasts on what the timing might be. It all depends on opportunity.","Brian Callen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brett Levy from Loop Capital.","Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. You said 10% of your customers account for 50% of your sales. On the off chance that maybe 5% of your customers account for 30% of your sales or 1% of your customers account for 20% of your sales, is it the possibility to make kind of Macy's like a full experience? Like you can get your glasses there, get your appliances there, there's a bar and a restaurant. You can get your pharmaceuticals there. And you know where I'm going just conceptually, is there any way of taking that 10% that accounts for 50% and even further focusing it and being kind of the one-stop shop?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I'll broaden your point that Macy's is a very flexible brand and when you think about the owned businesses that we have with the lease model that we have and the hybrid models that we have, we could be in more categories. We have high interest in taking care of the needs of our best customer. Be that 10%, 5% or 1% and the new loyalty program is really to address her.","The store experience and the stores owning those relationships with those individual customers, you can touch those customers that are so potent for our overall brand in ways through technology and customization, what we can do with our digital assets, in ways that we couldn't in the past. We're not ready to comment if that means the categories that you're talking about. But everything is on our radar screen. We're open to all opportunities. And the spirit of your question about our best customers, we want to be her one-stop shop. And we believe we can do better with her over time.","Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets LLC","And the follow-up is a simple one. Since maybe there's an extra floor, maybe you could sell her a condo there? I mean this is more of a Brookfield-related question maybe, but is there any priority being given to the top ten customers in terms of what you do with the extra real estate you'll potentially have as an asset?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","I broaden your point that the idea about us in looking at each of our assets because they're all unique, we have an opportunity to make sure that we're monetizing every one of these unique properties to make sure that we're maximizing shareholder value. So we're going to take great care in doing that.","Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kara Szafraniec from Northcoast Research.","Kara Szafraniec - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Good morning, guys. Quick question on the fine jewelry initiative, hoping maybe you can give us color on which categories of fine jewelry are performing best, maybe some average dollar value transaction color, and finally, how is the fine jewelry initiative impacting total jewelry margins?","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","What I'd say is that each of the categories with them, when you're talking a double-digit increase, everything is playing across the whole fine jewelry categories. But one particular note is really what's going on right now in diamonds. And a lot of that is because the strategy isn't just about product. It was also about environment. It was about salesmanship. It was about management. It was about training. It was about marketing. So when you look at that, our opportunity to sell better quality diamonds for someone who's starting their engagement journey with us, that was one of the places that we really wanted to make sure we were relevant.","So we put focus on that. We really built a lot around that and the rest is doing well for us. So what I'd say to you is that our efforts are really focused on the full jewelry customer, so it's not just in fine jewelry. It's also in bridge jewelry. It's also in fashion jewelry. It's in watches. It's in fine watches. So if you can establish a beachhead with a particular category that customers really want, and then once they're in, they'll buy other categories. That's how we're looking at it. We do that through our own brands. We do that through our market brands.","Kara Szafraniec - Northcoast Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone. As you think about the second half of the year and holiday plans, whether it's hiring and the changes you're doing in marketing, how is that investment, hiring, marketing different this year than last year? And then with the vendors and slower product, more buy now, wear now? What are you seeing in arrival of the goods, timing, that's different than it had been in the past? Thank you.","Jeffrey Gennette - Macy's, Inc.","Hi, Dana. So what I'd say is that we're more efficient in our marketing spend than ever because of what we're doing with weights and buys and Rich Lennox, who you had an opportunity to meet at the Investor Meeting, and the leadership that he's bringing to this subject. So expect us to be very promotional, but we have available dollars now because we're more efficient in our promotional marketing to be able to focus on those things that make Macy's stand out as a gift and fashion destination. So expect those parts to be in more balance during the fourth quarter.","So and then to your question about inventory, we definitely are buying closer in. So the opportunity to flow closer in is a priority of ours, so to make sure that we have the right goods in time for holiday, but not too far in advance, and to make sure that our December receipts are really focused on the transitional opportunity for Christmas vacation into the New Year. So we're really focused on freshness and making sure that our inventories are bought closer into customer demand, and expect us to get better at that and you'll see a marked difference this holiday versus last.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning. Karen, can you just reiterate your back half comp guidance? I think there was a little bit confusion about that.","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","Sorry. Yeah, the guidance had been, in order to get to minus 2% to minus 3%, mathematically for the fall, that would be minus 0.8% to minus 2.6%. So I think that's the back half guidance. We were trying to give some color around expectations for the third quarter. And you'll recall in June, we had said we expected Q2 to be better than Q1, Q3 better than Q2, Q4 better than Q3. With Q2 being better than what we had expected, I was just cautioning that Q3 may be close to Q2, or slightly worse. And then you have to decide your outlook for the fall as to what that could mean for the fourth quarter. Does that help or am I still confusing you?","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No. That helps. Thank you. And I just wanted to follow-up on the loyalty program. I know you're not giving a lot of details yet, but are you confident that launching it in October will give the customer enough time to learn what it means and be able to really use it for the important holiday selling season?","Karen M. Hoguet - Macy's, Inc.","We believe that it's a good time to be launching it, but we also know that it takes a long time, roughly 18 months, for a loyalty program to really reach its stride. So we do not expect to get the full benefit of the loyalty program in the fourth quarter. But we hope that we will begin to see that happen.","Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.","Karen M.

Today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Karen Hoguet. Please go ahead ma'am.","Karen Hoguet","Great. Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Macy's conference call scheduled to discuss our second quarter earnings. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website www.macysinc.com beginning approximately two hours after the call concludes.","Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning. Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed form 10-K and other SEC filings.","Today, we announced second quarter earnings as well as two additional initiatives that should help to enhance shareholder value and build for our future. On this morning's call, I will cover three topics, starting obviously with second quarter earnings, then the other two announcements made this morning, and conclude with our outlook for the remainder of the year. I will then open the call as always for your questions. So let's get started.","In the second quarter, we reported earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.64, which is 20% below last year. While we had expected earnings to be below last year in the second quarter, this was below what we had expected.","Our performance in the first half of the year was not as strong as we had hoped, but we are cautiously optimistic about our ability to improve the sales trend in the fall season. We'll talk about that later in the call, but know that we remain confident in our strategies and in our team's ability to execute them.","Total sales in the second quarter were $6.1 billion, down 2.6% versus last year. On a comp, owned plus license basis, sales were down 1.5%. Remember that last year comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis were up 4% in the second quarter. So, on a two-year basis, comp sales increased 1.2% per year in the second quarter, which is stronger than the first quarter decline of 0.4% per year on the same basis.","We would highlight the following four major factors in no particular order that contributed to our sales weakness in the quarter. Two of these are the same as we mentioned last quarter. The first is our decision to no repeat a friend and family event that we had last year in the second quarter.","We had hoped that we would be able to preserve the sales with other promotional events, but that turned out not to be the case. Two, continued weakness in the international tourist business. We estimate this hurt comp growth by approximately 1% as it did in the first quarter.","Three, slower growth in some key center core categories. These businesses are still growing well above the total company, but just not at the same level as they had been growing. And four, the continued challenges with the consumer.","The overall growth in the economy is modest at best and we are seeing customers gravitating to restaurants, recreational services, healthcare, and electronics rather than to traditional general merchandize apparel and furnishing category.","Last quarter, we also spoke about the West Coast ports, which had a lingering albeit smaller effect in the second quarter as we predicted. The weather effect in the first quarter no longer impacted sales in the second quarter.","We also had mentioned last quarter that there was a steeper than expected learning curve as our new Omni channel merchandizing, planning, and marketing teams learn how to maximize business in their new roles. This is still a factor, but doesn\u2019t rise to the same level as it did when the new organization launched in the first quarter.","Interestingly, two of our best performing categories in the quarter were in the center core areas; handbags and fragrances. We also had strong sales performance in active, furniture, and mattresses. The weaker categories included fashion jewelry and watches, petites and large size women's apparel, men's tailored clothing, house wares, and table top.","Our Omni channel strategies are working well as customers increasingly shop and buy across multiple channels. We believe that our new organization structure is helping to accelerate digital growth, which continued to be very strong in the quarter.","Geographically, we continue to see relative strength in the Southern markets, but the best performance came this quarter from the entire West Coast, and our worst performance was in our major tourist doors and markets.","In the second quarter, average unit retail was down 1.3%. The number of transactions was down slightly in the quarter and units per transaction, up slightly. The gross margin rate in the quarter was 40.9%, down 50 basis points from last year.","We told you at the end of the first quarter that gross margin rate would be below last year due to the impact of the delayed receipts from the port slow down earlier in the year. However, with the weaker sales, we took additional markdowns needed to keep our inventory fresh, and as a result the gross margin rate was lower than we had expected.","Remember though the margin rate was up versus last year in the first quarter. So for the spring season or the first half of the year as a whole, the gross margin rate was down 30 basis points.","Inventory at the end of the quarter was up 3.8% or a 2.9% increase on a comp basis. This is higher than one would expect in part because we brought in merchandize earlier than last year to get better set for back-to-school, which by the way has started off well.","SG&A in the quarter was $2,058 million, up 1.7% over last year, which is similar to the increase in the first quarter, and as a percent of sales, it was 33.8%, a 150 basis points above last year.","The biggest increases in expense relative to last year related to our growth investments. Our Omni channel strategies, a full quarter of Bluemercury expense and the start-up expense associated with the back stage pilot. In addition, we were negatively impacted in the quarter by higher medical benefit expense.","Depreciation and amortization was $261 million, which is $7 million higher than last year. These increases were offset in large part by the cost reduction resulting from the yearend Omni channel restructuring as well as higher credit income. In the second quarter, credit income was $195 million, which is $12 million above last year.","Penetration or usage of our proprietary credit card in the quarter was 47.8%, up 190 basis points over last year. This great result was in large part due to the launch of our new Plenti Loyalty Program and also the impact of the lower international tourist business. Operating income in the quarter was $436 million, down 24% from last year.","Interest expense was $93 million, tax expense $126 million with a 36.7% effective tax rate. Net income in the second quarter was $217 million, average share count on a diluted basis was 341 million shares, which is 6.7% below a year ago and as I said earlier, earnings per share on a diluted basis was $0.64, 20% below last year.","Cash flow from operating activities was $398 million, $338 million below last year, due primarily to a $106 million of lower net income and $154 million from higher inventory net of payable.","Net cash in investing activities was about the same as last year apart from this year\u2019s acquisition of Bluemercury and year-to-date we utilized $937 million to purchase 13.9 million shares of our stock.","In addition to the second quarter earnings we also made two announcements this morning. The first relates to our entry to China through the formation of Macy's China Limited, a joint venture with Fung Retailing Ltd. The joint venture will be based in Hong Kong and is 65% owned by us and 35% by Fung Retailing. This venture will start with an eCommerce pilot initiative on Tmall Global later this fall.","Macy\u2019s China Limited will be led by Kent Anderson, a longstanding Macy\u2019s Executive who was the Founder and long time President of Macy\u2019s.com. No physical stores are planned for China at this time, but maybe considered in the future based on our experience in eCommerce.","Together with Fung Retailing, we're expected to invest approximately $25 million in these operations over the next 18 months and our share will obviously be 65% of that.","The entry is expected to have an immaterial impact on our earnings this year and in 2016, we expect the joint venture to generate sales of approximately $50 million. We're very excited to be working with such a great partner to being to build a business in one of the world\u2019s largest and fastest growing consumer marketplaces.","Our game plan is to start small and use a test and learn approach as we move forward. We also believe that by increasing the presence of Macy\u2019s in China, we will actually help our business here as well both with the Chinese tourists as well as Chinese residents.","We also announced this morning a transaction that takes advantage of the value inherent in our Brooklyn real estate. As you know our strategy has been to maintain a mix of both owned and leased stores and this approach has worked extremely well for us keeping our cost low and providing us with the flexibility to adapt to changing economic conditions.","As part of this strategy, we continuously review our portfolio and take action where we see opportunity to enhance value. In this case, we were able to monetize part of what we owned in Brooklyn and frankly weren\u2019t using productively while creating what we expect to be a stronger, more productive retail store in this terrific market.","We have been studying our options for this location as well as for other properties for quite some time. As you read Tishman Speyer is purchasing our Brooklyn parking garage facility as well as the top five floors and air rights above the existing Macy store for approximately $170 million in cash.","Tishman Speyer will convert the space into first class office space. They will contribute an additional $100 million that will be used toward the total rebuild and remodel of our Macy store. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and is expected to result in a gain of approximately $250 million.","This transaction had not been assumed when we provided earnings guidance at the start of the year. The good news is that in addition to monetizing the space that was unproductive, we're going to be able to reinvent the store to create a true fashion hub combining the best of Macy's with Brooklyn's local flavor. We see enormous opportunity to better serve the Brooklyn customer.","We currently operate 378,000 square feet on eight floors in this store and in the future, we will be operate more productively in 310,000 square feet on five floors. The remodel is expected to start in the spring of 2016 and be completed by the fall of 2018 and the good news is that the store will remain open through this period.","While on this subject of real estate, I want to take a moment to touch on the work we're doing on a real estate portfolio. We have regularly considered ways to realize the value of our own real estate over the years, but each time we did not see enough meaningful economic benefit to justify the added cost and lower flexibility that would come from doing so.","With that said though real estate values clearly are nearing all time highs and so over the past few months, we have been intensely studying this subject again. We have brought on specialized real estate advisors as well as financial, legal and tax advisors to look at a wide range of alternatives from financing to structural that have the potential to create value.","As part of this thorough effort we are working through a number of very complex issues relating to everything from property type to taxes, to debt covenants. It is too early to tell what the results of this will be as the work is still underway, but we plan to come back to you as soon as we complete this work.","Let's now move on and talk about the back half of the year and some of the good things happening that should help accelerate our sales growth profitably.","Last quarter, I spoke about our mom's strategy still being core to what we're doing. My Macy's, Omni channel and magic selling that is still the case and last quarter we highlighted seven new initiatives about which we are still excited. Let me just quickly give you an update on each of these.","One was Bluemercury. There are now 66 stores open and we expect to have another 10 by yearend. We're working hard to improve the digital experience and strengthen the Omni channel capabilities and we're also opening this fall four Bluemercury stores within Macy stores including one on our Union Square Store in San Francisco.","Two, Plenti has launched very successfully. Macy's now has over seven million customers enrolled and we expect to generate incremental sales from these customers as well as new customers who enrolled in this program through other companies as points begin to accumulate and customers understand the value inherent in this loyalty program.","Three, the execution of our top door strategy continues and we said last quarter, we hope to see results beginning this fall. This will include enhanced product offering, upgraded shopping environment, incremental special events and additional sales associates with greater product knowledge.","The fourth initiative we mentioned last quarter as All Things Wedding. Since the last conference call we announced our partnership with Men's Warehouse to open licensed tuxedo rental shops within 300 Macy stores with the first open opening this fall. This is an important capability added to what we offer for these customers.","The fifth was outsized growth categories. One new initiative here is a pilot of a new strategy for jewelry and watches that includes an intensified selling effort, elevated product, improved physical environment and added marketing. We also are continuing to drive growth in the categories such as active, dresses and other parts of center core ","Six was Backstage, our off-price pilot. We\u2019re getting ready for a grand opening in the first stores in a few weeks. We are very excited about how these stores are shaping up. And seven was International and obviously our China announcement that I just discussed is the big news in this arena.","So as you can see, we are making progress in all of these fronts and staying focused on what we believe will drive our business.","Our expectation for fall sales is now a 1% comp growth on an owned plus license basis with own comp about 50 basis points lower. Total sales are expected to be flattish versus last year. Total sales are growing slower than comp because of a significant reduction in the sales of private label goods to third parties.","We\u2019re opening two new full line stores in the fall, a Bloomingdale's and Honolulu and a second Macy store in Puerto Rico. Plus we're opening the ten Bluemercury locations, six Macy\u2019s back stage off price stores and a very exciting new Bloomingdale\u2019s outlet store on the upper Westside of Manhattan.","Now as you model sale by quarter, I should note that we're expecting sales growth to be stronger in the fourth quarter than in the third as we begin to year around on the weakness in the international tourist sales.","The gross margin rate is expected to be flattish in the back half of the year and SG&A dollars are expected to be below last year as a result of the large gain expected from the Brooklyn transaction. With that Brooklyn, SG&A is expected to be in the range of last year.","And as you model the quarters know that the third quarter SG&A will be negatively impacted by the timing of asset sales this year relative to last year and additionally, the third quarter expense will be negatively impacted by a slight reduction in credit income in the quarter due to the cost associated with the EMV card reissue for our cobranded cards.","So because of the sales assumption and the SG&A comparisons to last year, operating income is assumed to be below last year in the third quarter but in the fourth quarter operating income is expected to be above last year without the benefit of the Brooklyn gain and obviously with the Brooklyn gain higher still.","Interest expense is expected to be $80 million in the third quarter lower than what we have been running year-to-date, due to a gain associated with the debt we're calling at par next week. But in the fourth quarter, interest expense is assumed to be back at the levels experienced in the first two quarters of the year.","In the third quarter, the tax rate is expected to be higher than last year because last year's rate benefited from one-time tax settlements that happened during the quarter and was only 33%. We are still expecting our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37%.","So with these assumptions for the fall, the annual earnings per share on a diluted basis is expected to be 470 to 480 including the gain on the Brooklyn transaction.","Now the good news as we head into the third quarter is that there are many things working in our business and we are following through on the plans we previously announced to initiate and develop growth avenues for the future both organic and with new businesses.","The overall economy didn\u2019t do us any favors in the first half of the year. We look forward to the effects of the stronger dollar beginning to year around in the fourth quarter and to consumers replenishing their closets as their wardrobes require updating heading into the fall and holidays.","At a Management meeting two weeks ago, we updated each other on the many items on our to-do list, to generate sales growth from existing operations in the back half of the year. Some of them are mentioned earlier in this call today.","As is often the case, success isn\u2019t going to come from a big bang, but from a disciplined execution of strategic and well planned ideas, that genuinely serve the emerging needs of our consumers.","Layer on top of that, the upcoming opening of Macy\u2019s Backstage stores, our eCommerce launch in China and the growing presence of Bluemercury. The picture you see is of a strong and progressive retailer that is Omnichannel in nature and intent on continuing our success. Make no mistake about that the fact that we're focused on growing and driving this business and in creating shareholder value on all fronts.","We\u2019ve already returned more than $7 billion to shareholders over the past four years in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We have consistently outperformed the market in most of our major competitors on both the top and bottom lines.","We're committed to maintaining the foundation of innovation and financial strength that have brought us this far. We continue to build our business in new and exciting directions and we appreciate your interest and support going forward.","So let\u2019s move on now to whatever questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].And we\u2019ll take our first question from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you. Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Lorraine Hutchinson","As you consider real estate monetization above and beyond maybe the single-store transactions, how do you think about the best use of proceeds from those transactions?","Karen Hoguet","Well, as with everything, we\u2019re looking at balancing growing the business and making the investments needed to do so along with obviously returning cash to the shareholders. So I think it would be similar to how we look at the cash flow that we generate just from the business.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Great. And it seems like you've been able to generate a lot of this -- these new initiatives without spending a lot of incremental capital, so would you consider a larger share repurchase here if you were to get further proceeds?","Karen Hoguet","Absolutely, we would consider anything, but remember all of you who follow retail know that it\u2019s fundamentally a cyclical business. So we do want to ensure that we have the financial flexibility and access to the capital markets in all conditions. So we\u2019ll obviously balance how we use that cash with maintaining a strong balance sheet.","Lorraine Hutchinson","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Lauren Cassel","Good morning, Karen. This is Lauren Cassel on for Kimberly. Just going back to the real estate strategy, it sounds like you are a bit more open to that subject today than in prior years. Is that a fair statement?","And then you announced Brooklyn and Pittsburgh recently, so it seems like you are more open to opportunistically monetizing assets. But is there anything, other than all-time high real estate values, that has changed your thinking there?","Karen Hoguet","I think that's the biggest issue. We've looked at this for many times over the years and also obviously how we can monetize assets like Pittsburgh like Brooklyn, particularly to increase the retail operation at the same time.","So I think it\u2019s really the value enhancement and some of the transactions that have been announced this year that were interesting. So I think between real estate values being high in some interesting transactions, we are taking a deeper look at the subject.","Lauren Cassel","Great, thanks.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Hey good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Matthew.","Matthew Boss","So if you back out tourism, and we try our best to back out the friends and family, we calculate flattish to slightly positive same-store sales in the quarter.","But then, in light of some of your comments on the consumer and maybe some of their changes in spending patterns, I guess as we look forward, is it more fair to think about consumer spending in department store category as more in the 0% to 1% comp run rate versus maybe 2% to 3% historical thought process or just any help you can give me around that would be great.","Karen Hoguet","I\u2019m stepping back for a second. I think the real answer Matt is that we see opportunities of generating more sales from our consumers. It is clearly getting harder. As I said, there is a lot of competition for the dollar in categories other than what we sell, but we have confidence in our team to develop -- deliver the sales that we've talked about and continue to be a market leader here.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then as we think about back stage and the potential rollout, if the fall test hits all your metrics, what options would you consider for growth next year and beyond, I guess both on an organic basis or would you also consider growing by acquisition?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, I think we have to see how the test goes, but there is lots of ways that we could grow Backstage whether it would be organic, acquisition within Macy stores, there\u2019s lots of ideas floating, but I don't want to get ahead of our test either.","Matthew Boss","Okay. Great. Best of luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Oliver Chen with Cowen & Co.","Oliver Chen","Thanks a lot Karen. In your comments on back-to-school, it sounded like you're encouraged. I just was curious about categories or things that were driving that momentum and also when you did mention the slower growth in center core, which categories are you referring to?","Karen Hoguet","Well in terms of back-to-school, it's way too early to claim victory. So we do feel good based on the early start. Obviously there has been a lot of talk about denim, and we see a lot of opportunity unfolding there for back-to-school, but also for the fall season in total, but it's too early to really talk fully about back-to-school,","In terms of the slower growth categories, some categories are just growing slower than they had, but still growing very rapidly, but we did mention weakness in the fashion jewelry and watch category in the quarter.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And Karen on the -- regarding your helpful statements on real estate, I just had a question about the bigger picture characteristics you're thinking about in terms of really maintaining your operational excellence, maintaining investment grade, thinking about your margins, and thinking about how comps are not necessarily that predictable with external circumstances.","What are the constraints that you're evaluating just to ensure that you optimize any potential transaction?","Karen Hoguet","Well as I said earlier to Lorraine, the key here is maintaining financial flexibility, so that if the business hits a bump, we would still have the access to the financial markets that we need to operate the business as a proxy for that.","That is why we talk about remaining investment grade as being so important to the company because we want to be a strong retailer for many years to come, and so we do need to have that flexibility for the speed bumps that do happen or the cyclical nature of retail.","So those are all being factored into the arithmetic as we look at opportunities.","Oliver Chen","And just a final question, your comment on expanded markets and same day, it sounds really competitive and really focused on thinking about fulfillment, in what inning would you say you're there and what's ahead for us to think about how you'll continue your leadership in thinking about apparel online.","Karen Hoguet","Yes I think that I have no idea what inning it is because I think the game keeps getting extended. So I think we will be investing and growing this business forever, which is the exciting news and I think at the end of the day, fulfillment is really important, but it's also having the right assortment and I think our team is so good in combination with our vendor partners including private brand as having the right assortments and offering to the customer that that combined with the fulfillment opportunities, I think is going to make us a leader in this arena.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you for taking my question and thank you so much for all your comments around the end points of investment grade and maintaining balance sheet flexibility, Karen, can you talk specifically within the IG context about how important maintaining access to the commercial paper markets for you in terms of ongoing funding needs, whether you could operate service of Tier 3 issuer comfortably or whether you would prefer to have the cushion that Tier 2 provide.","And then just an administrative question, can you remind us where you need your cash balance to be at a minimum level. It looks like your cash is low as it\u2019s been since October of 2010. So just wanted some guidance on how we should think about that going forward? Thank you.","Karen Hoguet","Yes, I think the key thing is having access to commercial paper is a great thing and obviously gives you flexibility and lower borrowing cost and accessing our bank facility, but we could access the bank facility should we not have access to the commercial paper market.","So I can't tell you today that maintaining access is critical for the company going forward, but we\u2019d obviously like to keep that capability because again for a highly seasonal business that becomes very important.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","And then just cash balance question.","Karen Hoguet","Yes, I don\u2019t know how to answer that. So I think I\u2019m just going to deflect that question.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee CRT.","Charles Grom","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Charles.","Charles Grom","On the tourism headwind, could you just remind us when that started last year and are we close to cycling that headwind? And I guess, in conjunction, how were trends at Bloomingdale's in the quarter?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, it\u2019s started really in December maybe late November. So it\u2019s really the fourth quarter that we should begin to have easier comparisons. I don\u2019t know that the international tours will get better. That\u2019s the year rounding effect and Bloomingdale's had a disappointing quarter as well and they\u2019re actually more impacted by the tourist slowdown as you might imagine given where the stores are then is Macy\u2019s.","Charles Grom","Okay. Great. And then just throughout the quarter just any sense for have comps trended by month and any early read on August.","Karen Hoguet","Obviously I\u2019m not going to comment on the early August. So that is just too early to judge and there really wasn\u2019t much change. We obviously had a tough June given friends and family but we expected it although it was worse than we had expected.","Charles Grom","Okay. Thanks and good luck.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Paul Trussell","You've touched on it a little bit, but if you can give any more detail, get a little bit more granular for us to help us make -- be more comfortable with your second-half guidance, which I believe includes a return to positive comps, flattish gross margin, and in-line SG&A dollars year over year, if I heard you correctly.","Just given your prior comments regarding the consumer's preference to shopping restaurants and travel, what we already know about the promotional environment, as well as your focus on shipping and same-day shipping expansion, as well as some of the challenges you mentioned around credit card changes that will impact SG&A, healthcare, and other factors.","Karen Hoguet","You\u2019re full of doom and gloom Paul. Look we\u2019ve tried to layout in a release and also in my comments earlier today that some of the things that give us comfort that there will be some improvement in the fall starting with all that's going on in the Omnichannel world.","We think it will be very important as we go into the fall. The top door strategy that I talked about, go back and listen or read the transcript from today, but all of those things do give us the comfort that we're going to be able to deliver the fall results.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. And just going back to comments you made back in February, you spoke about entering phase three, which obviously included a focus on the growth initiatives and innovation, but also doing that at the 14% EBITDA level. Has industry conditions changed in terms or your positioning changed in terms of expectations to maintain that level? Or do you still believe that is doable?","Karen Hoguet","I think that level is an attainable level, obviously this year we're taking a step backwards if we take out the Brooklyn gain as you can tell from our guidance, it's obvious from the math. So you can see that, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t think it's the right level to get back to and we still think that that's achievable even accelerating our growth through these new initiatives.","Paul Trussell","Thank you and good luck.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research.","Jeff Stein","Karen, a couple questions on the real estate transaction. Again, thank you for taking the question. So explain how you get a $250 million gain with $170 million of proceeds.","I'm wondering if you're also including the $100 million that your partner is going to be contributing over the next three years. And can you quantify the EPS effect of the $250 million gain? Are you considering any tax strategies to try to minimize that and so forth? Thank you.","Karen Hoguet","Well there is two different questions, yes the accounting is such that it's the $270 million, which gets you to the $250 million gain, which is approximately $0.46 a share. We are working on tax strategies vis-\u00e0-vis the cash taxes, but the book taxes would lead to the $0.46 a share impact roughly on the year.","Jeff Stein","Got it, got it. And I am wondering in the second quarter, did you see any boost from loyalty customers that were seeking the use of their point balances due to the transition to the Plenti program?","Karen Hoguet","No, I think it too early and we didn't really expect it. I think it takes time to accumulate the points and see the value and remember we just launched it in early May. So it is going to take time. Our hope is that as the year goes on, we begin to get the benefit, but it does take time for those points to accumulate.","The good news is, the good news is that we've had lots of customers far more than we had expected sign up. So at least they're interested in the program and hopefully they\u2019ll get engaged and learn how to maximize their points and use them.","Jeff Stein","But what I was referring to, I am sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear, the old Star Rewards program, I guess those points had to be used by the end of May.","Karen Hoguet","Correct.","Jeff Stein","So if you had any balance left over, you would lose those or a customer for example where they were trying to build up points and get certificates to use before they lost everything. That's kind of what I was referring to.","Karen Hoguet","I don't think that that happened. I think we did a very good job communicating with those customers, but I don't think it helped sales in the quarter.","Jeff Stein","Okay. And one real quick one, I am a joint venture with China, the $25 million investment your share, does that comprised or is some of it going through the P&L?","Karen Hoguet","No, Jeff as I said, there is an immaterial impact on earnings in the quarter, sorry, in the fall.","Jeff Stein","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey, good morning, Karen. Could you help us talk a little bit about I think you commented that and I apologize if I missed anything that you're getting it back to flat gross margins in the second half. Just seems like as eCommerce gets bigger and the inventories are a little high, you got new initiatives like same day delivery and then slower sales to tourists or at least your third quarter, which I am assuming has a low return rate.","Are some of the underlying drivers on the gross margins helping you to get back to flat that you can maybe point out to us?","Karen Hoguet","Yes, just we believe that that's doable given the mix of the business and what we expect to happen. eCommerce is not a negative to gross margin. So yes, delivery expenses, but again we think we've planned it properly and we'll see.","Michael Binetti","Okay. So on the -- if we just tried around some of the math on Brooklyn it looks like it was about a $0.45 listen in the numbers, maybe I am off on that, but that's a pretty significant reduction excluding Brooklyn on a smaller sales adjustment.","Can you tell us about the SG&A from here in the second half and how flexible the planned spending is in the second half if there is another downside scenario for you there or the industry or for you? Will there be a similar level of deleverage on sales in the back half?","Karen Hoguet","Well, we're always trying to reduce expense when we see sales decline and SG&A was not up that much this year. So I am not quite sure what you're referring to. Obviously if sales are down, you are going to deleverage, but we're always looking if sales aren\u2019t materializing to trying to offset or minimize the impact of that with expense and I think that will continue into the back half of the year.","Michael Binetti","Okay. And then just one final one, you've been helping us with your comments on real estate for several quarters now. I was just wondering if you with your longevity in the industry, can you talk about even though real estate values are peaking now, what any hesitations you may have at this point as you dot the eyes on how you're looking at anything you may do as you maybe look at what kind of financial obligations it will create for the retail business longer term, thanks?","Karen Hoguet","Well I don't know that the word is hesitation. I think it's just making sure that the total fixed cost that we put on the business whether it would be interest expense or rent expense is appropriate given EBITDA that we expect to generate through all cycles.","So I wouldn't use the word hesitation. It just has to all work together.","Michael Binetti","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bernard Sosnick with Gilford Securities.","Bernard Sosnick","Yes Karen, mention was made about consumer spending on all the categories that are sold in department stores and of course Macy's has made adjustments through the addition of athletic footwear, you're bringing in tuxedos.","But the one thing that you mentioned just a while ago was perhaps a licensee for electronics, could you speak about what the options are for bringing in a categories that are more in the forefront of consumer spending especially among young shoppers?","Karen Hoguet","Sure. We're continuing to look at options for that. So that\u2019s clearly on the radar screen. We're also trying to bring in products. So for example wearable tech is something that we're bringing in. Products like Fitbits and things like that. So we are trying to bring products into our assortment that fit that need and also still explaining opportunities vis-\u00e0-vis license partners.","Bernard Sosnick","Thank you. The second question that I have is in regard to the expense control. Of course sales were down in comps in the second quarter, which was a surprise, but in the first quarter you said that you were surprised by the weakness of sales but didn't have as much option to play with expense levels as you might have in the second quarter.","Of course there was the addition of Bluemercury. But I didn't see as much adjustment in expenses as I thought might have occurred, given your prior history of making such adjustments quickly.","Karen Hoguet","Well, remember we are also investing in Omni channel, which we think is critical and obviously sales -- digital sales are growing quite rapidly. So it would be wrong to start making that investment. We also obviously have to start-up expense associated with Backstage. So those are things that would be wrong to stop doing. We obviously could have, but not the right answer for the business over the long term.","Bernard Sosnick","And finally in the first quarter you said that the decline in tourism hit comp store sales by about 50 basis points.","Karen Hoguet","No, we said a point ","Bernard Sosnick","A point, okay. I'm glad you corrected that. What would be the impact in the second quarter?","Karen Hoguet","A point it's about the same.","Bernard Sosnick","Which, to me, implies that tourism was down around 20% tourists sales. Is that a reasonable estimate?","Karen Hoguet","We\u2019re not giving that number.","Bernard Sosnick","Okay. Thank you very much.","Karen Hoguet","You bet.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Hi, good morning.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning.","Stephen Grambling","Good morning. So following up on Matt's earlier question on off-price, I'm just curious what are some of the learnings that you are getting from the pilots that is giving you confidence in the further expansion? And then kind of as a secondary question\u2026","Karen Hoguet","Well they haven't opened yet. So there is really no learning yet.","Stephen Grambling","I guess I was just referencing the comments in the press release. But I guess the other question is just on the supply chain side. What would potentially have to change to support additional stores? Is there any thought process on additional CapEx needed to support that expansion as it relates to next year?","Karen Hoguet","Obviously if we\u2019re going to expand it, we will obviously map out the investment needed and plan accordingly.","Stephen Grambling","Okay. And then I guess the second would be a follow-up on Jeff's question on the Plenti sign-ups. What are you seeing from those customers relative to the Star Rewards?","Karen Hoguet","What do you mean relative to the Star Rewards?","Stephen Grambling","I guess do you see incremental spending on certain categories or how are they responding?","Karen Hoguet","Well I think the key thing is we talked about the fact that proprietary penetration is up in part because of the Plenti program taking hold. So I think that's a good sign.","Stephen Grambling","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Joan Payson with Barclays.","Joan Payson","Hi good morning, Karen. You mentioned the acceleration in inventory growth earlier. Is there any way to quantify how much of that growth is the early pull-forward of that new seasonal product?","Karen Hoguet","No it\u2019s actually hard to do so, I was trying to do the same thing last night because I thought somebody might ask. So I don\u2019t know the answer. It is the good chunk of it over and above the sales expectations are as we go into the spring season -- I\u2019m sorry, into the fall season.","Joan Payson","Okay, great. And then, with some of the categories that you are investing in the most right now, including active wear and dresses, could you talk about how those are performing versus other categories? And also is that more of a this year focus or is it also a long-term investment?","Karen Hoguet","No it\u2019s a long-term investment and we talked about them as being strong categories. I guess didn\u2019t call out dresses this quarter, but it has been in prior quarters and still does well.","So we think it\u2019s long-term and not just something that's happening this fall season. And so we\u2019re investing more and more in the whole health environments arena. You'll see us do more in that and obviously dresses plays into the wedding strategy in addition to just social dresses in total, junior dresses relating to prom, all kinds of things as we're building more business with the Millennial customer.","Joan Payson","Okay. Great.","Karen Hoguet","They are long-term as well as short term.","Joan Payson","Thanks. And my last one is just about the upcoming openings of those off-price stores. Are there any changes that are going to be made to the surrounding or overlapping full-price stores in the same markets, either in terms of assortments or promotional activity?","Karen Hoguet","Not anticipated at this time.","Joan Payson","Great, thank you ","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi Karen. Good morning.","Karen Hoguet","Hey Bob.","Bob Drbul","Just a couple of questions from me. The first one is are you seeing any change -- when you look at the consumer interest in the branded national brands versus private brands, is there any change within your mix on that standpoint? And when you look at the overall sales results, are competitive pressures impacting your business at all any differently than they have over the last several quarters?","Karen Hoguet","Actually in terms of the change in mix and consumer view towards national versus private brands we are really not seeing anything in that arena.","And in terms of competitive activity, the answer really is no. We're really sticking to our playbook and don\u2019t think that that\u2019s had a big impact. Obviously we're reporting first. So we'll learn a lot more over the next couple of days and next week.","On the Bloomingdale side, I would say the upscale world has gotten a lot more promotional. So for Bloomingdale the competitive activity as probably a bigger fact then it would have been in the case of Macy\u2019s.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And in the back half of the year, is the credit income level expected to continue to be higher?","Karen Hoguet","Yes just not the third quarter.","Bob Drbul","Okay. And then last question I have is you called out a medical benefit expense. Can you just elaborate a little bit what's going on there? I think that's the first time you've called that out.","Karen Hoguet","Well there is two things happening. One is I think we\u2019ve talked for a long time about the pressure of higher medical cost which I think is probably impacting most companies\/ What\u2019s different about this year is we\u2019ve gone to a consumer directed plan and as part of that and this is probably more detail than you need.","We've helped to fund the HSA accounts for our employees and so there was more expense in the second quarter than it would have been last year. So part of it is timing, but we also expect a big increase in medical expense for the full year as well.","Bob Drbul","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Stacie Rabinowitz with Consumer Edge Research.","Stacie Rabinowitz","Good morning. I actually had two, if you don't mind. The first was just with the AUR decline you saw this quarter; is that coming from -- what portion of it is coming from the markdowns due to the ports, a potential mix shift?","Karen Hoguet","It\u2019s mostly due to the clearance activity, again mostly driven by the ports as well as the weaker sales earlier in the year.","Stacie Rabinowitz","Okay. And then my second question was actually around the Bluemercury openings in the Macy's stores. Are there any plans to put in some of the spa and services businesses?","Karen Hoguet","I don\u2019t believe so in the first four, but we are absolutely considering that.","Stacie Rabinowitz","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI.","Matt McGinley","Good morning, Karen. My first question is on the SG&A. I just want to make sure I have this right. Ex Brooklyn, your SG&A in the back half should be at around the same rate or the same dollar basis as you had last year?","Karen Hoguet","I was doing it on dollars.","Matt McGinley","Okay, good. Then in the second quarter and you listed all the growth drivers and obviously there was a lot of spend in this quarter as it related to that. But was that spend more heavily weighted in the second quarter than we would see in the third and fourth quarter that would have caused more deleverage in this quarter versus other quarters this year?","Karen Hoguet","Well Backstage opens. So that would obviously be less of a factor as they are beginning to generate sales and margins. Bluemercury would be similar and the Omni channel investment is going to continue through the year.","Matt McGinley","And then I think last quarter in the fourth quarter you said that there was a renewed focus on these top 150 stores in the platinum 30. Was there any real difference that you saw in terms of the comp rate in the quarter between the top 150 and all of the other stores?","Karen Hoguet","Well there is a complicating factor if you're relating to the tourist stores. So a lot of those top stores are impacted by the declines in international tourist. So if you take the tourist impact, I think the answer would be yes, but obviously with the tourist impact, those stores are getting hit harder.","Matt McGinley","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, Karen.","Karen Hoguet","Good morning, Dana.","Dana Telsey","Can you give us an update on the single view of inventory and how the progress is being made there?","And lastly, on the weakness in jewelry and watches that you had mentioned, do you think of that as related to tourism, related to product trends? How would you describe that? Thank you.","Karen Hoguet","Yes, in terms of single use of the inventory I would say it's progressing. As I mentioned earlier there has been a steeper learning curve on that subject as well as the restructure than we had expected.","So I don't think we're getting the full benefit of having that single view of the inventory, which again for people who aren\u2019t as close to the details is that we merge the inventories that is in the warehouses for a direct to consumer business plus the stores so that our planners are able to better allocate merchandize across warehouses and stores.","It has helped us to begin to improve turnover as well as obviously help margin and more importantly get goods closer to the consumer. Having said that I would say we're in the early innings of maximizing the opportunity there. So I think that's still ahead of us as we go forward. ","In terms of the weakness in watches and jewelry, I think it's sort of all of those things and as you recall and as we talked earlier we've actually started a test where we're trying to intensify our business not only in the fashion jewelry and watches, but also find that we think may address some of this weakness as we go forward.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group","David Glick","Thank you. Good morning, Karen. Most of my questions have been answered. Had a couple follow-ups. How do you -- with the additional proceeds from the sale of the Brooklyn store, how do you look at the buyback for this year in terms of what you are anticipating? Obviously, your EBITDA projection is lower today as well, but how do we think about the buyback for the year?","And then, secondly, didn't talk a lot about some of the other categories. You mentioned some of the strong and weak, but in general you talked about center core. But how about ready-to-wear, home, and men's in terms of how they are trending and what the prospects are going forward? Thank you.","Karen Hoguet","In terms of the buyback as with every year we look at our cash flow and look at what's the appropriate leverage ratios and we utilize our cash appropriately. Obviously with this transaction happening at the end of the year, unlikely to have a big impact on the buyback in '15 more likely beginning of '16, but obviously that's incremental cash that can be used to buyback more stock.","In terms of the other categories, ready to wear continues to be tough with exceptions of areas like active, denim doing better, dresses doing a little bit better. Men's, I would say was mixed, but with a lot of strength in some parts. Home we talked about the big ticket areas being very strong furniture and mattresses and actually we've started a pilot of a new approach to soft home, which appears to have a lot of promise.","So we feel good about the prospects for that business as we move forward into the fall season.","David Glick","Then just a quick follow-up. Obviously the EBITDA projection down this year. How do you look at that shortfall and how quickly you can recover that going forward? Obviously some of the headwinds this year are transitory, some are not. But as you look at your EBITDA level coming out of the year, how quickly are you looking at making up that operating shortfall?","Karen Hoguet","That's a big question of the day. We're looking at that as we're speaking today. So I don't know the answer to that yet.","David Glick","Thank you very much. Good luck in the second half.","Karen Hoguet","Thanks David.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Richard Jaffe with Stifel Nicolaus","Richard Jaffe","Thanks very much and I'm really excited about the opportunity in China and the initiative. I'm just wondering about the magnitude, that is to say the size of the offerings, the breadth, the depth, where the inventory is going to kept. Will you be doing fulfillment in China?","And will the online experience be very similar to what we see here, or are you creating a unique experience for the folks in China?","Karen Hoguet","I think those are all the questions we're still trying to answer. For this fall it will be relatively limited assortment and the goods will be in Hong Kong, but over time, assuming it works well, the idea would be to have the goods house in China hopefully at some point and see how much of the website we need to modify to fit the consumer in China.","We're not going into this thinking we know all the answers and that's why we're taking sort of a test and learn approach because we know the Chinese consumer is different both in terms of merchandized taste but also how they interact online and so again we're going in with an open mind and not assuming we know all the answers.","The good news is with Ken Anderson running it, who as I mentioned earlier was the founder of macys.com and has been there since up until the last couple of months.","I think we're in very good hands for trying to switch through how to build this business appropriately.","Richard Jaffe","I think so, too. What will Fung Retail's contribution be in this process, either dollars or expertise?","Karen Hoguet","The dollars obvious, but there is a great deal of expertise. They obviously understand the Chinese customer in ways that we don't yet and they are terrific business people. So we're really very excited about the partnership and think that they're going to add a lot to the strategy and also helping us execute.","They have great capabilities as I think you all know, not through Fung Retailing but through Lee and Fung, which will also have access to in logistics HR and all of these subjects that are going to be so important to the success of this venture.","Richard Jaffe","I look forward to it. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse","Michael Exstein","Thank you, Karen. Two quick questions. Number one, can you talk about the decision to eliminate the friends and family in the quarter? And are you going to add one in the second half of the year to offset it?","Secondly, in terms of the gross margin decline, was there any mix shift impact on your gross margin, or was it just purely clearance more inventory at the end of the quarter?","Karen Hoguet","So in terms of the margin, it was not a mix shift. It was purely clearance of inventory. And in terms of the decision to eliminate the friends and family, obviously in hind side, I am not sure it was a good one, but we're not adding an event to offset it.","Michael Exstein","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Wayne Hood with BMO Capital Markets","Wayne Hood","Yes Karen, I just had two real estate questions and then a working capital question. I guess on the real estate side, on the Brooklyn transaction, does that preclude you from eventually vending the owned piece into a REIT with a joint venture partner at some point in the future?","Karen Hoguet","No, it does not. We still own the part of the store that we're operating.","Wayne Hood","Okay. So that's still a potential outcome. The second I guess for you, and the Board and Terry, as you think about what's going on with real estate today, there's an element of surfacing the value the way you've done, but there's also throwing it in to or entering into a joint venture relationship with a JV partner that could grow.","And I'm wondering as they think about that, broadly speaking, does it not to provide a growth silo for you eventually by partnering with a joint venture partner that could not only monetize your real estate, but go out and buy other assets to grow buy. And you could lever off of that in a way that you were not able to create a silo in the past.","Karen Hoguet","I think the answer is we've said as we're looking at all options, obviously that's one of the options that we're looking at.","Wayne Hood","Okay. And the last question I guess is on working capital. You mentioned a little bit about inventory. Can you talk a little bit about where you think inventory will be at the end of the third or fourth quarter? And maybe if you can dive into where you think working capital might be by the end of those periods, if at all.","Karen Hoguet","I think on a comp basis, I think it will be up at the end of the year, but less than it is right now, but I can't give you a forecast at this point precisely.","Wayne Hood","Okay. Great. Thanks Karen.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Laurent Vasilescu with FBR Capital Markets","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning. Following upon Joan's question, can you provide a bit more color on how your athletic business is doing? Was there a pickup on -- over the first quarter? And are you seeing any particular strength in footwear versus apparel, men's versus women's, and any call outs on particular brands?","Karen Hoguet","We don't discuss particular brands and I would say the whole business has done very well first quarter and second quarter, men's, women's apparel, footwear etcetera. So we feel very good about that business.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay, great. And then, with the resurgence in denim sales are you seeing consumers trading away from any other categories?","Karen Hoguet","Well obviously if you're buying denim, you're probably not going to buy the same bottoms that you had been buying. The good thing for us is that denim comes at a higher AUR and also requires different tops and footwear to go with it. So it could be a really good trend for us assuming it continues ","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay, great. Best of luck.","Karen Hoguet","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick","Karen, good morning. Appreciate you getting us in. Just a follow-up to several of the previous questions. As you look at real estate opportunities or potential real estate opportunities, does your too forward of 2000 publicly stated lease adjusted leverage that's still hold or could that potentially change?","Karen Hoguet","It does still hold. Could it potentially change, I guess so, but remember as I said repeatedly, financial flexibility and access to capital markets is really critical for us. So that will obviously always be a factor.","Todd Duvick","Got you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we have no further questions. And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Karen Hoguet for any additional or closing remarks.","Karen Hoguet","No, I just want to say thank you everybody for your interest, your support and if you have further questions, obviously let me know, let Matt know and we'll do our best to get back to you as quickly as we can. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
