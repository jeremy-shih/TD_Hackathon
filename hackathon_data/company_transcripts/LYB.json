At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","","Douglas J. Pike","Thank you, Glenn. Well, hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's fourth quarter 2012 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.","And before we begin the business discussion, I\u2019d like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today\u2019s call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. I\u2019d also like you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com\/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with any other applicable disclosures including the earnings release are currently available at our website www.lyondellbasell.com.","Finally, I\u2019d like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 pm eastern time today until 11 pm eastern time on March 1 by calling 866-454-2134 in United States and 203-369-1248 outside the United States, and the pass code for both numbers is 7068.","During today\u2019s call we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2012 performance, the current environment and near-term outlook. With that being said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our website.","Let\u2019s take a look at slide number 4, and review a few financial highlights. The fourth quarter of 2012, was generally a solid quarter impacted by difficult seasonal trends as well as some specific items such as European restructuring cost, year-end bonus accruals, and the Wesseling cracker turnaround. In total, these items impacted the quarter by more than $100 million. Together with seasonality impacts, these items led to a decline versus the third quarters $276 million. However our results were significantly stronger than the fourth quarter of 2011.","For the year, our income from continuing operations was $2.9 billion or $4.96 per share. The charts on the bottom of the page provide a good perspective of the quarter and the year relative to recent history. Within our portfolio, the drivers of strength were consistent during the quarter and the year.","The Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment continue to benefit from the revolution in natural gas liquids. Intermediates and Derivatives also had strong performance as it continued to benefit from steady propylene oxide results and its own natural gas based advantage and products such as acetyls and oxyfuels. This advantage coupled with strong operations has been a consistent theme in both segments. ","Karyn and I will discuss some of the details later in the call, but first I want to discuss some of our 2012 accomplishments.","If you turn to slide number 5 of the presentation, I will begin with our 2012 environmental, health, and safety performance. I am extremely proud of our accomplishments in this area. The trends on the charts speak for themselves, but to understand them, you need to consider that our historic results were already good.","Today, we may well be the industry leader. I know that many of you wonder why we place so much emphasis in area. It\u2019s really quite simple. We care deeply about our people and the communities in which we operate. Good environmental, health and safety performance aligns with reliable efficient operations.","On page number 6, we outlined some of our key accomplishments. In the interest of time, I\u2019ll highlight just a few of the many achievements. First, prop\u2019s reached a record level. Our total annual shareholder return was 89%. Also view that we\u2019ve followed this over the past several years, know that we always emphasis cost control. I am proud that for the fourth consecutive year, we offset inflation and maintained flat underlying costs, while improving our safety, operating and financial results.","In the finance area, our strong cash flow enabled us to further improve our balance sheet. Moody\u2019s elevated the Company\u2019s credit rating to investment grade. We were also able to reduce our interest expense and pay $2.4 billion in dividends. This equates to a 30% yield on our 2012 opening share price and greater than the 7% yield on the end of year price.","In U.S. manufacturing, we raised our percentage of ethylene produced from NGLs averaging close to 85% during 2012 versus 75% during 2011. We also continued refurbishing our assets completing maintenance turnarounds at two of our largest sites, Channelview and Basell AF. These investments are paying off in our reliability and production metrics.","Commercially we define new expansion options at our Channelview and Corpus Christi sites. In addition, the permitting process for methanol plant restart and La Porte ethylene expansion projects recently moved into their final stages. Throughout the year, our NGL and condensate supply programs provided a competitive edge contributing to what I believe was industry leading performance.","Beyond the U.S. olefins area, our Chinese propylene oxide project advanced to the Memorandum of Understanding stage. In Europe, our butadiene expansion of ethylene is well into construction within estimated completion date of mid-year 2013. We have also restructured the European commercial organization to better reflect the market environment. We are consulting with our works council on additional actions in European manufacturing and R&D to further improve our cost structure and competitiveness in the region. Overall 2012 was a very successful year, both in terms of our annual results and our progress on growth initiatives.","On the bottom of the page, we show EBITDA results by segment. As I mentioned, the O&P-Americas and Intermediates and Derivatives segments were standouts. The O&P-EAI segment remains in trope conditions necessitating the focus on improving cost structure and market segmentation. Our refinery performed inline with other large heavy, solid crude Gulf Coast refineries.","Let\u2019s turn to slide number 7, and look at some of the metrics that drove our performance. Across the top of the page, we have plotted our key volumes. I want to focus your attention on U.S. ethylene production. Our cracker operations have been rock solid. We have seeded name plate capacity in both the third and fourth quarters of 2012. Ethylene margins have been excellent during this period. Our reliable operations have allowed us to capitalize fully on the opportunities presented.","U.S. polyethylene spreads have been relatively consistent. European Olefins & Polyolefin margins have been under pressure in 2012. Oxyfuel margins have been excellent as you can see on the bottom right hand part of the page. The natural gas to brine oil ratio has been an important driver of this trend.","The final part shows the key industry metric for our refinery. While the Maya 2-1-1 spread has increased with time, it only tells part of the story. Our product values such as petroleum, coke and LGPs have negatively impacted our results. Overall, these charts provide a reasonable perspective of the margin and volume factors that have contributed to our success over the past several years.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks Jim. Please turn to slide 8, which shows our fourth quarter and full-year segment EBITDA. The fourth quarter generally reflected the trends and conditions that prevailed throughout 2012 with the overlay of typical seasonal items. The O&P segment results reflect the contrast between North America benefiting from low NGL base cost, while EAI results tend to reflect the impact of crude pricing, a weak regional economy and weak industry supply demand balances.","In Intermediates and Derivatives, the chemical products led by PO and PO derivatives, have continued to realize good study results. Oxyfuels posted seasonally good results, but declined relative to the third quarter. In contrast to the share related benefits enjoyed by O&P-Americas, and I&B segments, the refining segment margins were negatively impacted by low byproduct values. Jim will cover details a little later. The bar-chart on the right side of the page shows relatively similar trends across the segments for the full year data.","Now, let's turn to slide 9, and see how we deployed the cash during 2012 and over the past two and half years. Operations generated approximately $4.8 billion of cash during 2012. We invested $1.1 billion in CapEx, it was slightly more than a third of it devoted to our growth program.","Cash income taxes were $260 million and $640 million was incurred in financing costs and interests. During the year we paid slightly more than $2.4 billion to our shareholders through dividends, while exiting the year with slightly more than $2.7 billion in cash on the balance sheet.","On the right, you can see the disposition of cash since our emergence. Most notably you can see that in the last two and half years, we have returned cash of approximately $5.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders, while reducing our debt by $2.8 billion.","Regarding future use of discretionary cash, as of the first of the year, the Dutch tax constraint that limited our share repurchase flexibility, expired. Dutch law requires shareholder authorization for share repurchases. We are discussing our options with the supervisory board regarding going to shareholders or authorization, at the May Annual Meeting of shareholders. If we do seek and receive shareholder authorization in May, the number of shares that ultimately may be repurchased if any and the timing, and manner of any repurchases would be determined by management with the prior approval of the supervisory board in light of prevailing market conditions, our available resources and other factors.","Let's turn to slide 10, and review the history around some of the key cash flow items. The charts are generally self-explanatory. And the top left chart consistent with the Company\u2019s philosophy of flat to down costs, our underlying cash fixed cost have essentially been unchanged since 2009 despite inflationary pressures.","Our capital program has increased as we invest in growth opportunities. Working capital has remained flat in the chart on the bottom right brings it all together showing increasing free cash flow. Since this is the beginning of a new year, I expect that some of you may have some modeling questions. Regarding capital, we are planning to spend approximately $1.5 billion during 2013. Approximately half of this targeted toward our growth program.","We expect cash interest expense to be approximately $260 million based on $4.4 billion of total debt and an average interest rate of approximately 5.6%. Additionally there should be an estimated $5 million per quarter to amortize financing fees. Annual book depreciation and amortization should be slightly higher than the $983 million incurred during 2012.","We plan to make regular contributions that total approximately $210 million to our pension programs and estimate and expense of approximately $70 million. We currently do not anticipate any additional special pension contributions.","Regarding taxes, we currently expect a book rate of approximately 31%, cash taxes are expected to increase from 2012 to around 29%. Our anticipated cash tax rate is higher due to the high percentage of U.S. earnings coupled with relatively low depreciation and interest reductions. Unlike 2012 the current year will not benefit from an accelerated depreciation under the U.S. Jobs Act, prior year refund or a prior year interest deduction carry forward.","With that, I\u2019ll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.","","James L. Gallogly","Thanks, Karyn. Let\u2019s discuss segment performance beginning on slide number 11, with Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $769 million, a decline of $51 million versus the third quarter. However, excluding the impact of the third quarter, lower cost to market inventory credit, underlying EBITDA increased by $20 million. For the full year, our segment EBITDA was $2.96 billion, an outstanding year. Let's discuss a few of specifics that put the quarterly results in perspective.","First, relative to the third quarter, our ethylene results improved, for the second consecutive quarter, our production exceeded name plate capacity. Ethylene margin expanded as the sale price increased by approximately $0.02 per pound. And polyolefins, our average polyethylene price increased by approximately $0.01 per pound versus the third quarter, while polypropylene price increased by approximately $0.03 cents per pound. Compared to the third quarter, polyethylene volumes were unchanged while the polypropylene volumes declined by 6%. Within polyethylene, exports were approximately 20% of sales.","For the full year, results surpassed 2011 by $823 million, primarily due to our higher ethylene margins of $0.08 per pound and strong ethylene production. Polyolefin results also improved versus 2011 contributing approximately 50% of the segment EBITDA.","Overall, 2012 was an excellent year. The fundamentals that supported the segment performance last year have remained untapped, but the global cost advantage has expanded. Our efforts to increase NGL cracking in the United States have positioned us to further exploit this advantage.","Looking to the first quarter, ethylene margins have been strong. Ethane and propane costs were low in spite ethylene prices have increased. We are also seeing recovery in propylene and polyethylene prices.","Let's turn to slide number 12, and review performance in Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and international segment. Conditions in this segment have been difficult. During the fourth quarter, exclusive of the $50 million joint venture dividend, EBITDA was breakeven. For the full year, EBITDA was $561 million. During the quarter, our results were negatively impacted by several items including the $35 million restructuring charge and approximately $20 million related to the Wesseling cracker turnaround. These negative items more than offset the credit related to our raw material contract renegotiation.","Within the business, underlying olefin margins improved by approximately $0.04 per pound, contributing to an approximately $30 increase in EBITDA. In Polyolefins, we experienced a typical year-end slowdown. Polypropylene volume declined by 4% versus the third quarter.","As a result, our underlying Polyolefins EBITDA declined slightly. Our combined polypropylene compounds and Polybutene-1 results declined by approximately $40 million, following a strong third quarter. Most of the decline is related to the typical December slowdown while the balance relates to timing differences between raw material and product price movements.","For the full year, segment EBITDA declined by approximately $333 million from 2011, reflecting weak European economic and industry conditions. The decline reflects lower volumes and margins in commodity olefins and polyolefin\u2019s while our differentiated product results were relatively unchanged. Additional contributors to the decline were the turnaround activity at the Wesseling cracker and lower joint venture dividends.","2012 was a difficult year for European olefins business. Through January, we have not seen a significant change in this environment. European olefin operating rates have been in the mid-80% range, consistent with these conditions, we're consulting with work councils to further reduce cost at some of our facilities and within R&D. The fourth quarter restructuring charge is related to these efforts.","Now, please turn to slide number 13 for a discussion of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $305 million, a $170 million decline from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment attracted record EBITDA of $1.65 billion exceeding 2011 by $261 million. The majority of the quarterly decline is attributable to typical seasonal trends in oxyfuels. This accounted for approximately $100 million of the decline versus the third quarter.","Propylene oxide and derivatives also experienced some seasonal volume decline. This was normally offset by increased sales in the aircraft deicers. However, warm weather in certain areas caused deicer demand to be weaker than normal. Intermediate chemical results declined by approximately $20 million also primarily due to seasonal factors.","For 2012, the $261 million EBITDA increase is primarily attributable to increased oxyfuel margins. Oxyfuels represented slightly more than a third of the 2012 segment EBITDA. Results for some PO derivatives declined versus a very strong 2011, but 2012 was still a solid year. Most products within our intermediate chemicals posted improved results, although ethylene glycol margins declined.","During 2012, the segment benefited from the first dividend from of our Chinese joint venture and the payment from the prior year hurricane related insurance claim.","Thus far in 2013, propylene oxide and derivatives have experienced a seasonal rebound, but aircraft deicing sales have remained subdued. During the quarter, we have maintenance turnarounds at propylene oxide plants and our ethylene oxide facility.","In the chart on the bottom right, you can see that oxyfuel margins have improved during January. This improvement is earlier than typical. We believe this is partially related to issues at competitor\u2019s facility and strong demand from South America. Let's move to slide number 14 for a discussion of the refining segment.","Fourth quarter EBITDA was $122 million. During the full year the segment generated $481 million of EBITDA, a decline of $496 million versus 2011. Compared to the third quarter, underlying refining results were relatively unchanged. However, the third quarter benefited from a $24 million legal recovery.","During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $24.36 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 255,000 barrels per day. The value of byproducts such as petroleum, coke and LPG\u2019s continue to negatively impact refinery margins. Thus far in 2013, the Maya-2-1 spread has averaged approximately $21 per barrel. First quarter operations will be impacted by scheduled turnaround maintenance at one other refineries cokers and crude unit. This is currently estimated impact to impact first quarter crude throughput by 80,000 barrels per day.","Let's check back some of the details and think about the quarter and their timid look a little more broadly. Overall, fourth quarter results were good. Our North America ethylene assets operated extremely well and raw materials remained favorable. Conditions in Europe were difficult and we\u2019re pursuing actions consistent with this environment. Across the company, we experienced typical seasonality.","January activity has rebounded. 2013 is starting well with similar teams dominating the business environment. NGL prices are favorable and we\u2019re benefiting from olefin and polyolefin price increases. Oxyfuel spreads have moved off at winter lows, and the Maya 2-1-1 spread has been in the low $20 per barrel range.","Overall, with the exception of European olefins and polyolefin\u2019s conditions seemed to be improving and our people are working hard to build on our strong 2012 performance.","Our growth projects are progressing. We are in the final stages of permitting a methanol restart project and look forward olefin expansion. We have announced additional high return growth projects at Channelview and Corpus Christi.","We look forward to providing more details on our exciting plans at our Investor Day conference which is scheduled for March 13, in New York City. We hope that you will be able to join either in person or via webcast. We are now pleased to take questions, Lynn.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Chris Nocella, RBC Capital Markets.","Christopher J. Nocella \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","Yes, good morning. There has been some pail since price increases recently. But poly prices are penetrating in line with olefins. So just wondering, what type of demand incorporating environment would you need to see for your resin prices to move a little bit higher and the olefins prices, if you capture some margin in that part of the chain?","James L. Gallogly","","Chris, we\u2019re seeing [nickel] looks like in January there is more price increases on the table for later months. One of the things that we are seeing very clearly in the market right now is, due to beginning of the turnaround season there\u2019s some operating issues, that a couple of our competitors spot prices are really very, very strong right now. In certain instances that causes us not to turn that ethylene into polyethylene.","Sergey Vasnetsov","We sell that, in despite of that premium. That\u2019s causing there to be bit of a shortage in resin supply and because of that we are able to push price increases. So all of these things have a balancing effect and we\u2019re seeing prices increase in both olefins and polyethylene at this point.","Christopher J. Nocella \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Can you just walk through the puts and takes of the recent large increase in propylene price as opposed to your portfolio, imagine it will be all patches for the derivatives, but just how do you look at that?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, propylene prices have been coming up. As you know, we do make a fair amount of propylene and that\u2019s been good for us. That puts some pressure on our polypropylene business. There is usually a lag in getting that push through the market and our propylene oxide business, there is also a bit of a lag, but remember that a lot of those are contracts that are indexed and so we\u2019ll pick that up in fairly short order again in those contracts. So there is some impact on us, generally its pretty neutral thing.","Christopher J. Nocella \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great, thanks.","Operator"," ","The next question comes from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co."," ","Thanks. Jim, I think in the past, you talked about some skepticism about build rates or some of the new capacity in the U.S. and in your role as a licensor, you have a good look. Can you give us an update on what you are seeing there?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah. At this point in time, you don\u2019t see a lot of people out there trying to license polyolefins plants, we heard of a few things that are out there on the horizon, but they are out there in the distance a bit. They are usually related to a PDH unit in the polypropylene. We\u2019ll see if all of those projects happen. I'm a bit more skeptical, the most on this propane advantage, it's very, very strong right now, but as you know propane unlike ethane can be put on a boat. And over time, there will be more propane export here in the United States.","You see people putting those export facilities in place even this year with some expected expansion over the next couple of years. The E&P guys simply are not going to sit here and let propane prices advantage downstream users so much without taking action. So I think some of those projects won't go forward that have been announced.","On the ethylene side, there\u2019s been a lot of announcements. I think there's a reasonable number of those projects that will go forward, but we\u2019ll see about some of the more recently announced ones whether they will actually happen. We continue to steady our condo cracker, but our strategy has been pretty clear. We are going to work cheaper debottlenecks and get that capacity up very, very soon.","As you know, we\u2019re talking 2014 to a look forward. We\u2019ll talk more on Investor Day about our Channelview and Corpus Christi assets, but I think you will see some very, very interesting strong return projects there. We will beat the competition getting that ethylene to market.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","And have you sensed any increased willingness of the mid-stream guys to sell fixed-price ethane, I know they\u2019ve started selling the fixed price gas deals, is there any chance that can happen?","James L. Gallogly","","Right now, there seems to be no reason for us to look at that. And prompt barrels are readily available, inventories are very high on ethane, and so we\u2019re feeling very good about our position at this point in time.","Robert A. Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Andy Cash,\tSunTrust.","Andy W. Cash \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi, good morning, Jim. I was curious if you could give us your perspective on your naphtha based assets in light of the natural gas environment in the U.S., on the one hand maybe it makes sense to try and spend them off or somehow exit. On the other hand, maybe there\u2019s a good reason to keep them. Maybe it\u2019s not a good choice right now. So I am just curious if you could give us your perspective on that?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, most of our naphtha based assets are in Europe. We're looking at alternative feedstocks. There will be some NGLs available maybe a little more, some condensate pricing a little differently than they used to because South Texas is providing lot of material into the Gulf Coast now and some of the Algerian condensates and feedstocks like that are now going into Europe. And so, that's a bit helpful to us.","We're looking at our other supply dynamics, but simply put Europe is a tough environment right now and so we're doing what we can about that. And that's taking cost out. We're extremely disciplined on that and we've already achieved a lot and we're in the process of doing more.","Andy W. Cash \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, so\u2026","James L. Gallogly","These assets will get better. Remember, we're in a trough environment. And as the world economies come up, those assets will improve and China is showing signs of improving. And when that happens, some of the Middle East product that's flowing into the Southern Europe will begin flowing more into China and we should see an uptick in Europe.","","Andy W. Cash \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And if I could ask another question, you mentioned China, I think the last couple of MTO plans that are built there are based on imported gas base methanol. And I am curious, how do you view the outlook for MTO plants over there and how they may impact China\u2019s appetite for the polyolefin imports?","James L. Gallogly","Well, there is some added capacity that's coming on. Some of that's fairly, well \u2013 they were expensive capital projects. We'll have to see how the returns are, but I think that will keep a bit of a lid on how much more of that goes forward. The United States should become a much larger exporter. We are at 20% here on the fourth quarter, but we\u2019re typically more 15%. But as new capacity comes on line it will not just be the Middle East bringing low cost capacity into Asia, it will also be the United States. And so, that should put a bit of a lid on some of the expansions that are announced there. Simply put they won't have the competitive price advantage that we have in these lower cost environments.","Andy W. Cash \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Thank you very much.","","Operator","Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, hi Jim. As the midstream guys are adding capacity all over the place and first question is on shale oil from Bakken. When that begins to come down to the Gulf Coast, how do you see your cracks were changing and would you go lighter on your refinery?","James L. Gallogly","Some of that product is getting to the Gulf Coast right now and we are lightening up our crack some. We typically talk about the advantage of heavy deeply discounted sour type barrels, but right now, as you know the WTI\/WTS barrels are very, very competitively cracked. We can crack those barrels too and we are starting to bring more of that product into our refinery. I won't be real specific about it because this is competitive information, but we do recognize that advantage.","There are pipelines in place, moving some of that product down right now and one of the things that\u2019s happening in our turnaround is we are doing some work on our smaller crude unit to open up some of the flexibility there to crack even more efficiently some of these lighter barrels.","I do want to mention though that overtime, heavy Canadian oil is going to be extremely important to this refinery. It\u2019s not all getting down here today, but as time goes on that will become more and more powerful to an asset like we have.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Okay. And then secondly on ethane pipelines, we\u2019ve seen this Conway MacKenzie spread on ethane has narrowed recently. Where do you see that going in 2013 and what\u2019s the impact on you?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think this is a good new story in all accounts. Ethane was very, very cheap in the Midwest, and now it\u2019s also very, very cheap in the Gulf Coast. And the difference between the two is really a transportation difference and so we are able to source feedstocks competitively price up in the Midwest as well at the United States. So it\u2019s a good new story on both fronts. We don\u2019t have the same brilliant discount that we had last year in 2012, as rejection kind of value economics, but we now have rejection kind of value economics in the Gulf Coast too.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you.","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Nils Wallin, CLSA.","Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA","Thanks for taking my question and good morning. Building on the past question with ethane rejection, I was curious as to what you thought the kind of max limit there would be in terms of ethane rejection going forward within the pipeline limits. People have been talking about 200,000 barrels a day, but of course there\u2019s additional ethane capacity coming online. So I was wondering if you had a view what you thought ethane rejection might be this year.","James L. Gallogly","It\u2019s a bit hard to say, but that 200,000 barrel is inline with what we\u2019re seeing. Inventories are very high and all of that is putting downward pressure on ethane. And at some point you can\u2019t reject certain amount, if you have a burner tip spec, so it all feels good.","","Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA","Got you on that one. And then just on your polyethylene and polypropylene sales sequentially, it looks like polyethylene was probably flat sequentially but this is obviously versus the industry which was down was polypropylene was down sequentially but a lot more than the industry. So was there something that you were able to do in your plans to preferentially move more polyethylene or did you take some share or is it just a better export opportunities for you?","","James L. Gallogly","Well, we\u2019ve been running our polyethylene assets hard all the time and so I don\u2019t know that we increased our share but good solid operations. We are at above doing polypropylene and that\u2019s why that\u2019s down a bit. I think the good new is, the assets are making us a lot of money. Olefins we set quarter-after-quarter flat records in multiple places and so, running above name plate. We made money where the money could be made. Polypropylene didn\u2019t have a very good margin, we did have a (inaudible) doing, it had very limited impact but it did affect our volume.","Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA","Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Hassan Ahmed, Alembic Global.","","Hassan I. Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Good morning Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Good morning.","","Hassan I. Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Quick question about returning cash to shareholders, I know a couple of moving parts here, particularly with regards to the share buybacks. As Karyn mentioned the supervisory board approval and the like, but just wanted your internal sort of thought process with regards to the balance between special dividends and share buybacks. I mean said differently, is there a particular sort of special dividend payout ratio you guys are thinking about internally beyond which you would sort of indulge in buybacks as well?","James L. Gallogly","Let me make a couple of comments and then I will let Karyn add to it. First, I think, it is extremely important to recognize how disciplined we\u2019ve been in a couple of different areas. First on cost, as I mentioned in the early remarks, we\u2019ve maintained cost flat. We took $1 billion out of the cost structure in 2009 and then have beaten the inflation in the last several years. We operate with 13,000 people, so we are extremely disciplined.","On the capital side, we underspent our capital budget for 2012 by several 100 million dollars. We have done everything we can to make sure that we\u2019re spending the money efficiently and not spending just because in the budget it doesn\u2019t mean we want to spend it. We had $2.4 billion of dividends in 2012 and we said we would return discretionary cash. Our philosophy has been that, we said we would do that either in terms of special dividends or share repurchases.","Up until this year, we really couldn\u2019t do share repurchases, because of tax issues and because of market concentration issues. I think what we just described to you in our earlier comments was, we have to go to shareholders under Dutch law, we have to talk to the Supervisory Board first, and we have a shareholders meeting in May and it could be the possibility we have both of those options available to us depending upon votes, those kinds of things in 2013 compared to 2012. But I want to be very, very clear on one point. We returned discretionary cash to our shareholders and we have growth projects with very, very high return, but what we have done over the last couple of years speaks for itself. Karyn, do you have anything else you would like to add.","Karyn Ovelmen","No, just to reiterate, there has really been no change to our financial policy or practice of returning discretionary cash to shareholders. Potential buyback mechanism would really just be another alternative to returning value to shareholders. So if shareholder authorization is sort, management and the supervisory board will look at all those considerations.","Hassan I. Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Fantastic. And a quick follow-up if I may. On the regular dividend side of it, obviously it\u2019s a nice chunky $1.60 in terms of a regular dividend. But again just trying to understand the thought process over there as well that at least historically the way I think about regular dividends is, that\u2019s A companies sort of relative confidence in trough earnings power of that company, right. Now we clearly are in a capacity utilization trough globally. Yet, this is the second consecutive year, 2012 is where you\u2019ve earned north of $4 a share in a trough. So the question basically is, is there further potential for a regular dividend boost as well?","Karyn Ovelmen"," ","Yeah, so our current regular dividend what said is reflective today of our investment grade metrics and our strong free cash flow profile. So we have set this at the high end of the yield and payout ratio, as it relates to our chemical peers as well as well above the S&P 500. So it\u2019s reflective of our free cash flow versus our peers, but it also leaves us room for us to grow it overtime. So currently our policy is to continue pay the regular dividend, increase it over time. So sustainable for ever growing regular dividend, which assuming we\u2019ve exhausted any other near-term positive growth investments.","We will continue to potentially supplement this with periodic returning of value to equity shareholders as we did in 2011 and just recently in December with the special dividends, but the amount and timing of any future increase that\u2019s currently been evaluated by management and the supervisory board.","Hassan I. Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global Advisors","Very good, thanks so much.","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Two questions Jim on propylene. First off, in periods like first quarter of 2013 when we get soaring propylene monomer prices, can you comment on whether or not you can run long through feedstock mix adjustment and metastasis and if so how long can you run? And then second, can you provide an update on your new metathesis unit at Channelview and what that timing might look like for the 0.5 billion pounds?","James L. Gallogly","","Yeah. Kevin, at this point in time, we are running what we call double dimmer mode in our metathesis unit. We are turning ethylene into propylene because propylene prices have really blown out, and is profitable to us. When you think of how wonderful spot values are in ethylene at the moment, to think of using those volumes and putting in propylene tells you, just where propylene prices are. So they are running double dimmer or making propylene and selling that into the market.","In terms of the expansion of that metathesis unit, we\u2019ve basically taken that off the table. I think given the announcements of these PDH units that multiple companies are suggesting. We don\u2019t think that make sense. It did at the time, but I think, as I mentioned earlier in the call, I think people are bit over reacting to where propane is. This is not the Middle East, the government mandate decided they'd like to see extra capacity built using their own natural resources. In the United States we can export freely.","The E&P guys are going to put this product on the board. And over time, there will be plenty of propane, just like plenty of ethane. Propane will start to trade closer to market prices because it's much easier to export it. And so with the amount of capacity I think there is possibility open to build that long. That's positive for us in some ways because we make a lot of propylene oxide and obviously we have a couple of polypropylene plants. But that\u2019s making to reevaluate in cooperation with the rest of the team, that metathesis expansion. I think our money is better spent getting these big bottlenecks down on our ethylene units.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very interesting, that\u2019s helpful. Second question if I may on ethylene monomer. It seems as though you continue to operate quite well. Can you give us a feel for how much above nameplate you\u2019ve been able to run your crackers in the United States and what that has meant for the amount of volume you\u2019ve been able to move into the spot market at premium prices and impact on profit there?","","James L. Gallogly","Well, we\u2019re always talking a couple of percentage points, nameplates is hard to exceed, but having said that, simply being able to do that a couple of quarters in a row. I can\u2019t emphasize enough. In the last two years, we\u2019ve spend a lot of money doing massive turnarounds at our crackers. We\u2019ve done OP-1, OP-2 at Channelview. We\u2019ve gone into almost every one of our units. We did Corpus. We did Morris. We\u2019ve got these as such fresh and ready to run when we have the opportunity.","A couple of years ago, when things weren\u2019t as good, we said we\u2019re going to get these things prepared to be reliable and make money when the sun starts to shine and so that\u2019s happening. We are delivering on it and we\u2019ll keep trying our best. We put huge emphasis on operations as you no doubt see.","Now, in terms of the spot, we sometimes dial back polyethylene and we talked about fourth quarter exports, we can dial back exports and turn that into spot because there is some people short right now coming into the turnarounds and buying lot of product curve.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Mr. Mike Ritzenthaler, Piper Jaffray.","Michael Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the naphtha based assets questions that you had addressed earlier. Can you discuss the EBITDA impact of the various puts and takes? You talked about averages and so forth that happened in 4Q and then can you give us a sense for the cost saving initiatives in the international O&P segment that have been completed and how much further you believe that has to go this year?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah. In terms of what we did at Wesseling, we mentioned that was about $20 million impact to that turnaround and margins weren\u2019t that great. We were able to cover a little bit here and there, but it was back $20 million. There is always an expense side to it turnaround as well and we don\u2019t put those numbers out technically.","In terms of what we have done already, I think you have to recognize that the time we do the action, it take a couple of years to get a payout in Europe. It\u2019s different than the United States. We have already at least in the neighborhood $50 million.","We are working on a couple of more pretty significant items. Because we\u2019re in discussions with the works council, we don\u2019t make those numbers public, because it\u2019s appropriate that we have that dialog with our employees. I am really proud of that group too because under the tough conditions that they\u2019ve had they are still \u2013 when you look at competitive pricing and the way we run the assets, we\u2019re right up there in the top quartile and the values we receive for our products is just a tough environment.","So we\u2019ve been very respectful to our works councils, working with them closely, but we\u2019ve also been very clear the cost have to come down that\u2019s a lever that we can use and we\u2019re going to.","Michael Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","Okay, great and then on the current efficiency in North America as well I guess it\u2019s a similar type of question, but with ethane having hit something of a bit of a floor here at least in the near-term. What other levels can you pull from an efficiency stand point like outside of debottlenecking to incur growth and what \u2013 can you just give us a flavor for where those types of things are working on?","James L. Gallogly","Well I think that we continue to increase the amount of ethane that we crack. We set it fairly quickly, but 10% change last year, and the amount of NGL\u2019s that we cracked was \u2013 and that's very, very strong. That took a lot of hard work and engineering, a few tweaks and things, doing a little debottleneck here and there to get that done. We have more of that coming. It won't be that order of magnitude, but we're bringing more ethane into certain facilities.","Condensates, we're getting from South Texas and has been a nice strong plus. So, we work it every day. We optimize the crack, and I think it's showing up in our financials.","Michael Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Ok thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks. I had to hop off the call for a moment, so I hope this hasn\u2019t been asked, I don\u2019t think it has. Jim, you sounded still a little pessimistic about Europe, so I wanted to ask you the bottom right hand corner of that O&P, Europe, Asia, and International slides got some pretty nice improvement in polypropylene margins and I guess being just a little bit above breakeven isn't so terrific.","So I can understand the sentiment. But do you think the move that we've seen so far in January, I mean, how sustainable do you think it is, what do you think is driving it and what would have caused it to reverse?","","James L. Gallogly","Yeah. Well right now I'd still say that there is excess capacity. We do our best to achieve value in the way that we sell our product, but I wouldn\u2019t want to say that we see any kind of a significant upward trend in Europe at this moment in time.","I will remind everybody that in the second quarter of last year when naphtha prices fell fairly rapidly we had an outstanding quarter in Europe. Those things can happen again. But I would say that Europe's in trough conditions.","What could improve is that, we are seeing signs of China picking up and if that trend continues that will take some pressure off of Europe and things will get more or like they were in 2010 I hope. And then as the cycle improves, we will do even better. But right now it's still trough.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","But just in terms of where that polypropylene margin is, should we be expecting that through the first half of the year or no real deal?","James L. Gallogly","It\u2019s a bit difficult to call, there is some moments when it looks little better, get a few price increases, but before I forget to mention this, we also have some pretty differentiated uses of polypropylene. Remember that we have a compounded business that is very strong. It\u2019s always seasonally a little often the fourth quarter is, holidays were taken by auto manufacturers, but that business is super strong business for us last year and we hope that we\u2019ll see that again in \u201913. But overall now that \u2013 yeah consultant calls on polypropylene prices that can change in 30 days, we just have to see how the market develops.","","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay and then just as a follow up, on the last call you talked about MLP\u2019s and you\u2019re obviously very specific, but it come to us when you had to sign a (inaudible). I am just wondering if in the mean time you ruled any thing out in terms of what you may be able to do with that structure.","","James L. Gallogly","No, we haven\u2019t rolled anything out. We\u2018re doing an intense study, I think for a fair number competitor, and doing the same thing. It is a potential option for us and we want to give it do consideration, discuss it with the supervisory board and but we\u2019re not at a decision making point yet.","","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay thanks very much.","","Douglas J. Pike","This is Dough. I am going to have to apologize. We've got about seven minutes left or so in the allotted time for the call. So we will take as many calls as we can. So if people just kind of limit their calls, and I will apologize if we can't take all the calls, we still have a pretty long queue. So we just apologize in advance. Gwen, we will just take the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer, Barclays Capital.","","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, good morning.","James L. Gallogly","Hi, Duffy.","","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jim you\u2019ve talked about at different times some upside from the JV\u2019s particularly the ones in the Middle East as those can run a little more efficiently than they have. Where do we stand on that and how much more upside is there as those give up to kind of world class standard running.","James L. Gallogly","Yeah. Well, I think our one JV has been returning dividend very nicely as it runs well. The PDH unit and the polypropene joint venture also there in Al-Jubail had some hiccups when it first started. That was the world\u2019s largest PDH and as you\u2019ve seen from the unit here in the United States, those aren\u2019t the easiest things to run. We seem to have solved the issue that we had and we\u2019re up to rates in the PDH unit now and hopefully that grows to profit.","In an early joint venture like that, you have to pay down some debt and all before you start issuing significant dividends. I think we have made the comment before. We have good earnings from those joint ventures. We just don\u2019t know always see the dividends and that\u2019s what we reported in our earnings.","So good operations, improving highly competitive assets and but unfortunately as dividends are paid kind of in a lumpy fashion and little hard to predict in our earnings. I can\u2019t say much more than that, but the assets are running well now.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then you had mentioned condensate being a benefit for you, couple of questions back. And a lot of that's coming off the Eagle Ford. So others are doing several projects, one to gather condensate say little more efficiently, but also to put a pipeline to kind of get to the river system. So on one hand that helps you and that you get a little more condensate. On the other it may be a little bit of a negative as they can get it to some of your competitors where you've had a very nice position with your Corpus Christi. Net-net when you look at the spread you've gotten over competitors on condensate from the Eagle Ford. Does that get better or worse for you over the next couple of years?","James L. Gallogly","","It's been very good to have first a day. Remember Corpus Christi, it\u2019s right there in the heart of the Eagle Ford. So there is a transportation advantage. It's been very difficult to get all of that out. Just like the comment I made before on propane, over time the E&P guys will figure out how to move this, but it's still a plus overall. Maybe we won't a stronger competitive advantage and there will be a pipeline discount, but right now, we're barging into our Channelview side and we're able to take it almost straight off the local pipes there in Corpus, so today it's a nice advantage, some of that will be moderated.","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Operator"," ","Your next question comes from Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Good morning. Jim, question on, you talked about the turnarounds at OP-1 and OP-2 in 2012. What kind of a tailwind does that give you going forward into 2013 in terms of additional capacity or just not having to device spot product?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah. We did OP-2 in 2011 and then OP-1 in 2012, they had both down to a little bit, because utilities in 2012, but we Clinton this year, but we have got a big turnarounds in the rearview mirror. And so we\u2019re felling pretty good about where we are at, that was part of our strategies, get it done.","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","And am I correct in recalling that was about $100 million header so to 2012 earnings from OP-1 data?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, Don, I remember the precise numbers. But let me give you a kind of a context of the turnaround activity and in 2012, where we had one olefin unit down for about seven week or so turnaround and we had the other one down for about three weeks at Channelview. So you had that many cumulative weeks of 1.9 billion pound olefin plant down.","This year what we are going to do is, we are going to have to turnaround later in the year at Clinton. Now Clinton is about 1 billion pound facility. So that\u2019s half the size and just the one facility versus the two. So I think that will give you a bigger context on what\u2019s even, where is the market is for everything.","","Don D. Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay, thank you.","Douglas J.

Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Jim, just on ethane, as we hit these rejection limits, would it surprise you if we saw ethane prices drop below $0.20 a gallon for a period of time?","James L. Gallogly","A bit depends on natural gas prices. Obviously, we saw those kind of numbers and even better in the Midwest at one point in time. It's hard to say. I never try to forecast prices, but recently natural gas prices have to come down and we are still in the depth of winter.","David I.

Gallogly","Yeah, in Europe there in the mid to low 80\u2019s, we\u2019re in the mid because we were short structurally, ethylene. So we run our crackers a bit harder than other folks. I think in the United States everybody who can run a pound is running a pound of full out, but some folks have tripped a little bit on operating results and there\u2019s some turnarounds going on, and in Asia I think mid 80\u2019s is probably about right.","Jeffrey J.

Thanks for taking the question. In terms of exporting ethane out of the U.S., we\u2019ve seen a few announcement of the agreements for moving ethane to Europe, can you touch on whether this is something you\u2019ve looked into for some of your European crackers, if you think this will be a meaningful thing for some of the ethane supply coming on over the next couple of years, and any impact to pricing?","James L. Gallogly","Well, there is a very, very limited amount of ethane done by one company that had facilities in place, but it's just really not an economical thing to do. If it was Middle East, ethane would have been moving out many, many years ago. So I don't think that's going to have any measurable impact in the United States.","Douglas J. Pike","I think we\u2019re \u2013 I am going to have to wrap up there. And so I apologize if any questions we weren\u2019t able to take. And Jim can you make a few comments to close the call off for us.","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, thank you Doug. We did have record 2012 earnings, industry leading stage performance and I think operational results. We are a company with intense discipline on cost, our 13,000 plus employees work really hard. If you compare the number of people we have compared to our competitors, they are very, very efficient group.","We\u2019ve been very disciplined in the way that we spend your capital.

We\u2019ll talk much more about this in the Investor Day in New York City in a couple of months. We\u2019ve demonstrated a track record of fiscal discipline. We brought down debt and Moody\u2019s now has assessed us an investment grade company. We underspent the capital budget by several hundred billion dollars last year. We returned $2.4 billion in dividends last year. I think you now understand our balance sheet policy. It hasn't changed over the last few years. We returned discretionary cash to our shareholders, either in the form of special dividends or share repurchases.","One thing that I'd like to close on is, when I joined this company is 2009, there was a bankruptcy.

And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.","Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call, and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.","I'd also like you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. And for more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com\/investorrelations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website, lyondellbasell.com.","And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 pm Eastern Time today until 11 pm Eastern Time on November 26, by calling 800-839-5569 in the United States and 402-998-1150 outside the United States, and the pass code for both numbers is 9511. And during today's call, we'll focus on third quarter 2012 performance, the current environment, and the near-term outlook.","With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","","Jim Gallogly","","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompany this call, and are available on our website.","Let's begin by taking a look at page 4 and reviewing a few financial highlights. Income from continuing operations was $851 million and EBITDA was $1.57 billion. The quarter included some items that are not reflective of the underlying business and exclusive of these, income from continuing operations was $791 million.","Our earnings per share were $1.47 or $1.36 exclusive of the items that I referenced. I also want to highlight that we announced both $2.75 special dividend as well as a regular $0.40 per share interim dividend. Overall it was another very good quarter. The fundamentals that have benefitted us over the past couple of years continue to drive our success.","Key areas of strength were North American ethylene margins and production above our nameplate capacity as well as record profitability for the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Karyn and I will delve into more details during the call, but before doing that, I want to highlight another bright spot, our safety performance. And so I had number 5 you can see that our safety performance continues to be excellent reflecting a focus on the details of operations. I believe that our safety record is very near to best-in-class with a current recordable incident rate of 0.26.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss some key elements of our financial performance.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to slide number 6, which shows our first quarter and last 12 months segment EBITDA, the $1.57 billion of EBITDA reflects a $209 million decrease in the second quarter. A majority of which occurred in European olefins operation. Year-to-date we have generated approximately $4.6 billion of EBITDA.","From a segment perspective during the third quarter, O&P Americas continued to generate very strong results with EBITDA of $820 million. As Jim mentioned this excellent performance was driven by continued strong ethylene margins and operations. However, versus the second quarter underlying business results declined primarily due to lower ethylene and ethylene co-product prices.","O&P-EAI produced $75 million of EBITDA, Results from European olefins and commodity polyolefins will approximately breakeven reflecting poor economic and industry conditions. The segment EBITDA, which generated from the differentiated polyolefin products, Intermediates and Derivatives segment generated record EBITDA of $475 million. The Chemical Product results were relatively unchanged representing approximately 55% to 60% of the segment EBITDA.","Oxyfuels results increased significantly benefitting from the strength and gasoline prices and octane value versus feedstock costs. Refinery segment generated $150 million of EBITDA. Underlying results benefitted from strength and margin as Maya 2-1-1 benchmark spread increased to $26.65 per barrel. However, byproducts values remained weak and operating constraints reduced crude throughput to approximately 240,000 barrels per day. Technology segment performance remained steady with EBITDA of $48 million.","The bar chart on the right depicts the last 12 months EBITDA by segment. Over the period, total EBITDA was approximately $5.3 billion approximately 50% was generated from O&P Americas while the Intermediate & Derivatives segment generated $1.58 billion or approximately 30%. As you can see from the relative heights of the bars, the trends over the past quarter are relatively consistent with the past 12 months.","Let's turn to slide number 7 and take a look at the key elements of our strong cash flow. During the third quarter, cash balances increased by approximately $1.6 billion, closing the quarter over $3.5 billion. As you can see in the chart in addition to the cash generated from our earnings, the quarter benefited from declining inventory which you might recall, we mentioned this inventory reduction during the second quarter earnings release call.","On the right side of the chart you can see that over the last 12 months our cash balance is declined from $5.9 billion to $3.5 billion. Operations, including working capital generated over $3.5 billion of cash, while usage included approximately $1 billion for CapEx, $1.5 billion of debt repayment, and $3.3 billion in dividends.","Last quarter, I provided guidance regarding our capital spending and interest expense. Our capital spending outlook for the year remains unchanged at approximately $1.2 billion. You should expect that this will increase to approximately $1.5 billion next year and into 2014. Terms of interest payments, we are now running at a quarterly pace of approximately $65 million.","You probably noted that our third quarter tax rate increased by approximately 3% versus the first half of the year way. Increased results from the strength of the U.S. business profitability relative to the rest of the world versus the first half of the year. A higher tax rate impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $0.07 per share. ","With slide eight, we have included our working capital chart and a few key statistics. I won't go through each rich item but I do want to highlight our free cash flow. Year-to-date we have generated $2.8 billion. This enabled us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders. Inclusive of the dividends announced today our 2012 dividend payments are anticipated to be $4.20 per share approximately $2.4 billion resulting in a dividend yield of almost 8% at the current stock price.","Regarding dividends we currently expect that for U.S. tax payers at least two thirds of our anticipated 2012 dividend payments will qualify for dividend treatment under the IRS criteria. The balance would be treated as return on capital. Of course this is subject to change in refinement. We felt that we should provide some early guidance to assist your year-end tax planning.","Now, I'll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.","","Jim Gallogly","","Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance, beginning on slide number 9, with Olefins & Polyolefins Americas. Third quarter EBITDA was $820 million, an increase of $44 million versus the second quarter. However, these results include a lower cost of market inventory credit, while the second included a charge and an insurance settlement. Exclusive of these items underlying EBITDA decline by $69 million versus the second quarter. Underlying Olefins EBITDA declined by approximately $45 million from the second quarter.","Ethylene production volumes increased significantly as there were no turnaround activity. Our plants ran very well exceeding design rates. Margins declined both to the lower prices and increased cost of ethylene production. On average, ethylene price decline by approximately $0.025 per pound versus a second quarter of 2012. However, the price decline was reversed earlier in the third quarter as gradual price increases were realized throughout the quarter. ","The cost of ethylene production increased, but the increase was generally limited to naphtha cracking as coke product prices declined. Gulf Coast ethane price decline by approximately $0.08 per gallon where mid-west ethane increased by $0.03 per gallon.","During the quarter, 85% of ethylene was produce from natural gas liquids with ethane accounting for approximately 65% of the ethylene production. Propane accounted for approximately 18%. All the Olefin results declined by approximately $25 million versus the second quarter. Sales volumes in both polyethylene and polypropylene increased. Polyethylene spreads declined by approximately $0.02 per pound but polypropylene spreads were relatively unchanged.","Overall, it was another very good quarter for this segment. As we look to the fourth quarter thus far the underlying fundamentals that have benefitted us remain intact. Ethylene and propane prices have remained low and Olefins production has been strong. However, it is difficult to experience some moderate slow down as we approach the end of the year.","Let's shift our focus to slide 10 and the Olefins and polyolefin Europe, Asia, and then international segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $75 million. A $260 million decline from the second quarter, which benefitted from falling Naphtha prices.","During the third quarter, our differentiated products touches polypropylene compounds and Catalloy resins continued to perform well, generating results consistent with prior quarters. We did not receive any dividends from our joint ventures, but they generated equity income generally consistent with the second quarter.","Within Europe, underlying business conditions were weak. Olefins and commodity polyolefin margins were near breakeven throughout the quarter. Olefin production volumes declined due to a turnaround at our largest European cracker.","The polyolefin sales volumes exceeded weak second quarter sales by approximately 17%. Despite the volume increase combined polyolefin results only improved by approximately $10 million. Polypropylene compound and polybutene-1 results improved by approximately $20 million as volumes remained steady and margins increased slightly.","During October, the environment for European olefins and polyolefins have remained difficult, ethylene plant and turnaround has continued into October as planned but we anticipate that the impact on our financials would be minor. Although, we expect continued good performance were differentiated products a seasonal slowdown is typical.","Now please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of the intermediates and derivatives segment which had record EBITDA a $475 million. EBITDA exceeded the second quarter by $20 million. Underlying improvement was actually stronger as a second quarter included an insurance settlement and JV dividends with total $32 million.","Within the segment underlying results for the propylene oxide and derivative products, as well as the intermediate chemicals were relatively unchanged, propylene oxide and derivatives volumes increased slightly but prices declined. The other chemical products generally follow the similar trend.","Oxyfuels EBITDA increased by approximately $60 million as it benefitted from both increased margins and volumes. The chart on the lower right provides a perspective on industry margins. Our results generally follow this trend.","We typically expect a slight fourth quarter slowdown of the chemical products within the I&D segment, we expect oxyfuel results to decline more both due to seasonally lower margins and the impact of a turnaround at one of our U.S. PO TBA plants.","Let's move to slide number 12 for a discussion of the refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $115 million, a decline of $11 million versus the second quarter. Exclusive of the second quarter insurance settlement and third quarter legal restitution related to a former employees fraudulent activities underlying refinement results improved by fractionally $20 million.","Throughput at the refinery was approximately 240,000 barrels per day as we experienced some operating issues in our gas plant and coking process. These were addressed during the quarter but resulted in lower throughput. The industry benchmark Maya 2-1-1 spread increased are approximately $3.50 per barrel to average $26.65 per barrel.","Our spreads that generally follow this trend, refinery continue to realize the lower than just historical yield on the benchmark as the of byproducts such as petroleum coke and various natural gas based products remained depressed. We estimate that this impact on our margin -- impacted our margin by approximately $2 to $3 per barrel versus historic trends.","Looking to the fourth quarter our operating issues have been addressed and we expect to run the refinery at full rates. Industry benchmark margins typically decline by several dollars during the fourth quarter. Early this week the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged approximately $21 per barrel.","Let's get back from the details and summarize the business environment on slide number 13. Third quarter results were strong and the factors that have shaped our results remain largely unchanged. The U.S Olefin business continued to benefit from shale gas opportunities and our plants operated very well.","In Europe, the weak economy and high cost of ethylene production resulted in near breakeven EBITDA but the differentiated products within O&P-EAI generated good results. Intermediates and Derivatives had record profits from steady chemical results coupled with record Oxyfeul EBITA.","Refining crack spreads were good, but low byproduct prices depressed our realized margins. We also encountered some operating problems, which reduced throughput at the Houston refinery. The fourth quarter started with similar drivers across most business areas, however I as mentioned we typically expects some slowing during the fourth quarter thus far, we have not seen significant slowing and we don't expect to experience a decline as severe as we saw last December.","Before we take your questions I want to address a few other points beginning with our growth programs; first the announced projects remain on schedule and although we have not yet received our environment permits the process is proceeding as planned. Today I would like to introduce the next projects that we are developing. The first project is a (Inaudible) Ethylene Expansion. Engineering has progressed we've applied for the required environmental permits the project is expected to have excellent economics somewhere to the port expansion.","Details have been finalized but we expect to add another $250 million pounds capacity during 2015. We are also developing a plan for Corpus Christi expansion. It is premature to discuss this project other than to say we want to say that it is larger than the [Channelview] expansion and looks very promising.","Also wanted to shed some additional light on $2.75 per share special dividend that we announced this morning. Over the past several months Karen the board and I have been defining these payment and our future plans. The philosophy that we have discussed with you on many occasions has not changed.","This special dividend supports our commitment to return value to our shareholders. Assuming that the results remain strong we're fully funding our growth plans, we intend to return cash to our shareholders in periodic fashion perhaps in varied amounts and more frequent intervals. We will also consider sharing purchases as in appropriate.","Management will continuously access our situation and presuming specific actions within the frame work of this velocity. At this time I won't go into specifics but helps itself clarify our intensions.","Finally, I want to discuss MOPs and our current thoughts. First it is our responsibility to consider the risks and rewards round any opportunity to increase shareholder value, this is no exception. We have done some work around MOP concept weather its preliminary there many complexities considering this area so we will take some time to develop the firm opinion as weather this opportunity can be executed by us to benefit of shareholders.","Those of you have come to know our new company appreciate that our style is not likely make projections and commitments, rather we prefer to bring forward our plans and actions when they are concrete and we are convinced that we can be successful. We will follow the same course here in considering the merits of MOP structure preceding assets. We will be tackling our deliberations and bring forward a plan at the appropriate time.","We are now pleased to take questions, Glenn.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from J. P Morgan, your line is open","Jeff Zekauskas - J.PMorgan","Hi, Good Morning can you talk about your beliefs concerning European Olefin and Polyolefin capacity over the next four or five years. That is - do you think that capacity will be similar to where we are now, do you think there will be material rationalizations or - something in the middle that you can't tell.","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, Jeff, I think there will be some rationalization, as you know we've shut down some capacity that was fairly expensive, a couple of years ago, we continue to monitor our assets, I think there will be some industry capacity rationalization, but I don't think it will be anything extreme. I think that's been the history of Europe. A this point in time, margins are basically breakeven, there's obviously some pain in the industry but everybody is working hrd to reduce their costs and trying to address issues that way.","Jeff Zekauskas - J.PMorgan","Okay, and then finally when you chose your $2.75 special dividend, why didn't you choose, $3.75 or $1.75, why was $2.75 the appropriate number.","","Jim Gallogly","","Well if you look at our balance sheet, we've tried to be very conservative, it's - fairly difficult economic environment, we went to be - a big cautious but as we said we will also look at perhaps more frequent and smaller special dividends as we go forward, also look at share repurchases.","Jeff Zekauskas - J.PMorgan","Okay, thank you very much.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar, Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","Yes, thank you. Jim you mentioned, that - mentioned your round two have debottlenecking and I was surprised to see that Midwest crackers were not included in that. So just any comment about that. And then this cracker advantage in the Midwest, once the pipelines get build from (Inaudible) to Mt. Belleview, you think that advantage could potentially go down next year?","","Jim Gallogly","","P.J. first on the Middle East cracker expansion we don't have the same opportunities expand there that we do here. The first question that has to be asked is there additional ethane feedstock available. Now at this point in time that doesn't exist. If it did, we'd be very happy to expand those crackers. But it simply doesn't exist at this moment in time, ","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","At a pricing that was previously available?","","Jim Gallogly","","In terms of the - ","Sergey Vasnetsov","P.J. I just want to clarify for you, because I think we had a little trouble hearing you. Are you asking about our Middle East crackers or Midwest U.S. crackers?","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","I'm sorry, Midwest Cracker.","Sergey Vasnetsov","I'm sorry I misunderstood.","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","The Midwest crackers.","","Jim Gallogly","","Midwest crackers, we've got slight debottleneck in the tap and after a turn around. There is still a pretty significant ethane advantage, but we've already seen that (Inaudible) with pipeline take away capacity, I think it's about where it's going to be for a while, I think it will deteriorate too much more over the near term. And there will always be a transportation benefit to those crackers.","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","And then in your oxyfuels business, in MTBE, you're seeing some good spreads which is really a spread, between oil and natural gas and natural liquids prices. Do you think that's sustainable given the advantage here in the U.S. and that business could contribute at current levels, thank you.","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, as long as gasoline prices are high, and the feedstock costs are low we'll see very significant margins that's been the case so far, so far year-to-date we've also been able to move more capacity more volume and so that's been a benefit. These commodity prices, generally should be favorable going forward because of cheaper natural gas prices, so we're optimistic that oxyfuels would be a good business for us.","Doug Pike","PJ one thing that and you can see it on the charts you do have to consider in the very near term a seasonality of course, you know and that's always been there in that business because the raw material sees some seasonality.","","Jim Gallogly","","Right, and we pointed that out previously in our other comments.","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","Sure, thank you.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Yes, good morning. Jim I just wanted to follow-up on your comments regarding exploration of an MLP structure. I appreciate you working on it, it must be a very complex endeavor given your level of integration. But, I was wondering if you have reached any preliminary conclusions as to whether it would make sense for any of [as well] in those existing assets or would the scope be principally some of the new projects resident in your pipeline.","","Jim Gallogly","","Kevin, that could be either new or existing projects. We have to look at things like where we are on our tax basis, a variety of different things. You could always consider unique assets to put into an MLP. We have looked at that somewhat before, but as you know there is a new ruling and we are going to take a much harder look at things going forward, more analysis to come.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Okay, fair enough. Then on polyethylene resin in the United States, would you comment on what you are seeing in terms of demand trends kind of in the wake of hurricane Isaac dove tailing into your order book for October. What does that look like and do you think it might be strong enough to get polyethylene resin prices higher?","","Jim Gallogly","","At this point in time inventories in the chain are reasonably low, that's particularly true with polypropylene, somewhat true with polyethylene. Days on hand are fairly low. Whenever you have the weather events, you know that can change things a bit, but the most important thing we watch is which way our price is going. If customers think prices are going up they try to build a little bit of inventory and if it's going down of course they are holding of their sales until the - and their buying patterns until a little bit latter. I don't know that that storm will have a significant impact on things. It shouldn't be fairly modest, obviously there is a fair amount of processing up in the northeast, but we'll just see where that goes. I think so far polymer demand has been pretty good and we have been able to move all the product we need to move. One of the other unique things which helped our profitability if we look at our olefins chain, as I mentioned we ran extremely well this last quarter and continue to do so into this quarter. We find that sometimes better to sell spot ethylene than to make polyethylene out of it. We have had those opportunities when our competitors are having operating [missions] we are very happy to go into the spot ethylene market.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Then last question if I may. I think you have had a objective to extract 200 million of run rate savings out of your European operations by year end. How much of that has been accomplished and how much is still to come here?","","Jim Gallogly","","We are working on that very, very hard and we have had a lot success. That number is going to increase. When it comes to cost, I would like to make a very important point. In our Company we generally don't do big cost adjustments at some point in time and announce it in the quarter. I would like to tell our leaders within LyondellBasell start on January 1 and when we get to the budget season you need to present a package that shows flat to falling costs. That's a hallmark of how we operate our business. You'll see that we honor that in the way we do our business day in and day out. We are in discussions with works councils on various matters within Europe and there will be more to come on that, but we recognize the economic difficulties within Europe and we are a Company that addresses those kind of issues. So you'll see a bit more activity in Europe and in other places, but we manage costs everywhere starting January 1, of every year.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Very good thanks a lot.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","","Thanks, good morning. ","Doug Pike","Good morning, David.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","","Jim you are expanding obviously La Porte, Channelview and Corpus Christi, but you have yet to announce a greenfield cracker, where does that thought process stand either by yourself or a potential JV partner?","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, we have had significant interest in a variety of parties participating in an asset like that. Obviously these debottlenecks have really favorable economics and if we can bring those up in 2014 and 2015, we'll be well in advance of the big capacity ways. I think you have seen David that some of the competitors have said now that their schedules are slipping from 2017 into latter years. I personally think you are going to see more of that. We continue to discuss the combo cracker, but our focus in the near-term has been getting this other incremental capacity online, because the as installed cost is a fraction of the newbuild. A lot of people are quoting $0.75-$0.80 plus for newbuilds and our expansions are typically in $0.50 for annual pound range perhaps a little bit less than that. So the economics are just very compelling for the debottlenecks and as we work the numbers, as you can probably start to add some of the capacities up, we are in essence getting pretty close to putting a (inaudible).","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","","Jim, just on potential buybacks next year, what's the timing of when you would be you'll have to buy back stock under Dutch corporate law?","","Jim Gallogly","","The Dutch law changes on January 1, as it impacts LyondellBasell and its dividing paying history. So that would be the possibility, but as I said we'll look at [smart ways] to return back to our shareholders. I think the key takeaway is we'll look at that more frequent and perhaps smaller and see where that take us, but I think that's a prudent thing to do in light of economic uncertainties and we like a strong balance sheet, but we have shown very clearly that we'll return value to our shareholders.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer, Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","","Yes, good morning.","Doug Pike","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","","When we listened to a couple of calls so far this quarter, couple of your competitors look like they are in the mode of kind of ratcheting back a little bit on CapEx. So I am just wondering when you look through the $1.04 billion that you talked about last December. Are there projects in there that because of where the global economics are today, might get pushed out or how do you stand on what you guys announced last year?","Doug Pike","Duffy, we have a very disciplined capital program. The projects that we are implementing have very strong returns and at this point we don't see ratcheting back any of those. As we have gone through the budgeting process this year we have looked at how much we spend on basic maintenance. We are trying to get more value for the dollars we spend and have a great deal of emphasis on that. Kevin Brown is in charge of project execution these days and we are doing a very nice job on all of that. Now there is potentially one exception that was the Flex project expansion there and at this point in time that doesn't look as good as it did in the past, but instead of that what we are looking at is expansions, debottlenecks at both Corpus and at Channelview, and those are actually stronger projects. So we're feeling pretty good about our capital program the rate we are spending it's very, very disciplined compared to the cash that we have generated.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","","Okay, and then of those projects some of the larger discreet ones we can monitor the methanol restart, the PO JV, but of the smaller ones, how much of that should we think about actually comes online next year and starts contributing kind of with that call it 50% ROIC payback per yield I guess when we think about the investment.","Doug Pike","Well we talked about methanol next year, but when we looked at La Porte that was '14 and these other ones look like 2015 when they startup. So, you probably noticed in our ethane usage that we're up. We have got the debottleneck work done at Channel View where that was going to happen. We have done some other work in our other facilities. So you are already seeing some benefit from that. Crackers are running very well, they are running very hard and we are using more cheap natural gas liquid feed stocks.","Doug Pike","Duffy, you maybe referring to the spending on the small high return project. We really started those in '11 and then they typically got kind of a two to three-year sort of payback. So we are just partly through it, you'll start to see those programs really next year and forward.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","","Jim, I had two questions on ethane, one is near-term in the US. I mean, you'd correctly called for growing ethane surplus. We have seen ethane's fuel value premium condense significantly. Do you think we have reached the bottom there in terms of where ethane will trade relative to its fuel value, so it will just cycle up and down with gas now? And the related ethane question would be, we saw INEOS arrange a deal to potential take ethane over to Europe. Do you think that there is other opportunities to do that and how would (inaudible) and those European assets be positioned to take advantage of any ethane exports from the US.","","Jim Gallogly","","Don first on the question of ethane pricing in general. Obviously last year in December we saw real spike in ethane on the [plus] and the gallon. I commented earlier that we don't think that's going to happen again. Things seem to be long. We expect that to, ethane to stay reasonably cheap for the foreseeable future. Could it go lower than this to-date, it has been lower, and so I certainly think that's possible. You get into the question of rejection economics and I know you are quite sophisticated based on reading some of your writing on that. There is always that question how much they want to reject and how long ethane is, but things are pretty favored right now for us and ethane prices remain pretty cheap. In terms of the ability to export ethane, I really think that's going to be pretty limited, that's kind of an expense route you have to have some facilities to do that. I think the volumes will be pretty small. One of the things that drove the Middle East ethane advantage was the high cost they are trying to export that particular NGL cut. So I think that those same dynamics remain true in the United States and the ethane advantage will be something of a U.S. advantage and it's not something we're looking at in any kind of size or scope over in Europe.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","","Thank you.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Hassan Ahmed, Alembic Global. Your line is open.","Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global","Good morning, Jim. Just wanted to revisit the dividend - special dividend discussion just trying to get some sort of guidance as to how we should think about some sort of a maybe minimum dividend pay out ratio, I mean what are your thoughts about that?","","Jim Gallogly","","Well tried very hard not to be specific Hassan I think the reason is because always wathcing the economic environment, sources and usage of cash I think that should give you comfort is that as you looked to what we did last year late last year and here in the third quarter announcement we're returning significant cash to our shareholders, as basically an 8% dividend yield and 80% of our free cash flow, we think we're doing the pretty good job of returning cash to our shareholders and as I mentioned we'll look at perhaps more frequent and smaller in size.","Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global","Fair enough, now on a slightly different topic again the ethane side and natural gas prices in particular, I was talking to one of the methanol producers yesterday with North America and what they're talking about is as they consider new capacity possibly it's trying to structure long term contract with gas process and the like and one of the things that they've been talking about is trying to sort of structure contract such beneficiary to both parties where indulgence some sort of margin sharing agreement with these gas processes so what are your thoughts about that?","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, it's a very dynamic market at this point in time we excited to bring up methanol plant next year, it's been shut down for a while because it will have a nice impact on our earnings as you can imagine restarting an ideal plant with this kind of cheap natural gas prices wonderful thing for us, so we're happy to bring it on we're looking at how we market or methanol but generally those markets agreement aren't something that we as a company favor, I can't get into the details of exactly how we're going to move that product but we have very definitive plan and place already and expect to be able to move the volumes for early nicely once have plans starts up.","Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global","Sure, but I guess what I was trying to get that was that as you also considering some of the Ethylene expansion, are you having conversations with the gas processes and gas companies about structuring some sort of long term pricing regiment?","","Jim Gallogly","","No, generally we're not, we generally play with the market on that and we think ethane is going to be quite long and we like the pricing dynamics, I think a few company started to do some of that and got (inaudible) little on the high side where they thought the prices were going to be so we'll watch the market. Now if things (inaudible) going to change significantly we may change our mind on that but at this point in time we're just kind of following the pricing curve as our ethane moves and frankly I think we've been pretty much right on that so far.","Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global","Very good, thank you so much.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Denson Andrew , Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","Jim could you just mention for us around two now of brownfield can you just help us understand I mean some it's obviously but some of it might be a little more launch why certain projects one round two versus one and are that - should we expect lower returns with around two round one and is there round three?","","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah, Denson I think in round one, we were doing fairly small projects that had very high returns very short pay our I think Doug mentioned that a few minutes ago, that was in part because we were emerging from bankruptcy had to get our operations cleaned up or kind of cost structure and so we were trying to improve our balance sheet and so we tried to have great deal of discipline around our capital. I used to work chapter instead of rounds in chapter two we started to expand and we talked about debottleneck project so that very robust economics.","We announced leopard, we talked about the methanol restart we'd now talk about a couple other expansions that existing crackers that was have extremely robust economics too if you think about where all ethane margins are today and you start thinking about capital and $0.45, $0.50 annual pound range those are very, very nice economics, so we're in that chapter today we were doing those expansion and improving our execution ability as Karyn mentioned we're talking about a capital budget in the $1.5 billion range next year because of those addition somethings, longer term we'll look additional growth projects but as we said one might be a condo cracker but we continue to assess that based on seeing what their competition is doing, our strategy has been the beat them to the marketplace get the capacity up earlier get it up cheaper and make money in the andrium more to come on future CapEx.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and then maybe secondly, just obviously the operating rate over 100% name plate in the quarter, is impressive, can you just dimensionlize for us, how much that help you relative to your future running sort of it a very strong 90ish rate and how sustainable do you think this level is?","","Jim Gallogly","","Well this is Doug, Denson we produced about well it was 2.4 billion pound little 2.4 billion pounds in the quarter. so if that's our basically our full name plate capacity. So if you look at that you take each percent is worth of another 24 billion pound or so in 0.25, 0.30 a pound, the math is kind of right there, and we've been having good strong operations for a while and as Jim said that's where we've been putting our focus and money making sure these things are running well and that were capturing that $0.30 a pound every month and every quarter.","","Unidentified Analyst","So there is nothing incremental in terms of fixed costs or so anything like that that's not obvious.","","Jim Gallogly","","Nothing that's you're going to see that's not obvious I mean of course there is a fixed cost absorption you're getting the variable profit on the in all the increments obviously.","","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah, I think couple important points to think about in terms our ability to sustain that, generally people can't run crackers of that kind of the rate or prolong period of time but we have spent considerable money in turnarounds over the last couple of years where some hedging up to do, but as you know both big crackers or channel have been in turnarounds more like go on and on but we've been freshening up our assets, just finished up big turnaround of vesseling so we've got some assets ready to go and they're showing that they can run in the sustain way. We really focus on those details to shows up in our safety records, shows up in our operating rates and we're very happy to show a less five points to competitors when they're not running.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Chris Marshall, RBC capital markets.","Chris Marshall - RBC","Hi good morning. The very spot on your OMP EIA segment has been your polypropylene compounds despite to slowdown Europe orders, you're still seeing some pretty good growth there so maybe can you highlight where the strength is coming from in this business.","","Jim Gallogly","","Well in polypropylene compound in we have very nice market shares particularly in Europe but also in the United States in to (inaudible) business. In Europe there has been some softening Nevada sales that's been more with a call it local producer himself primarily into their local market, country specific where some of the larger more global automakers still have pretty good sales and we've maintained a very nice market share there and we tried to ourselves on extremely high quality great consistency and the ability make those premiums customers happy and so our volumes have held up pretty nicely you see good quarter by quarter type earning, so that's a business we're very proud off.","Chris Marshall - RBC","Right, and your technology segment pretty stable and frankly not talked about too much on these calls, do you see the potential for growth maybe in your catalyst side or in (inaudible) license for that business.","","Jim Gallogly","","We've had a bit more licensing sales these days there has been some pickup in licensing sales in China, we have great technologies and when people start to add Polyolefin capacity we will always get the call and always get a chance to compete and as you know we have a very nice market share there so we'll expect that we'll continue to have very, very competitive licensing business going forward, now on catalyst that's somewhat depends on how markets, how much Polyolefins are being sold particularly primarily polypropylene when you look at our catalyst sales if volumes were in Europe, that impacts us a little bit but as you know we have worldwide sales and catalyst and they've helped us recently well the people who have come to us in the past continue to come to us, we think we have a wonderful offering and people see great mileage and products out of our catalyst and so done a good business.","Chris Marshall - RBC","Okay. Thanks.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Nils Wallin, CLSA. Your line is open.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Thanks and good morning. Question on the use of cash, obviously you've highlighted special dividends in grater frequency as well as you're continuing dividend, does this mean that you've taken acquisitions whether bolt on or larger off the table in terms of capital allocation?","","Jim Gallogly","","No, Nils, I don't think we've taken that after table we're just very selective and what we do we always look to see does it make us better not does it make us bigger there have been variety of assets that are being for sale and we're happy to let our competitors purchase those they didn't look like they would help us and so we use the word discipline the great deal and our capital strategy, the projects that we do or expected to have very nice returns we're extremely disciplined and so M&A is not off to table but we'll be selective and always use the word accretive.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Got it and just to follow on with that if they were an opportunity, is there anything in particular that looks interesting to you in terms of whether it's upstream, downstream or sort of adjacent to your existing footprint?","","Jim Gallogly","","We try not to be very specific about that at this point in time, we have a very active planning group that surveys risen all the time but look at things that might be attractive at the right points in time and we continue to assess those things talk with board about it but so far those assets have not become available.","Nils Wallin - CLSA","Understood. Thanks very much.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from John (inaudible), Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is (inaudible) calling in for John, good morning.","","Jim Gallogly","","Hello, Avi.","Unidentified Analyst","Quick question on some of the new expansion, so given the large number of expansions in Greenfield out there in industry could you speak to the demand for contractors out there and if you've locked up the people and resources you need to handle the expansions or if there is risk tighter availability or increasing project inflation generally?","","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah, I think that's a point that everybody is paying a lot more attention to and as a result of that you see besides a permit questions you see some people talking about delays and when they might come up that could be an issue in the United States more so then some people expect at this point in time, our strategy has been to get in early and we're working with specific contractors as we speak on these expansions, so you know for adding furnisher and furnish there and doing some debottlenecking it's a whole lot easier project to execute than giant Greenfield cracker.","And so far we've been able to find the resources that we need we've been able to enter into contracts for La Porte and those are progressing nicely contractors performing well so far on that project and as we look at these other expansions we're working with specific firms and I will get a chance to bid on that work and so far we've seen, we've been okay and what we're doing, again if we're in front of that wave that really helps us and people recognized there our debottleneck projects, were bring them work today versus few years now and (inaudible) grand it. Before I leave that I do want to be very specific about our we have started, we found for permits on some of these projects, sometime ago and we're in pretty advance stages impacted channel view I was just talking about that in more detail today, we previously filed a permit application on that, so we're pretty advanced.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great and then I have just a quick followup question on the MLP opportunity, could you touch and whether there any Dutch legal or tax implications that might complicate the opportunity or is that too early to tell at this point?","","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah, I am not aware of any unique Dutch issue that will complicate that for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank very much.","","Jim Gallogly","","We only have I think about eight minutes or so late, so I will ask everybody to try to manage our time and we'll try to manage the time for you, so that we can catch everybody.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Frank Mitsch, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo","Good morning folks. I wanted to Jim, you talked about decent demand in the polyethylene arena, could you talk about the outlook there domestic versus export can you size how those markets are playing up both the polyethylene and for Polyolefin here in U.S.?","","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah, first United States the demand has been reasonably good and we've been able to move the volumes that up, too much difficulty, when we talk about U.S. Polyolefins very, very important point a couple years ago we used to export fairly high percentage of our U.S. Polyolefin production to Asia particularly Polyolefin, that's dropped down to under 2% a day of our domestic production. We do take about 12% down to Latin America, South America, because there is some good value there and some very good customers that we've had for long time but we are not a U.S. based export platform to Asia like some of the other competitors now of course in the old days we have about 15% plus sometimes 20 to Asia, we just don't market that way today. The Asia markets have still been defined for our Middle East production because of the significant cost advantage. And so we haven't had any issues moving the product out to the Middle East. Now Asia markets are weaker, European markets are weaker but Unite States is help up pretty well.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo","All right, great. So about 15% your Polyolefins are being exported today, mostly too Latin America.","","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah, little less than, yeah about that from the United States, yeah.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo","All right, great, and then could you just quickly size the our ballpark the negative impact in the third quarter from the Wesseling turnaround for the Polyolefins Europe the refinery limitations. And then also looking at the fourth quarter in IND the PO\/TBA turnaround just kind of ballpark up for us.","Doug Pike","Frank, this is Doug let me try to do that I guess first with Wesseling in Europe, we don't think that had much impact, probably under 10, for us that's consistent with the kind of results you're seeing and market in Europe right now. In terms of the refinery, run in 240,000 versus 268,000 barrels a day probably around $30 million or so in that third quarter of course we've got those issues are corrected now. The PO\/TBA turnaround that's - that ones going to have on a PO side with the number of plans we have in the system that we have, we cover everything that way, we will lose some Oxyfuel ships over time because the TBA production effecting that. Of course that partially wide time these things into the fourth quarter rather than those strong second and third quarter. So let's just see how margins turnout on that.","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo","Terrific, thank you so much.","","Jim Gallogly","","Thanks Frank.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Thanks, appreciate your interest here. Maybe in extension of that last question, Jim if you look forward for the U.S. industry, maybe to the cost of the big Greenfield driven just after that do you think we're going to need to increase the export numbers out of the U.S. do you think that downstream markets in the U.S. so grow more prominently, where is that Polyolefin in the five, six, seven years going to go.","","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah, Bob a lot of that capacity has to be built for export, the United States market will grow but not to that size, if you think of all the capacity that was built up in China and the Middle East over the prior years, and you think about what we're talking about United States as an overall amount compared to the total olefins worldwide that still kind of the 5%, 6% if I remember capacity addition and should be absorbed if we get into normal economic conditions. But to your point United States will have to become an exporter Polyolefins and I think everybody's anticipating that putting in place logistics for that and so should be an orderly transition, I would expect.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","As you start to consider share repurchase next year is an option for cash flow use? How do you think about the concentration of your largest owners, I mean there was some fair sales earlier this year but I guess you weren't able to buy that stock, could you directly buy from your largest owners and do you have a sense that they like to participate in any share repurchase ratably?","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, I really don't know the answer to that at this point in time, I'd be speculating and so I chose not to it's something that we've commented it on we have to watch, what is shareholder concentration, it was fairly high, that's been reduce slightly but we'll just watch that over time to work those .","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Very good, thank you.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Gregg Goodnight, UBS.","Gregg Goodnight - UBS","Good morning all. Oil prices being down in the last month, certainly beneficial for global heavy crackers obviously polyethylene prices are also down now in the last month about $100 ton or about 7% and my question to you if you guys thought about if we get into a oil weaker oil stronger gas price environment next year what impact that might have online help in total?","","Jim Gallogly","","Gregg, that obviously one of the reasons we're doing so well these days just because that ratio is blown out we still expect it to be very, very sizable oil prices can come down, some gas prices come up, I mean we still have an extremely strong advantage in the United States just on a relative basis compared to naphtha cracking, yes it would hurt the margin but those margins would still remain quite robust, so we feel pretty good about the future, it's always hard to predict oil prices have been in this business for a long time and the all business for a lot of years and they go up, they go down and right now they're still in pretty strong areas.","Gregg Goodnight - UBS","So, for  25 to one oil to gas ratio instead (inaudible) earlier in the year over 50 and that's been over 30 for most of the years is on a percentage basis what impact would you see to your EBITDA?","","Jim Gallogly","","Gregg, I mean, the one thing you have remember and this is you want to look at Brent and Brent crude has been actually averaged around the 110 plus or minus a little bit for over the last year, so you kind of really are sitting in that kind of a range now, we had spoken before about ethane and gas and have a relationship to the cost of ethylene, so that type of move have been and as Jim spoken before about gas has some room if it moved up a little bit ethane has been selling it over Btu value in the past anyway, yeah, so I think those are really the kind of the core you've got to remember two thirds of the world is really driving of that Brent crude price that's there naphtha base","","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah remember that at this moment in time that Brent to WTI differentials around $22 a barrel, so it's very, very significant.","Gregg Goodnight - UBS","Okay, appreciate your insights, gentlemen.","","Jim Gallogly","","Thank you.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Victoria Lee (inaudible) your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Our question has been addressed. Thank you.","","Jim Gallogly","","Thank you.","","Jim Gallogly","","I think we'll take one more question then we're going to wrap it up.","","Operator","","Thank you. Your last question comes from Bill Young, ChemSpeak. Your line is open.","Bill Young - ChemSpeak","Thank you. Once again I am not really clear about on this, your polyethylene versus ethylene trades are pretty bad I think you showed a slight negative on your chart, like there in their enough market here for exports a polyethylene to not things up here in North America and firm out those negative spreads.","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, those are industry quoted spreads and obviously as you heard from our earnings report we're making some money, the values are frankly better here in the United States then exporting to Asia especially after transportation costs, so if we can move the product here, higher values will continue to do that and there is a positive margin both polyethylene, polypropylene, in the United States at present. You'll (inaudible) more break-even as we mentioned.","Bill Young - ChemSpeak","Okay. Thanks.","","Jim Gallogly","","Thank you.","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, let me make a couple final comments, we had a very solid quarter, we're executing our plan we have a great safety record generally reliable operations in Olefin margins are strong as nice to run over 100% your flat capacity. Our investments are very disciplined, we're increasing those as time goes on and we think the shareholders will significantly benefit from that. We've had a great cash generation and that has been able to continue to reward our shareholders and I think that $2.75 special dividend and $0.40 interim quarterly dividend their examples of that, we think we have a great future and we're very much appreciate to your interest in LyondellBasell.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Tori. Well, welcome to LyondellBasell's third quarter 2015 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO, and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.","But before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com.","I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","For more detailed information about the factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com\/investorrelations.","And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on the website at www.lyb.com.","Now, finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time today until 11:59 Eastern Time on November 23, by calling 800-856-2254 in the United States and 402-280-9961 outside of the United States. And the pass code for both numbers is 5671.","During today's call we'll focus on third quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like again to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we've discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are somewhat unique to our 2010 company formation, when all assets and liabilities were measured at fair value, our use of LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in crude oil prices and prices for many of our raw materials and finished goods inventories.","And during the third quarter, we recognized in LCM charges totaling $181 million. Now, comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of this LCM inventory charges.","With that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thanks, Doug. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's take a look at slide 4 and review a few financial highlights from this record third quarter. Third quarter earnings per share was $2.80, with EBITDA of $2.2 billion. This quarterly diluted EPS figure is another new, all-time high for LyondellBasell. And as represented by the orange lines in the lower-left chart, our EBITDA has now averaged approximately $2 billion in each of the last six quarters.","Additionally, we have achieved 12 consecutive quarters of year-over-year EBITDA growth. This sustained level of earnings has translated into diluted EPS during the past 12 months of $10.60 per share. Achieving these record results during a period of slow economic growth and a volatile hydrocarbon environment speaks to the balance in our portfolio. We remain focused on safe, reliable operations and cost discipline.","Our results support these statements and continue to surpass most, if not all, within the chemical space. In fact, our cash flow and shareholder-friendly policies not only standout within the industry, but also among S&P 500 companies. Our dividend yield play successfully within the top 15% of the S&P 500 and our share repurchase program is in the top 4%.","Turning to slide number 5, you'll see that our safety performance year-to-date remains slightly ahead of 2014. We continue to operate as a top decile performer and a safety leader in the chemical industry. While we're proud of our safety performance, we're not at all satisfied. Our goal remains zero incidents. Our discipline around safety that the strong tone defines who we are, and we believe translates into both operational and financial success.","Please turn to slide 6 for our third quarter and last 12 months EBITDA results. EBITDA in our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment was again in excess of $900 million. The Olefins and Polyolefins EAI and Intermediates and Derivatives segments each produced record EBITDA results for the second consecutive quarter.","Olefins & Polyolefins EAI EBITDA totaled $555 million, as supply-demand balances in Europe remained tight early in the third quarter and moved to be to a more balanced position as the quarter closed. The Intermediate and Derivative segment recorded EBITDA of $506 million, strength in propylene oxide and styrene helped to offset seasonally lower oxyfuels results and scheduled maintenance activity.","Refining EBITDA declined by $11 million, but results in this segment have been relatively stable throughout the year. Year-to-date EBITDA is $451 million, $75 million ahead of 2014 results. The Technology segment results declined by approximately $12 million, but are on a pace again to exceed $200 million for the full year.","During the last 12 months, we've generated EBITDA of $8.5 billion. The composition of this EBITDA is in the lower right hand part of slide 6. EBITDA has been fairly steady across quarters. This has been achieved despite a volatile crude oil price environment and again as a testament to our portfolio's resilience and stability. As the chart shows, all segments contributed to our success.","Please turn to slide 7 and 8 and I will discuss cash generation and cash use. Cash from operations continue to be very strong as we generated $1.8 billion from our operations during this period, an increase of more than $300 million from the prior quarter. Cash used for share repurchases and dividends totaled $1.7 billion. Share repurchases during the third quarter totaled 15.5 million shares or approximately 3.3% of the outstanding shares. During the quarter, capital spending totaled $373 million. We anticipate capital spending of approximately $1.4 billion for the full year 2015. During the past 12 months we generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations, while raising $1 billion from a bond issuance, and utilized $500 million of our commercial paper program.","$6.3 billion were used for share repurchases and dividends during this period. $4.9 billion or 73% of our cash flow was used for share repurchases, reducing our outstanding shares by 56.3 million, or approximately 11%. Dividend payments totaled $1.4 billion. We also invested approximately $1.4 billion in CapEx with about half of this amount dedicated to growth projects.","Before I comment on the performance of each of our segments, I wanted to make two broader observations. First, the quarter was characterized by generally stable volume across our portfolio. The second is that while margins in some product areas declined, some seasonally, other products improved. As a result, we generated another strong, stable quarter despite the oil price volatility and during a period where olefins and polyolefins market conditions shifted from tight supply-demand toward a more balanced market environment.","Please turn to slide 9 as we look deeper into the segment results. Olefins and Polyolefins Americas' third quarter EBITDA was $920 million or $73 million lower than the second quarter. As a result of the rebalancing market and declining crude oil price, results declined from very strong second quarter levels as the third quarter progressed.","Versus the second quarter, Olefins results declined by approximately $140 million as our average quarterly ethylene price declined by approximately $0.06 per pound. This downside was somewhat mitigated by a lower cost of ethylene production.","Our U.S. Olefins plants ran at 94% of capacity during the quarter, in line with the second quarter. Our metathesis unit operated at reduced rates and its contribution declined by $6 million quarter-on-quarter. Approximately 90% of our ethylene was produced from NGLs with ethane representing approximately 65% of ethylene production during the quarter.","Propane and butane cracking accounted for 22% of ethylene production. While Olefins results declined sequentially, Polyolefins results improved by approximately $70 million during the third quarter. Polyethylene spreads increased $0.02 per pound and polypropylene spreads increased $0.04 per pound during the third quarter. Polyethylene volume was steady and polypropylene volume declined 5%, partially as a result of maintenance at our Lake Charles facility.","During the first weeks of the fourth quarter, the market remains balanced. Natural gas costs have declined from second quarter levels, while NGL costs have increased seasonally but still remain low. Inventories of both remain abundant. Sales and production volumes have been relatively consistent with the end of the third quarter. As you can see on the lower left on slide 9, third quarter price declines have led industry consultants to forecast lower ethylene chain margins. We do not have planned fourth quarter maintenance, but we intend to build inventory for the first quarter of Corpus Christi steam cracker turnaround and expansion, which will add 800 million pounds to our annual ethylene capacity. We estimate that this inventory build will negatively impact fourth quarter results by approximately $30 million.","In addition, we declared force majeure in polypropylene due to a site-wide power loss in our Bayport plant. Bayport polypropylene accounts for approximately 15% of our global polypropylene capacity and approximately half of our North American capacity.","Please turn to slide 10 and a review of our Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $555 million, another quarterly record and $63 million higher than the second quarter. Olefin results improved by approximately $60 million. Ethylene continued to remain tight early in the third quarter and prices were relatively constant. Margins increased approximately $0.06 per pound primarily from a lower cost of ethylene production due to lower feedstock costs.","During the quarter, we operated our assets at 92% of capacity excluding planned maintenance at our M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster, Germany Olefins plant. We estimated that this maintenance impact impacted third quarter results by approximately $15 million during the quarter. We produced approximately 65% of our ethylene from advantaged raw materials, adding approximately $30 million to EBITDA over naphtha cracking.","Combined Polyolefins EBITDA improved by approximately $20 million. An increase in polypropylene price spreads of $0.02 per pound and 9% higher polypropylene volume more than offset the 4% lower polyethylene volume. Polypropylene compounds results were lower by approximately $10 million. Volume was seasonally lower and margins were compressed by increasing polypropylene costs. JV equity income was relatively constant.","The third quarter was characterized by rebalancing in both Olefins and Polyolefins markets, as the industry came off the high rate of outages that defined the second quarter. Volume continued to remain at second quarter levels, but margins in September closed lower than where they started the quarter. To this point, October margins, as forecasted by IHS, are located on the lower-left side of slide 10, have come off of the levels of the third quarter.","Typically during the fourth quarter, the benefit from advantaged feedstocking declines and Polyolefin volumes decline seasonally with converter holiday downtime. The maintenance outage at our M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster olefins plant is scheduled to continue through October. Based on current margins, we expect this to impact fourth quarter EBITDA by approximately $15 million.","Now, please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Exclusive of the LCM impacts, third quarter EBITDA was a record $506 million, $23 million higher than the second quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results were higher by approximately $30 million as lower feedstock and other variable costs led to the margin improvement. Intermediate chemicals performance also improved by approximately $30 million. Styrene results improved approximately $30 million as margins remained strong and volume increased following the conclusion of the planned maintenance at one of our propylene oxide styrene monomer plants at Channelview.","C4 chemical volumes also improved. Acetyl results declined by approximately $20 million due to planned maintenance at our La Porte acetyls plant. Oxyfuels results followed typical seasonal patterns and decreased by approximately $30 million. To-date, October demand has been similar to third quarter.","During the fourth quarter, we generally see seasonal margin declines in our oxyfuels and C4 chemicals businesses as butane becomes more expensive due to winter gasoline branding. As you can see on the slide, this year is not an exception.","During the quarter, we will complete the maintenance turnarounds at our French PO\/TBA plant and at our La Porte, Texas acetyls plant. This maintenance will impact the production of propylene oxide, oxyfuels and acetyls. We estimate that the total impact of these maintenance activities will negatively impact full quarter EBITDA by approximately $20 million.","Let's move to slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. This quarter, third quarter EBITDA was $143 million, excluding LCM impacts, results are $11 million lower than the prior quarter. During the third quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged nearly $23 per barrel. The realized spread at our refinery was moderately higher than the Maya 2-1-1 spread, but approximately $1 lower than the second quarter.","Crude throughput averaged 249,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 6,000 barrels per day. Canadian crude oil and light U.S. crude oil made up approximately 30% of our crude slate. During the fourth quarter, we are expecting maintenance at the refinery to impact fourth quarter EBITDA by $15 million to $20 million.","Our Technology segment generated EBITDA of $45 million during the quarter, a decrease of $12 million. This was primarily the result of lower licensing earnings. Please turn to slide 13 and I'll briefly summarize the quarter.","Third quarter earnings was another all-time record and marked the sixth consecutive quarter with EBITDA of approximately $2 billion. We again delivered record earnings per share to our shareholders and we continue to deliver industry-leading cash returns. Our operating excellence is the enabler and our balanced portfolio continues to deliver strong steady earnings and cash generation. During the third quarter, we returned nearly $1.7 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends.","I describe the third quarter and the transitional market. The supply constraint of the second quarter transitioned to a more balanced market during the third quarter. As a result, there was some margin compression as the quarter progressed.","Looking ahead, during the fourth quarter, we typically experience seasonal slowdowns in our Oxyfuels, Polyolefins and Refining businesses. Overall, we continue to see ethylene markets that are balanced. Thus far, sales volumes remained similar to the third quarter pace. During the fourth quarter, we will complete three ongoing turnarounds, and our Bayport polypropylene plant has resumed production. However, the force majeure remains in place in polypropylene.","As we look ahead into the first half of 2016, we remain encouraged by what we see. The next several slides help explain our optimism. First, as shown on slide 14, the current oil-to-gas ratio remains healthy and well above the pre-shale average. This represents the U.S. shale advantage, and we remain well positioned to continue benefiting from it.","Along with this cost advantage, we continue to benefit from an abundant supply of natural gas and NGLs. The markets that we serve also lead us to be optimistic. Demand for our products, approximately two-thirds of which go into consumable end users, remained steady. Our products are relied upon for fuel, food packaging and other diverse everyday end uses. Mid-markets grow consistently and in excess of global GDP, as you can see in the graphs on the right of slide 15.","In the past 25 years, global polyethylene and polypropylene demand has grown year-over-year in all but one year, 2008, and we know how severe that recession was. Earlier in the call, I mentioned fourth-quarter seasonality and transitioning to a balanced order. But we also need to look further ahead.","Slide 16 provides a view of global industry supply-demand. Operating rates in 2016 are projected to be very similar to 2015, with ethylene effective operating rates, again, above 90%. This suggests a balanced-type market, depending on industry operating reliability which, over the past two years, has not been that strong.","Please turn to slide 17. As the fourth quarter trends lower due to seasonality, we typically see a demand increase during spring and restocking occurs. This pickup in demand coincides with planned maintenance and we could again see another period of supply tightness in the first half of 2016. It would not be unreasonable for the first half of 2016 to look similar to the first half of 2015.","With that, I'm now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. The price of ethane today is $0.20 a gallon which equates to about $3 per MMBTU and the price of natural gas at Henry Hub order of magnitude is $2.40. And if ethane were trading or were priced with natural gas, it would be at $0.15 a gallon. And there is, I don't know, 500,000 barrels of ethane a day being rejected. So, it seems like there's plenty of ethane, yet a premium has been built into the ethane price. Do you have an opinion on why that is? Do you find it puzzling or straightforward?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Our sense is that ethane demand increased as Q3 progressed, as propane fell more out of favor, propane prices rising through the quarter, so demand increased and I think the rejection rates that you quoted are in line with our views, 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day. This price margin should encourage more of that ethane to come to market. And I would suspect that, over time, we would see ethane trade back closer to fuel value. So, I'd see this, Jeff, as really more transitional.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, for my follow-up, a good portion of your increase in EBITDA year-over-year came from your European operations. And in Europe, this was a year where there were all kinds of operational issues. How much of the improvement do you see year-over-year as being due to transitory events and how much do you see it as being due to steps that you've taken to improve the business in a more durable way?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Part of the improvement in Europe is improvement in demand year-over-year. But I would say that the restructuring work that we've undertaken over the past three years, four years, has really provided the foundation for this increase in earnings. Having said that, a weaker euro, lower naphtha price does increase competitiveness of Europe. So, our end use customers are more competitive in export markets, for example, for film. So, we've seen, polypropylene demand grow very solidly year-over-year, and polyethylene is incrementally higher year-over-year.","I think those are all the factors and with lower oil price and weak euro, we expect that Europe should do pretty well.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much. Bob, I noticed in your ethylene forecast there, it looks like you've got operating rates. You're going to sustain a pretty consistent level here assuming ongoing downtime in the industry. Is there a reason not to simplistically assume that you should be able to continue booking this $2 billion quarterly EBITDA numbers? Or do you think there's some further leg up here as you bring on some new capacity or maybe do some other things with the portfolio?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","In terms of unplanned outages, Bob, it's difficult to really forecast those, right? So, we don't know what's going to happen next year. But the history is any indicator \u2013 recent history is any indicator, then next year's additional planned outages will create some firmness in markets. We'll just have to see how that develops. We do have more capacity coming on next year with our Corpus Christi expansion. So, we'll take a fairly large turnaround in the first half of the year as we bring that expansion on line, and then we'll have more operational leverage in ethylene in the second half of the year.","So, I'm not sure if I answered your question, Bob, but we will just have to see how the operating reliability develops in the first half.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","If I might ask a follow-up. On slides 9 and 10, you show your U.S. or Americas and then the Europe metric. I found it interesting that in the third quarter, naphtha- and ethane-based spreads were the same. And then European and U.S. spreads were nearly the same. Do you think going forward, as you go through the next few years here, that you're going to see the European spread continue to be close to North America? Or do you think that was sort of a one-off because of those extraordinary shutdowns in the first half of 2015?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","I think in third quarter, it was more than just about the tightness in the market. We also had a declining naphtha price which increased margins. As you know, we have a price lag on our ethylene price settlements. So, we settle price on ethylene at the beginning of the month. We buy feedstock throughout the month and in a falling price environment, we tend to benefit. So, there's some of that in the third quarter. I would not expect it to be that strong in future quarters.","Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Thanks, guys. So, just wanted to clarify a couple of your comments. So, I think a lot of us have kind of witnessed the loosening supply\/demand over the third quarter and expect a lower fourth quarter. At the end of the call, you noted that the first half of 2016 could look like the first half of 2015. What drives that comment? I guess what are the factors that go into your expectation there?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, as we sit here today, Arun, I think inventories are average at best, maybe below average in the value chain. We see buyers only buying what they need. We don't see them buying ahead. Seasonally, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we tend to see demand decline in November\/December, fourth quarter seasonal effects. Easily, we see spring pickup, not only in demand but then restocking of inventory to meet that higher level of demand. I don't expect next year to be any different. The year-over-year planned outages on the ethylene side, they're higher in 2016. And if demand grows year-over-year, then all of that points to tighter markets in 2016 compared to 2015.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And on the cash flows, you're still generating very strong cash flow. If you're at a similar level next year, what are the plans and priorities for that cash flow?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, our cash flow deployment priorities have been relatively consistent and I don't expect those to change next year. We'll do growth CapEx where we see opportunity to leverage advantaged feedstock or technology and have a stable growing dividend. And then beyond that, share repurchase is a very good option for us, so I suspect that we would continue in the same rhythm as we have in the past.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Would it be possible to comment whether you'd be announcing any further new projects or considering M&A as well?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","On the project side, we're advancing discussions with our board and we're developing a few different projects and as we're ready to discuss those, we'll certainly do that next year.","On M&A, our view has not changed from prior calls. My view is that M&A, first of all, competes with share buyback and our organic growth program. In the case of our organic growth program, we're leveraging local advantage through doing debottlenecks, not greenfield when it comes to ethylene expansion. So, that's a fairly high bar. Share buyback is also a fairly high bar because when we buy back shares, we're buying back something we know every day and we're buying at market. So, M&A would have to have significant synergy potential, would have to be accretive. And so, we continue to evaluate things on all fronts, but we think our organic growth program and share repurchase set pretty high bars.","Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Bob, on slide 9, you highlight polypropylene margins. Can you discuss the drivers of the expansion and your view of the sustainability of these higher margins in polypropylene?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, David. Polypropylene has been underinvested for the past few years, especially in the U.S. and in Europe. And this is the first year we've seen really significant growth, globally, in polypropylene. A part of that could be that polypropylene price has come down some and it's more competitive with ethylene, especially in the U.S. But we're definitely seeing demand growth in polypropylene. And with the prospects of capacity in the near term not changing a whole lot, polypropylene market in the U.S. and to even some degree in Europe, is structurally balanced and headed towards very tight markets. And I expect that will continue over the next year or two.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And Bob, just heading into (33:02) November, there are some polyethylene price increases on the table. What's your sense for the potential for those to be successful?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","My sense of the market environment at the moment is that our order book is pretty full. We see demand being solid here in the U.S. Inventories are low. So, we just have to see how this develops, but markets seem pretty firm as we sit here today.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","My first question is on styrene. It's not a market we have talked about a lot on these calls, but that profitability has improved. And, at least in the quarter, it more than offset the decline in MTBE. So, maybe, can you add a little bit color on the styrene market? What is the sort of approximate EBITDA you make there? I know it's a co-product. And then, what's the outlook for next 6 to 12 months?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, in terms of supply\/demand for styrene, as you know, it's been very underinvested for years. In fact, demand was shrinking for styrene and derivatives for some time. We now see demand increasing year-over-year. It's been underinvested for quite a long time. And there had been some unplanned outages, as you know, in the Netherlands, there was a POSM unit that had a fairly significant incident which has created more tightness in the styrene market.","Our sense is that the styrene market will remain balanced if not tight, much like I described polypropylene with a prior question. Of course, as that capacity in the Netherlands returns to the market, that will ease some of the tightness, but we do expect year-over-year demand growth. And also, you have to remember that benzene prices come off a bit as oil price came off in the third quarter, so, that also helps margins. But we're constructive on styrene. We haven't said that in a long time. But the styrene market looks decent to us.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And then, my next question, Bob, is on NGLs. As some of these propane export terminals begin to ship propane, what's your outlook on propane, and do you think that ethane becomes more advantaged next year compared to propane? Thank you.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, in the case of both propane and butane, we have to consider seasonality in terms of the competitiveness with ethane. So, in the summer months, we're going to see propane and butane be more competitive and then, in the winter months, less so. The export capacity for propane is increasing, but I don't think it's increasing at a pace where propane becomes disadvantaged. As long as both propane and butane are of abundant supply, then I think they'll compete to be in the cracker slate. And, of course, coal products play a big role in this. So, as propane cracking decreases incrementally going into the winter, we should see less propylene production and that should change the outlook for propylene prices. So, you kind of have to think about the coal products in all of this as well. But my sense is that propane and ethane will be near each other in terms of competitiveness in the cracker.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, fellows.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","A question kind of on the split between profitability in your integrated ethylene chains. Obviously, I think it surprised everybody how much has kind of moved downstreams in the polyethylene from the ethylene side. Do you find that transitory or do you think that that's kind of a structural shift we'll see persist over the next three, four or five years? And then how would that affect your desire to be there net long or net short ethylene?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, I think in the near term, that's more transitory. It's local conditions and situations. As you know, PVC is a large consuming derivative of ethylene, and when the PVC producers are exporting more, they can certainly afford to \u2013 ethylene at the prices where it is today. Longer term, definitely, we're watching to see how some of these announcements develop. As you know, it takes a lot less time to build derivative capacity than it does ethylene capacity. We intend to be a merchant seller of ethylene long term in a similar proportion as we are today. So, we still think that that's an important part of our portfolio. We'll continue to evaluate derivatives and we are as we speak.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then maybe one for Doug. Just on the Corpus Christi turnaround next year as we're modeling that. With the inventory build, with the downtime and then kind of ramping back up, how should we think about that affecting year-over-year numbers?","Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations","Yes. Well, definitely, the first they do, a good comparison is somewhat like the La Porte turnaround that we did, right? We built inventory for that, then we had it down. And it's going to be an extensive turnaround, but is not only the turnaround but the expansion. So, if you can think of it in terms of maybe a 90-day or maybe a little bit longer, shorter turnaround, the inventory builds, what we're really doing is we're buying ethylene now, putting it in inventory, that's why you see the fourth quarter financial impact, and then that'll come out of the inventory as the turnaround proceeds. So, I think those things will guide you through kind of how to model and how to balance it as we go forward with that.","Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Bob, big spread has opened up between contract ethylene and spot ethylene in the United States and it's a lot wider than normal. Could you sort of discuss what's causing that and what gives you the confidence that we're not going to see the contract price leak down to where the spot price is?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, Vincent. At spot ethylene, let me first frame the markets. So, the spot ethylene market accounts for about 10% from the total volume produced in the U.S. Now that includes both paper and physical trades. If you just look at the physical volume, it's like 5% to 7% of the total production, so that's quite small. It's a very thin market in the end. And so, near-term price movements, like we saw in the second half or the third quarter, those can be influenced by very local logistics-type issues, different producer issues, or whatever that might be. But I don't see this as being something that's structural.","In fact, if you look at the forward curve on ethylene, it is in contango and it points upwards. So our sense is that this is just kind of a local situation. And then if you step back and look at next year's supply-demand balance on ethylene and the number of outages that are planned in Q1, my sense is that the market remains balanced to tight. And again, we'll have to see how operability develops.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up, is there any update on the CFO search?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yes. Well, that just remains a high priority for us and we were closing in on a selection. We didn't want to rush into this and we continue to advance all of our finance-related matters. So, stay tuned, we're getting close.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Mr. Byrne, your line is now open. You may want to check if you're on mute, sir. All right. Thank you. Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura. Your line is open.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Was polypropylene market being tight? Is there any opportunity for Lyondell to restart some of the older plans that had been idled in the past, either in the U.S. or Europe?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yes. Good morning, Alex. We're not so much looking at that as we are debottleneck opportunities, as you know. That's been kind of the hallmark of our expansion program, and we have a few possibilities there. So, we'll evaluate that. And this is more of a recent development, meaning in the last two to three quarters. So, we're starting to think about our capacity and the potential here in the U.S.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. And continuing the seam of merchant ethylene market, with the upcoming expansion of Corpus Christi, do you have that extra ethylene \u2013 do you have a buyer for that extra ethylene or you'll need to place it into the market on a spot basis?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","No. We've already contracted quite a bit of that volume and we have ongoing discussions, as we're a merchant seller and have been for quite some time. So, that just comes into our portfolio and a lot of it is already placed.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group","Yes. Thank you. Bob, we've seen propylene pricing come in quite a bit, and relative to ethylene, it's on its lowest levels since 2009 kind of pre the shell boom. So, what impact does is this having on line though? For example, that $140 million sequential decline in U.S. olefins, how much would be due to lower co-product credits? And then with this lower relative propylene price, I know that in the past, you talked about perhaps expanding your metathesis unit. Is that kind of on hold now?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, so in terms of propylene price, first of all, with higher propane cracking and that's what increased the supply of propylene. In terms of the impact on our results, we were just \u2013 as I mentioned during my remarks that we did run the flex or metathesis unit at lower rates. We'll have to watch how well this develops. I suspect, as we work through the next few months and propane is currently out of favor, we should see propylene rise. It has happened already. It's going to depend on supply-demand for propylene, of course.","Longer term, the metathesis unit, that is one of the projects that we have that we're studying. We have to take a longer-term view rather than just what happened this month or this quarter. So, we'll kind of step back and look at propylene balances and our need for propylene, especially in light of a stronger polypropylene business here in the U.S. So, that's still an option, and that's something we'll look at with a longer-term view.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group","Then just a follow up, with the shift \u2013 industry shift in Europe to more propane usages. Has that reduced the effect of capacity industry by a couple points? Do you think that's one of the reasons behind some of the better-than-expected margins you're seeing in Europe beyond just the outages?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","It doesn't impact the ethylene output there as much as it does the coal products like propylene or butadiene, and even that is very incremental. So, I suspect it's not really the driver for some of the things you're seeing in Europe.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Your line is now open.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Morning, Bob.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, Hassan.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","A two-part question on methanol if I may. First question is how \u2013 one of your priorities, obviously, was better for the corporations or better running at the Channelview facility. So, how is that going? So, that's part one.","The second part is that, obviously, you've been talking about evolving tightness within the ethylene side of things. As I understand it, there are roughly 3 million tons of MTO capacity that was supposed to come on line this year. But owing to volatility, a lot of that Chinese capacity has not come online. How does that fit in to your thinking as one thinks about 2016? Will those facilities start coming back on line?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","All right. So, first of all, on the Channelview methanol plant, it's running very well. We've been running at benchmark rates. So, I would say that our issues that we had in last year have been resolved, and I'm really proud of how well that plant is running today. And given where margins have been, we've virtually paid for that restart, so those are very quick payback for us.","In terms of the supply\/demand balance for methanol, I still see the U.S. as being an importer of methanol. Market balances, we don't think change a whole lot in the next year or so. As this decade develops, it's possible that the U.S. will become an exporter of methanol if all this capacity that's been announced will come on line.","MTO plants, they are under construction or coming up in China. The demand is growing as well. So, our sense is that at least next year, methanol supply-demand balance is reasonable for the U.S.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Perfect. And as a follow up on methanol sort of derivative side of things, you talked a bit about acetic margin sort of compressing a bit through the course of Q3. Now, obviously, methanol pricing is lower and continues to go down. But the flipside is that, obviously, acetic supply-demand balances remain quite slack as well. How should we be thinking about sort of 2016 asset yields or profitability for next year-on-year?","Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations","Hassan, it's Doug. I mean, I think our reference to the asset yields, of course, encompasses methanol. So, when we talk about being down, it's more turnaround related as where we were referencing. We've got the La Porte facility which includes a methanol plant and acetic and then in turnaround that's going to come up pretty shortly. But that's what we're referring to in the comments.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. Thanks so much, guys.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Mr. Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. With respect to the oil-to-gas ratio chart you have in there, with oil production continuing to increase, how close to parity you think we get there? Just how do you think that chart moves as we go forward?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","I mean, if you look at the natural gas price where it is today, we're sub-$2.40 on Henry Hub. It's difficult to predict where oil price will go on the near term; but longer term, certainly. There's a lot of production in the world that's underwater at $45. So, my sense is that longer term oil price should come up, it's a question of when and the time that we take to get there. But if you think about natural gas, it's very abundant in the U.S. and so we think this ratio is pretty resilient in different oil price environment.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. And also, on the ethylene supply-demand balances that you're showing, how much of the production of ethylene is going to be for domestic markets versus export markets in your view? Do we have more growth internationally and is that what absorbs the capacity?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yes, you really have to look at ethylene derivatives because we don't really ship ethylene as monomer. We do, but not in material quantities. So the U.S. ethylene production increase later in the decade, will really meet global demand increase for PVC, for polyethylene, for MEG, and so on. And so, when you look at those markets, there's not a lot of ethylene expansion elsewhere in the world.","Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. As you noted that there are a fair number of ethylene turnarounds next year, but there are also a fair number of polyethylene start-ups. So, I'm just curious how you're thinking about the interplay between those two and what that effect might have on the PE spread over ethylene?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, Nils. The polyethylene expansions, I think they're in the second half of next year; most of them are. And those expansions, in the month that they start up, there may be a little bit of disruption, but our sense is if you look at markets at a global basis, there's enough demand growth based on the trend that we've been on to absorb that new capacity. So, could there be some change in the month? Perhaps, but we think that this capacity will be absorbed.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. And then, obviously, your comment just on the question before was instructive in terms of your long-term view around oil prices. However, in the medium or short term, rig counts have come down, and efficiency is decelerating. So, do you have a view on how all that might \u2013 in the U.S. that is, how all that might affect the NGL supply?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","So far, Nils, we don't see a whole lot of impact on NGL supply. I think it's still abundant. As I mentioned earlier, in response to one of the other questions, that ethane rejection still is north of 400,000 barrels a day. That's enough to feed five to six world-scale crackers. And some frac margin will probably bring even more supply to market. So, our sense, so far, not much impact on NGL supply. But we'll continue to watch it.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Rory Blake - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. This is actually Rory Blake sitting in for Frank Mitsch. Just a couple of questions following up. You guys spoke about demand improving in Europe. When you think about the global pace, this constant demand growth, has there been any change in terms of regional strength or how would you guys characterize maybe how things trended through the quarter?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Demand was pretty strong through the quarter in Europe on polyolefins. Now, you have to remember, that normally in July and August, there are pretty significant holiday periods that occur in North Europe, South Europe at different times. If you were to kind of take that out, year-over-year demand was stronger this year than it was last year. So, we're pretty constructive on where polyolefins demand is in Europe.","Rory Blake - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just following up on the feedstock commentary. Obviously, it seems like the NGL view is to be long in the U.S. But given where you saw things trend, maybe in the middle of the year with propane coming off extremely strong. Do you see further investment opportunities to enhance your flexibility or do you think that's kind of everything is going to be parity longer term?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","We do find incremental opportunities to increase flexibility. We're going to do some work at Channelview to increase flexibility to crack propane. I continue to believe that flexibility will be the key going forward. There are going to be times when propane is favored like it was this summer and then ethane and so on. What I would say, it's more incremental flexibility improvement. We've already done a lot of work in the past two years, three years.","Rory Blake - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you very much for your time, gentlemen.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. I was curious about your comment, always wanting to be net long on ethylene. I assume that's in excess of you metathesis capacity and many players like that have a more tapered integration strategy. So, why would you like to be long ethylene even in excess of metathesis?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","I think it gives us an opportunity to, first of all, to optimize, right? I mean, we can participate in the spot market when it's strong via either merchant sales or spot sales. We can increase or decrease metathesis production or propylene production. It gives us another knob, if you will, in terms of optimization. But we're not significantly long. I think our length has been consistent over the past four or five years.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And secondly, I assume M&A activity still doesn't compete anywhere close to share buybacks?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Our share buyback program looks pretty attractive to us at this point.","John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. I have a follow up on the MTBE side. You were talking about seasonal weakness on MTBE going forward. But a lot of the driving the MTBE price has been the octane premium. And the octane premium the last couple of quarters has been, I think, the highest that it's ever been. Do you have any comments on that dynamic and well, where we can expect that to be next year in the summer?","Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations","Hey, Jonas. This is Doug. We agree that the octane premium has been very strong and we think octane is going to remain in demand. If you think about the developing world, you think about the way crude is developing, shale produces quite a bit of high-vapor pressure, lower octane components, engine technologies driving towards needs for more octane. So, that's why we feel quite good about it.","Our comments, really, around MTBE and butane are you do see, though, a seasonal thing. This is something, I guess, I've watched for 25 years. Seasonally, what happens is when you hit the winter months, there's demand for butane, both for gasoline blending and cooking, so, you pull up butane a little bit. And gasoline demand comes off a little bit. So, it usually comes off a little bit. So, those two bases are trends that you'll see. This year, so far, is no different than, really, most years. You see that strong summer period. And they'll come off a little bit. And then, you'll see in the spring, we, typically, will see it move back up.","So, I think you've got it exactly right. We feel good about octane and we feel good about the oxyfuels position.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sirs. Next question is form Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. I think maybe just to wrap up, just one quick question is, you've highlighted a bunch of different outage-related items for next quarter. If we roll all those up, that works out about $125 million to $150 million. Is that right or did I miss something?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","I'm going to be a little troubled doing the math. That sounds a little bit high. But I'm not sure if you're doing a relative-to-relative. What we've got in the fourth quarter is we have a continuation of the asset yields and the PO turnarounds. So, there was one month in the third quarter, one month in the fourth quarter. In Europe, in EAI, they're kind of a similar thing with the M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster cracker, where we have a one month in the third quarter, one month in the fourth quarter. So, we have similar...","Unknown Speaker","Refinery... (59:10)","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Similar impact across those periods. Now, when we get into the first quarter is where we do have more activity, because in the first quarter we'll have a part of the refinery in turnaround. If you recall, we moved out of this spring due to the strike in the labor environment, moved it into the first quarter of next year. And, of course, Corpus Christi will be there. So, that'll be a fairly large activity.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Brian DiRubbio with Tipp Hill Capital. Your line is now open.","Brian V. DiRubbio - Tipp Hill Capital Management LLC","Great. Thank you for letting me ask the question. Just want to clarify a comment that you made earlier. You said first half of 2016 will look like first half of 2015. So, that's just on the EBITDA level basis.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","No, I was thinking more about market conditions and relative supply-demand, the amount of industry planned outages, along those lines.","Brian V. DiRubbio - Tipp Hill Capital Management LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Cooley May with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Cooley May - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, guys. So, if I'm looking at the market correctly, it appears that following heavy planned outages kind of in the first half of next year, the supply of U.S. ethylene will grow 3% year-over-year next year, 9% in 2016 and 17% year-over-year in 2017. So, I want your thoughts just generally on capital deployment during this period. Do you expect to buy back a similar rate of stock or similar amount of stock over this period? And also, if you're looking to keep merchant ethylene as a similar portion to what is consumed, what high ROI projects do you envision?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, in terms of cash deployment, our approach so far has been to prioritize our high return growth projects CapEx. And what remains, we would dedicate to share repurchase. In the absence of significant M&A, that would be accretive. That \u2013 our approach will be similar in that regard.","In terms of derivative projects, I think we're continuing to study a lot of different options in that area. I think we'll be a merchant seller in the future, a degree to which a merchant seller will depend on our opportunity in the derivative projects. So, that \u2013 as we develop those and we align with our board, we'll communicate with all of you on our progress.","Cooley May - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Okay. Well, I think if there are no further questions, then thank you for all of your questions. And let me close with a few comments. We delivered another record quarter despite further declines in oil price and related volatility in end markets. I think this is a testament to the balance and resilience of our portfolio. Our continued focus on safe, reliable, cost-competitive operations, it defines who we are and enable our financial performance. We're a strong cash flow generator with the discipline and shareholder-friendly approach deploying our free cash flow. In the past 12 months, we have returned $6.3 billion to shareholders via repurchases and dividends.","Our growth program continues to focus on low capital cost debottlenecks and end products that leverage our technology. We're increasing operational leverage where we see structural advantage, i.e., the U.S. So, our focus stays steadfast. I hope you see our approach is consistent while we remain constructive about the industry outlook for 2016.","Thanks for your continued interest in our company.","Operator","Thank you, speakers.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Johan. Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell's second quarter 2018 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website, www.lyb.com. I would also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For a more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com\/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com.","Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:30 PM Eastern Time today until 11.59 PM Eastern time on September 27, by calling 866-483-9089 in the United States and 203-369-1588 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 3564. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives.","With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","All right. Thanks, Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. By now I'm sure many of you have seen our earnings release that we put out this morning highlighting the specifics of the quarter. While I will go into greater depth on these results shortly, I want to take a brief moment to provide a longer view on why they are significant.","Every year, over the past four years, our company has consistently generated more than $5 billion of cash from operating activities under a wide range of oil prices and industry conditions. During the second quarter of 2018, we generated $1.7 billion. In my view, these superior results are a product of our team's outstanding focus on efficiency, value creation, disciplined execution and our strong portfolio of businesses. This approach has not only delivered value, but also created the opportunity for us to develop and execute on a broader growth strategy that goes beyond brownfield expansions and is beginning to yield tangible results.","Now, let's begin with slide 3 and review the highlights. During the second quarter, our focus on safe, reliable operations and diligent commercial efforts captured market opportunities, particularly within our Intermediate and Derivatives, Refining and Technology segments. Second quarter diluted earnings were $4.22 per share. Our second quarter results included a $346 million non-cash benefit from the settlement of a prior-year tax positions that increased earnings by $0.88 per share.","Excluding this benefit and a one-time benefit from the U.S. tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017, our second quarter earnings per share represents a quarterly record that exceeds the previous record set in the first quarter of 2018. We also achieved quarterly EBITDA records for both our Intermediates and Derivative segment and our Technology segment.","At our Annual General Meeting on June 1st, LyondellBasell shareholders approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to 10% of the company's shares over the next 18 months. In a few moments, Thomas will provide further detail on how our strong cash flows supported substantial shareholder returns with more than $700 million of dividends and share repurchases during the second quarter.","We continue to advance our growth program during the second quarter, with significant progress on multiple initiatives. In June, we announced that LyondellBasell entered into exclusive discussions with Odebrecht regarding a potential transaction with Braskem. As you might expect, there is little to say at this point in the discussions. Our teams are working diligently to assess the feasibility and shareholder value of such a transaction.","Our pending acquisition of A. Schulman moved forward with Schulman shareholders approving the transaction in June. Antitrust clearances have been obtained from the United States, the European Commission, China, Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and Russia, to name a few. Our team anticipates securing the remaining regulatory approval during the third quarter and is ready to begin the integration process.","To this end, we announced last week that Jim Guilfoyle, who leads our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, will lead our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment following the close of the transaction. Until his replacement is named, Jim will continue to oversee our I&D segment. In June, we continue to expand our joint venture portfolio with the announcement of a new 400 kiloton per year of polypropylene plant in South Korea that will utilize LyondellBasell's industry-leading Spheripol technology to serve customers in Asia.","Our organic growth programs are advancing well with significant construction activity in our Hyperzone polyethylene plant in La Porte, Texas. This is scheduled to start up in the middle of 2019. We also made very good progress in our PO\/TBA project, as we work toward a 2021 start-up. Underlying all of our business results, there's one outcome that is perhaps the most important to us.","On slide 4, I would like to take a moment to highlight the significant improvement in the safety performance achieved by our employees and contractors during the first half of 2018. In my view, this is an important indicator for our investors because of the close tie between safety and operational excellence.","Although it's tempting to become complacent about safety after years of top decile performance, as a team, we rededicated ourselves to the goal of zero injuries and delivered a 38% improvement in workers safety during the first half of this year. We're extremely proud of this achievement and I want to thank all of our employees and contractors who've contributed such great performance.","And now, Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the second quarter.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to slide 5, which shows our quarterly and trailing 12 months segments results. During the second quarter, robust demand for polyolefins supported chain margins for both of the regional Olefins and Polyolefins segment, especially in the United States. Strong operations and markets across nearly all product lines generated record quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, while continued strength in operational reliability and improving markets increased refining results.","I also would like to highlight how increased licensing revenue drove a record quarterly EBITDA of $113 million for our Technology segment. Our Technology group has been increasingly successful at licensing both LyondellBasell's polyethylene and polypropylene process technology over the past year. With this strong quarter, LyondellBasell's trailing 12 months EBITDA has increased to approximately $7.5 billion.","On slide 6, we describe our recent cash generation and deployment. As Bob mentioned, during the second quarter we generated over $1.7 billion of cash from operating activities and over $700 million was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases, as we repurchased more than 3 million shares.","We increased our investment in capital expenditures to approximately $500 million during the quarter, primarily due to increased activity related to construction of the Hyperzone polyethylene plant. After this activity, our balance of cash and liquid investments grew by approximately $400 million during the second quarter.","Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.7 billion of cash from operating activities and used approximately 40% for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program and other financial activities, the cash and liquid investment balance increased over the past year by approximately $1.3 billion to end the quarter at nearly $3.9 billion.","Slide 7 depicts some recent history of our cash generation and deployment. Operating activities at LyondellBasell have consistently generated between $5 billion and $6 billion of cash over the past several years. Our trailing 12 months free cash flow has increased to over $4 billion, with less capital investment during 2017 and stronger cash generation during 2018.","Over the remainder of 2018, we expect to increase our capital investment for growth, as we complete the Hyperzone polyethylene plant and ramp up activity for construction of the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant. Our forecast for capital expenditure during 2018 remains at approximately $2.4 billion, with approximately $1.1 billion allocated to maintenance that supports our high operational reliability.","The chart on the right illustrates returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The foundation of our capital deployment strategy is a leading, sustainable and progressively growing dividend. Our dividend yield of 3.6% remains in the top quartile of the S&P 500. LyondellBasell's substantial cash flow generation continues to provide capability for shareholder returns through share repurchases.","As Bob mentioned earlier, our shareholders recently approved the new buyback program for as much as 10% of our shares over the next 18 months. Our tactics to optimize share repurchase may occasionally produce short-term reliability in the rate of our repurchase volumes such as that seen in the fourth quarter of 2017. But share buybacks continue to be a component of our capital deployment strategy.","With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","All right. Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 8 and review our segment results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $700 million, an $80 million decline from the first quarter. Olefins results decreased by approximately $175 million compared to the first quarter of 2018.","Ethylene margins declined by approximately $0.07 per pound and volume increased with improved derivative operating rates. Ethylene operating rates remained strong across our system during the second quarter, averaging 89% despite planned maintenance downtime at one of our Channelview, Texas crackers. Approximately 85% of our ethylene production was from ethane and an approximately 93% came from NGLs.","In polyolefins, combined results improved by approximately $105 million. Polyethylene spreads over ethylene increased by approximately $0.07 per pound, as ethylene prices declined while polyethylene prices were relatively unchanged. Planned maintenance on one of our two crackers at Channelview was completed during the second quarter. We estimate that the impact to second quarter results was approximately $50 million. We have no significant planned maintenance in this segment for the remainder of 2018.","We continue to see weakness in spot ethylene prices during July, due to inconsistent and lower than anticipated operating rates on downstream derivatives. This is creating length (00:14:02) ethylene. Strong domestic and global demand for polyethylene is supporting firm polyethylene pricing and robust ethylene to polyethylene chain margins. Improving operating rates on these profitable downstream derivatives is expected to provide a more balanced ethylene market over the coming months.","With the recent commissioning of another U.S. ethylene cracker, ethane feedstock prices have increased in a similar pattern seen during previous start-ups of crackers and ethane export terminals. Strong NGL production coupled with new pipeline and fractionation capacity is supporting the recent reversion to lower ethane prices, as new demand is addressed with plentiful ethane supplies. The highly anticipated wave of ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America is well underway.","As seen on the upper right part of slide 9, the majority of the capacity planned for the period from 2016 to 2019 has started. Approximately 65% of both ethylene and polyethylene has entered the markets. In addition to polyethylene, ethylene consumption by other derivatives such as ethylene oxide and alpha olefins is also expanding.","In general, much of the new ethylene capacity has ramped up smoothly, while some of the new and existing derivative units are struggling with operating issues that are temporarily limiting ethylene demand. So far, the new U.S. polyethylene capacity has been largely absorbed by this year's strong domestic U.S. demand with exports only recently increasing above historical norms. Over the coming months, North American polyethylene capacity additions will increasingly serve a relatively balanced global market and China's growing trade deficit for polyethylene.","Turning to slide 10, let's review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, EBITDA was $447 million, $71 million lower than the first quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $15 million. Utilization of advantaged feedstock increased by 3%. Our crackers operated at 95% of their nameplate capacity during the second quarter, exceeding industry average performance by about 5%. Combined polyolefin results declined by approximately $40 million, primarily due to reduced margins for polyethylene. Joint venture equity income declined by approximately $20 million.","During July, global markets remained tight to balanced with robust demand. Industry consultants indicate that three European crackers will undergo planned maintenance during the third quarter. This includes the larger of our two crackers in Wesseling, Germany, which will begin approximately two months of maintenance in the middle of September. We estimate the impact from this downtime will be approximately $55 million, with about $15 million impacting the third quarter and $40 million impacting the fourth quarter.","On slide 11, we again highlight the record-setting quarter from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA increased to $642 million, exceeding the previous record established in the first quarter of 2018 by $156 million. Our assets ran well and allowed us to realize opportunities from tight markets. PO and derivatives performed similarly to the previous quarter, continuing to capture margin strength seen year-to-date. Strong volumes and higher margins across nearly every product drove approximately $110 million of improvement for intermediate chemicals.","Oxyfuels and related products results improved by approximately $45 million due to increased margins and volumes associated with seasonal demand for oxyfuels. During July, oxyfuels margins moderated due to higher feedstock costs. Margins for styrene and methanol are also expected to moderate, as new methanol capacity enters the market and styrene markets become more balanced with reduced industry maintenance.","We will be performing maintenance at one of our three propylene oxide plants in Bayport, Texas during the third and fourth quarter of this year. We expect the maintenance will reduce EBITDA by approximately $50 million, with about $20 million of that impact during the third quarter and $30 million in the fourth quarter.","On slide 12, we describe the drivers behind the $450 million of improved performance by our I&D segment during the first half of 2018. Although much of this year's improvement is due to synchronized margin strength across multiple value chains in this segment, roughly 15% of this year's improvement can be attributed to sustainable contracting improvements and a return to our typical asset reliability.","We've implemented new contracting strategies that improve our capture of market upside without significantly increasing downside exposure. Another 20% of this year's improvement can be attributed to PO and TBA volumes with less planned maintenance and a reduction in the precious metal catalyst costs incurred during the first half of 2017. The remaining 65% of this year's improvement is derived from capturing market opportunities afforded by strong supply and demand fundamentals.","These are the times when LyondellBasell's commitment to safe and reliable operations generates exceptional returns. While not all of this upside is durable, we expect to see an upward trajectory for this segment relative to the annual profitability seen in 2016 and 2017, as we advance towards start-up of our next world-scale PO\/TBA plant in 2021.","Now, let's move to slide 13 for a discussion of our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $104 million, a $41 million improvement over the first quarter. The refinery continued operating at a strong rate of 259,000 barrels per day during the second quarter. The Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased over $5 per barrel when compared to the first quarter. Margin improvements were partially offset by other crude differentials and an increase in blending cost to meet summer gasoline specifications. The cost of RINs decreased relative to the first quarter.","During July, our refinery has continued to operate near nameplate capacity, but refining margins are moderating with a declining Maya 2-1-1 crack spread. In the middle of September, we will begin planned maintenance on one of the two pairs of crude distillation and coking units at the refinery. This maintenance is expected to impact EBITDA by approximately $65 million, with $20 million of that impact in the third quarter and the balance in the fourth quarter.","Please turn to slide 14 for an update on several significant milestones that were achieved in the A. Schulman acquisition during the second quarter. On June 14, A. Schulman shareholders approved the acquisition; and on June 27, we've received European antitrust clearance. In the coming weeks, we anticipate approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. We look forward to welcoming A. Schulman employees to our team and are really excited about the shareholder value that the combined business will create. We'll continue to update you on our progress as we expect to finalize the transaction during the third quarter of 2018.","Slide 15 summarizes a few drivers that could fuel LyondellBasell's earnings growth over the next 12 months. The completion of the A. Schulman acquisition will improve our vertical integration and expand our reach into growing and attractive markets. Start-up of our Hyperzone polyethylene capacity in 2019 will meet a rising demand for high-density polyethylene and improve our capture of integrated ethylene\/polyethylene chain margins.","Our Intermediates and Derivatives team has diligently driven structural business improvements and is reaping the benefits from favorable market conditions. Our team at the refinery has delivered five consecutive quarters of highly reliable operations with improved margin. And going forward, our Houston refinery is well positioned to benefit from new regulations from marine fuels during the latter half of next year.","Turning to slide 16, allow me to recap some highlights. Building on our strong track record of performance, our team delivered another quarter of superior results from our global portfolio of diverse petrochemical businesses. Record quarterly EBITDA results from Intermediates and Derivatives and Technology, along with solid improvements from Refining, more than offset the challenging conditions from rising olefin feedstocks and capacity additions in North America.","Our robust cash flows continue to support both reinvestment in our growth programs and generate shareholder returns. We see continued strength in our business with strong global demand growth for our products in both consumer-based and industrial markets over the remainder of 2018. As new North American industry capacity is absorbed by the market, we anticipate decreasing impacts from short-term feedstock constraints and inventory imbalances across the value chain.","With a solid pipeline of organic growth charted for the next decade and the potential for additional growth from M&A, our team is working diligently to advance our progress and maximize return to our shareholders.","With that said, we're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Bob, question on polyethylene inventory. Typically, converters destock or carry low inventories when they see new plants starting up. So can you talk about where do we stand on inventories in the U.S.? And actually a similar question for China, because with all the tariffs and ban on imported recycled plastic, what's going on there in terms of inventories?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. P.J., I've commented on this at the last earnings call and my view has not changed. I think converter inventories here in the U.S. are on the low end because of the expectation of new capacity coming, as you rightly mentioned, and I think that will continue here through the fall. So, I think any unplanned events will likely cause more tightness in the market.","China inventories, a little bit less visibility in terms of what goes on there. But our sense is that demand is growing at very good rates. Per IHS, the forecast for demand growth for polyethylene is 8.5% for 2018, so a very strong rate, and I think that all points to a very good market in the back half of 2018.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","It is a sort of extension of that question, if you think about these tariffs and plastic bans and all that, would that mean the Chinese MTO plants will run at a higher rate to meet local demand?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think it's possible. First of all, I think we're \u2013 as I mentioned before, we believe that fair and free trade is certainly very important to have healthy markets and a healthy global economy. I think in the near term, demand is fairly fixed. It's a question of how that demand is met. And I think, one consequence of the tariffs could be, yes, that MTO plants run harder. The other is that maybe trade patterns will shift such that China's demand could be met more from the Middle East and perhaps more U.S. product flows to Europe and other places.","We've seen a bit of that in styrene. As you know, there have been anti-dumping duties and tariffs that have been levied, but the market has kind of managed through that change very well. So I would expect that we'd see similar things in polyethylene. And I kind of step back from all the tariff noise and say that global operating rates are very high and demand is growing at very good rate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good Morning.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Bob, obviously, strong results within I&D and particularly strong volume growth within the acetyl side of things. My question is that, one of your acetyl competitors recently gave their views about supply\/demand fundamentals over the next two years. And they talked about global utilization rates tightening by 600 to 800 basis points between, call it, now and 2020. And two-thirds of that they attributed, so two-thirds of that tightening they attributed to just regular demand growth, but a third to Chinese environmental sort of related closures.","So, do you \u2013 first of all, do you have a similar sort of supply\/demand global utilization rate view? And the follow-up to that would be that, if this is impacting acetic in such a way or VAM in such a significant way, I'd imagine there are other sort of petrochemicals and chemicals which would be impacted as well. So are you \u2013 any sort of clarity around this and your thoughts would be appreciated.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes, Hassan. So on VAM, directionally I tend to agree that the outlook looks good. I think the magnitude, we'll have to see how that plays out. But the broader point you raised which I think is very important is that, the growing sort of regulation or a more tightening regulatory environment on chemical operations in China is important and meaningful, and I think will tend to favor our intermediate and chemicals business, whether it's EO or VAM or other products. So directionally, I think it's good for our I&D segment and constructive for the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Nice quarter, Bob. Bob, I know you can't discuss the Braskem acquisition. But in theory, what makes that asset attractive? I know you do like polypropylene, but maybe discuss maybe polypropylene or \u2013 overall what makes Braskem attractive to you and Lyondell?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Well, I've described in the past that from an industrial logic standpoint, there's sort of a consolidation play in the O&P space. It gives us a presence in Latin America that we don't have today, and we think that's a very important market as we look out long term in terms of the Olefins and Polyolefins space. They have very high-quality assets and it's a well-run company. So I think there are a lot of, I think, potential benefits to our shareholders. So, we'll just have to kind of work through our process and see where we come out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Hi, Kevin.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Bob, how would you compare and contrast the propylene monomer market these days in the United States versus Europe?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, there is a very important distinction in the U.S. is that the cracker fleet in the U.S. is much more flexible. So, that drives some of the variability in propylene supply. Generally speaking, I would say, propylene supply remains very tight in the U.S. and likely will continue to be so. And especially, as over the last decade you've seen more ethane cracking, that's reduced the amount of propylene output and incrementally some new derivatives have come to market.","So, I would expect propylene to be more dynamic in terms of prices or continued sort of dynamic as it has been. In Europe, it's more of a stable market and tends to follow naphtha and tends to kind of follow overall cracker margins. It's not as dynamic in terms of price just because of the supply being more stable.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Yefremov from Nomura Instinet.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Good morning. Thank you. Just following up on VAM. Bob, is there any interest in perhaps adding to VAM capacity if there is enough return on capital in that area?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Good morning, Alex. I've been focusing the team on maximizing the potential of the asset we have on the ground today. And so, we're trying to find opportunities where we can increase output and increase efficiency at little or no cost. And I think we do have some opportunities in that area and I'd like to see us reap those benefits before we think about other assets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Bob, you put in some data in one of these slides about domestic demand growth for polyethylene U.S. and Canada, almost 55% \u2013 sorry, 5% (00:33:12) year-over-year in the first half. Is that consistent with demand growth that either you've been expecting or that you're seeing from your customers? And if so, what's driving that level of demand growth?","And are you having any increased dialogue with your customers on addressing some of the chatter that's out there on banning one-time use of plastic? Is that just noise out there or do you see any meaningful impact from it?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, on the growth rates, I think they're really reflecting a very strong U.S. GDP environment. And as you know, polyethylene growth tends to tie very closely to GDP growth. So I think it's \u2013 the growth rates are a reflection of a very good U.S. market and more penetration of plastics into other end users. So, I think that trend is very good and very durable. I've also pointed out in prior earnings calls that, typically our industry experiences most of our annual growth in the first three quarters of the year because of seasonality and the like. So, I think that also plays a role as it does in prior years.","Now, let me answer your question on sort of plastics waste. First of all, there's been a lot of press about plastic waste in oceans and rivers and landfills and so on. I can tell you that our industry understands that this is a very, very important issue and something that we must be a part of the solution. It's a key focus area for trade associations around the world including American Chemistry Council and Cefic and others. And we hold membership \u2013 we have core (00:35:11) members in a lot of these associations and hold leadership positions on many of these.","There is a lot of alignment globally in the industry that we've got to do substantial things to address this challenge of plastic waste. You should expect a pretty significant launch before year-end on an initiative around plastic waste. And I think that will clarify how serious the industry is about addressing this. But on sustainability, there is a positive side to it in terms of plastics. So first of all, plastics extend the life of food through packaging. And if you think about fuel efficiency in vehicles, it's made possible by light-weighting which comes from plastic. So there is a very positive aspect in terms of sustainability.","The last thing I wanted to mention is, here at LyondellBasell we're doing a lot in this area. You heard me talk in the past about our Quality Circular Polymers joint venture. It's a one of a kind recycling joint venture with a waste management company called SUEZ in Europe. That's off to a really good start. And I'm convinced and I think it's a model for a platform we'll be able to replicate elsewhere in Europe.","We also recently signed an agreement with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany to develop catalyst and process technology that decompose post-consumer plastic waste. So, there's a lot going on in this area. So look for big announcements from the industry by year-end as we get serious about tackling this issue of plastic waste.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a question on your outlook, I guess, for both North America and ex-North America olefins. I guess, we've seen some softening in Asian prices. What do you expect for the rest of the year in North America? I mean, on the polyethylene side we've seen some price increases pushed out. You expect ultimately those would have support or not?","And then, secondarily in Europe, it looks like sequentially we are going to be lower on the margin side in Q3, Q4. Just wanted to get your thoughts on those two dynamics.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So Arun, first of all, prices like any year tend to follow seasonal patterns. So we typically have a stronger spring and a strong fall sort of period. That seasonality is much stronger in Europe because of a more prevalent sort of summer holiday season or many factory shutdown \u2013 converter shutdown.","Let me kind of step back and think about operating rates. So last year, globally we had very high operating rates, really near full capacity in ethylene and polyethylene. Now if you look at change in supply and change in demand from 2017 to 2018, supply growth is exceeding demand growth by forecast from IHS by less than 1% from 2017 to 2018. So given that we're starting at very high operating rates, coming off maybe 100 basis points on operating rates is frankly negligible in terms of impact on market. Prior cycles we've seen reduction of 10% in operating rates or greater. It's a very modest reduction.","Furthermore, if you kind of peel that back and you look at high-density polyethylene which is kind of 70-or-so-percent of our output in polyethylene \u2013 actually, this year demand growth is forecasted to exceed supply growth by almost 150 basis points, and we're seeing that in the way kind of pricing is playing out.","And if you look next year, overall polyethylene supply growth and demand growth will be very close to matched; and in HD, supply growth falls short again of demand growth projections. So who would have thought, Arun, that we would have had price rollovers when you've had this much new capacity comes on? And if by the end of the year operating rates have dropped 1% in my view, we still have a very tight market with not so much capacity coming in the next couple of years.","I think it's important as we try to sort of sort through all of the noise from month-to-month, just step back and look at where operating rates are and we got a pretty tight market with normal seasonality.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I was wondering, Bob, if you could discuss the differences in the European high-density polyethylene market year-over-year? That is, why was it such a better market in the second quarter of 2017 than it is in the second quarter of 2018? And likewise, for the polypropylene market year-over-year in Europe. And then, I have a question about how are cash taxes this year versus last year or the cash tax rate? Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. Well, I'll take the first part of that and then ask Thomas to answer the second part of that. In terms of the European polyethylene and polypropylene business Q2 2017 compared to Q2 2018, if you go back to Q2 2017, last year was a very strong year in Europe, and I think many units in the industry or many plants were trying to ramp up and didn't run as well last year. We had a very, very tight market last year.","This year I think you're seeing a more normal pattern where we see summer weakness in both polyethylene and polypropylene. I expect that with fall turnarounds planned and fall demand coming up, we'll see that come back into balance like we do in most years. And I would expect that the global sort of overlay of both polyethylene and polypropylene being strong will bear out in Europe as well.","So, I just think Q2 2017 was unusually tight because of the big demand growth relatively speaking for Europe from 2016 to 2017 and then seasonality here in 2018. So, hope that answers your question, Jeff. And Thomas, on tax?","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay, Jeff. Thank you for the question. So with respect to the cash tax rate, so we ended 2017 with a cash tax rate of approximately 19% and we expect now the cash tax rate 2018, as we have communicated earlier, to be a little bit higher, somewhere between 22% and 24% for 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, everyone.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just two questions, Bob. You talked a little bit about ethane and the price retreat recently in Mont Belvieu. So maybe just give us an update on your sort of $0.07 to $0.10 frac spread forecast. I think it's a bit higher than that now. And secondly, in Conway, a nice big discounts opened up again against (00:43:08) versus Mont Belvieu. So what's the durability of that?","And then lastly, just as a clarifying question. In Tech, can you \u2013 is this the new run rate we should be thinking about from a quarterly perspective, or is any of that licensing revenue in the quarter just sort of a start-up one-time benefit? Thanks so much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Sure. So I'll take those one at a time. On ethane, first of all, I just want to provide some context on how these big tranches of ethane demand occur when new cracker start up. So a new cracker start-up, when it's world-scale cracker like 1.5 million tons, that's about 100,000 barrels a day of additional ethane demand when those start up. Now these are kind of big steps. It doesn't happen gradually.","Now as you can imagine on the supply side, the supply then has to adjust and it takes a period of time, maybe a quarter or so, for the supply to adjust, to meet the demand of these big kind of jumps in demand. I've said in the past as you rightly mentioned that \u2013 I think $0.07 to $0.10 could be quite normal going forward. As you say, we're above that today. But on the other hand, with higher oil prices, the U.S. sort of advantage and the slope of the global cost curve is still quite good.","And we also had in Q2 some issues on the Mariner East pipeline. So that impacted the source of exports of ethane and put more tightness on the Gulf Coast. I think all of this is going to kind of work its way through, as we get to a new normal. But again, when I step back and look at ethane fundamentals, there's a lot of ethane available on the Permian. New pipelines have been announced for Y-grade coming through the Gulf Coast. New fracs have been announced. There's one new frac that's about to start up. One other one recently started up.","So kind of if each frac adds 60,000 barrels a day or so of ethane and more logistics are available to bring Y-grade from Permian, I think this will all kind of work its way through. But you have to appreciate that these jumps in demand are quite large for the size of the business that it is in the U.S. in terms of ethane. So, we may see some blips here in terms of ethane being above $0.10 frac spreads. But I think $0.10 is the reasonable thing to plan around longer term. Certainly, we're doing that.","The Conway advantage and its durability, that ebbs and flows, it depends again on more about Gulf Coast; and up in Conway, very few consumers. I mean we represent a large part of the consumption of ethane up there. I continue to believe there will be a meaningful advantage in Conway and we should reap the benefits of that for years to come.","On Technology, the run rate \u2013 first of all, when you think about our Technology business, there is kind of three components. There's our catalyst business which tends to be very steady. We have service income from licenses that we've issued over the years. That tends to be steady and modestly growing as we have more licenses. You can imagine as we have more units out there that are licensed, we're providing more service to those.","What makes it more variable is the timing of license payments. And if you go back and look at the number of press releases we issued on new licenses last year, there was a meaningful step up from 2016. So we're seeing now the payments in 2017 of that of \u2013 sorry, in 2018 from the 2017 licenses that we signed. 2018 looks to be also a very active year. Again, you go back and you look at our press releases year-to-date, we're having a fairly active year.","So, you know I'd caution you from taking Q2 as a run rate, but I would tell you that there's been a step up in activity in 2017 and 2018, and I expect that to continue. Our focus is in China, more polypropylene than polyethylene. So that's how I would kind of characterize our licensing activity. So hope I've answered the three questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Are you contemplating any major I&D investments besides propylene oxide, given the strong performance in the rest of the chemicals in that portfolio?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Good morning, John. That's a pretty big investment that we're undertaking. So, I'd like to see our team deliver that before we consider others. As you know, we have a joint venture in PO\/SM in China and there is a potential to do more there. But in the U.S., I'd like to see us deliver on our PO\/TBA project which is, by the way, the largest capital investment this company or its predecessors have undertaken. So, focus on execution is also really important.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.","Dylan Campbell - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. In the slides, you mentioned that not all PE units are currently operating at full operating rates. Can you talk generally kind of what's hampering them to come up to speed or to a full run rate, and generally how long that takes across the market? And also with your own Hyperzone HDPE project, how long you would expect that to come online?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So good morning, Dylan. Just sort of anecdotal frankly, but my sense is that operations continue to improve. And your question about how long does it take, I would expect from 30 to 90 days something like that, about a quarter, to get to the grade slate and work out the bugs of these. All of these units are redefining world scale. So, we shouldn't minimize the challenge in ramping up and getting to new world scale.","I'd expect our Hyperzone is going to be very similar. We're also introducing a new technology here. So if it takes a little longer, it may not surprise me. But I don't think it's a quarter longer, it's maybe a month longer or something like that. But what makes I think polyethylene more complex is that you have multiple products and you have to go through a sort of, what we call, a product wheel as opposed to with ethylene it's one product, and you're just trying to get on spec and get to full rates which in its way is also difficult, but a different set of challenges compared to numerous products in polyethylene.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning, guys.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Congrats to Jim to his new job, and way to go out on a high note at I&D.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, we expect a lot of him when he gets to our Advanced Polyolefins Solutions (sic) [Advanced Polymer Solutions] (00:50:26).","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Big job ahead of him. But on that I&D, it seems a lot of the performance was \u2013 the volumes are really high. It seems that practically every unit was operating at max capacity. So, does it mean that maintenance was deferred for later \u2013 or not deferred perhaps, but at least lower maintenance than average? And so, what can we expect [Technical Difficulty] (00:50:55) forward sort of normalized volumes?","And then if you don't mind a follow-up, based on the same question on the Technology segment, how much of that is sustainable?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So on the maintenance side on I&D, we just didn't have much planned maintenance. As I mentioned during my prepared comments, we will have planned maintenance at our Bayport PO plant \u2013 one of our Bayport PO plants in Q3 and Q4. Look, I think we ran well as we expect to run well. We had in the prior period some issues that were uncharacteristic. So, part of that is the step up in volume from our I&D business. So I think the unplanned part, this is more typical what we did in Q2. The planned is, we don't defer maintenance. We typically do it when we need to do it and in terms of our planned schedule, we'll stay on that cadence.","In terms of the run rate and the change in the Technology business, we can't really quantify the change. But I would tell you that, again, compared to \u2013 when you look at 2016 to 2017, there was a step up in the amount of licenses that we announced. The 2017 licenses are coming through in the P&L in 2018. We have a similar pace in 2018 signings that will come through in 2019. But when you look quarter-to-quarter, it still can be lumpy because of the way the payments are done. But I encourage you to kind of think about annual time horizons when you look at our Technology segment and quarterly the payments can be lumpy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Bob. How are you?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning. Doing well. How are you?","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good. Thanks. Could you walk us through what you're seeing in the U.S. polypropylene market? On slide 8, you showed some margin expansion. I think there has been some outages. Where do we stand on inventories? Are the higher absolute prices having any impact on demand? And do you have any update on your potential U.S. PP\/PDH project? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Sure. Well, the PP market continues to be very tight, and any small outages sort of make the tightness more acute. Inventories, my sense is, are average or below average. The industry is kind of working through the usual seasonal high period in PP. I'd expect that to continue until there is meaningful new capacity. Imports have increased because of just more demand in the U.S. that has to be met. And I suspect that whenever new units come on down the road then some of those imports will decline.","In terms of our own project, we're still working through the details and sort of the engineering of that. I want to make sure my team provides a very good estimate on capital so that we can make a good decision and with an eye towards creating shareholder value. So, we're still working through it. I don't have anything definitive to report to you today, but we still see the project as being attractive.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob, for closing comments.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","All right. Well, thank you.

With that being said, now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our website.","Let's take a look at Slide #4 and review a few financial highlights. The second quarter continued the trends of the first quarter but with results that were slightly stronger. We generated $1.65 billion of EBITDA. This led to record income from continuing operations of $923 million and record diluted earnings per share of $1.60.","North American ethylene margins and operations continued their strength. Overall results essentially replicated outstanding first quarter results. We again saw our U.S. crackers operate at or above nameplate capacity.","In Europe, results also exceeded our expectations. Olefin plants operated at increased rates, raw material costs declined and we benefited from a favorable raw material mix.","In addition to record earnings, the quarter was highlighted by further advancing our cash deployment strategy. During the quarter, we raised our dividend by 25% and initiated our share repurchase program.","If you turn to Slide #5, you will see our year-to-date safety results. Overall, our safety statistics continued to be among the best in the industry, but that's not good enough. We seek safety perfection, goal 0, no one hurt. Our record is flat with last year, and we expect continuous improvement. Needless to say, we're not happy with the trend and are redoubling our safety focus.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance. Karyn?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Slide #6, which shows our second quarter EBITDA by segment. The quarter generally reflected the trends and conditions that prevailed throughout 2012 and last quarter.","O&P-Americas generated record EBITDA of $951 million. The combination of continued strong ethylene margins and production drove these results. O&P-EAI EBITDA was $295 million, reflecting a second consecutive strong quarter. Several factors contributed to this performance, including favorable raw material cost variability, competitors' downtime and increased LPG cracking at our ethylene plants.","The Intermediates & Derivatives segment generated EBITDA of $338 million. Scheduled maintenance turnarounds at several PO plants caused a decline in results, which was partially offset by stronger oxyfuel results.","Refining segment EBITDA was a disappointing $20 million. Declining light to heavy crude differentials, coupled with increased RIN costs, were largely responsible for the results.","On the right side of the slide, we have plotted segment EBITDA for the last 12 months. Across the period, we have benefited from strong and growing O&P-Americas ethylene margins and generally strong Intermediates & Derivatives results. Our O&P-EAI results have experienced some volatility, benefiting during 2013 from favorable timing factors and other items that I just highlighted.","Refining has been quite challenging, but we have taken action to broaden our operating window and better position us as the crude oil delivery infrastructure further develops.","Now let's turn to Slide #7 and see how we deployed the cash. Second quarter operations generated $1.2 billion cash, exclusive of working capital changes. A portion of our anticipated inventory reductions materialized in the quarter but were offset by timing impacts and accounts receivables and payables. Capital spending has been consistent with plan at approximately $390 million.","During the quarter, we increased our dividend to $0.50 per share and paid the interim dividend at this level. We also repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares, reducing our outstanding shares to approximately 570 million at the end of the quarter.","In total, during the quarter, we committed approximately $650 million to our dividends and share repurchases. We also made cash tax payments of approximately $640 million. Our cash balances increased by approximately $355 million.","On the right side of the slide, you see similar metrics for the last 12 months. I want to highlight a few items. First, combined operations in working capital generated $5.4 billion. From this cash flow, we invested $1.4 billion in our capital program and returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while increasing the cash balance by $1.3 billion.","On Slide #8, we provide further detail of working capital and metrics that we track.","Before I turn the call back to Jim, I want to mention that during July, we issued 10- and 30-year bonds totaling $1.5 billion in principal. The bonds secure an average coupon of 4.6%. These bonds were the first that we have issued in investment-grade space. We're very pleased with issuance both in terms of the support to investors and the rates that we received.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance, beginning on Slide #9, with Olefins & Polyolefins-Americas. Second quarter EBITDA was $951 million, a slight increase over the first quarter and record performance for this segment. Versus the first quarter, olefin results declined by approximately $30 million. The decline was attributed to a $0.02 per pound lower ethylene price and an increase of a similar magnitude in the cost of ethylene production metric, the latter being influenced by lower coproduct prices. The margin decline was partially offset by increased ethylene sales volumes.","Our ethylene plant reliability continue to be a highlight. For the fourth consecutive quarter, ethylene production exceeded nameplate capacity. Our Americas manufacturing team, led by Karen Swindler, continues to outperform the industry. Hats off to our Olefins plant managers, Courtney, Randy, Tim, Brian, Chris and their teams. I've never seen this type of performance in my long tenure in this business. Congratulations to them.","Our raw material mix also established a new record as 90% of our ethylene was produced from NGLs. Approximately 70% of the production was from ethane, while propane accounted for 14%. The balance was butane, which became a very competitive feedstock.","Increased polyolefin profits more than offset the ethylene decline. Combined polyolefin EBITDA increased by approximately $70 million, slightly more than half from polyethylene. Spreads for polyethylene and polypropylene increased by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per pound. Polyethylene sales volumes were unchanged, while polypropylene sales increased by 13%.","Joint venture equity income was $8 million. No dividends were received. Business conditions in July have been fairly consistent with June. Planned industry downtime will be less than during the second quarter, which is having some impact on spot ethylene prices. During the quarter, we have a planned turnaround at our Clinton site, a 1.1 billion pound per year ethylene, polyethylene facility.","Let's turn to Slide #10 and review our performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins-Europe, Asia and International segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $295 million, an improvement of $70 million versus the first quarter. Joint venture equity income was $31 million, and we received dividends of $29 million.","Olefin results improved by approximately $50 million. Several factors contributed to the improvement. First, our Olefins plant operating rates averaged greater than 90%, and our ethylene volumes increased by approximately 9%. These rates were differential to the industry as we were able to take advantage of scheduled and unscheduled downtime at competitors' facilities.","Second, we continue to benefit from naphtha raw material cost volatility and the timing of polyolefin price changes.","Finally, our feedstock mix benefited from processing the substantial percentage of liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG. Approximately 37% of our European ethylene production was sourced from propane and butane at production costs less than naphtha costs. Versus naphtha cracking, we estimate this benefited results by approximately $45 million. It is common for us to process LPGs during the summer months, but the volume and benefit received exceeded historic levels.","During the quarter, we completed the 155 million-pound butadiene expansion project. The project was generally on schedule and on budget.","Our polyolefin results were relatively unchanged. Volumes increased by approximately 10% but margins remained modest. Combined polypropylene compounds and polybutene-1 EBITDA improved by approximately $30 million. Declining propylene prices led to improved margins.","While second quarter results were strong, this was partially related to industry pricing conventions and significant industry maintenance. Underlying economic fundamentals within Europe remain weak. We should not assume that the relatively strong first half performance will continue into the third quarter. Within this environment, we continue to focus on costs and efficient management of our feed mix. The strength of our second quarter reflects improvement in these areas.","Now let's turn to Slide #11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $338 million, a $35 million decline versus the prior quarter. We estimate that scheduled maintenance at several propylene oxide facilities impacted results by approximately $30 million.","Including turnaround impacts, propylene oxide and derivative results declined by approximately $50 million. The balance was primarily attributed to lower butanediol margins and seasonally lower propylene glycol sales in the aircraft deicing.","Results for other chemicals in the segment were relatively unchanged. We benefited from increased acetyl and ethylene glycol volumes. C4 chemical volumes declined as a result of scheduled maintenance at both our facilities and customer facilities.","Exclusive of turnaround impacts, styrene results were relatively unchanged. Oxyfuel results improved by approximately $15 million. Increased sales volumes accounted for the majority of the improvement. Margins were relatively unchanged as weak gasoline prices offset the benefit derived from lower butane costs. Thus far, in the third quarter, we have benefited from the absence of our prior quarter maintenance work. Low butane costs continues to support oxyfuel margins. We do not have any significant planned maintenance in the third quarter in our I&D segment.","Let's move to Slide #12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $20 million, essentially unchanged from the first quarter. Refinery ran well during the quarter, with crude throughput just shy of the 268,000 barrel per day capacity. The modifications that we made during the first quarter to broaden the operating window of the refinery met our goals. However, market conditions were very difficult. Pipeline infrastructure still needed to efficiently move crude in the U.S. and Canada, and RIN cost increased.","During the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark spread averaged approximately $18.49 per barrel, almost $3 per barrel below the first quarter. This decline reflected both the weakness in the gasoline market and an unfavorable heavy light spread. Low byproduct values continue to pressure results.","During the quarter, combined Canadian and light crude oil represented slightly more than 15% of our crude slate. While Canadian crudes were economically advantaged, supply remains limited. Weak gasoline markets limited the benefit of processing light crudes.","Increased costs of RINs contributed to the unfavorable results. Versus the first quarter, our cost of RINs essentially doubled to approximately $50 million. Approximately 70% of the increase is attributed to increased volume, while the balance was caused by a 17% price increase.","In the past, the export market provided some relief from this cost pressure. However, during the second quarter, the gasoline export market was very competitive. The resulting weak export prices essentially eliminated this opportunity. Distillate exports continue to present value for us.","Thus far, during the third quarter, we have seen similar pressures within the market. There has been recent improvement in gasoline spreads. But in general, the market is expected to weaken after the peak driving season ends. RIN costs have increased until the last day or two. The heavy light spread has expanded as heavy crude suppliers attempt to be more competitive. We will remain flexible as the Gulf Coast markets transition, and we will pursue both purchase and sale opportunities as they develop.","I want to mention that we will change the reporting basis for our Refining spreads beginning next quarter. In the future, we will report the distillate component of the Maya 2-1-1 spread based on ultra-low sulfur diesel rather than No. 2 Heating Oil. Changes in NYMEX trading and the physical market necessitate this change. This does not impact our operations.","If you have any questions regarding this future reporting change, Marian and Doug will be happy to help you.","Let's move to Slide #13 for a quick summary. The second quarter continued with strong results. Diluted earnings per share achieved a second consecutive quarterly record. Olefins continue to be the main driver of these results, and O&P-Americas achieved record EBITDA.","Performance in the EAI segment was strong. While some of this was due to timing differences between cost and price mechanisms, our actions were critical to the success as we both significantly increased NGL cracking at our olefin plants and increased operating rates. We can't count on European industry margins to continue at the second quarter level, but we expect to continue to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves.","Intermediates & Derivatives benefited from strong oxyfuel results. Our turnarounds and competitor capacity expansions put some pressure on this segment, but the underlying strength of propylene oxide and other assets continued during the quarter.","Refining has been a difficult area. I'm confident that we have taken the right actions, and we anticipate improvement over time as pipeline infrastructure brings additional advantage crudes to the Gulf Coast. We're also hopeful that structural imbalances within the renewable fuel standards will be corrected by our government as they increase their understanding of how current regulations are distorting markets.","Through the early weeks of the third quarter, the fundamentals across our businesses have been relatively unchanged, and our assets have operated well. This supports near-term earnings. Looking longer term, our projects continue to proceed on schedule, and we recently received a permit for a channel view expansion.","We currently have the methanol plant restart, as well as the La Porte and channel view ethylene expansions under construction. Our project max butadiene expansion and low-density polyethylene restart at Wesseling, Germany are now complete. We're making excellent progress growing our company.","Thank you for your interest in LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take questions, Sherry.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In your Intermediates & Derivatives analysis, you called out competitive pressures on butanediol margins. Order of magnitude, how much EBITDA did you lose from that competitive pressure and what's the outlook for butanediol margins going forward?","James L. Gallogly","I think the number, Jeff, is around $20 million, and the market was extremely strong. In the past, there's been competitive pressures. And so I think we're seeing a more normal course for now until that extra capacity is used up.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, butadiene prices have really moved lower both in the United States and in the offshore market. Can you sort of quantify how that might affect you in the third quarter?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, the BD market has contracted some. That was particularly true in Europe, and now what we're seeing -- the export arbitrage was open to the United States. We've seen some cargoes move in this direction. And as a result of that, we'll see the margins contract some. I'm happy to tell you that in the expansion project that we had at Wesseling, we put in forward pricing. We wanted to ensure that, that project had a very nice return. And so we're going to see nice margins from that expansion despite the overall reduction and industry pricing in BD.","Operator","Our next question in queue comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, I was wondering if you could give us your latest assessment on the state of the propane market and sort of what you see going forward. It seems like maybe we got through the first 6 months of this year without any real upward momentum even as the export facilities opened, but I suspect that it could change going forward. It's more open, but maybe there's enough NGL fractionation coming that it's awash. How do you see it playing out?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, at this point in time, the inventories of propane are coming in a little bit within somewhat historic levels. Pricing is still good for us in the crack, and so we are continuing to bring it in to our olefin numbers. Butane has been a nice surprise, been very long in the summer, and that's come into the crack as well. And I think that's helping hold propane where it's at. There's going to be a need for more propane export before you see propane come in a lot. So I think we're okay for right now. As you know, my longer-term view is that propane will trade more in line with crude oil type metrics on heating value basis, given that you can put it on a boat and transport it. And so I've not been as enthusiastic about PDH units as some of our competitors.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I might follow up, could you give us a sense what you would see -- if we went to a wonderful world where it might grow at 3% or 4% a year and Europe pulls out of its recession, what is sort of an upside scenario you could paint for EBITDA from Olefins & Polyolefins in EAI?","James L. Gallogly","Well, you heard that we had increased our LPG cracking to 37% in Europe. During this time of year, we do that, but it was much better than is typical. We had some nice earnings there, and we're able to take advantage of it. Let me give you kind of an interesting fact. At Berre now, remember, we shut the refinery down, which used to be a feed prep unit for that cracker. And over the last days, we're only cracking about 20%, 25% naphtha in that unit, a lot more condensates, quite a bit of propane, some butane. So we'll see how it develops over time. But we have a lot of communication between our U.S. assets and our European assets in how to get the best out of our furnaces. So I don't want to quantify that number today, but we're working it very, very hard. We saw about $45 million in this last quarter from it, but we're working hard to make that number bigger.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, maybe if you could speak also on the ethane market, how supply will come in rest of the year and what that means for ethane prices and even a differential versus your Conway, Kansas pricing metrics?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, right now, ethane pricing remains very, very favorable to us. We've been kind of at that reject kind of pricing. Today, it's $0.255, something in that range. We feel very good about it going forward. And of course, when we take our Iowa facility down, that's going to put some more pressure on Conway. That will help us a bit at Morris, and we'll see that full dynamic play out. That turnaround may be $50 million, $60 million in the quarter impact to us, but we feel very good about ethane pricing right now. And if you look at inventories, they're still at historic highs. So quite a bit, 200,000, 250,000 barrel per day type of rejection, so we're in good shape.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jim, just on your RIN cost for the back half of the year, do you have an estimate?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I did a couple of days ago, but I'm starting to rethink that estimate. It might be worthwhile for me to give you a little bit of a flavor for where that's been. But first, let me tell you that in the last couple of days, those prices have come way down. Yesterday, RIN prices hit $0.91 for a little bit, and they're trading around $1 right now. So that's a lot lower than that $1.40 or so, or $1.50 occasionally that we've been seeing. But let me give you a sense for how that's been working. I thought that topic would come up. In the first quarter of '12, it was about $0.15; second quarter, $0.17; third quarter, $0.18; fourth quarter, $0.18. And the impact last year, $30 million, plus or minus. When you look at the first quarter of this year, $0.78 on average, $25 million impact. Second quarter is $0.91 and a $47 million impact. So if you took that and annualize it, you can get numbers in the $200 million range. But as I said, things have started to come in. I'm hoping that our Congress is seeing that the market is so distorted that the ability to blend that extra ethanol into the system doesn't exist, and it's hurting consumers at the pump. There's a good reason to fix it now and save everybody a bit of money and stop this market distortion. It's also forcing refineries to move product overseas, which is -- in a peak driving season with gasoline prices going up, isn't the right thing for our country. So I'm hoping people pay attention, make some adjustments and we see less of it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, even sort of x-ing out some of those favorabilities that you noted in Europe, it still seems like there's been some cost structure improvement there, maybe some execution improvement from the new team over there. Can you talk a little bit about -- and I know that's obviously been something you've been working on. Can you talk a little bit about sort of how we should be thinking about that level of improvement and maybe quantify it a bit if you can?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, well, we have been trying to improve that operation. While we had strong results in Europe, I'll tell you, we also left some money on the table. We could have done better. You heard my comments about safety. Some people say I'm never satisfied, and I think that's probably true. We're always seeking perfection in our operations. We're getting it from our Olefins team in the U.S. We left some money on the table in Europe, could have done a bit better there. But it's been good, and there's various reasons. One, we're improving our crack. I mentioned more LPG cracking. We've been taking costs out. We previously said a couple of hundred million dollars. We're seeing that show up now. Remember, that as we reduce headcount and all, it takes a year or 2 for that to show up because of severance programs in Europe and how that operates versus the United States. So the payouts are a little longer. But it's action that still needs to be taken to reduce the cost structure. We announced that polyethylene facility closing in Wesseling. We reached agreement with the works council, several hundred people coming off the payroll there. We have a major program in R&D that's underway in Europe, a little bit in the United States, but primarily in Europe. And we're taking a lot of costs out there. To give a sense for that, within our Frankfurt R&D facility, it will be about half the people; and in Italy, it's 25% or so. So we're really tuning up our operation to make sure that we get full value for everything we do. And you're seeing it show up in the bottom line. Now the other thing I want to mention about Europe is we have a lot of stable businesses within the portfolio. Obviously, the \"I\" stands for international. We have Middle East assets. We have some joint ventures that contribute. Our polybutene-1, our compounded business have nice stable type earnings. And so kind of half of the EAI numbers are very stable, and we've performed well there. So we're going to keep working costs and reliability in Europe, and more to come on that, Vincent.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just as a follow-up, the pace of share repurchases in the quarter, obviously, you didn't have a full quarter to buy stock back. How should we be thinking about that over the next couple of quarters?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes, the majority of that -- really all that was really done in the latter part of the quarter in June. But going forward, really no change in terms of our commitment to returning the cash strictly to shareholders, more frequently, varied amounts. We have no other meaningful accretive alternatives. We will authorize for 10% of the shares, and then the Management Board Supervisory Board provided approval for execution of that over 12 months. But as far as the specifics on the mechanics or the tactics, so to speak, on the execution, we intend to disclose any of that buyback activity in hindsight in connection with our future earnings calls or our quarterly reporting. So as we disclosed today in terms of what we executed on the second quarter, we'll continue to do that as we go forward.","James L. Gallogly","I might add that in the last 12 months, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and also increased our cash balance $1.3 billion. So we're very committed to both generating and returning cash.","Operator","Our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, if you can talk about your lower MTBE results and why was the profitability down year-over-year, and then maybe compare MTBE profitability in U.S. versus European plants.","James L. Gallogly","Yes, well, remember, we had some turnaround activity stuff going on, and we had just an incredibly strong 2012 due to some market conditions. They're strong at Poland and South America on MTBE for a period of time and a few other things going on. So we think that business is performing very well. We've got a butane advantage. Gasoline prices weren't as strong as we had hoped in the second quarter. But right now, they're a little better. We sell ETBE in Europe, and some of those margins are very nice. It's just a good business overall, and we're the industry leader in oxyfuels in the world. So what you're seeing is good solid performance out of that business and pretty proud of it.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then secondly, just on balance sheet. Karyn, you raised some debt recently as an investment-grade company. Is that something you're likely to continue in the future in terms of taking on debt, given that your balance sheet is still underlevered, and would the main use be stock buyback?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes, we just recently reached that investment-grade milestone, so it was important for us in terms of getting those benchmarks out there. So we're very, very happy with the tenure and the rates reserve on both a 10-year and a 30-year benchmark. As we've discussed in the past, we understand that there still continued to be some opportunity and flexibility in that balance sheet. As we continue to season in this investment-grade space, we continue to work with the rating agencies, we'll continue to look to see how we can be very opportunistic and optimize that balance sheet. But no specific targets in that regard, but we do understand we have some flexibility there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Nocella with RBC Capital.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just one more in Europe. Did cracking more LPGs this quarter require much capital investment or you're just basically taking advantage of some of the market opportunities there? And how do you see the opportunities to maybe use imported LPGs from the U.S. for these assets a little bit longer term?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, Chris, that took no new capital at all. It's just how we ran our furnaces and optimized the back-end of our crackers, so there's no investment period. And we see more opportunity to do that, so we'll continue to press on that. One of the things that's happened is we've taken more South Texas condensates into our system here in the Gulf Coast. That's freed up some of the condensates that we used to import, for instance, from the Middle East and made those available in Europe. And so we're rerouting some of those feedstocks into our crackers there at margins that are better than NAFTA type pricing. So we'll continue to do that, try to improve that crack, increase the competitiveness of those assets and work it really hard.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just on your cash usage and return to shareholders. If ethylene assets became available, where would that fit on your list of priorities for capital allocation?","James L. Gallogly","Well, everything depends on price. Really, I'd be surprised if it came available, one, if it's the things that I'm aware of, it's probably not the quality of assets we typically chase; and two, if it's small enough, somebody else may bid up that price. And so we're still totally about value. We see a real benefit in buying more of ourselves through share repurchases because we like our earnings profile, our cash profile and the quality of the assets that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up on that, not necessarily going after existing assets. But what would be the prospects of Lyondell building a new facility in conjunction with a major customer that's out there? What would be your thoughts about doing something like that?","James L. Gallogly","Well, right now, we've announced 1.8 billion pounds of added capacity here in the Gulf Coast, which is almost equivalent to a world-scale cracker. We've got concrete being poured, steel in the ground and those assets coming up. And we feel we'll beat everybody to the punchline and de-risked these investments. We're watching all these announcements. And also right now -- we said we might do a condo cracker. But right now, we're working really hard to get those projects we have announced to the fruition stage, so feel pretty good about our portfolio right now. And as we said, we're investing more in ourselves. That's another way to acquire more assets is to buy our shares.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Terrific, terrific. And on the I&D side, you mentioned stronger acetyl volumes, which is a little bit surprising. What's the outlook for that business?","James L. Gallogly","One of the things that's probably gone unnoticed is where we would talk about our reliability all the time and our olefins chain, we're a lot stronger operator in our acetyls business as well. We've teamed up those assets, learned how to run them better, put a little money into maintenance. And we're seeing the positive results. And of course, that's an extra bite at the cheap natural gas price apple. So that's a good strong business, we like it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","Again, I wanted to revisit Europe. Obviously, good volumes over there in the quarter. I just wanted to sort of hear your views about the sustainability of this volume growth that you've seen. I mean, you obviously talked a bit about taking advantage of some turnarounds in the industry. But was there some restocking activity as well as naphtha prices started inching up?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, Hassan, there'll always be a little bit of restocking that goes on when naphtha prices start to rise like we saw. At the moment, those naphtha prices are sitting in the kind of $870 range, so they've tapered off a little bit from their highs. But it's also a better time seasonally for people to buy. Certain of the types of polyethylenes have been pretty strong. Some of that is competitor-related, some of it is just market-related seasonality. But it's been okay. The good news is our team is really capturing the opportunities as they present themselves. There've been pretty quick on their feet. And when the opportunities exist, they strike, and that's adding up. These kind of earnings that we're seeing, well, I call them strong compared to what they've been in history, certainly not anywhere near the peak. These are trough-type returns still in Europe and a lot of running room as markets get tighter over the coming years.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","Fair enough. Now a follow-up, if I may, on just some of these new builds that have been announced. We obviously get updates from some of the companies that have announced in terms of the state of affairs of these projects. But obviously, not much clarity on the MTO and CTO side of things. So what are your views about all this sort of new capacity sort of, say, that's been announced in China?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, there are some of those plants going to be built. The capital is really, really high. But then once you get those assets running, their operating costs are competitive. A lot of that's Central China, different market space. And remember that you get kind of a half-and-half mix between ethylene and propylene. And so you can't just translate all that capacity as extra ethylene into ethylene derivative type capacity. I think that's something that everybody needs to watch. I think there's a lot of announcements and not everything announced is going to be built. If you look at the timing of the permits and all, I've seen some of our competitors start to run into some challenges on their permits, maybe going to slow them down a little. We'll see how that all develops. But we just got our Channelview permit, and so couple of our big projects are marching along. And we're very pleased to see that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, Jim, just a couple of questions on the near-term outlook for Olefins Americas and you've seen a nice -- you've got a nice benefit from widening polyolefin margins in the second quarter. But I've been noticing that with weakness in the real, the export demand to Latin America seems a little softer. I'm just wondering -- and then as we get these restarts, do you see these positive spreads coming down over the balance of the year? How sustainable are they? And just wondering, during the quarter, given your strong onstream performance, were you able to take advantage of the nice spot ethylene sales opportunities in the U.S.?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, Don, the spot prices that come in a little bit, you'll see on a daily basis. They'll bounce $0.01, $0.02, $0.03. They certainly come in from where they were when there was so much turnaround work going on. But they're still pretty strong, especially when you compare them to the contracts, so a good solid market. South America is a little lighter than it was. But having said that, we're only exporting 13% of our volumes. And that's going Mexico, South America, almost nothing to Asia from our U.S. polyolefins operations. And we're seeing very strong demand in certain of the flavors, like high-density is super short. Brazil has got some expansion going on, but it's not particularly relevant to us. I think things are holding up fine. Ethane prices are still cheap, and we're running full bore.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And a follow-up on the refinery. What is it you're looking for in terms of RIN relief? Are you looking for rollback of the ethanol mandate back to, say, 2012 levels? Obviously, the blend wall only gets worse as we go forward into '14 and '15. And I guess, realistically, going into a midterm election and the power of the farm lobbies, is it realistic to expect any relief on RINs?","James L. Gallogly","I know the industry is asking for complete relief and let the markets solve themselves and let's get government out of the middle of things. We only run one refinery. We're a chemical company that has a high-quality refining asset. We'd like to see all this short-term market distortion be eliminated. We're not going to get into retail with our one refinery to solve that problem. But we would like to see normalcy. If we could get a realistic target for ethanol in the blend, refiners would still blend it. There'd still be business conducted, but it's all artificial at this point in time. And it's driving up the price for the consumer, and there's really no point in that. It needs to be fixed. How it's ultimately fixed, we'll have a voice, but we're one refinery in a much larger system. But again, I mentioned there's too much exporting going on. That's being driven by misguided regulation.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","There's been a lot of discussion obviously about Eagle Ford and Permian condensate production and how much that's ramping up. Just was hoping if you would refresh us on how much you think that could help some of your operations, as well as if all this lighter hydrocarbon may affect your Houston refinery, and then if there's any interest you might have in actually building a condensate splitter.","James L. Gallogly","Well, it's already been positive to us, particularly at Channelview and also at Corpus. There has been advantage condensates coming our way. I think that number is going to increase, but we're already kind of maxing out our systems. So I don't expect there to be more volume. It'd just be a question of will the prices continue to come in for us as we expect. In terms of a condensate splitter, we're always trying to think of ways to improvise and make a little extra money. You saw that in the fractionation project that we're sponsoring down at Corpus. There's a possibility that we could do a few things in a condensate splitter or down in that operation with some of the existing hardware that we have. We're studying it. We'll see if it makes sense. But we're going to be very opportunistic in all of this.","Douglas J. Pike","Nils, can you repeat your question on the Refining?","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Oh, right. I was just wondering if the mix in Eagle Ford, because it's such a light hydrocarbon, if it would affect any of the Houston refining or your asset in particular?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, I think that would be pretty modest to us. We don't see it right now a lot. But as I said, gasoline prices were lower. Some of that ends up in the pool over time. But I don't think it's going to have a significant material impact. And now we're very interested in the light-heavy dip, and that started to open up a little bit.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, 2 questions on Refining. I guess over the near term, do you have a view on how much of the inflation in RIN cost, if any, is being passed along through the chain to the consumer? And then longer term, would you care to share your latest thoughts on the role of the refinery in the portfolio as you weigh the benefits of integration versus the various pros and cons of potentially electing to separate it at some point?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, on the amount of RIN cost being passed on to the consumer, I've seen a variety of commentaries on that, and I'll give you my most simple explanation of it. When gasoline prices are rising and gasoline is a little tight, we're going to be able to pass on a lot more of it. When pricing is weak, when gasoline is long, we're going to have to digest it. And I think first, second quarter, until more recently when gas prices -- gasoline cracks has started to open, I think we were absorbing a lot of the RIN cost. You saw it in our reduced earnings. At this point in time, I think some of it is getting passed through to the consumer, and so it's a supply-demand typical kind of thing that you see. In one way that maybe -- one thing I should mention, and I've alluded to it already, it's also being passed on to the consumer in that gasoline is being exported so that we don't have the RIN issue and if that were an issue to greater supply in the United States. So there's a lot -- that's why you see such a disparity of comments on that particular question. In terms of the role of the refinery going forward, we've invested in that asset. We're not going to put a lot of new capital into it. I think we've got a good kit on the ground right now. We're running it much better than it's ever been run. We're working costs very, very hard on the asset as you would expect. But it's not a good time to sell a refinery. That asset will have more value over time. It's a good asset. We do have some synergies between the refinery and Channelview, move some products back and forth. But we'll see over time what we do with the asset. But right now, it fits in our portfolio. We're doing a good job with it, all things considered.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Fair enough. And then as a follow-up, Jim, you had mentioned back at your Investor Day in March, you were contemplating a new 1 billion pound polyethylene resin line, I think it was for circa 2016 or so. Any update on that? Is that looking any more or less likely at this juncture?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we're still studying it. What we're doing is looking at our ethylene balances. We have third parties coming to us and asking us for volumes out into the future. We're looking at the pricing that they would buy that for as against what we would be able to upgrade it in terms of polyethylene, and so we're both working those deals. At the same time, we're moving along with some preliminary engineering. The thing about that line that I'd like to mention, if we built it, it's likely to be our latest new technology that we've never offered before. And we think they could open up some very, very nice licensing opportunities for us. We found ways to reduce the capital cost and still have the great product mix that LyondellBasell is famous for.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, the line of question I'd like to drive is around Asia and PO currently. So one of your competitors was talking about a softening in the market for PO. They had opened up an HPPO plant in Thailand not too long ago. Some of it could just be their new guy on the block. But how do you see the next 6 months to a year playing out for PO in Asia?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, well, there's been some competitive pressures in Asia in part because of that new capacity. I think you may see certain competitors backing down a little bit because of their cost position. Sometimes they can have cheap capital and high operating costs, and they won't beat a competitor like us in the window. Our PO\/TBA plant is industry-leading in terms of cost. Now I'd point out that our POSM plant that we have in partnership in China has been running very well since start-up in 2010. It came up nicely. We're moving the volumes. So there is some pressure. But even with that pressure, PO is still a very solid business with very nice returns. And it's a question of great or really good. And I think it's more really good than great right now, but it will be -- it's just one of those products that fewer competitors and certain technologies are advanced, and we find a way to make good money on it.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Fair enough. And you had mentioned in your commentary around the potential coal to olefins crackers in China, the difference in the skew between ethylene and propylene. When we look longer term, does PO get put in the crosshairs as they end up with a lot more polypropylene molecules potentially over the next 4 to 5 to 6 years there as an outlet for those molecules?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think you've got to look at the geographies. And first, a lot of that will not find its way to the coast. And if it's anything, more polypropylene probably would be helpful for us as a propylene oxide producer. So a lot of that propylene will go into polypropylene, too, Duffy, so I don't think it's going to hurt us much in polypropylene oxide. There's just not that many people with the right technologies that can be competitive in PO.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","You had mentioned the RIN costs, and I just wanted to follow up on one other aspect to that. Escalating from 1Q yet profitability in the Refining business was flat, so it seemed that perhaps the fundamentals improved even if it was modest. Is that fair or is it the pass-through phenomenon that you had discussed? And then as a follow-up to that, on the refinery business, coming out of the turnaround in 1Q, there had been some re-plumbing to do, some lighter feeds. And could you just discuss kind of going forward how those lighter feeds could improve the profitability here in the second half?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, in terms of the pass-through of the RINs, first, let me describe the first quarter was a turnaround quarter for us. We had a lot of capacity down during that point in time, had one of our crude units down, and so it's an abnormal quarter and abnormal earnings. The volumes have come up nicely in the second quarter, but Maya 2-1-1 is down $3. So that's a pretty significant impact. So with that 2-1-1 down and the RINS higher, you see kind of quarter-to-quarter pretty flat. So one is turnaround, one is falling margins and RINs. Going forward, we'll see if the last couple of days are an indication of what's going to go on in RINs. I really don't know. A couple of days doesn't make a trend, but it's certainly somewhat positive news to see this. The light-heavy difs have opened up a little bit. There's a gasoline crack that we didn't see. So there's a few positives in all of that, but we just have to see how it plays out. I didn't answer all of your questions. I think there was a second one that I didn't get to.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, it was about the lightening up on the feedstock slate and the refinery and...","James L. Gallogly","Yes, we are able to bring some WTI down, dips in pipeline capacity. But the differential between WTI and Brent, it's totally collapsed, and so that margin wasn't there. And then with the pour of gasoline crack through much of the second quarter, we decided to crack heavier and went away from some of those lighter crudes for a period of time. You saw us do a little more Canadian but -- and right now, we're try to move those Canadian barrels down on our capacity to the extent we can get them, because they're still price advantaged.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You talked about in Europe, in the crackers running the lights during the summer here. Could you comment on last winter, the fourth quarter and the first quarter, what your RIN -- were you able to run any lights a year ago? And I'm asking for a comparison, what do you expect this winter in the fourth quarter, first quarter in Europe in terms of LPGs and probably want to characterize your light feedstock?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, last year, we weren't running very much in it. We've moved a little condensates in and then some propane, butane occasionally. But it's come up a fair amount this year. And part of that, especially at Berre, we used to be cracking VGO there out of the refinery. And now a lot of condensates, a lot of light dense, I said we're only doing like 20%, 25% naphtha today. Now I expect this to continue to try to lighten our crack and bring in some of those advantage feeds. We have things like hydrowax at Wesseling, Germany. That's always been competitive. We get a nice stream at our M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster cracker as well. That's very competitive. But we're going to keep trying to lighten that up and use some of those long condensates around the world to try to improve our profitability and competitiveness in Europe. And we're seeing early signs that we're making progress there.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But you're in the mid-30% sort of now in the summer you were talking in terms of lights in your cracker feedstock. As you get into the fourth quarter and first quarter, the winter months, will that drop down into the single digits or teens or...","James L. Gallogly","Well, maybe 20-ish percent. We'll just have to see. But that also depends on availability. If people are right and a lot of propane starts to get exported, that number is going to be higher. I kind of think there'd be more propane exported out of the United States, and there are some projects in the Middle East that are bringing on some of the NGLs. So if that's available at the right price, we'll run it.","Operator","Our last question will come from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess just one question. What drove the strength that you guys saw on the polypropylene compounds business and is it sustainable?","James L. Gallogly","The polypropylene compounded business is a very, very stable profitable business for us because it's totally technology driven. Most people don't think of compounding polypropylene as high-end business. But remember, we're selling primarily into high-end autos. If you want a bumper with no waves and perfect color and all of that, you come to us. And this goes way, way back in time, a beautiful technology position. Some of the auto industry is doing very well, particularly in the United States. Some the high-end European car manufacturers, while they're off year-to-year, they're still in a nice place. And we try to provide them a lot of value. So the last little bit, this last quarter, we had some propylene price declines, which helped contribute. But if you look from quarter-to-quarter, quarter-to-quarter, nice stable earnings, just a little uptick this quarter because of some propylene price movements.","Okay. Well, let me make a couple of closing comments. First, we're proud of the record earnings from continuing operations, record O&P-Americas EBITDA. That business continues to contribute very strong, in part, driven by 4 quarters in a row of better than nameplate capacity. That just doesn't happen in our business. And our people in manufacturing are really delivering. We had solid results in Europe. We're taking cost down, doing more LPG cracking, working that very hard.","I&D had a very respectable quarter. We had some turnaround activity. Take that away, it's -- I think you'd see it's as expected. Refining, tough industry at the moment, more to come on RINS. We'll try to crack more Canadian crude oil over time, and we expect that business to improve as time goes forward. Very strong cash generation, supporting both our dividend and share repurchase programs, and that's a hallmark of the company that we've become. But I want to emphasize the growth projects for just a moment.","Our project max shows that we can get projects done on time and on budget. That was not this company's history. This is the first one that -- of any order of magnitude, that we've had as a new LyondellBasell. And we brought it in as expected. I think that says something about the new company.","We've got permits for the Channelview and La Porte expansions, concrete being poured, steel coming out of the ground. We're going to get those projects up and put them on the bottom line sooner than you expect. Methanol restart later this year, that will be a nice earnings boost. We've got 500-plus people out there working very, very hard to bring that project home.","So this company's get a very bright future. We appreciate your interest, and we'll continue to reward our shareholders. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

That being said, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our website.","Let's take a look at Slide #4 and review a few financial highlights. First quarter earnings per share were $1.72, with EBITDA of $1.67 billion. This is the fifth consecutive quarter with EBITDA in excess of $1.5 billion. Strong results continued despite headwinds created by scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, weather-driven raw material cost volatility and shipping delays. Cumulatively, these items impacted the quarter by approximately $300 million but were partially offset by first quarter price increases. We expect some of this impact to be recovered in the coming quarter.","Overall, industry trends have remained relatively unchanged, although U.S. natural gas prices have been somewhat elevated following a very cold winter. Oil prices have remained relatively steady and seasonal trends are following their normal course. Our company performed significant maintenance in our U.S. operations in the first quarter. Given strong U.S. margins, this negatively impacted results. However, we also benefited from growth projects that are now online and advanced our new growth projects. I'll discuss these topics later in my remarks.","Turning to Slide #5. You'll see that our safety statistics continue at the strong level that we have established over the past several years. While our statistics are very good, I'm saddened to say that during April, a contractor working for a third-party company that manages railcar movements at our Wesseling, Germany, site died in a tragic incident. We are assisting that company in their investigation. Our Wesseling site had achieved 3 million man hours without any injuries just prior to this incident, truly a world-class record. But obviously, we have more work to do. As you have often heard me say, safety is our top priority, so this type of event is very troubling to us.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Please turn to Slide #6, which charts first quarter segment EBITDA. As Jim said, overall, our results have been strong and steady. Within the segments, the O&P-Americas results were below the typical run rate of the past years. This is primarily attributed to maintenance and weather impacts. Jim will cover these items in more detail. In addition to these factors, there was an impact from our La Porte turnaround preparation, where during the quarter, we made outside purchases of close to 300 million pounds of ethylene, which negatively impacted results.","In O&P-EAI, results exceeded recent quarters. We attribute this to an environmental indemnity settlement, improved margins and normal seasonal recovery following the fourth quarter holidays. In Intermediates & Derivatives, results followed recent trends. Oxyfuel results began the quarter with typical low winter margins, which improved as the quarter progressed. Methanol contributed strong results, while styrene and ethylene glycol weakened. Refining posted a quarter similar to the fourth quarter. Combined, these 2 quarters make up almost all of the last 12 months' earnings for this segment. The Technology segment continued to enjoy consistent strong earnings.","Slide #7. Slide 7 provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During the first quarter, we generated $1.1 billion from our operations and issued $1 billion in 30-year bonds at 4.875% interest. Our cash balance declined slightly with cash use of $1.5 billion in share repurchases and dividends. During the past 12 months, we generated $4.8 billion in cash from operations, while raising $2.5 billion in cash from bond issuances. Almost $4.4 billion were used for share repurchases and dividends and another $1.5 billion invested in capital expenditures.","On Slide 8, we summarize a few key aspects of our cash story. In the chart on the upper left, you can see the relatively steady cash generation from operations over the past 2 years, continuing into the first quarter. On the right, we have plotted the past 3-plus years of share repurchases and dividends, averaging approximately $2.8 billion per year. If you annualize the pace of first quarter share repurchases and dividends, it could be in the range of $6 billion for the year 2014.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 15 million shares, bringing the total purchase since last May, when we initiated the program, to approximately 42 million shares at the end of the first quarter. You have seen from recent press releases our shareholders approved a second share repurchase program at our annual meeting and the Supervisory Board approved a $0.10 per share increase of the quarterly interim dividend to $0.70 per share.","Now I'll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.","James L. Gallogly","Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance, beginning on Slides 9 and 10 with Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas. First quarter EBITDA was $736 million, $147 million less than the fourth quarter. Operationally, first quarter results were negatively impacted by a number of maintenance items, including unscheduled maintenance at our Channelview crackers. This required us to temporarily reduce production by an estimated 160 million pounds.","Late in the quarter, we began the La Porte ethylene plant turnaround, which impacted production by approximately 40 million pounds. As Karyn mentioned, in preparation for the turnaround, we purchased approximately 300 million pounds of ethylene. During the quarter, we also conducted a significant turnaround at our Matagorda polyethylene site. Collectively, these events generated most of the variance between the 2 quarters. Weather also had an impact, both through delayed shipments and increased cost of feedstock in natural gas.","Slide #9 provides a perspective on natural gas and NGL costs. January and February experienced cost pressure, but the beginning of spring brought some relief. The chart on the right side of the page indicates that the benchmark cost of ethylene production metric has returned to a level similar to the fourth quarter. However, natural gas costs have remained somewhat elevated, increasing utility costs.","Despite all of this volatility, ethylene margins remained relatively steady. Our average ethylene price increased by approximately $0.02 per pound. The cost of ethylene production increased similarly, in part due to increased natural gas and NGL costs. During the quarter, ethane accounted for 75% of our ethylene production and NGLs represented 87%. Within polyolefins, polyethylene prices increased by $0.03 per pound, while sales volumes remained relatively unchanged. Preturnaround planning mitigated impacts on our polyethylene sales. Polypropylene results were relatively unchanged.","Overall, the quarter for O&P-Americas was not on our normal pace. But the reasons for this were primarily transitory. The weather-related margin pressure that we experienced during January and February was relieved during March and the quarter finished on a strong note. During the second quarter, our focus will be on the successful completion of the La Porte turnaround and expansion. The downtime related to this will impact ethylene production. However, the impact on sales and EBITDA should be mitigated by the first quarter inventory build.","Let's turn to Slide #11 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. First quarter EBITDA was $356 million, $241 million greater than the fourth quarter. Results include a $52 million benefit from an environmental indemnity settlement with previous owners. As we had expected, results also benefited from a seasonal recovery following the year-end holidays. Olefin results improved by approximately $65 million. Margins improved by several cents per pound due to a combination of lower naphtha raw material costs, use of advantaged feedstocks and moderately higher coproduct prices. Our ethylene plants operated at approximately 93% of capacity, which was significantly above reported industry rates. Approximately 35% of our ethylene production was sourced from raw materials with advantaged economics versus naphtha.","Combined polyolefin results also improved, reflecting both increased European margins and volumes. Combined polypropylene compounds and polybutene-1 results increased by approximately $30 million, reflecting the typical seasonal recovery. Joint venture equity income was a strong $54 million, but no dividends were paid this quarter. Business conditions during April have been relatively consistent with those experienced during the first quarter.","Now please turn to Slide #12 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $375 million, almost $20 million higher than the fourth quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results improved due to seasonal volume recovery versus the fourth quarter. Intermediate chemical performance declined, primarily due to weaker styrene and ethylene glycol results. Margins were pressured by the increased benzene and ethylene costs. This weakness was partially offset by increased acetyl results. Acetyls benefited from increased methanol, acidic acid and VAM volumes and margins.","The Channelview methanol plant operated for the full quarter at approximately 85% of nameplate capacity. Oxyfuel results benefited from seasonally improved spreads, but this was partially offset by lower volumes. The temporary closure of the Houston Ship Channel delayed some vessel movements, impacting results by approximately $10 million. April business conditions have been generally similar to conditions experienced late in the first quarter. In conjunction with the La Porte olefins turnaround, our acetyl operation at the site will be down for 2 to 3 weeks. Sales will be met through inventory.","Let's move to Slide #13 for a discussion of the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $129 million, relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $28.26 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 247,000 barrels per day. The spread at the refinery increased following a trend similar to the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark. Crude oil throughput increased versus the fourth quarter, contributing approximately $5 million to first quarter results. However, our product mix and yield were negatively impacted by coker maintenance. Additionally, increased natural gas and RIN costs negatively impact the results by a combined $20 million. April benchmark spreads have averaged approximately $29 per barrel, in line with the March spread. We took a 1-week outage on one of our crude units during April. RIN and natural gas costs have been reasonably consistent with March costs.","Our Technology segment continued to perform well, with the catalyst business slightly ahead of 2013 results. Segment results improved as a result of our past restructuring efforts and reduced R&D costs.","The next 5 slides provide an update on our growth program. You may recall that we're scheduled to bring online a new project almost every 6 months during the end of 2015. The benefit is already visible in our earnings. For example, the Channelview methanol plant started on schedule during December and contributed approximately $50 million to first quarter EBITDA. During late March, we initiated production at our Matagorda polyethylene facility, which now has an additional 200 million pounds per year in capacity due to the debottleneck. This project was generally on schedule with costs in line with our estimates.","As you can see from Slide #14, the next project in the queue is a major expansion at our La Porte ethylene plant. We currently anticipate that will start up mid-year with an EBITDA impact within the range that we previously discussed and plotted on the chart.","The next 3 slides provide a visual perspective on progress since last October. At that time, we were erecting a tower at the methanol plant. Today, it's online and contributing to our EBITDA. The Channelview expansion was a mere hole in the ground when we last discussed it. Today, you can see that the furnaces are really taking shape. At La Porte, we were erecting furnaces. Today, the furnaces are up and the final steps of the expansion are underway. We have approximately 2,800 contractors on-site. We have been moving quickly because the sooner we can bring these projects onstream, the sooner we can increase earnings and cash flow.","Slide #18 updates the cost and status for both the active and previously discussed developing projects. As a quick review, the light blue denotes projects that have been completed. The medium blue represents projects that are currently underway. The projects highlighted in dark blue are projects that we are developing. They're not yet under construction. The cost estimates and timing represent current estimates, while the potential pretax earnings column is based on 2013 industry benchmark data. Our 2013 margins would yield similar earnings.","If you compare this chart to past versions, you'll notice that the projects generally remain on schedule, but that we're experiencing increased costs on several projects. For example, the methanol project cost increased due to higher construction wages and hours worked as we strive to maintain a very aggressive startup schedule. The polyethylene expansion project was completed on schedule and within our cost estimates. The La Porte ethylene expansion is in full swing with the turnaround completion targeted for June. We have experienced cost escalation on this project in terms of scope, labor efficiency and materials cost escalation. Some of this is related to our aggressive schedule and working on a large-scale debottleneck within an operating plant.","The Channelview ethylene expansion remains on track, both in terms of schedule and cost. This has been a less complicated project to execute as we're only adding 2 furnaces to the existing plants. We received the final permits for the Corpus Christi ethylene expansion in mid-April. I first introduced this project to you over a year ago when the scope was still under definition. At that project stage, capital estimates were typically in the range of plus or minus 50%. On this chart, our estimates have been updated to reflect a more defined scope and the recent realities of Gulf Coast construction cost. The timing remains on track with the forecast that we made over a year ago. Our polypropylene compounding projects have moved forward as planned. Last year, we added 2 new lines. And during 2014 through 2016, we expect that we'll add another 4 lines. Spending will be in the order of $10 million and $15 million per year to make these additions.","Let's next discuss 2 of the projects that are not yet in construction. You might recall that we have been developing a new polyethylene process with the intent to build the first plant at one of our locations, and then add the technology to our licensing portfolio. Work has proceeded well over the past year. Our Supervisory Board recently approved advancing the project to the next stage, during which we will finish engineering and purchase long-lead items. Permit applications were filed during the fourth quarter.","The cost estimate and timing on the chart incorporate the final process design and the addition of site-specific infrastructure costs. Previous estimates were conceptual and only included the polyethylene line itself. The Chinese PO\/TBA joint venture has advanced at a slower pace due to the general slowdown in the Chinese economy. We now believe that completion will be in 2018.","Along with moving many projects forward, we also took the decision to cancel the olefins' NGL recovery project. While developing the details of the capital project, we simultaneously pursued commercial options that would eliminate the need for capital, while accelerating the timing of earnings. We recently renegotiated a contract that met these criteria. Going forward, we will recover a greater portion of the economic benefit of our gas stream from the third party without making the capital investment. We are very disciplined with capital. And if we don't need to spend your money to get incremental benefits, we won't.","In summary, our project slate is very strong and is adding value today. Our projects are being completed on schedule. Project definitions and the construction cost environment are clearer today than a year ago. This has resulted in cost increases. But we expect the other projects will still have wonderful returns. We think that the labor market in the Gulf Coast is in the early years of an up cycle. We're very happy that most of our projects are under construction now rather than later. During 2014, we will continue to build momentum across the company. Market conditions, coupled with our internal focus on efficiency, enable us to pay a strong growing dividend while utilizing additional cash to acquire shares.","We're now pleased to take questions, Holly.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First one, kind of a couple announcements by either competitor or supplier that have some impact on you. The first would be Enterprise's export of ethane and the 240,000 barrels a day number that they put out kind of coming online late in '16. One, just want to get your take on the plausibility of that actually coming up on time. And then how should we think about maybe an over-under for how much ethane will be exported out of the U.S. in, say, '17 and '18? And then the second question is around this morning's announcement by Westlake that they're going to pursue an MLP. And just want to get your take on -- obviously, it's company-by-company fit. But is there a fit with an MLP for Lyondell going forward?","James L. Gallogly","Okay. The first question on the Enterprise ethane export terminal. That's a large project, 240,000 barrels per day. And to say that they'll start up in mid-2016, that's a very aggressive schedule. But I'm sure that they've considered what the construction timing would be. I would first say that's a big vote of confidence in a strong oversupply of Gulf Coast ethane. They stated in the press release that the supply could exceed demand by 700,000 barrels per day by 2020. That's very, very strong. And that's after all of the new crackers are built. So they are very, very bullish. That capacity, as you know, is equivalent to about 3 world-scale crackers and 20% of current supply. So it's a very big and an important announcement. We have been studying whether we could effectively use ethane in our cracking in Europe. And in fact, I had a review with our European team 2 short weeks ago. It just doesn't work for us. When we look at propane, butane cracking, condensate cracking, and it just seems to be so much better for us. I know that INEOS has a project that's announced. But that's, what, 10,000 barrels ramping up to 20,000 barrels per day. I'm having a hard time understanding how that kind of volume could go to Europe. Some of it must be going to Asia. And I wonder if some of that isn't going to be used to spike LNG in a couple of the countries, where they have some lean gas supplies. I know that they haven't contracted all of that volume yet. We're anxious to see further details as that's worked out with Enterprise, how much of that is actually going to move. As you said, it's an aggressive schedule, and we'll see how that develops. But once again, I think the important note is they have a lot of confidence and a very long position in ethane. Otherwise, they wouldn't be making that type of investment. Second, on Westlake MLP, as we reported some time ago, we also studied an MLP. Our tax position on our assets is different than some others. We did go through bankruptcy 4 years ago and had some asset write-downs. And so the tax implications may be different from us. We've looked at it. We continue to look at it. Obviously, the market has reacted very favorably to Westlake's announcement. We'll take a look at all of that and continue our evaluation.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Karyn, just a follow-up question for you. On the 300 million pounds of inventory you built, is it rule of thumb fair to say that there's about a $0.25 margin in that so that was about a $75 million hit to Q1 earnings?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes. More or less, it's probably a little bit higher than that. And then again, we would expect to see that returning in the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","John J. Hirt - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is John Hirt on for P.J. today. Curious, looking at your methanol facility now that it's up and running and, I guess, it ran at 85% in the first quarter, it would seem to be a logical MLP candidate, given that it's a standalone plant. I think you've mentioned in the past that you've got some debottlenecking opportunities there and you just put in about $100 million -- $180 million of fresh capital. So I'm just curious if that's an asset you'd be willing to put into an MLP structure.","James L. Gallogly","John, that's a new item that we will look at. The asset hasn't been running very long. We just brought it up in December. We'll continue to advance -- ramp up the rates. We're going to do a little bit of unscheduled work in the third quarter on some heating tubes. But otherwise, that thing -- we think we can debottleneck it and get some extra capacity. Margins are holding up reasonably well. And it's definitely adding to our earnings. We'll take a peek at the MLP for that asset as well.","John J. Hirt - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then your O&P - Europe, Asia and International business was up nicely year-over-year. With propane swinging into favor in February and March and I think it's still in favor today, to what extent have you been able to take advantage of that? And can you just kind of talk about your feed slate mix in Europe today, given that you're now free from some of those unfavorable naphtha contracts?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Well, the first quarter we ran at about 35% of advantaged feedstocks. Typically, in the summer, we can ramp that up. We'll be looking to do that as opportunities present themselves. That segment had a very nice first quarter. Margins were up on falling naphtha prices, and we ran our crackers at 93% capacity, which is outstanding, have been able to move the polymer volumes reasonably well. And of course, our businesses, such as polybutene-1, our compounded businesses performed very nicely as they always do from quarter-to-quarter. So we're pretty proud of the results in Europe. We're definitely differentiating ourselves from our competitors there. And we expect to continue to do that in the future.","Operator","Next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jim, could you talk about -- in the past, you talked about maybe doing another round of kickbacks following this ramp, probably smaller in scale. And I'm just wondering, given what you're noting on the cost side of things and we still have crackers ahead of us, do you think that another round of sort of debottlenecking or brownfield-type stuff is prohibitive from a cost perspective at this point?","James L. Gallogly","Vincent, I don't think it's cost-prohibitive. It depends on where you do it and how you do it. But as you said, we like to do the debottleneck kinds of things, where the capital is naturally cheaper. One of the things I didn't mention in the base part of the call was that despite these cost increases in a couple of our olefins expansions, we're still bringing those on at something in the order of 2\/3 of cost of other people's incremental production on a cents per annual pound basis. So they're not only earlier, but they're also quite a bit cheaper. We always look at those cost increases that we're seeing right now could delay some other projects that people are looking at. Their cost would definitely go up based on what we're seeing in labor rates, productivity, other kinds of costs like that. But we're going to be very sensitive as we do our economics and make sure that those additional capital projects do make sense. And as we put the engineering together, we will start announcing those.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up to the ethane export situation, could you just give a little bit more detail as to why your analysis said that exports for your facilities didn't work? Was it sort of the CapEx you would have to invest? Or is it sort of the relative opportunity with the other feedstocks? What were sort of the big bottlenecks for you?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. It was both of those things. It's -- we can run some of those crackers lighter than we do today. But generally, that's 20%, maybe 25% on some of those furnaces without a fair amount of modifications. They're slightly different than that. Some of its transportation issues because some of our crackers are inland. But frankly, when we looked at propane, butane, some of the condensates, the economics really favored the slightly heavier feedstocks when you looked at all the transportation costs and everything else. It just didn't work very well for us. I was hoping it would.","Operator","The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, can you discuss the M&A pipeline? There's potentially a large transaction available on the plastics side. If greenfield doesn't make sense from a U.S. perspective, do you look more towards M&A longer term to perhaps integrate downstream?","Douglas J. Pike","Dave, I'm sorry, this is Doug. You weren't too clear on our side. I think you were asking about the future for M&A?","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. The M&A pipeline, given potential assets on the plastics side, any interest -- can you discuss your interest in those?","James L. Gallogly","David, we're same place on M&A as we've always been, it has to be significantly accretive. Nothing has come on to the market that has been of interest to us lately. And as we previously said, we always evaluate all those opportunities as against buying our own shares. And so far, our own shares, in our view, is better value. And obviously, we know the company well and like our prospects.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, on the refinery, Jim, discuss the timing of the Canadian crude coming down into your operations and potential impact this year and next.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. As we've mentioned, we're expecting additional volumes to come in, in the second half of the year. Flanagan South is slightly delayed. But we expect still that to be kind of a third quarter event and allow us to ramp up Canadian crudes at a nice discount, which should help our Refining earnings. One of the things that's been happening is obviously the Maya 2-1-1 spread has been pretty decent, fourth quarter, first quarter and now into the second quarter. So with a little better operations, we should be able to have better earnings in that segment.","Operator","The next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, 2 questions. On La Porte turnaround, what other impact will you have other than the inventory that you built? Did you have to buy some inventory? And so will that negatively affect margins as you go into Q2?","James L. Gallogly","Don, that primarily had a first quarter impact. We did have to buy about 300 million pounds of ethylene to cover. And as we are in the second quarter, we're now selling that or using it on our own operations. So that should have somewhat of a positive impact in the second quarter, whereas it was a negative in the first.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then on your EU feedstock flexibility. I know earlier in the year, you renegotiated a long-standing naphtha supply arrangement that you had. What was the benefit? Did this just give you more flexibility to use advantaged feedstocks? Or did you actually negotiate a reduction in the benchmark price for that naphtha contract?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, that was -- it wasn't just all naphtha, there were some other feedstocks, certain instances, we got slightly lower pricing. But the primary benefit of that is a lot more flexibility because we had basically take-or-pay requirements that would push us to process an awful lot of naphtha, when sometimes we would prefer to crack something different. By lowering the volumes on that, we're now able to bring in some advantaged feeds when available. Some of that is seasonal, some of it is not seasonal and can be done year-round as, for instance, we just showed with first quarter with 35% advantaged feeds.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And what kind of benefit you think that's going to have on a full year basis going forward?","James L. Gallogly","Well, it really depends on what propane, butane and that is doing in the marketplace. Right now, it's fairly advantaged. But in the summertime, it's historically been even more advantaged. So we'll just have to see how that develops into the year.","Operator","Next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, I was wondering if you could comment on the sequential pattern of profitability at the refinery. It looks like your benchmark spread improved and your throughput ticked up a bit and the earnings were off $5 million. What is going on there? Is it crude slate or the coker outage impact?","James L. Gallogly","It was more of the coker outage impact. It didn't let us process what we wanted to process and really hit the mix of products in the back end. So that was more of the story. And we had said last quarter that we still had some work going on, on that, and that's now been completed.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Very good. And then second, you'd indicated kind of weather-related impacts of about $300 million, partially offset by some price increases. Can you give us a sense regarding how much of that pressure you might expect to recover in 2Q and beyond, if any?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. We'll get some of that back in the second quarter. But kind of to put that in perspective, a couple hundred million dollars was related to O&P-Americas, and then about another $100 million was related to increased natural gas, oxyfuels shipping delays, couldn't get some cargoes out. And then the coker stuff at the refinery increased natural gas prices.","Douglas J. Pike","Yes. Kevin, this is Doug. I just want to clarify that, that $300 million that Jim stated was not just weather. That was also largely the maintenance, where we had the planning for La Porte. We had our La Porte polyethylene facility and its turnaround. And then we had some weather-related maintenance and some other maintenance in some of the olefins plants. So that really encompasses the whole thing, not just the weather.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. That's very important to make sure that, that's clear. I mentioned the La Porte turnaround cost is 40 million pounds of ethylene and a couple of Channelview crackers using another 160 million pounds. And then we talked about weather-related things as well. So all of that is in that total mix, that 200 million [ph].","Operator","Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","Again wanted to revisit this whole European ethane export side of things. Obviously, from one side of it, there's fear that there may be tightness in the U.S. ethane market on the back of this. But let's say that all of this volume does eventually arrive in Europe. I mean, obviously, there are going to be some fairly severe coproduct consequences as well, particularly on the propylene and butadiene side of things. So I would love to sort of hear your views around that.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. If all of that could go to Europe, and my view is, if we're talking about the Enterprise deal, I think that's highly, highly improbable from what I understand the economics looks like and the ability of crackers to even take it.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","I would imagine for companies -- you would have companies shutting down downstream units if they were to do that.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. There'd have to be a lot of work to accomplish it. And I just don't know how that gets done. Frankly, when we do our economics, it's also much easier to shift polyethylene than ethane. And that's why you see all these cracker announcements versus these kind of projects. There must be more to that story than we're seeing. And that's why we're anxious to hear more. But if your premise were basically right that, that all could go to Europe, it would have a significant impact on coproducts. It'd run up propylene prices, it'd run up butadiene prices, be significant shortages. But all of that stuff goes into our computation when we decide what we're going to crack every day. So I just don't see how that all that capacity could go to Europe.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","Fair enough. Now as a follow-up, changing gears a bit, you had mentioned that in terms of usage of cash, you'd look at acquisitions obviously being accretive and the like. I mean, could you comment on just your appetite in terms of specialty versus commodity? Because again and again, obviously you've reiterated the back-to-basic strategy. Does that still hold?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. There's several companies that like to talk about becoming more specialty-oriented. We're very happy with who we are. We compete very well. We have a commodity mindset in the way that we maintain our cost, the way that we work our debottlenecks in adding cheap capacity. We also believe that very well-run commodity chemical companies perform better across the cycle than specialty. So overall, we're more interested in accretive transactions versus whether they're this type or that type. We're interested in high return on our capital and the deployment of our cash.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","There's been a number of announcements on around condensate splitters being built over the next couple of years. And I was curious to get your thoughts on if that would change the economics at all at Corpus. Obviously, you're doing an expansion there, too. And if so, how that would affect the economics there?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Actually, I think there will be some condensate splitters built. And frankly, we're looking at that as well because we have some opportunity potentially to do that at a very cheap cost. So we think it's a positive development for us instead of a potential negative. Yes, condensate prices could in theory go up. But we expect there to be a lot of condensate available, some out of South Texas already from the Eagle Ford that has a positive impact on us, to the point where we're just not taking any Middle East condensate in our U.S. operations any more. And we expect some additional condensates to come from some of the Northeast fields, particularly the Utica. So we think there's an opportunity for us there for the Corpus at our refinery, and we'll see how that all develops.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on that. Obviously, there's still wrangling going on in Washington whether condensate can be allowed to be exported. But if there's all this capacity that comes on, it may not matter because you'll have a lot of naphtha. In either case, would you be a participant either on condensate exports or naphtha exports into your European assets?","James L. Gallogly","Well, so far, we haven't needed to export any naphtha into our European operations. But potentially condensates could move in at the right pricing, although one of those things that's happened is there's been a displacement of foreign imports into United States. Those have been flowing into our European operations. And in fact, in one instance, we just changed a contract from being a U.S. contract to a European contract and moved those cheap condensates in.","Operator","Next question is Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A quick couple of questions. First, can you give a sense for how -- what you think aggregate outages will be as a headwind in Q2 and possibly also Q3, if you have that available?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. There's a fair amount of capacity that we expect to be down in olefins in the second quarter. Obviously, La Porte is down now, our asset, and we talked about that being an 80-day outage. DuPont has a cracker down. ExxonMobil Beaumont and Baytown will be down. We're hearing about 10% of capacity down. And then with the pipeline looking like it's coming up into Louisiana, we're already seeing spot ethylene move up fairly aggressively. So we think that's all a nice development for margins into the second quarter.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then secondly, on the European dynamic, in terms of condensate and naphtha coming available, is -- are you seeing any competitor assets that would not be able to benefit from that dynamic over the next several years that would just keep the cost curves steeper? Or is this going to be something that everybody in the industry should eventually be able to benefit from?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think the United States and the Middle East assets still are so competitively advantaged. It all gets down to a crude-to-natural gas ratio. And we still very much favor -- like what we see here in the United States and our Middle East assets are also benefiting. But we see that ratio staying high. And that's why you see people like Enterprise making announcements like they did. One thing I should have also said is obviously Europe has a large number of inland crackers. So that's something to consider when you start thinking about the ability to take advantaged feedstocks. There aren't that many coastal crackers with that kind of opportunity.","Operator","Next question I'm showing comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Thanks so much, Jim, for the project-by-project review. I thought it was interesting in listening to the commentary about the rising labor and material costs that you're seeing. So it kind of begs the question regarding all these mega crackers that may be coming up in 2016, 2017, even 2018, what are your thoughts about those projects? And how should we be thinking about that timeframe in terms of startups, et cetera?","James L. Gallogly","Those projects are going to be expensive. We're already seeing a lot of pressure. Since we're in the field today, we can see firsthand what's going on. And there's a couple of dynamics. One, labor is definitely going up and the quality of that labor is not what it used to be. And so productivity is going down, and that's at this stage when there's not as much out there to do. We're still in the early phases. So when some of those big projects ramp up, I think it's going to get worse, not better. So I would expect cost to be higher and I expect things to come in a little slower. We'll see what really develops. But I can tell you from our own experience, that's absolutely what we're seeing today.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, terrific. And then obviously, you have a very enviable balance sheet. You spent over $1 billion on buying back stock in Q1. Does that pace seem reasonable for Q2 and beyond?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes. So as of, you'll see we're going to file our Q here, you'll see as of the end of last week, we had approximately 10 million shares remaining on the initial 10% authorization. And the expectation is that we will purchase that through the end of this May. And then we have the new authorization. It's about 53 million shares, which we have authorized over the next 18 months.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. So I'd say we have a great balance sheet and we like our growth prospects a lot. So we're making an acquisition of ourselves.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, I was wondering if we're to presume that there is going to be a massive ethane imbalance for quite some time, have you seen that expressed yet in any greater willingness for long-term contracts or fixed fractionation margin contracts or something, where you could lock in a more secure price over the next 5 or 10 years?","James L. Gallogly","No, I really haven't. That's why I'm a bit anxious to see what's going on with the Enterprise project to see if there are more details on what they're doing. But right now, I don't see that. We'll just have to see how that develops. Frankly, if it's as long as we think, we're still going to get great pricing. And so we're happy to let it all develop like it's going on right now.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And do you suspect that it's possible, like if they really had 3 virtual ethane crackers pop up in Europe, would that make your cracker system even better, would we get into some shorter supply that some of these -- as we've seen in the U.S.? Or is it just a drop in the bucket, given the scale of assets already over there, just won't make a big difference?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I just frankly can't see how all that Enterprise volume goes to Europe. Physically, I just don't know how that happens and how it gets integrated into the crackers over there. And I don't see anybody that would build a new ethane cracker over there with these kind of economics, you'd build it here in the United States immediately and not have that shipping cost. So there's got to be more to their story. I think there must be an Asian dimension that we don't understand yet.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I've seen some producers suggest the potential for ethane imports into Europe have allowed them to negotiate better feedstock terms. Have you seen that creep up at all for you?","James L. Gallogly","Not really.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the last one, if I might. On the Refining side, do you think there's any scope for any change in the ethanol mandates in gasoline?","James L. Gallogly","I hope so.","Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But do you think there is?","James L. Gallogly","I think we'll know more in a short period of time. But at least in the first EPA announcement on certain of the cellulosic volumes, they were realistic on that. So we hope good judgment prevails.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jim, when you say lighter feedstocks just don't work for you in Europe, is -- that's because of the propylene and propylene oxide integration that you've got over there?","James L. Gallogly","No, not really. This -- when I say lighter feedstocks don't work, I want to be careful. I said ethane doesn't work. Propane and butane does. Condensates do. Obviously, when we crack lighter like that, we make less propylene, less butadiene. But overall, within our system, we're still a major purchaser of propylene anyway. We're very short. And so that we're buying on the open market. So overall, it's more a question of lightening up somewhat. Last year in the summer, we went quite a bit lighter and in the first quarter, maybe almost 1\/3 of the feed. So we'll keep working that, trying to make money.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then as a follow-up, it seems pretty certain that CapEx will decline materially in 2016. I know that's a little ways out here. But is that far enough out that you could have some shorter-term projects come in and back-fill on the CapEx side?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we're not going to have all the big projects that we do today to expand U.S. olefins. We want those online soon. And that's why we've been racing to get those projects finished. But we'll have another pipeline of projects that come back in that point in time but maybe not as much as we're doing right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Robert Rightsees [ph] with Broadwright Capital [ph].","Unknown Analyst","I just have one quick question. Regarding the first 2 months of the year. I was trying to put together how much that cost you with the weather and some of the outages, et cetera. And I'm not sure if you were saying a couple hundred million here and there. But could you give us either margin number or a dollar number, what you think the weather and some of those effects cost you in the first quarter?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. What we're seeing is in O&P-Americas, the impact was about $200 million. And then there was $100 million of other items on the rest of the portfolio related to weather, natural gas prices, coker outage, all of those kinds of things.","Douglas J. Pike","And Bob, there's a little bit of an offset, of course, across the quarter as we raised prices moving across the quarter.","James L. Gallogly","And February was our toughest month. March was much better.","Operator","I am showing no further questions at this time.","James L. Gallogly","Okay. Well, thank you very much. We expect a very solid second quarter in U.S. O&P-Americas. As I said, the first quarter was not on our normal pace. We have the La Porte turnaround as a key project and other growth projects moving ahead very rapidly. So we feel very good about U.S. O&P. EAI had a strong first quarter, running at exceptional rates, 93%, way above industry averages. And we think we're performing differentially in Europe compared to our peer groups. I&D had another very solid quarter, performing as expected. And now with methanol online, we have upside in our Refining operations. Margins are good. We just need to run better. So we feel very good about our future. We're investing in our company. We've increased the regular dividend and are buying back our shares. We have a very bright future, and we thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

Let's take a look at page 4 and review a few financial highlights. 2011 was a strong year for LyondellBasell. We generated net income of $2.1 billion and EBITDA of $5.3 billion. If we take into account all of the items we don't believe reflect underlying business results including the unique financing costs associated with our balance sheet restructuring, charges related to the suspension of operations at the Berre refinery, and our European restructuring, the underlying net income would be $2.7 billion and EBITDA would be $5.4 billion. The corresponding earnings were $4.71 per share excluding items of this nature.","In the fourth quarter, prices and margins in the olefins chain and refining declined from strong earlier levels. As a result of this and several charges, our fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $536 million or $675 million exclusive of charges. While the magnitude of the quarterly decline is significant, there is positive momentum building in a number of our businesses at present. I attribute most of the weakness in the fourth quarter to global economic conditions, particularly in Europe, unusual crude pricing movements in refining and typical seasonal trends. However, the quarter was also impacted by other items including turnarounds in the Intermediates & Derivatives segment.","Karyn and I will discuss all the details later in the call but first, I want to discuss some of our 2011 accomplishments. If you turn to page 5 of the presentation, I'll begin with our 2011 environmental health and safety performance. Our safety statistics have continued to improve. While we typically only speak to you regarding our employee and contractor safety performance, I would also like to highlight the improvement in our process safety and environmental performance. These are all indicators of focus and investment in our operations. I am quite proud of our results and the continued improvement to levels that rival the best in the industry.","Unfortunately, though, I must report that in mid-January, we had an incident in one of our low-density polyethylene lines in Wesseling, Germany. There were no injuries and the damage was limited to an older 130 million pound per year line. The line is currently out of service and we are still investigating the cause and assessing damages.","On Page 6, we have outlined some of the key establishments. I will highlight just a few of the many achievements. First, as a relatively young Company, establishing strong governance has been an important focus. During the year, we expanded our Supervisory Board, adding world-class expertise. We have always emphasized cost management, and 2011 was not an exception. Our underlying fixed costs were flat compared to 2009. I'm also pleased to say that LyondellBasell shares outperformed the market delivering a 10% return to our shareholders. In the financial area, we undertook an important balance sheet restructuring. This unlocked the value of our significant cash generation as we both reduced debt and paid a $2.6 billion special dividend.","Operationally, our plants established 35 annual production records or increasing ethane processing capabilities by approximately 5%. We also improved operations at the Houston refinery, enabling us to increase throughput and benefit from strong early year margins. We advanced our investment program by completing major turnarounds at the refinery in two U.S. olefins plants. We also completed many quick payout high-return projects. Further, we enjoyed significant commercial success. We advanced our growth plans. For example, we defined our U.S. olefins expansion projects and the restart of an existing methanol plant, allowing us to further exploit the North American natural gas and ethane advantage. Working with Sinopec, we announced plans for joint feasibility study for PO\/TBA plant in Ningbo, China.","The Houston refinery crude purchasing program was another bright spot. This effort diversified our sourcing, while yielding an estimated $150 million advantage in 2011 versus the industry benchmark. In contrast to these opportunities, the situation in European Olefins & Polyolefins as well as European refining was quite difficult. We address this as well. We initiated actions to restructure our European operations and on January 4 we ceased operations at the Berre refinery. On the bottom of page, you can see the EBITDA results by segment. For the year, all segments did quite well, improving from an already solid 2010 performance.","Let's turn to slide 7 and look at some of the metrics that drove the performance. On the left side of the chart you can see that our ethylene production volumes were relatively unchanged versus 2010. This data reflects production after netting our Channelview flex unit volumes. This tends to understate ethylene operating rates since we converted an increased percentage of our ethylene to higher value propylene. The margin improvement is the more leveraging story. Our ethylene margins increased by 26% in North America. In Europe, ethylene margins also expanded, but from a much smaller base and fell to a slight loss at year-end. In both regions, the improvement in ethylene margins was partially offset by reduced polyethylene spreads. Overall, chain margins increased and were strong in North America. 2011 was a difficult year for polypropylene. High polypropylene prices led to deselection and soft demand which is reflected in the reduced sales volumes.","The Intermediates and Derivatives segment had a very strong performance. We saw an increase in intermediates product volumes. Ethylene glycol was particularly strong as operating and catalyst improvements led to record production. However, propylene oxide product volumes declined primarily in Europe. On the far right side of the slide, we show metrics for the Houston refinery. Crude throughput increased significantly, averaging slightly less than full capacity. This, coupled with the strong Maya 2-1-1 spread for most of the year, and our crude purchasing strategy led to an excellent annual results.","I'd like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.","Karyn Ovelmen \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to slide eight, which charts our fourth quarter and full year segment EBITDA. As Jim said, the fourth quarter experienced a significant decline from record third quarter performance. We will cover details a little later but in general, each segment experienced year-end slowdowns.","Additionally, the North American Olefins & Polyolefins segment was impacted by price declines, particularly in ethylene co-products. The Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment experienced similar trends in co-products causing European Olefins & Polyolefins to operate at a small loss. The EBITDA generated within this segment came from high polypropylene compounding and our joint ventures. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment also generated lower fourth quarter profits. This is primarily related to plant maintenance downtime, typical slow year-end sales and weak sales into the aircraft deicing and use.","The Refining & Oxyfuels segment was impacted by very weak Refining margins while Oxyfuels results the weaker than third quarter benefited from stronger than typical winter margins. The bar chart on the right depicts full year EBITDA by segments, notably the North American Olefins & Polyolefins segment delivered more than $2 billion of EBITDA. To put this in perspective, this was approximately $0.26 per pound of ethylene production. The other segments also performed well with each major segment generating EBITDA of approximately $1 billion.","Now, let's turn to slide nine, and see how we deployed the cash. The first thing you might notice is that in the fourth quarter cash from operations excluding changes in working capital was negative $385 million. Let me point out that this includes approximately $400 million in premiums paid to refinance our balance sheet and a U.S. tax payment of approximately $200 million. On this chart I want to highlight our debt repayment and dividends. During 2011, we reduced our debt by $2.1 billion and paid $2.9 billion in dividends while maintaining a comfortable $1 billion cash balance.","The chart on the right provides a good picture of our overall performance since becoming public. Excluding changes in working capital, we generated approximately $5.6 billion from operations and returned over $6 billion to our investors through dividends and debt reduction. Working capital was managed closely generating approximately $200 million. During the 20 months, capital spending was $1.5 billion.","Slide 10, shows a little more detail on our working capital and liquidity. We finished the year with $3.2 billion of liquidity consistent with our targets and our net debt was slightly below $3 billion. While discussing liquidity, I want to point that we have not yet received the majority of our anticipated tax refund. We have received all required government approvals in January of this year and believe we will receive approximately $200 million shortly.","This being the beginning of a new year, I expect that you have a few modeling questions. Regarding capital, we are planning to spend approximately $1.4 billion during 2012. As always, we will target to complete this work at a lower cost. Interest expense can be calculated based on approximately $4 billion of beginning debt and an average interest rate of approximately 9%. Additionally, there will be an estimated $5 million to $10 million per quarter to amortized financing fees.","Annual book depreciation should be relatively unchanged from 2011. We plan to contribute approximately $160 million to our pension and other social programs and estimate an expense of approximately $80 million. Regarding taxes, we currently expect a book rate of approximately 30% to 32%, and after taking into consideration our refund and other tax attributes, we expect cash taxes to be significantly below book taxes.","Now, I'll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.","Jim Gallogly \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance beginning on slide number 11 with Olefins & Polyolefins, Americas. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $407 million, a decline of $266 million versus the third quarter. For the full year, our segment EBITDA was $2.14 billion, an outstanding year given the generally weak global economy. The key driver of the quarterly decline was reduced ethylene co-product prices. During the third quarter, propylene, butadiene and benzene benefited from very strong pricing, and the U.S. naphtha cracking was quite competitive with ethane. These prices declined during the fourth quarter, making naphtha cracker \u2013 cracking less competitive.","Let's discuss a few metrics to put the quarterly results in perspective. Relative to the third quarter, our average ethylene price declined by approximately $0.02 per pound, while the cost of ethylene production metric increased by $0.11 per pound. The latter increase was primarily related to the cracking of non-ethane feedstock. In fact, our average cost of ethane feedstock was relatively unchanged as cost increases in the Gulf Coast were offset by decreases in the Midwest. Production volumes increased moderately as we continue to operate our ethylene plants near full capacity.","However, characteristic of year-end buying patterns, our ethylene sales declined. During the quarter, we built some inventory in preparation for upcoming turnaround. Polyethylene sales price declined by approximately $0.05 per pound versus the third quarter. The decline came early in the quarter and reversed in December when we realized a priced increase. Polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.02 per pound as price declines outpaced the propylene monomer price decline.","Polyolefin sales volumes were relatively unchanged versus the third quarter. Although fourth quarter results declined relative to the third quarter, exclusive of 2010 lower cost or market adjustments, they outpaced the fourth quarter of 2010 by $65 million. For the full year, EBITDA exceeded 2010 by more than $400 million, primarily due to higher ethylene margins.","Overall, it was a very good year for this segment, and the underlying fundamentals that supported the performance have remained intact. We still have cheap U.S. ethane as compared to heavier feedstocks. During the first quarter, we have been experienced positive price momentum in several products. We are also benefiting from lower ethane, propane, and natural gas costs.","During the first two quarters of 2012, the industry will have a very active maintenance schedule. I'll remind you that at the end of February, we'll begin a turnaround of Channelview. This is a significant turnaround, and we expect to lose approximately seven weeks production from one olefins plant and half a month at the second plant. Although we have taken many commercial actions to prepare for this, you should expect an impact on the first and second quarter results.","Let's turn to slide 12 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. The fourth quarter was very difficult as we generated EBITDA of only $62 million, a decline of $199 million from the third quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was $931 million, 14% above 2010. Results on this segment followed the trends that we discussed during the recent Investor Day. Profitability in olefins and commodity polyolefins was slightly below breakeven. Profit was generated through differentiated products.","During the fourth quarter, we maintained solid earnings in our polypropylene compounding business and received dividends from one of our Saudi Arabian joint ventures. In prior quarters, we benefited from substantial earnings in our butadiene operations. While butadiene recovery remained profitable during the fourth quarter, the average butadiene price declined by approximately $0.45 per pound.","Versus the third quarter lower co-product prices caused ethylene margins to decline by approximately $0.07 per pound. Ethylene production declined by 13% due in part to normal seasonal trends, but also from a weak European economy. Polyolefin sales volumes also declined by approximately 13%. Polyethylene margins declined by approximately $0.02 per pound while polypropylene margins were generally unchanged. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, we experienced lower polyolefin margins and volumes.","Results in polypropylene compounding were relatively unchanged and joint venture dividends increased. Throughout 2011 differentiated business areas performed well. The first three quarters benefited from co-product strength during, particularly butadiene. Polyolefin results were also relatively strong during the first half of 2011. However, as the European economy weakened results in these products decline.","In summary, it was a respectable year for this segment but a difficult quarter, primarily in European commodity products. We continue to aggressively pursue restructuring in this region. Over the past several years we have shuddered European capacity while starting up advantaged joint venture assets elsewhere in the world. Most recently, we announced a plant closure of additional polypropylene capacity at our Wesseling site.","Our commercial restructuring efforts are well underway. In the near-term, we have seen some positive price moves within Europe but economic uncertainty remains a key factor over the coming months. I would also remind you that this segment includes the Middle East and Asia which performed well during 2011. Thus far, this trend remains intact.","Now, please turn to slide 13 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $173 million, a decline from the prior quarter. However, for the full year, results were very strong generating record EBITDA of greater than $1 billion. This segment of our company has normally been very stable.","In the fourth quarter, volatility is larger that we have typically experienced. The drivers of the decline are different than within our Olefins & Polyolefins segment. The majority are either non-recurring or seasonal in nature. More than half of the quarterly decline occurred in propylene oxide and derivatives, and most of the balance was acetyls. Both of these areas executed significant turnarounds during the fourth quarter, and this was the major driver of the lower results.","Having said that, other factors also contributed, such as, seasonally slower year-end sales in the European industry, very weak propylene glycol sales into aircraft deicing due to warm weather in both the U.S. and Europe, lower ethylene glycol prices and seasonal marginal declines in TBA chemicals. Absent the turnaround impacts, underlying business results were somewhat stronger than the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, EBITDA exceeded 2010 by approximately $200 million. Propylene oxide and derivative results were strong in both years. Acetyls and ethylene oxygenates experienced particularly good results in 2011. Acetyls' strength was driven by low U.S. natural gas costs and competitor operational issues.","Ethylene oxygenates benefited from a tight supply demand environment and strong production as we debottlenecked our plant and upgraded our catalyst system. Looking forward, year-end maintenance activities are behind us. Temperatures have only recently cooled and as a result the deicing sales continued to lag. Additionally, Intermediates & Derivative product sales were often influenced by durable goods end-uses and therefore sales volumes can be susceptible to the global economic volatility.","Let's move to slide 14 for a discussion of the Refining & Oxyfuels segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA in this segment includes $136 million of charges related to the suspension of operations at the Berre refinery. Absent this, results were still very weak at $26 million. This decline of $493 million from the third quarter is primarily related to lower industry margins. In comparison to the fourth quarter of 2010, underlying results declined by approximately $50 million. This is attributed to weak November and December refining spreads. At our Houston refinery, quarterly EBITDA was slightly above breakeven. Margins declined as the quarter progressed.","Additionally, crude purchasing advantages seen in prior quarters were temporarily lost when WTI crude pricing abruptly increased compared to other crudes like Brent, due to the announcement of the Seaway Pipeline reversal. In general, this impacted some prior purchases which are based on the WTI crude index. The WTI Brent spread has widened in recent weeks.","During the quarter, the Houston refinery operated near full capacity consuming approximately 262,000 barrels of crude daily. The Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $13 per barrel during the quarter and only $9 per barrel during December.","Our Berre refinery operated at 61,000 barrels per day while consuming existing crude inventories prior to ceasing operations on January 4. Underlying EBITDA for the quarter declined by approximately $35 million versus the third quarter as the benchmark spread declined by $1 per barrel and throughput was reduced by a labor strike related to the anticipated closure.","In Oxyfuels, our results were influenced by seasonal margin declines; however, the declines were somewhat less than normally experienced during winter months. Excluding the $136 million of charges related to the Berre refinery, underlying segment EBITDA for 2011 was approximately $1.1 billion, an improvement of approximately $650 million versus 2010. This includes the Berre refinery EBITDA loss of approximately $150 million.","Thus far in 2012, the Maya 2-1-1 spread has improved from its December low point averaging approximately $15 per barrel in January and near $20 per barrel during the first days of February. Although operations at the Berre refinery have been suspended, we continue to clear the unit and safely secure the equipment so that it can be my fault.","During the first and second quarters, we will continue to incur fixed costs at the refinery. Oxyfuels margins have been good for this time of the year. I'd like to close with a few final thoughts on the past quarter and our near-term outlook.","First, I want to be clear that the fourth quarter was disappointing. We had record earnings in the second quarter, again in the third quarter, and so have set high expectations. Yes, we have some unusual charges in the quarter but clearly, macroeconomic conditions changed as we approached the end of the year.","We always see seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter but this year global sentiment was negative as well. Our U.S. Olefins & Polyolefins business weathered this storm reasonably well and the fundamentals that created outstanding full year results are intact. Crude oil prices remain elevated while U.S. natural gas prices and NGL prices have continued to decline. As you can see on Page 16, margins are already rebounding nicely.","Our refinery results in the U.S. fell dramatically, but margins have recently rebounded. We have stopped operations at the Berre refinery, have taken a significant charge to earnings in the quarter and will in the coming months eliminate this drag on earnings. Our Intermediates & Derivatives business is relatively steady performer, but not immune to general market and seasonal impacts. This segment fared reasonably well, but was impacted by two major turnarounds in the fourth quarter.","Our European Olefins & Polyolefins business was significantly impacted by macroeconomic conditions. This segment appeared to be recovering from trough conditions earlier in the year, but experienced very weak markets late in the year. We will remain vigilant and disciplined in our restructuring efforts and will push hard to regain profitability in this region.","While we see some early indications, markets are proving, particularly in the United States. We will always remain focus on a few key things; safety, operational reliability, reducing our costs, including the cost of debt, being disciplined stewards of our capital as we undertake growth plans and returning value to our shareholders.","We're now pleased to take questions. Brad?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Begeleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning. Jim.","Jim Gallogly","","Yes, good morning.","David Begeleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you. On the U.S. ethane price situation, do you see those lower prices immediately or is there some sort of lag given your inventory situation?","Jim Gallogly","Ethane prices are usually seen almost immediately. The prices as you would probably recognize are under $0.50, I believe they were $0.47 a gallon yesterday and of course even much cheaper in the Midwest. We see that almost immediately in our operations.","David Begeleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Very good and just few comment on the advantage and benefit of both the Conway hub as well as your Corpus Christi cracker versus and they are buying NGLs from the Eagle Ford versus Gulf Coast metrics?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah. The Midwest has just dramatically advantaged at this point in time. Ethane has been priced kind of that priced even below the value of natural gas, which is incredibly low for February on the $2.50 Henry Hub range. So, the Midwest has a terrific advantage, a couple billion pounds of ethylene cracking there. Corpus Christi is a slightly heavier cracker, although, we have been moving significantly more ethane through that unit. The other thing that's happened as a result of the Eagle Ford production is we are taking in steeply discounted condensates into that unit. That's been helping our overall cost structure. So, we saw that cracker move from a relatively high cost cracker to middle of the pack despite it's been fairly heavy.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just last. Would you expect European olefins profitability to remain similar in Q1 to Q4?","Jim Gallogly","Well, we've seen some price increases already. January was reasonably weak, but people have been committed to moving prices. There have been some pretty dramatic price increases; ethylene, propylene, and pushing our various polymer prices pretty hard too. So, we'll see how the quarter develops but there is a lot of activity around that. The other thing that you have to recognize is butadiene. It's moved up to \u20ac235 a ton in February. So, as we pointed out in Investor Day, butadiene is a lot of where the value was extracted last year. We saw prices fall in December; they are increasing earlier in the year, so that will help us.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Bob Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks very much. Jim, you guys have quite a few projects on tap to do some of the bottlenecks or brownfield expansion and get some more ethane consumption. Could you just talk a little bit about the mood of the ethane producers in giving you some long-term confidence that you're going to see these low rates? It seems like there is quite a bit of contentious chatter on whether ethane is going to be long for a few years or tight for a few years, and then obviously there is that giant balloon of ethane out on the horizon. So, can you talk about negotiating for some security or stability in ethane, and then also, what path do you see over the next few quarters as we get through the turnaround seasons and back into a more normal environment?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, those are very good questions, Bob. If you look at where ethane was last quarter \u2013 in the fourth quarter; you saw some prices that were about $0.90, and obviously today under $0.50, so that's a very dramatic shift. There was a lot of chatter in the markets about there being issues around transportation in all, and as I said at Investor Day, I think that probably was overstated. I personally think that the market is reasonably balanced. As you know, there is several turnarounds going on right now; some unplanned outages. That puts tremendous pressure to move ethane, and as a result you see product moved dramatically lower. That pressure is going to remain on ethane, I believe in the first and second quarters at a minimum because of all the turnarounds. There is a remarkable amount of what's going on in the industry right now.","Going into the third and fourth quarter, we expect there to be some NGL fractionation capacity coming on, and we'll see how markets are going to react to that. But I personally think ethane prices should stay fairly low for the year. I feel pretty good about that, especially, when we're sitting here in February with the prices where they are.","Bob Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Certainly that strips out there even through '13 of sub $0.45 ethane would validate that, but is there been any willingness of the producers, the suppliers of ethane to lock in long-term contracts with you or are they still reluctant?","Jim Gallogly","","Well, there are some people that are out there looking for strips right now, and as you said, we could do a fair amount of stuff through the end of this year at a minimum. There are people approaching us from the Marcellus; some other folks in other of these regions that are coming in and would like to know that they can move the product. We think ethane is going to go long and so we're hesitant to do that at this point in time. We have discussed it, but at this point in time, don't look to lock any of those margins.","Bob Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Got it. Quickly, can you give us some methanol update on that project?","Jim Gallogly","","Yes, we continue to do engineering work. Of course, the plant exists today and the most important thing is getting a permit which they are looking at they have the 2012 to get that started at.","Operator","Our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citi","Yes, hi good morning.","Jim Gallogly","","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citi","Jim, given the (accelerate) in propane in the U.S. with warm winter and all that can you ship some of your liquids to your European crackers to get them a little advantage?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yes, we can. We've been historically buying some Algerian condensates. One of the things that people don't necessarily recognize about the shutdown of the Berre refinery is that will allow us to change our feedstock slate into our cracker at Berre. We can look at some condensates; we can try to buy naphtha, little better pricing. We think we will have some benefit at the Berre cracker as a result of that the ability to change the feedstock slate a bit. But in terms of United States, obviously ethane is very advantaged. The thing that people don't necessarily see is that last quarter we had real deterioration in co-product prices and propane has come on pretty strong. And so we can go ahead and put some propane back into furnaces and make some propylene and make some money again. That should help us quite a bit here in the first second quarters.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citi","Okay. And you also mentioned that you've been converting more ethylene into propylene. So can you help us understand what are the economics of metathesis unit today and what are your thoughts about what accelerating your new metathesis capacity?","Jim Gallogly","In the fourth quarter, we lost some of that advantage. It just didn't make sense to go ahead given propylene prices to convert ethylene into propylene. So, we were doing considerably less of that. That hurt our earnings, but at this moment in time, that makes sense again, and we are running what we call, double-dimmer mode.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citi","And anything on the new capacity?","Jim Gallogly","We are still working on that project, so nothing new from what we said at Investor Day. I think, February propylene contract price is up over $0.16, so that's very, very significant, and that's why the sudden shift back to double-dimmer.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citi","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yeah, good morning. On the turnarounds this year at Channelview, how should we think about that as being kind of a year-over-year impact on lost earnings?","Jim Gallogly","Well, we are going to have OP-1 down through that entire period of time. We'll start at the end of this month on that turnaround. And as a result of having a co-gen unit down, that takes our steam down we're having to also shut down OP-2 for a short period of time. So remember, we did the turnaround of OP-2 last year, but unfortunately with the way we have co-gen setup and the lack of steam, we just can't run OP-2 across that turnaround at the co-gen unit. So, both will down. We've been in the process of turning around our crackers in a significant way last year and this year. And then, as you look forward into the year after that, year after that, we're not going to have as much to do.","Now, in Europe, we have one of our big crackers down in the fall at Wesseling, but we're catching up with their turnarounds and in the next few years we'll be in pretty good shape on that. Before I forget, Duffy, I also mentioned that we built some inventory in December and we did take some commercial steps to try to mitigate the impacts of the big turnarounds at Channelview.","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. And then just two kind of housekeeping questions; the inventory of Berre was supposed to be a nice cash flow in the fall for you guys as you worked off that inventory when you shut it down. Has that already happened? Have we seen that cash come through the cash flow statement yet or is that still in the future? Then, if you would just touch on the remaining expensive debt you've got and what we should think about for plans for that over the next year?","Jim Gallogly","I'll let Karyn answer those questions, Duffy.","Karyn Ovelmen","Sure, from a cash flow perspective, as it relates to Berre, approximately $100 million was liquidated in the fourth quarter. We do expect given current pricing another order of magnitude around $300 million or so in the first quarter of 2012. In terms of our current debt that we have outstanding, the remaining 2017 and '18 notes have their call date in May of 2013. Today, the market fundamentals and technicals are very strong, but I expect volatility will remain high. So, there are windows of opportunities that exist in the market. If the market provides opportunities for the Company to move towards its transformation to an investment-grade like capital structure and also have a significant reduction in our weighted average coupon rate; on our bonds, then we should, as we are, continue to explore those opportunities. We'll continue to monitor the markets and balance market risk with tender cost and potential annual interest savings.","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, terrific. Thank you, guys.","Operator","","Next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMC. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMC","","Hi good morning.","Jim Gallogly","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMC","Ethane production really stepped up in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. In that, I think gas plant production was 942,000 barrels per day in October and 985,000 in November. Do you think the gas plant production has increased since November, or do you think it's about the same. And then earlier in your comments, you said that you expected more capacity, more ethane capacity to come on. So, where do you think gas plant production might be by the end of 2012?","Jim Gallogly","Well, I think there were more NGLs produced at the end of the year. I think that trend line continues. I would tell you that there has been a slight reduction in the number of rigs that are running. But having said that, they're looking at dry gas; people are making money on the liquids still. And so my best guess is that ethane is going to long, and we believe that this is a continuing trend. There still are lots of rigs drilling for gas. When prices are $2.50 an M, that's not the best economics for the producers, but having said that, a lot of them have obligations continue to drill or earn their acreage. Generally, the ethane production trend is up, and some of these transportation bottlenecks that people talked about are being fixed. The issues surrounding Bellevue related to a fire last year and some of the jumpers that need to be put in; a lot of that work's done, and so we're not seeing those same number of issues.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMC","Alright. And then lastly, there is a very positive 2-1-1 crack spread but there has been a negative Maya spread. Do you think you can do anything about the negative Maya spread or is there a way to configure your feeds, so that you can widen out your refinery margins over an intermediate period of time?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah. That light heavy differential is part of the crack and there was new capacity that came on in the fourth quarter that caused that light heavy differential to shrink, but then there was other capacity toward the billions that went offline that helped us again. Right now, that 2-1-1 crack is pretty good. We also see quite a widening of the WTI to Brent differential. And give how we price certain of our crudes, that's been helpful. I perhaps didn't emphasize enough on the call but we got to hurt when that collapse happened in WTI to Brent. That was overnight and had nothing to do with physical movement of oil. That was just a trader phenomenon and we had priced crude off of WTI and so when it dropped over $10 a barrel that hit us.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","","Yes, thank you. Jim, are you able to do much in the way of opportunistic spot ethylene sales similar to what you did back in March, April 2010 when margins were about $0.35. I think they are over $0.40 today. What is your upcoming turnaround at OP-1 preclude you taking advantage of these very attractive sport opportunities?","Jim Gallogly","We always watch that Don. You properly pointed that spot is very, very high. It's in the low to mix $0.60 a pound right now and compared to mid-50s for contract. So, there are opportunities to move spot pounds. Having said that, supply is pretty tight, and we are watching the turnaround schedule. We think that that tight supply is going to continue, and you when you see kind of a spread between contract and spot, that tells you where inventories are, and so, we were building in December really hard in our crackers in anticipation of what might happen early in the year, built some inventory, put some cash to work doing that, and hopefully that will pay out for our investors as we come into the end of the first, second quarter.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","And can you talk a bit about demand from some of your polymer customers both in the U.S. and export business into Asia. There appears to be a bit of restocking going on, but is it continuing and what sort of your view of pipeline inventories after what seemed like a lot of de-stocking in the fourth quarter?","Jim Gallogly","The fourth quarter was really pretty weak in polymer almost around the world, less so in the United States probably than Europe. Asia definitely took a breather in the fourth quarter. I was on the phone with our sales team as late as yesterday talking about where Asia was coming out of the Chinese New Year. They told me that there is some renewed activity. The traders are reentering the market. Those are all positive signs.","But we are just out of the Chinese New Year, so we are going to have to see if that trend continues. Early days, positive, we'll see where that goes. In the United States, we were able to get a price increase in December, that's seldom happens, it was a nickel. We've got a couple of more price increases on the table. Things look reasonably tight especially, when you look at where turnarounds are going, and so we are going to push those price increases real hard.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you. Just hoping to dimensionalize a little bit more Jim, your expectations for ethane pricing, particularly in the second half of the year, just when we look at it, we see a fair amount of incremental ethane demand coming from BASF plant and some others as well and then presumably all of the unplanned outages are back and the plant is well.","But I just want to sort of get a sense of your comments that ethane prices were going to stay, I don't know if you meant they were going to stay about where they are or if you just meant they're not going to go anywhere back near where they were in the second half of last year. So if you could just try to bring sense to those a little bit more, that would be helpful.","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, I thought ethane prices, when they got above $0.90 were exaggerated and certainly not market at the time; although I did hear some experts say, well, that's probably hereto say, and I just disagreed with that. It was abnormal conditions. I think where we're at right now is a bit abnormal conditions. They are very, very low. Having said that, when we look at ethane going forward, there is a fair amount of product you can buy on a strip for these kind of prices. I think somebody commented on that before. So, the market thinks that ethane stays a bit long through the year. A lot depends on how people operate; whether everybody comes out of the turnarounds on time. Those kinds of things, but there is an abnormal amount of turnaround activity in the United States at this point in time.","Now, coming out, a lot of people are lightening up under feed, and some of the work that's going on in the turnarounds is to accomplish that objective. So, we'll see how the market settles out. But I still think, we're in a very advantage market condition. And we can't forget that natural gas prices in February are in $2.50 range, and oil price; Brent $1.18, $1.19 and we are sitting there just around $100 on WTI. So, we can't forget that big spread, which is something that affects the minds of people trading ethane.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Can you remind us of your ability to take advantage of that ethane strip?","Jim Gallogly","We haven't gone out and tried to buy any that we could. We can go out there like anybody else and by end of that for certain volumes, but at this point in time our philosophy is not to do that. We're going to watch and see how the market goes and we feel fairly good about ethane pricing into the rest of the year.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","Good morning.","Jim Gallogly","Good morning","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","I guess the first question is a two-part question on contracts. Are you seeing a shift in ethane pricing to percentage of proceeds rather than just a fixed fee by the midstream companies, and how long do you think your WTI indexing contracts will be sustainable or do you think there is going to be a movement to shift those to Brent Indexes?","Jim Gallogly","On the first part, on the midstream business, I can't really tell you if there is that big of a shift. I used to participate pretty heavily in that, in my old job. But the one thing that happens is those contracts don't change overnight. So, you're looking at new plants and what producers are doing, and typically it's a basin-by-basin thing, and how much competition is there. So, I hesitate to give you a general trend. You usually have to look basin-to-basin.","On the second, on WTI pricing, some is priced off of Brent, some is priced off at WTI, it just depends on how relevant one is compared to the other. Toward the second half of the year, people are generally trying to price off of Brent, I'll still say that there are fair amount of transactions done off of WTI. Ultimately, remember that that crude is available, WTI isn't that far away from us and there is a pipeline connection that is going to happen mid-year that will bring some of that pricing down into the Gulf Coast. So, it's still a relevant index.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","And then secondly on the outages, if OP-1 and OP-2 will both be down at the same time, is it good to believe that it's about a $70 million to $80 million headwind for the quarter in terms of a sequential bridge?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, we really don't give that number out and remember, we've taken some commercial average to build some inventories. So, we'd rather not publish a number on that. We gave you the basic timelines of how long we'll be down that's about as much as we'd like to say.","Doug Pike","Okay. I think Laurence you know the capacity of those plants. So, I think we had a pretty reasonable picture of volumetric impacts on things.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","And what's your \u2013 you mentioned that the cash tax rate would be significantly lower than the reported taxes. Do you have a rough sense for where the cash tax rate should come out?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yeah, the expectation for 2012, about 30% to 32% on the book tax but similar around the range of 15% or lower for cash taxes going forward. Again, you have to take into consideration the receipt of the $200 million in the cash tax refunds for 2012.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is open.","Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global","Good morning, Jim.","Jim Gallogly","Good morning, Hassan.","Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global","I was taking a look at page 6 of your slide presentation and you've listed a number of accomplishments in 2011, be they increasing your ethane feedstock capabilities or wrapping up three maintenance turnarounds in the lake. So now, with those behind us, just trying to get a sense of how we should think about 2012 EBITDA improvements because of having these accomplishments behind you in '11?","Jim Gallogly"," Yeah. We spent a fair amount of time talking about 2012 forward in our Investor Day. For instance, one of the things that we specifically mentioned about European restructuring is we are looking to take a couple of hundred million dollars a year out of our cost structure there. We talked about the Berre refinery being shut down, and in second half of the year, we won't have that earnings drag. We've talked about the ethane advantage that we've incorporated in the United States, increase it by another 5%. Things like that help us on an ongoing basis.","Further down the road after this year, and then to the next few years, we've got expansion plans at La Porte, maybe a bit of Channelview, methanol plant restart. We've got a butadiene unit that we are working on as we speak, that's a lump sum turnkey contract in Germany that's got beautiful economics. So, this is a growing company. The capital budget is up to $1.4 billion this year, and so we feel very good about our future.","Now, I will say that we are heavily dependent at this moment in time on U.S. Olefins & Polyolefins. I mean, that's where the key driver is and last year, we saw really nice bump from Refining. Refining didn't come to us in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was a very, very tough fourth order in refining, but the fundamentals of our business are still intact, and we are going to continue to drive very hard to improve our performance.","Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global","Very helpful. And a follow-up if I may. We've spent a fair bit of time on this call talking about the ethane side of things and ethylene, polyethylene and the likes, but where do you see \u2013 propylene prices obviously came down tremendously through the second half of last year. Where do you see propylene prices directionally going through 2012?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, propylene is a very short molecule at this point in time, and I can't explain why it fell as fast as it did in the fourth quarter, but we have had some pretty significant price increases early in the year. People are cracking lighter in the United States, which should make that more a valuable molecule going forward into the chain. I did mention in the call today that polypropylene demand had been diminished as a result of high prices; propylene and the polypropylene, so we have seen that market deterioration. On the other hand, there are other uses like our propylene oxide business. We feel pretty good about propylene prices going forward and we didn't have that benefit in the fourth quarter, we hope to see it the rest of the year.","Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global","Very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes good morning Jim. I was wondering if you could comment on prospective demand in the propylene chain. If I look at slide number seven, it looks like polypropylene resin volumes were down 0.5 billion pounds, POPG down as well. How much of that would you attribute to price elasticity and to the extent that that was a factor? Do you think it's mostly played out now so that we can resume growth in 2012?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, my hope, Kevin, is that that didn't play out. Polypropylene prices were materially higher than polyethylene prices. Those who could switch fairly quickly did. And so, I think there are certain uses where polypropylene just makes a lot more sense; car parts and all of that. I mentioned that our polypropylene compound business was really good in '10 and stayed really good in '11. We still see that continuing. So, a lot of the applications are still there, still solid, and I think we've seen the adjustment in those volumes. Now, it also goes into things like our propylene oxide business. You always have a little bit of reduction on the fourth quarter; some of that unseasonal, but pretty steady, we'll see where that goes, but if we have a bit of improvement in the world economy, I expect it all just gets better.","Doug Pike","Kevin, this is Doug. I mean I would \u2013 I would, as Jim just said, sort of separate the propylene oxide considerations from the polypropylene. I think some of that was our turnarounds, year-end with deicing and things, not anything from really propylene pricing.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then, Jim, at Investor Day, you talked a fair amount about earning the right to grow. I think the emphasis at the time was organic growth to the various projects that you've outlined. But we continue to see quite a bit of M&A activity across the chemicals sector. Even with a special dividend, you're levered about half a turn right now, what is your current view on the outlook for M&A for Lyondell?","JIm Gallogly","Well, as you've mentioned, the program that we put forward in Investor Day was organic-oriented. We, like other companies, look for opportunities. We just haven't seen something that we're interested in yet. A lot depends on pricing; those kinds of things. We'll pay a lot of attention; we do. Sergey is sitting next to me on the left and he is nodding his head. He's always keeping track of everything out there. But we also would tell you that, if you pay too much at the wrong time, you hurt the company a great deal, and we're interested in earnings, not being big.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay thank very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gregg Goodnight of UBS. Your line is open.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Good morning all. Jim, you mentioned the weak pricing in natural gas, and there is some forecast out there that you have gas even under more pressure. A couple of questions in that area. Number one, is your acetyls business directly exposed to spot gas? Question number two is, could you sort of size the Company's leverage to say $1 reduction in natural gas either through BTUs per month type numbers or $1 million per $1 of gas?","Jim Gallogly","The acetyls business does buy its gas on a spot basis. It's been very good for the business recently with it's very, very cheap $2.50 in the heart of winter type price. On the kind of indexes, you might think of $1 an MMBTU lowering our utility costs about $275 million a year. That includes co-gen steam purchase impacts. Then, if you think about into the ethane chain, $1 an MMBTU equals to about $0.07 a gallon ethane send upon COE, something like that. Those are pretty good ratios I think.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","","Okay. Second question, you mentioned a little turnaround you had in the fourth quarter in propylene oxide and acetyls. Could you size those up in terms of what the direct costs and maintenance costs were for those turnarounds?","Jim Gallogly","We don't usually talk to those direct costs. And of course, they get amortized over time on those large turnarounds.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Okay. So, we are going to have to break out then the impact of lower volumes versus the turnarounds.","Sergey Vasnetsov","","What you see in the third to fourth quarter results, as Jim said in the prepared comments was largely the turnaround impact was one of the most significant effects between third and fourth quarter profitability. Acetyls, of course, we only have one acetyls unit in the system, so when it's down, you have a pretty big impact. And then on the propylene oxide side, the site that was down is propylene oxide solvents, C4 chemicals and BDO site. So, there is a combination of impacts on that side.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Okay, great. How long was the Acetyls area down in fourth quarter?","Karyn Ovelmen","I don't remember the length of the turnaround, and I'll have to get back to you, because I just don't recall.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Doug Pike","Yeah. We are going to I think take one more question, because I think we are running out of time here","Operator","Our next question will come from Ed Mally of Imperial Capital. Your line is open.","Ed Mally \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the question about the debt in the capital structure, with respect to the high cost that, generally, would your priority be to refinance that into lower cost debt when the opportunity arises or would you look to place a priority on using excess cash flow to pay down debt outright? And then, also within that complex, you addressed the 27 -- 2028 a target any thoughts on the 2027 bonds?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yeah, in terms of reducing those 2017 and '18 bonds, yeah, we are looking a market here and see if there's opportunities to reduce the overall costs from a coupon perspective, then we will look to tender those bonds and going to the bond market and potentially extended maturities on those bonds as well as the an overall reduction in the cost.","In terms of our overall leverage that we have, expectation is where we are at is appropriate for us. We are a commodity chemical. It's critical to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity, as previously discussed at our Investor Day, maintaining that $3 billion range is appropriate from a liquidity perspective. We are looking to reduce our weighted average cost of capital, and I believe in this market, it is an achievable goal.","When you look at where our current market and 6%, 1 billion bonds are trading today, that would indicate the availability out there in the market and indicate a longer-tendered, maturity-staggered capital structure with the current leverage profile that we have. Now, of course, the capital considerations would be different if there wasn't sufficient liquidity in the market. But given our current credit rating, the nature of our business, the global outlook for our business, our capital needs, and our access to sufficient liquidity, then the current leverage profile that we have today is appropriate.","Ed Mally \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay Thank you. And with respect to 2027 bonds at 8.1%, similar to the other higher cost paper, would you look to address those as well as the 2017, 2018?","Doug Pike","","Well, this is Doug. I mean I think back at the history of those bonds, and it's a pretty small issue for us at $300 million they have been out there and survived through quite a bit. It is something that is a pretty nice piece of that for us. Yes, the interest rate is higher than we can achieve right now, but all the other considerations have gone through this. So, I think as Karyn said, the focus is on those larger issues and what we could do with those, particularly with the 2013 cost coming up and the opportunities that the market presents and we hope it will present across this year.","Ed Mally \u2013 Imperial Capital","Okay, good. Thanks very much.","Jim Gallogly \u2013 Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you everyone for your continued interest in our company. We did have a disappointing quarter. We have recognized that. It was seasonally slower as we often see in the fourth quarter. But in addition to that, we took a significant charge related to the Berre refinery; $400 million plus related to our refinancing efforts into fourth quarter, but I think those unlock significant value.","We had a very weak Maya 2-1-1 crack spread in our refining business, the collapse of WTI at a certain point in time. Europe is obviously been quite weak in the fourth quarter; seen a little signs of life, but fundamentally, we have a very, very strong business. Ethane is very cheap right now. There are lots of turnarounds on horizon. We're going to continue to press on reducing our cost structure. We have a good business, and we came off of record earnings in the second quarter, record earnings into third quarter; we're going to continue to press. Again, thank you for your interest. I look forward to talking to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you for your participation on the conference call today.

Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation of the company's today\u2019s call is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.

We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2019. Let's begin with slide 3 and review some highlights. In 2019, LyondellBasell\u2019s businesses extended our outstanding track record of cash generation by delivering $5 billion of cash from operating activities. Over the past six years, our resilient business portfolio has steadily produced $5 billion to $6 billion of cash each year under a variety of oil prices and macroeconomic conditions.","Our company's focus on operational excellence cost management and technology-driven growth has proven that we have an advantage across a range of business climates. 2019 earnings were $9.58 per share with $5.7 billion of EBITDA. This represents a decline of approximately 20% and 17%, respectively, relative to the prior year.","Despite healthy consumer-driven demand, our profitability was impacted by soft industrial demand has trade uncertainty, regulatory changes and a weak environment for capital investment challenge the automotive industry and other durable goods markets for our products.","Our global asset footprint and operational flexibility enabled us to adapt to changes in trade lines by continuing to leverage the advantage of abundant, low-cost natural gas liquids has be stopped for production from both our American operations and our Middle East joint ventures.","Our technology business achieved record revenues from licensing plan designs to support growth in China resulting in the most profitable year in company history for this segment. Before we get further into the results, I would like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Michael McMurray. Michael brings extensive knowledge and perspective to the company after working in finance, Investor Relations, treasury and as a CFO over the course of more than 30 years. I'm looking forward to Michael providing our finance and strategy groups with the leadership and will drive our continued success. Michael, welcome to LyondellBasell.","Mike McMurray","Thank you for the kind words, Bob. I'm excited to be part of LyondellBasell and your partner in driving our future. In my first several weeks in the company, I'm very impressed with the people and results oriented culture within the company. I look forward to meeting all our stakeholders and the investment community in describing how we will continue our disciplined approach to value driven growth while driving shareholder returns.","Bob Patel","Thanks, Michael. Let's turn to slide 4 and review our approach to maximizing the returns from our cash generation. Over the past year, we continue to actively manage our business portfolio with values driven growth investments to develop opportunities around the world.","On the US Gulf Coast, we completed construction of our new hyperzone polyethylene plant and increased activity to build our PO\/TBA. As hyperzone production ramps up this year and the PO\/TBA plant reaches completion next year. Both projects will provide growth in volumes and profitability that will further increase our capacity for cash generation.","The box on the right summarizes work to expand our footprint in the rapidly growing Asian market during 2019. We announced that our joint venture in Thailand will begin construction of their fourth polypropylene plant that will re-establish their position as the largest polypropylene producer in Southeast Asia.","In September, we signed an MoU with Bora to build an integrated cracker in Northeast China. And in December, announced our intention to expand our existing partnership with Sinopec to build a second propylene oxide and styrene monomer plant also in China. All of these projects leverage LyondellBasell technologies in our core businesses to extend our positions and expand in the world's fastest growing markets. With the disciplined investments, we are achieving growth, while providing substantial returns for shareholders.","On Slide 5, you can see that our company has maintained our focus on delivering top quartile safety performance. As we integrated the employees, contractors and assets from the A. Schulman acquisition in 2019, we were able to reduce the injury rate at these facilities by more than 50% relative to the prior year. Our goal remains zero injuries. We're diligently working to ensure all our employees, contractors, assets and the communities in which we operate, finish the day in the same or better condition than when they started.","In October 2019, we announced the latest step in our progress to utilize plastic waste in the circular economy. We're building a power plant facility at our research center in Ferrara, Italy to develop our proprietary MoReTec technology to convert mixed plastic waste continue into polymers.","As shown on slide 6, MoReTec will use catalyzed hydrolysis to convert plastic wastes into hydrocarbons that can be used as feedstocks to produce new plastics from existing olefins crackers and polymerization plants. We will develop more technology in our pilot facility and optimize a tour to commercial scale. More tech is complimentary to lined up Lyondell the existing mechanically recycled product business that relied upon clean and sorted waste streams. Together with our bio based succulent polymers, our company now has three technologies that are advancing the business of succulent plastics.","With that I'll turn the call over to Michael who will lead us through several topics relating to our financial performance.","Mike McMurray","Thank you, Bob. Let's get on Slide 7 where you can see the trends, our companies EBITDA and EPS over the past three years. 2019 results include a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $85 billion that increased earnings by $0.24 per share. Integration cost related to A. Schulman acquisition impacted full year net income results by $89 million or $0.26 per share and fourth quarter results by $0.29 million or $0.08 per share.","As Bob mentioned, our profitability was impacted by challenging market conditions during 2019. Using third quarter 2019 results as a benchmark, our resilience relative to our industry peers during these challenging times is noteworthy. While it appears profitability fell as much as two thirds LyondellBasell\u2019s global business portfolio formed relatively well with approximately two-thirds for asset volume serving non-durable demand from consumer markets. Our businesses are generally well-positioned during industrial downturns.","Slide 8 illustrates the consistent and efficient cash flow performance that Bob mentioned earlier. Our businesses have generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities over the past six years. In 2019 87% of our EBITDA translated into cash With approximately $1 billion dedicated to sustaining capital, our free operating cash flow yield remained healthy at 12.5% in 2019.","Please turn to Slide 9 and allow me to review our capital allocation strategy. Our approach remains consistent with the policies we have articulated last September at our Investor Day and, frankly, for the past several years.","We seek to provide balance between value-driven growth and shareholder returns. We remain committed to a strong and aggressively growing dividend. Our capital expenditures are focused on ensuring our assets maintain their high levels of reliability, as well as sending [ph] profitable growth.","With the completion of the Hyperzone in PO\/TBA projects, our go-CapEx will taper down. Our cash generation provides flexibility for highly selective value-driven M&A, growth through JVs and opportunistic share repurchases. At the same time, we are mindful about maintaining the appropriate leverage ratios and our commitment to a strong investment-grade balance sheet underlies all of our decisions.","Now please turn to Slide 10, where you can see that our businesses generated $1.2 billion of cash with moderate activities during the fourth quarter which contributed to $5 billion of cash generation for the year.","Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $730 million with roughly 60% invested in profit-generating growth projects and 40% dedicated to sustaining capital. Our investment in growth has increased since the second quarter of 2019, as we completed our Hyperzone polyethylene plant and continued to move our PO\/TBA plant construction forward.","In the fourth quarter, we paid $351 million in dividends. In 2019, our opportunistic buyback strategy allows us to repurchase 43 million shares for a total of $3.8 billion, together with dividends, returned a total of $5.2 billion to shareholders in 2019.","Along with that thought, I would like to compare our capital returns to some of our peers over the prior four quarters. Please turn to Slide 11. The dark blue bars depict dividend yield which was nearly 5% over the trailing 12 months prior to the fourth quarter. Together with share repurchases, our company tops the chart with 20% of total cap returns to shareholders.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2020 on slide 12. Regarding capital expenditures, we are planning to invest approximately $2.4 billion during 2020 to support both our sustaining capital and profit-generating projects. Approximately $1.3 billion is targeted towards profit-generating growth. The majority of this growth investment in 2020 will be dedicated to the construction of the PO\/TBA plant in Houston. We continue to expect a meaningful reduction in capital spending in 2022 after the completion of this facility.","For 2020, with a fairly typical planned maintenance schedule, activities during the year are expected to impact annual EBITDA by approximately $155 million. Our O&P Americas segment will have a cracker turnaround overlapping the first and second quarters of this year that is expected to impact EBITDA by $25 million and $30 million, respectively. Our O&P EAI segment will have a cracker turnaround in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 that is expected to impact EBITDA by $15 million in each quarter.","In our Intermediates & Derivatives segment, we have planned maintenance events that will impact EBITDA by approximately $10 million in each of the first and second quarters and $25 million in each of the third or fourth quarters this year. Our cash interest expense for 2020 is expected to be $420 million which includes capitalized interest of about $120 million. 2020 annual book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be $1.5 billion.","We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2020 that total approximately $120 million and we estimate a pension expense of $100 million. We currently expect a 2020 effective tax rate of approximately 20% for the cash tax rate in the. mid-teens.","I will now turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob?","Bob Patel","Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to slide 13 which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the last five quarters. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion. As you have seen, LyondellBasell\u2019s business portfolio typically follows a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring mid-year. In the absence of external catalysts, that improve order [indiscernible] from our underlying businesses, the pattern seen in 2019 are fairly typical. We have a focused and well balanced portfolio supported by our global footprint, flexibility and reliable operations. These are recurring themes for our company and attributes that we seek to improve upon as we manage the portfolio.","Even in the uncertain market conditions, our company continues to demonstrate resilience. We talked last quarter about polyethylene spreads being near 10-year lows. And on slide 14, we've expanded that idea to illustrate the market margins associated with some of our major products. Each market has experienced several cycles over the past 20 years. Most recently, we are faced with slow industrial demand and uncertainty in trade policies. Margins are currently relatively strong for North American polypropylene and for MTBE","On the flipside, we're seeing historically weak margins for styrene and Northeast Asia polyethylene. Some of you may be surprised to learn that globally we sell higher volumes of polypropylene and oxyfuels than polyethylene and styrene. These charts illustrate how our portfolio provides balance where our product and trough margins is often offset by another which from margins within the portfolio.","With these natural hedges across our global footprint and an innovative technology, cost advantage, operational flexibility and consistent underlying consumer-driven demand, LyondellBasell is well positioned to provide resilient profitability.","With the market conditions in line, let's review our fourth quarter segment results starting with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on slide 15. Fourth quarter 2019 EBITDA was $498 million, $155 million lower than third quarter. Profitability was impacted by reduced polyethylene margin from typical winter seasonality and an increased cost of ethylene production as feedstock costs were higher and propylene price was lower compared to the previous quarter. Olefins results decreased approximately $20 million compared to the third quarter of 2019.","Margin contracted on relatively higher natural gas liquid feedstock costs and lower propylene price. Volume increased after the completion of our planned maintenance at our Clinton, Iowa facility during the third quarter. Combined, polyolefin results were approximately $135 million lower than the third, quarter primarily due to a decline in polyethylene spreads over of more than $130 per ton.","For the full year, results decreased by $460 million. Olefins results increased as we utilize the high feedstock flexibility across our fleet of six US ethylene crackers to take advantage of low, low cost feedstocks. Combined polyolefins results declined primarily due to the spread decline in polyethylene of approximately $260 per ton. We expect the remainder of the first quarter will follow typical seasonal trends with increasing demand continuing into the second quarter.","Now we turn to slide 16 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins; Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $144 million, a decrease of $147 million, compared to the third quarter. Ethylene margin declined as a result of higher feedstock costs and lower propylene price. With typical fourth quarter seasonality pressuring volumes, there was little support to increase polyethylene price.","Olefins results decreased approximately $140 million, primarily driven by higher feedstock costs and lower propylene price. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $45 million driven by decreased spread in both polyethylene and polypropylene.","Full-year EBITDA was $101 million lower than 2018. Results including impact of approximately $55 million due to a decrease in the euro versus the US dollar exchange rate relative to 2018. Olefins results for the full year increased due to lower feedstock costs and improved reliability with planned and unplanned maintenance impacting the fourth quarter of 2018.","Combined polyolefin results and joint venture equity income decreased due to lower polyolefin spreads. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progressed through the first and second quarters similar to the amendments.","Please turn to Slide 17 and let\u2019s take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $329 million, a decline of $61 million from the third quarter of 2019. Well-supplied markets drove margin decline in most businesses for both propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals.","Fourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased approximately $10 million due to lower margins from our product sales mix. Intermediate chemicals decreased $50 million primarily due to reduced margin oxyfuels and related products results for relatively unchanged with the strongest fourth quarter for the company over the past five years.","During 2019 EBITDA declined $454 million compared to the record performance we achieved in 2018. Margin declined in most businesses primarily styrene partially offset by strong improvement in margins for our oxyfuels and related products businesses. Volumes for most businesses also declined due to planned and unplanned maintenance as well as softer market.","In January MTBE raw material margins have trended downward but are still relatively strong for this month compared to recent years. As the first quarter progresses we expect well-supplied markets to continue to pressure most of our IND businesses. Recently, we announced our intention to expand our existing partnership with Sinopec to build a second PO SM plant in China.","Joint ventures enable us to expand our reach with relatively low capital commitments in attractive markets. The proposed new JV will serve growing demand for both propylene oxide and styrene in China where styrene soaring demand is growing at a reasonable rate. As demand for fuel-based construction materials packaging and furnishings continues to grow we see an opportunity to bring together our leading technology with Sinopec\u2019s and operational capabilities to further serve the Chinese market.","The chart on Slide 18 depicts the company's cost leadership in producing propylene oxide from our two co-product technologies. We're building using our cost leading PO\/TBA technology on the US Gulf Coast where butane feedstocks are abundant and low price. In China we have selected our PO\/SM technology to serve growing propylene oxide and styrene demand. Both of our co-product technologies offer a significant cost advantage over new plants based on alternative technology or aging or chlorohydrin capacity.","On slide 19 let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $54 million, a $48 million decline over the third quarter of 2019. Volumes and margins declined as we are seeing continued headwinds from the automotive sector and a seasonal decline in the construction market.","Fourth quarter pretax innovation cost were $38 million. Compared with the prior period Compounding & Solutions results declined approximately $35 million due to continued headwinds in the automotive market. Advanced Polymer\u2019s results decreased about $20 million due to lower margin and volume due to a seasonal decline in construction demand.","Full-year EBITDA results for the segment were $424 million, a $24-million improvement over 2018. 2019 was the first full year of results with the addition of new product lines from the acquisition of A. Schulman. Pretax integration costs were $116 million in 2019. Volumes declined in legacy LyondellBasell businesses due to decreased automotive and construction demand.","Integration activities are on track, and we have captured $130 million in forward annualized run rate synergies as of December 31. We expect higher industrial construction demand, particularly for products from our Advanced Polymers business, as we move through the first quarter toward the arrival of spring. Any improvements in automotive and other industrial markets should benefit our Compounding & Solutions business.","Now let's turn to Slide 20 and discuss the performance of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $22 million, a $28 million improvement versus the third quarter of 2019. Results were driven by an improvement in margin. In the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread improved to an average of $19.44 per barrel for the fourth quarter.","Additionally, we benefited from relatively strong [indiscernible] prices. Operations were strong for the quarter with an average crude throughput near nameplate production rate at 267,000 barrels per day. Full-year EBITDA was $232 million, lower than 2018. The refinery ran well at an average crude throughput The refinery run well at an average crude throughput of 263,000 barrels per day. This was 32,000 barrels per day higher than prior years due to the completion of planned maintenance in 2018.","For the full-year refining margins were impacted by the limited availability of our heavy sour crude oil in the US Gulf Coast as well as lower Maya 2-1-1 spread which declined to $17.58 per barrel. In January, weak command for diesel has driven Gulf Coast ULSD to Brent crack spreads to five-year lows.","While we are disappointed by the current market environment, we continue to expect improvement, as the carriage ban on high-sulfur and marine fuels takes effect in March. We are well-positioned to benefit from the new regulation by serving demand for more environmentally friendly Marine fuels from our refinery.","Please turn to slide 21 as we review the results of our technology segment. In 2019, our technology segment delivered a record quarter and record annual profitability with our industry-leading polymer production technologies and catalysts. EBITDA was $138 million during the fourth quarter and was $411 million for the full year with a number of significant revenue milestone was reached for our licensing business. We expect lower license income recognition, and therefore, lower profitability in the first quarter following the strong fourth quarter in 2019.","Now, on slide 22, I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate our company's disciplined investment growth strategy that we shared with you during our 2019 Investor Day. We expect the contributions from our growth investments to deliver a $1.3 billion incremental annual EBITDA by 2022. Applying cash yield from EBITDA of about 80% combined with our moderating CapEx requirement of approximately $1.1 billion, we expect an increase in cash flow about $2.1 billion that would double our free cash flow by 2022.","Let me summarize the year highlights and outlook with slide 23. In 2019, our resilient portfolio was supported by our abundant low-cost natural gas liquid feedstocks in North America, natural hedges across our global business portfolio and licensing growth in our technology segment.","We have generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities for six consecutive years. This consistent and strong cash generation contributed to growth through disciplined profit generating capital investments and provided significant shareholder returns through a growing top quartile dividend and share repurchases.","In 2020, we look forward to the additional capacity from our Hyperzone polyethylene plant for O&P Americas segment. We are moving towards the completion of our PO\/TBA plant in 2021 to provide further growth for our I&D segment. We're seeing opportunities to drive value by expanding our diverse global business portfolio. We expect to see that these joint venture investments today to reap tangible earnings growth over the years to come.","With that said, we're now please take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Matthew Blair","Hey, good morning, Bob. Maybe you want to start off on refining one of the bright spots in the quarter. Could you talk about whether you were able to run high sulfur for fuel oil as a feed at your Houston refinery? And if so, what kind of volumes and what kind of EBITDA uplift? And if you were not, was the constraint economic or was it equipment-related? Any details on that would be great.","Bob Patel","Yeah. Good morning, Matthew. Thanks for your question. On refining, the HSFO, we are able to run supplemental feed typically when we've cut back on crude run rates for a variety of reasons. So we can run between 20,000 and 40000 barrels a day of additional HSFO and I would say in a typical month, maybe that contributes $5 million to $9 million of additional EBITDA.","So that gives you a sense for contribution and we did do some of that fact in January because we had some external events that caused some downtime on one of our crude units and some internal issues so we were able to buy some HSFO. The margins were pretty good. So, we do use that as an optimization tool.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Byrne. Your line is now open.","Steve Byrne","Yes, thank you. What fraction of your polyethylene production is currently exported to China and what other markets will this likely shift to as China becomes more self-sufficient? Are you able to move more of it into Europe and or do you have a concern that others might do this and erode the margins in that region?","Bob Patel","Yes, Steve. Good morning. Well first of all, we\u2019ve not exported as much generally as the industry has in years past and 2019 is no different. We did increase exports in 2019 as the year progressed, but we're still well below the industry average. And we're probably at a run rate of around 30% of our polyethylene that's exported. And of that, maybe 5% of it goes to China. And that could move up some next year \u2013 this year in 2020, as we start up our Hyperzone plant and balance our system.","Your question about self-sufficiency, based on IHS data and our analysis of that data, it seems that China will continue to need large amounts of imports of polyethylene and that short still is incrementally growing over the next decade. Now it's not growing as much as we thought maybe two, three years ago, but there's still a significant short in China on polyethylene.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good morning. Bob, I wondering if you could address the impact of the phase out of single use plastics in China? And also comment on your -- Table 2 of your supplemental information, suggests that high-density polyethylene prices declined, about $110 a ton sequentially in 4Q versus 3Q. It seems to be a little bit more than maybe some of the consultants are indicating and so I was wondering if you could comment on that and whether or not you're seeing discounting? And if so, might that reverse as 2020 progresses. Thank you.","Bob Patel","Okay. So, good morning, Kevin. On your question about single-use plastics, I think we\u2019ll have to see how that announcement plays out. Whether it\u2019s in China or Europe or the US, one of the challenges is there aren\u2019t really readily available substitutes for many of the applications for single-use plastics.","So, in the near term, Kevin, I don\u2019t expect significant impact on demand over, let\u2019s say, the next three to five years. I think, post five years, I think we'll have to kind of watch and see how recycling shapes up and how chemical recycling develops and the technology develops. But in the near to medium term, I don't expect a lot of impact especially because there aren't really obvious substitutes for those applications.","Your question on price from Q4 to Q3, several factors, I think first of all, as I said earlier, as the year progressed, we export more as an industry, and frankly, as a company. And so that mix of domestic versus export probably had some impact. And also, new supply came on.","We saw demand actually come off because of destocking and seasonality. So tons of pressure in Q4. We've already seen some of that reverse. For example, posted spot polyethylene prices have already come up $0.03 to $0.04 since early December based on different publications that we follow. So we're already seeing some of that reverse.","David Kinney","Kevin, this is Dave. That table that you're referring to is actually the net transaction price from IHS. It\u2019s not the contract price per se for polyethylene discount.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Can you talk about polypropylene demand trends both in the United States and in Europe either sequentially or year over year in the light of the slowing of the economy and difficulties in the auto sector.","Bob Patel","Polypropylene demand growth, Jeff, has been similar to polyethylene demand growth. It's been impacted a little bit because of the slowdown in automotive and generally in the industrial sector. Polypropylene as more end uses in those sectors. Would we still see a reasonable \u2013 a reasonably good market environment in polypropylene, something that we'll certainly watch as new capacity comes in 2020. But overall, we see polypropylene growth developing reasonably well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Arun Viswanathan","I just wanted to ask your question on the monomer side. You've often had some profitability from the metastasis unit. Could you size what that's been over the last several years and what your outlook is for both ethylene and propylene monomer profitability over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Bob Patel","Yeah. Thanks, Arun. It does move around quite a lot. As you can imagine, depending on poly \u2013 sorry, propylene price and the spread between propylene and ethylene. Generally speaking, if in Q4 and you look at all of our major product areas they really declined through the quarter and have reached kind of these tough conditions and propylene is an example of that.","So, in Q4 when we had really minimal contribution from our flex unit mainly as a result of lower propylene price. So as that reverses we should see better contribution from ethylene and into propylene. It does this \u2013 it moves around quite a lot and it's something that we factor into our optimization because we think about how we deploy the ethylene we produce.","David Kinney","Yeah, Arun, just to give you a sense of scale in 2019 our flex profitability was about half of what it might have been in 2018 and as Bob said in the fourth quarter it was very, very small.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Duffy Fischer","Just a question sort of around the refinery sort of round IMO 2020. I'm getting a lot of feedback that people are kind of equating that with Y2K. We got all bent out of shape and there's not been much change because of it.","Seems like you guys have a little bit different view and maybe it's just delayed so can you kind of walk through how you think IMO 2020 still plays out and then within that context what does that mean structurally for the refinery within Lyondell\u2019s portfolio?","Bob Patel","Okay. Yeah. Good morning, Duffy. Thanks for that question. So you will recall in our prior discussions about IMO what we've said is there are two primary benefits from IMO for us. One is that the light heavy differential would get wider which favors our refinery and the distillate spreads would increase because of the value of this sulfur, a bunker fuel. So one of the two have shown some signs of improvement.","The light heavy differential is improved by about $3 a barrel over the past 90, 60-90 days or so compared to what we saw most of last year. So we're starting to see a bit of response on that. And you can see it in the numbers, they\u2019re not terrific but they're getting better.","On the distillate side, there\u2019s been a couple of factors that have actually kept distillate crack spreads down or they\u2019ve\u2019 actually \u2013 they\u2019ve reduced in the last 60 days. One is I think, we probably \u2013 we all underestimated the amount of inventory of compliant fuel that was built before year-end.","To your point, there was a concern about would there be enough and I think perhaps, there was more than enough. And so there's a bit of overhang, which will be worked through. So I think, I see that as a temporary situation. Secondly, we've had a really mild winter, so distillate values have come down because there hasn't been as much demand for heating.","Again, I think a seasonal effect. So to summarize in terms of IMO, I think that the effect will be \u2013 it\u2019s somewhat delayed, but we are expecting some improvement in the refinery profitability as a result IMO.","Your question about portfolio, again, our focus has been very consistent; run the refinery as well as possible, try to optimize on the product side so that we can maximize value and we're continually focused on that. And we'll see how things play out longer term. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open","Vincent Andrews","Thank you, and good morning. Bob, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Asian PE markets. And maybe two things to touch on, one, the margins have been negative there for a while now longer than \u2013 if I look back over the last 10 years, usually they don't stay that negative for too long before capacity comes off and they at least go back to zero, and that hasn't happened.","And the big thing that looks like it\u2019s happened is that naphtha prices have been very strong certainly in the fourth quarter. Maybe they come off a little bit year-to-date due to the coronavirus, but what is driving the naphtha price versus a relatively flat crude oil price, and why aren't we seeing Asian capacity come off line given the losses?","Bob Patel","Yeah. Good morning, Vincent. Really good question, I think, and this is really at the crux of sort of why we think we're reaching trough conditions in polyethylene globally. As you rightly mentioned, margins today appear to be below cash costs. So you would think there would be negative earnings on many of these units, not just the highest cost, but probably deep into the cost curve.","I've been following this business for many years, including when I lived in Asia more than 10 years ago. And typically when you fall below 300, it's not just a few marginal crackers but many are underwater. My sense is that typically it takes perhaps a quarter or two of these sorts of conditions for there to be meaningful reduction in output or idling of capacity.","We're nearing that stage, in my opinion, and it seems to me that we should see some bounce. And as I said earlier, if you look at -- posted export prices of polyethylene from mid-December to mid-January, they have moved somewhat. So again, I think, these are all signs of trough conditions and there should be some bounce off of these really, really unusual loans.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts","Thank you. Could you give us an update on the closing of the Bora deal and if this start-up still on schedule?","Bob Patel","Yeah, good morning. We're working diligently to move towards definitive agreements. We expect to have those completed within the first half of this year. In terms of the project\u2019s start-up, they're making really great progress. And I would expect that we'll be in the commissioning stage towards the end of this year for that project.","I think that's one of the one of the attractiveness to us of this project is that by the time we're in a position to infuse equity into the venture, we'll be within months of start-up. So the timing between our investment and timing of start-up is very short. We derisked quite a lot of that project in our view as a partner.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes, hi. Good morning, Bob. One more question on your Bora project. At your Analyst Day, you mentioned that the cost of building in China is about half of that in the US. Can you comment about time it takes to build in China? I know crews their work 24\/7 to build and so, what's your expectation of timing and does that JV give you any special insight into the timing of some of these new crackers that are starting up in China? Thank you.","Bob Patel","Good morning, P.J. Indeed, it's one of the sort of attractions to us is that, first of all, that that project is going to produce product for the local market. So, we don't intend to export. I think it\u2019ll give us a really good window into how the market works there as well.","And as you said timing and cost of construction. In terms of the cost, they are between half and two thirds that of Gulf Coast builds and also timing very similar somewhere between half and two-thirds of the time that's required to build on the Gulf Coast. And the Bora project is certainly in that range relative to the US cost and timing.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Bob Koort","Slide 14 talks about those integrated spreads by competitors because good thing you don't have a lot of crackers but coincides with your promise that they were refining a trough. Just a bit curious how that informs or just no use of capital plans. I mean, clearly your stock is getting punished pretty substantially here.","You've got a big dividend that you could reduce those payouts by -- maybe buying some stock back. On the other hand, I would imagine targets are looking quite a bit cheaper. So, could you just maybe refresh us maybe early on in the capital deployment at this stage of the market?","Bob Patel","Sure. Thanks, Bob. First of all, on CapEx, you'll recall at that Investor Day, we had a few things we highlighted. First of all, sustaining capital of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion, frankly, we don't plan to change that. We want to make sure that our units are well-maintained and are able to operate when we need them at full rates. And because of our dividend coverage, we don't have to do that. We're in a position where we're able \u2013 we have a well-covered dividend without having to take those sorts of steps.","Secondly, our CapEx is declining because the Hyperzone project is essentially complete. And so that that capital comes off. So we have somewhere around $300 million to $400 million reduction in CapEx from 2019 to 2020. And then, if you look further out, we'll see another reduction after the PO\/TBA project starts up. I think the key for us is to really be thoughtful about how we think through future projects, be very disciplined as we've shown, and I see great opportunity on both sides of the equation to increase cash flow. We see sources of new earnings and we see CapEx declining. That story remains intact as we discussed in Investor Day.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Olympic Global. Your line is now open.","Hassan Ahmed","Bob, just wanted to follow up on you made some comments about what you think the trajectory of polyethylene pricing may be, obviously, keeping in mind some of the negative margin trends in Asia. My question is a bit more specific about the grades.","As we see the influx of all of this polyethylene capacity in 2020, 2021, it seems there have been a fairly large divergences between the amount of capacity that's coming on line call it in HDPE and linear low versus not that much capacity coming online in LDPE. So, I mean, you know how are you thinking about that? Should we expect to see sort of divergent pricing patterns between the different grades?","Bob Patel","Yes. Good question. And I think first of all within your low density \u2013 sorry low density polyethylene supply being less on an absolute basis, the demand growth is also lower for low density polyethylene. So, when I think about high density polyethylene which is the majority of what we produce, we do see that the supply is coming on generally when the demand is there as well. If we see periods of oversupply it's episodic as opposed to structural.","So, my sense is that as we work our way through digesting the new supply in 2020 globally then we'll have to see how the timing works out on the future projects. Even in China, some of the projects have been later than they were first announced, so and we're going through startup of our Hyperzone plant right now and if we don't reach full capacity on the first day that we put hydrocarbon in, so these things have a certain ramp up rate, which generally is not reflected in IHS numbers. But I'm somewhat constructive that I think we're \u2013 we've reached the bottom and we're bouncing off of the lows in Q4 and we'll see how demand develops here.","Mike McMurray","And Hassan to your point. I mean the days sales of inventory are reported by ACC has dropped for high density by eight days since December of 2018 to December of 2019. Just shows you that the market is tightening up for high density here in North America.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Michael Sison","Hey, guys. Bob, when you think about your EBITDA in the fourth quarter, it held up pretty well given difficult environment sort of across the board. So, when you think about 2020 and your portfolio, can you grow EBITDA on 2020? And if you can, where do you think you'll see some of the potential upside?","Bob Patel","Yes. Good morning, Mike. Thanks for that question. Indeed, I think we did hold up well. And in our prepared comments, I mentioned that the Oxyfuels business did well. So, first of all, I think the diversity in our portfolio and that some of these products are at different points in their individual cycles that helps in delivering consistent and strong cash flow. But I think through sources of earnings upside, first of all, start-up of our new Hyperzone polyethylene plant, as I said we're in the process of start-up right now. And so, we should have \u2013 we hope to have production by month-end.","So, once that plant is up and running and as Q2 progresses, we start to produce target grade rate that should start to contribute earnings. Also our APS integration work, the integration of A. Schulman continues. We're doing really well run rate synergies at the end of December, we\u2019re at about $130 million annualized. So, we're doing quite well on that. And we should continue to see benefits. The automotive sector has been really depressed globally. And frankly, that hit our legacy compounding business because it was mostly automotive. Any rebound in automotive is going to help that segment.","And in our view, with all of our integration work I think we're laying the groundwork for really capitalizing on small improvements. Furthermore, IMO, I talked about that earlier, while we've been disappointed that we haven't seen some response yet, we do believe we will see it. Into Q2, we should see the benefits of IMO in terms of better cracks and even wider light-heavy differential.","So those are some examples of earnings upside, if you will, that don't really rely on polyethylene market getting better per se. And also when you think about cash flow or the lower CapEx this year, should be positive as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now open.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning. And Michael, nice to meet you at least telephonically, look forward to meeting you in person.","Mike McMurray","Thank you, Frank.","Frank Mitsch","But Bob, I want to come back to the Sinopec possum JV or the Memorandum of Understanding that you signed last month. You mentioned a little bit about the fact that you're going to be more exposed to styrene in China and have a better prognosis for that business over there.","Obviously, this is a business that you have not expressed a lot of positive comments in the past and I'm just curious, has your outlook for styrene overall changed, where do you see it going, is this the first move of others or was this just opportunistic with Sinopec? If you could expand upon that\u2019d be great.","Bob Patel","Sure. Good morning, Frank. First of all, that joint venture is more about deal and less about SM. So it's really a driver for us to invest was propylene oxide, we see a growing market there over time. We have a great partner in Sinopec, an existing relationship that we're building upon. They have great operational capability as well as capability to build plants, low cost.","So, in styrene, the styrene wasn't the reason we did this, we\u2019re undertaking this project. But on the other hand, we believe that in Asia certainly there's still some growth in styrene and we can place that volume when that plant starts up. So, more about fuel, less about styrene but comfortable that we can place the styrene and have considered in our economics the value of styrene.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Bob, can you just discuss the prospects or your views on potential US polyethylene price increase in Q1? I know [indiscernible] pick up in March and April but ethane is cheap are you seeing spot export price pick up here. So, what's your confidence in getting up a P price increase in February and March? Thank you.","Bob Patel","Good morning, David. First of all as I mentioned earlier, the spot price has moved up post, on a posted basis right? So $0.03 to $0.04 depending on which publication you read. I think that says that if there\u2019s some underpinning for that increase.","Secondly inventories as reported by HCC IHS indicate that inventories are low as producer level anecdotally we believe that the converter level, inventories are also low. We should see a seasonal uptick we do every year and I don't see why this year should be any different. And so, some seasonal uptick should help.","Lastly, something that perhaps isn't on everyone's radar that the turnaround season is pretty heavy this year. They\u2019re much heavier than last year on crackers in the US so we could see ethylene be tighter in during the turnaround season as a result of the higher level of capacity that's out. So I think all of those things point towards reasonable chances of improvements.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jonas Oxgaard","Thank you. Bob, it sounded like you \u2013 you thought that naphtha prices have come back down again in Q2 or so. I was wondering how much of that as an industry view or how much of it is your lined out view? And if it is an industry view, wouldn\u2019t that suggest that the producers in Asia if they all know this would just try to hold on until it crashes instead of shutting down?","Bob Patel","Hey Jonas, I think my comment at one of the earlier questions related to I think it was Vincent who asked me about Asian PE margins. My comment was more that those margins should come up from \u2013 from sort of below the breakeven point where they are today.","I don't know that necessarily that's going to come from naphtha dropping. I mean it could be that price rises and that's why the margins improve. So if I express the view on naphtha that was not intentional. My view was more about the fact that Asian PE naphtha spreads seem \u2013 seem untenable based on historic and data. And you know my sense is that those margins need to expand some, so that they\u2019re not cash-negative for a significant part of the industry over there.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Bhavesh Lodaya","Okay, thanks. This is Bhavesh for John. Good morning.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Bhavesh Lodaya","So for your Technology segment, it has had a solid past couple of years. You shed some color for the first quarter. How should we think about the cadence and size of earnings of the full-year? And if you could just help with some of the underlying drivers for the growth you're seeing in catalyst sales, is it more about describing higher market share or is it just linked to growing the growing industry capacity?","Bob Patel","Yes, Bhavesh, first of all, in our Technology segment, there are two components, there\u2019s catalyst and then there\u2019s licensing. So the catalyst business is very steady, and as we do these licenses, our catalyst business steadily grows. That part isn\u2019t very volatile and there\u2019s definitely an upward slope in terms of earnings and one that accrues for many years to come.","And the licensing side, it\u2019s much more variable. It depends on timing of payments and licenses we win. Your point is correct, and that we\u2019ve been participating in many of these projects that you -- that are announced in China, primarily. But likely, the licensing side of the business will cool off some in 2020.","We do expect some lower earnings from that segment. And yet, on the other hand, as the license plants start up, our catalysts turning should steadily increase over time. And that's really a great part of that Technology businesses is that provides stability of cash flow.","David Kinney","All right. So I think that was the last question that we had. So, let me offer a few closing remarks before we sign off. So, our company's proven and continuous focus on operational excellence, cost management and disciplined capital allocation think will serve us really well in this current challenging environment. We anticipate typical seasonal improvements for our businesses as we've progressed through the year, favorable resolution of trade policies and a rebound in industrial demand could potentially provide significant upside for many of our businesses.","As I've mentioned several times in the Q&A, IMO 2020 is expected to increase earnings in our refinery. We see increasing polyethylene volumes from our new Hyperzone investment. And I think generally, we're really well poised as a company to deliver and continue our outstanding track record of cash generation in this year to come. So, we thank you for your interest in our company and look forward to updating you in April at the end of the first quarter.","Thank you and with that, have a great weekend. We are adjourned.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answering session.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning and thank you, Michelle. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's third quarter 2017 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin this business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com.

The passcode for both numbers is 2526.","During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment and near-term outlook.","With that being said, I would now like to turn the call all over to Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thanks, Dave. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide three and review the highlights from the third quarter.","Our third quarter diluted earnings per share was $2.67. EBITDA was $1.8 billion. Our global business portfolio demonstrated continued strength with EBITDA from our Intermediates & Derivatives segment improving by more than 30% during the third quarter relative to the third quarter of 2016. We advanced our growth strategy by opening a new polypropylene compounds plant in China, and reaching final investment decision for our next propylene oxide plant in Texas.","The sale of our interest in the Geosel pipeline and storage facility in France resulted in an after-tax gain of $103 million, which impacted earnings by $0.26 per share. We continue to execute on our financial priorities during the third quarter and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments.","Turning to slide four, I'm pleased to report that LyondellBasell's employees and contractors continue to stay focused upon workplace safety during 2017. Third quarter year-to-date metrics compare favorably to both industry benchmarks and our own historical performance. The value of our disciplined approach to safety was evident in the response by our workforce during Hurricane Harvey, one of the worst natural disasters in Texas' history. Despite extensive personal, community and industrial disruption, LyondellBasell had zero major process safety incidents in the areas affected by the storm. Our team overcame difficult conditions and countless obstacles to ensure a safe and secure operations of our clients. I'm personally grateful to our colleagues for their tremendous selflessness, dedication and sense of ownership during this event.","Hurricane Harvey affected each of our nine major U.S. Gulf Coast sites by varying degrees. Except for our La Porte ethylene cracker, all facilities were operating by the end of September. Our La Porte cracker had an unplanned shutdown due to the storm that damaged the compressor and distillation tower. I'm pleased to report that this cracker is producing ethylene as of this morning and we will ramp up to full rates over the next days. While we still have a few raw material allocations from suppliers, all other production units are now operating at typical rates. We estimate that lost sales volume valued at third quarter margins and additional related cost due to the storm impacted third quarter results by approximately $200 million.","Tight markets for many of our products resulted in improved margins that provided partial offsets. During the fourth quarter, we estimate that additional lost sales and expenses from the storm, primarily related to the La Porte outage will impact results by approximately $100 million.","Let's turn to slide five and review our progress towards increasing production volumes during 2017. You'll recall that during 2016. We had an unusually-high level of plant maintenance, capacity expansions and other work that led to downtime on many of our assets. Even after the impact of Harvey, this year we have produced 13% more ethylene across our global system than in 2016. This increased ethylene production enables us to run our downstream polyethylene and ethylene upside derivative units at higher rates.","At our refinery, crude throughput is up by 21% relative to 2016 with only minimal impact from the storm. These volume improvements are contributing to the increased EBITDA in our third quarter results.","On slide six, I'd like to review typical seasonality for polyethylene demand in North America, and how the cadence of capacity additions might play out over the coming months. Over the previous seven years, first quarter PE demand in North America improved by an average of 3%, as customers restock after depleting inventories at year-end. Demand typically stayed strong over the second quarter and steps up another 3% in the third quarter to serve increased demand for products consumed during the year-end holiday season.","Fourth quarter is typically a period of reduced demand when customers seek to minimize inventories and associated year-end taxes. This seasonal demand pattern is similar to the behavior of global markets where the 4% annual average for polyethylene demand growth is primarily focused in the first three quarters of the year. During the fourth quarter of 2017, several of the long anticipated North American polyethylene capacity additions are becoming a reality for the market.","The new capacity is likely to exceed global demand growth by a few percent, but it arrives at a time when global operating rates are very high. With Harvey reducing inventories across the industry during the last third \u2013 2017 and with increasing seasonal demand during the first three quarters of 2018, we believe the market is well positioned to absorb the new capacity over the next few quarters.","And now Thomas will provide detail on our financial highlights.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Bob, and good morning to all of you. On slide seven we outline our quarterly and trailing 12-months segment results. During the third quarter Olefins & Polyolefins Americas volumes were impacted by Hurricane Harvey, while high industry operating rates compressed olefin margins due to higher feedstock costs and weaker pricing for much of the quarter.","Olefins & Polyolefins EAI continue to benefit from strong demand for polymers that was impacted by reduced olefin margins, primarily due to lower co-product pricing. Our Intermediates & Derivatives segment benefited from strong volumes and margin across most products. The refinery run well throughout the quarter and had a relatively small throughput impact during Harvey. Strong September refining margins improved third quarter profitability relative to the second quarter and 2016 results. Overall, our profitability remained strong with $6.8 billion in EBITDA over the past 12 months.","Please turn to slide 8, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of cash from operations and more than 40% of this amount was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Our investments in maintenance and growth capital expenses were $380 million during the third quarter, with increased spending for the Hyperzone PE and PO\/TBA projects.","During the third quarter, our cash and liquid investments balance increased by approximately $500 million. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.4 billion of cash from operations and used approximately $2.7 billion for dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 9 provides a longer perspective, as well as some current financial metrics. We finished the quarter with approximately $6 billion of liquidity and a total debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.3 times. Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 3.1 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we had repurchased approximately 189 million shares, or approximately 33% of the initial shares outstanding. We continue to take a targeted approach to share repurchases as part of our capital deployment strategy.","I'm pleased to announce that on September 22, Standard & Poor's raised the rating of LyondellBasell's senior unsecured debt to BBB+ from BBB. Excluding the first quarter bond redemption charges, we continued to maintain our previous annual guidance provided in February for interest, depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as our effective tax rate. We now estimate that our capital expenditures for 2017 will be approximately $200 million less than our initial guidance of $2 billion. I look forward to providing you with annual guidance for 2018 during our fourth quarter earnings call.","With that, thank you very much for your attention. I will now turn the call back to Bob. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 10 and review our segment results. In our Olefins & Polyolefins-Americas segment, third quarter EBITDA was $616 million, a $243 million decline compared to the second quarter. Relative to the previous quarter, Olefins results decreased by approximately $260 million, increasing feedstock prices caused margins to decline by nearly $0.05 per pound and sales volume decline due to production losses from Hurricane Harvey.","Downtime on our Gulf Coast ethylene crackers during the storm resulted in an average ethylene operating rate of 76% for the quarter. 73% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 85% came from NGLs. In Polyolefins, combined results were relatively unchanged. Polyethylene sales were slightly higher than the second quarter, but lower than third quarter expectations due to Hurricane Harvey.","Polyethylene spreads improved approximately $0.02 per pound, but were largely offset by reduced polypropylene volumes and declining margins due to polypropylene prices lagging monomer price increases.","During October, polymer markets remained firm as customers continue to restock supply chains following the hurricane. Polymer supplies are expected to improve with higher production availability and new capacity, but ethylene inventory should continue to tighten due to planned industry maintenance and increased demand.","Co-monomer availability to produce certain types of polyethylene continues to be a concern for the industry. With the restart of our La Porte cracker this morning, no major maintenance is planned in our olefins system for the remainder of 2017.","Let's turn to slide 11 and review the performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $698 million, $1 million lower than the second quarter. This includes $108 million gain from the sale of our interest in Geosel. Olefins results declined by approximately $100 million on lower margins, primarily due to lower co-product prices. Utilization of advantaged feedstocks accounted for 53% of ethylene production and operating rates remained strong at 95%. Combined polyolefins results declined by approximately $10 million, with volume improvements partially offset by margin declines.","During October, global markets remained balanced with good demand. Thriving naphtha prices are expected to pressure strong olefin margins. In October, we had an upset in our ethylene cracker, which required unplanned maintenance. I'm pleased to report that the repairs are complete and the cracker is operational again. The value of lost production due to the upset is forecasted to impact the fourth quarter by approximately $40 million. As in the U.S., no other major maintenance is planned in our European olefin system for the remainder of 2017.","Now please turn to slide 12 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $402 million, an improvement of $63 million compared to the second quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives improved by approximately $25 million. Despite production losses due to Hurricane Harvey, sales volume increased due to the completion of planned maintenance in our PO\/TBA plant in The Netherlands during the second quarter.","Intermediate chemicals results improved by approximately $15 million as styrene margins improved. Volumes declined for most intermediate chemicals except for an increase in methanol volumes, due to the completion of second quarter planned maintenance at our Channelview facility.","Oxyfuels and related products results improved by approximately $25 million, primarily due to volume increases upon the completion of the planned maintenance in our Netherlands facility. October volumes are improving for most Intermediates & Derivatives products with the absence of hurricane impacts on production and demand. Tighter supply due to production outages in the acetyl industry are improving margins. In contrast, high butane prices and typical fourth quarter seasonal declines are compressing oxyfuel margins.","Now let's move to slide 13 for a discussion of the refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $58 million, a $33 million improvement over the prior quarter. We continuously and safely operated the refinery at reduced rates during Hurricane Harvey to minimize our losses and improved its speed of recovery after the storm. The Maya 2-1-1 improved primarily due to stronger distillate spreads.","This improvement was partially offset by weak heavy to light crude differentials on our byproduct margins. Our technology segment continued to perform well with $47 million of EBITDA, approximately $1 million decline versus the second quarter.","Turning to slide 14. Considering the effects of Hurricane Harvey, third quarter results showed the resilience of our business portfolio. We had earnings of $2.67 per share and strong results from our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. We continue to advance our 2,000 volume improvements with a 13% increase in ethylene production and 21% higher throughput at the refinery.","Our growth initiatives continue with startup of a new plant in China and approval of our propylene oxide investment in Texas. By generating approximately $1.5 billion in cash from operations during the quarter, we continue to deploy capital toward a balanced mix of dividends, share repurchases and organic growth.","As we look toward the remainder of 2017, we continue to see firm olefin and polyolefin markets, as supply chains restock from the production loss during Hurricane Harvey. New polyethylene capacity is aligned with seasonal demand and supportive of improved demand for ethylene monomer, while the industry awaits the startup of additional crackers during 2018.","Global polymer demand remains strong. Most Intermediates & Derivatives products are well-positioned as we enter the fourth quarter and should help balance typical seasonal weakness in oxyfuels. U.S. Gulf Coast refining markets appear to have reset favorably after the hurricanes with strong distillate spreads and improved light to heavy differentials. We're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Bob, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about ethane. Obviously, the downtime didn't tighten up the ethane market, it looks like maybe in the next 12 or 18 months we'll see ethane consumption in the industry rise about 30%. So, give us some sense what you think would happen to your ethane costs if we revisit that maybe mid of 2018 and late 2018, how much higher it could be?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Sure. Good morning, Bob. I think part of the reason ethane prices were somewhat sticky that you can see temporary dislocations in terms of pipeline operations and so on.","Our fundamental view is that we still see rejection of ethane in the range of 500,000 barrels per day and there is a lot more coming on from the Permian pipelines and fractionation capacity that's planned for next year. So my views haven't changed in terms of $0.07 to $0.10 sort of frac margins and abundance of ethane to meet the new demand that we expect from crackers in 2018. So, we're still pretty constructive and consistent with our views.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. You may go ahead.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Bob, we had tightness in polyethylene as you noted, you've had $0.07 in price increases. What's your sense of whether we can get additional price increases here? And as this new polyethylene capacity does start up in the fourth quarter, how quickly do you think this surge in pricing can last?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I still think, as I said in my prepared remarks, that markets are still relatively tight and not all of the industry has returned to unconstrained operations because of some of the comonomer lingering outages that does impact some grades of polyethylene. So my sense is that as the supply chain replenishes inventory, including our customers who likely depleted raw material and finished goods inventory, that'll probably carry us through the fourth quarter and in the first quarter as we showed in our presentation that generally we see a step up in demand seasonally in Q1 and then again in Q3.","So I think this demand pattern will likely provide for pretty balanced markets. And so we'll have to see, but I think also we're starting from even a higher price base than when we had anticipated, and higher operating rate, so I think all of that points towards pretty constructive markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Oh, I'm sorry. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe you can just discuss, I guess, what you're seeing on both ethylene side and propylene side? You discussed that there is tightness in polyethylene but we have seen a little bit of give back on the ethylene side, and then similarly in polypropylene, you mentioned that it didn't keep up with the monomer, so maybe you can just talk a little bit about those changes as well. Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Sure, Arun. First of all in ethylene, you may have read that one of the crackers that was due to start up early next year has been pushed out due to the impacts from the storm. And also if you look ahead into the spring season, the turnaround season looks to be heavier than average, and certainly the planned maintenance looks like it's going to be more than the spring of 2016, so we see that further tightening ethylene going into next year. So we're pretty constructive on ethylene through first half of next year. And the timing of ethylene and polyethylene price increases that's really just sort of small sort of market movements over time. But I think ethylene is going to be pretty constructive through certainly the middle of next year until the last of large crackers starts up in this sort of series of start-ups that are coming.","On propylene, what I had mentioned in my prepared remarks is really that generally propylene prices tend to lag by about a month. And so I think it's very normal the lag that we're seeing, but if we kind of step back, we still think polypropylene is very, very tight. There's not really any new capacity planned and demand is growing year-over-year. So, we're pretty constructive about polypropylene for some time frankly because there's not really any new greenfield capacity coming for another couple of years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just a question, I think it was like this call a year ago that sort of there was more talk about inorganic growth and M&A and obviously years now passed and nothing's happened. So, I know you can't be specific, but maybe at a high level, could you just sort of give us a postmortem on the last 12 months? And why hasn't anything happened, is it the bid-ask spreads are too high that you're not seeing the assets that you're interested in? And just any updated thoughts there would be helpful.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, good morning. So since our Investor Day, when we sort of presented our strategy and how we thought about inorganic growth, frankly, our strategic priorities did remain consistent, they haven't changed. We laid out our objectives, we laid out sort of the value chains in which we would find interest and we continue to be thoughtful and disciplined and our focus is on value creation. So my view is that not a whole lot has changed, and I don't think we expected in April that something was imminent and as the quarters have played out, that's been the case. So, we're going to be opportunistic, that's a very nature of inorganic growth and be focused on value creation and leverage our strengths.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. You may go ahead.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. You mentioned acetic acid prices were going up and I know you've got some announcements out there in the market. Can you talk about the cadence of acetic acid price increases and how that might impact profitability for Intermediates & Derivatives?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I think in the near-term, markets are a little bit tighter partly because of unplanned outages and we think that the market will be more balanced post all of this sort of settling out. And as you rightly mentioned, there is some more capacity coming, but likely that could moderate business conditions further in that value chain. I think the recent move up has been more because of the unplanned outages, whether it's there because of hurricanes or elsewhere due to mechanical issues.","Operator","Thank you. David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Bob, when these crackers do come on-stream middle of next year and maybe even the back half of next year, how do you think margins will at least in the short term, how much compression could they see on either ethylene or a combined ethylene, polyethylene basis in the U.S.?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Good morning, David. Let me give you a few statistics to help frame the degree of sort of supply growth exceeding demand growth. This is IHS data for your consideration, so 2016 to 2017, by IHS data, we'd estimate that supply for polyethylene has grown by about 7% from 2016 to 2017, and demand has grown at 4%, which is the number we've been talking about for some time and consistent with history. So you could say perhaps that supply growth from 2016 to 2017 exceeds demand growth by 3%. 2017 to 2018, based on published numbers, supply growth increases by 4.7% and let's assume that demand grows by another 4%.","If you look across those two years, you end up with perhaps operating rates declining by 3%, 4% coming off of very, very high operating rates and what we would consider still to be balanced markets on an annual average basis and tight markets during seasonal periods.","If you look at that slide that we showed in our presentation, it shows that the growth really comes in the first three quarters in a year. And when you think about operating rates, effective operating rates still being in the 90%s post this period of supply exceeding demand growth, I think markets are going to be pretty balanced and as we go into the seasonal upturn in 2018, I think there is the potential for this capacity to be absorbed over that period of time.","So and the other thing I would offer is that because of the recent price movements, our starting point is higher than it would have been otherwise. So, I don't have a crystal ball to tell you how much prices could decline next year, but it seems to me that with the starting point being higher prices and starting point being very high operating rates and modest decline, we're going to have pretty constructive markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. You may go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","With Brent crude trading in the high $50s or close to $60 today, what is the impact of higher oil prices on your European cracker, what are utilization rates there and what do you expect on co-product values? Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So as you know, in our European fleet, on an annual average basis, a little more than half of our feedstock is non-naphtha based or purchased at a discount to naphtha and I think that will continue. I think the availability of those what we call advantaged feeds should continue. Higher oil prices should provide for higher co-product prices over time and there is some seasonality in there. So, I think ticking from low-$50s to upper-$50s on Brent in my mind doesn't materially change the competitiveness of our European assets. And if you consider further, the backdrop of still a relatively weak euro compared to dollar, compared to what it was a couple of years ago, we've seen imports actually decline into Europe this year on polyethylene. So I think Europe is still going to be competitive and my expectation is that we're going to run at maximum rates next year of available capacity.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Just a data point P.J., we were running at 95% during the third quarter in Europe on our crackers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. You may go ahead.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more color on the $200 million impact from Harvey in terms of what the split might be between lost sales and direct costs, as well as color on the impact by major product line or segment, please?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. Most of that was from lost sales in terms of the $200 million impact. We had some fixed costs related to maintenance and so on. But you can consider most of it to be volume related. In terms of the split on the segments, about 60% in the Americas, 20% IND, 20% refining, approximately that sort of split is what \u2013 where the impact landed.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. You may go ahead.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. You talked about the hurricanes delaying new projects, La Porte was more impacted than your other facilities. Why wasn't the Hyperzone project delayed?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, first of all let me frame for you kind of our asset base along the Gulf Coast and just to sort of help understand, I think how well we did during the storm. As I mentioned during my prepared remarks, we've about nine assets, nine individual sites from Corpus Christi to Lake Charles, Louisiana. And in that there are four polyethylene sites and four large crackers. So, we think about our participation or our number of assets we have relative to others in the industry, we have a considerable amount of assets here, add to that headquarters with about a 1,100 people in Houston and a pipeline system that's more than 2,000 miles. So, if you kind of put all of that in your mind and you think about $200 million impact on mostly lost volume, I think that's really outstanding and really credit to our people.","We weren't impacted on the project at La Porte because we're still very early in the construction. We've just now started to pour foundations and we're coming out of the ground as the same goes in the construction business; so very early. We still project startup mid 2019 for our polyethylene unit. And given the earliness in our construction, the timeline really hasn't been impacted. So that's how to think about the project versus the cracker at La Porte.","Operator","Thank you. Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. And Bob, just following up on Hyperzone, the next major project that you've going on is PO\/TBA, but there has been press reports or speculation that you may be doing a propylene unit as well. Could you talk about what your plans are on these very large organic growth opportunities?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. So first of all, Frank, we have multiple platforms in the company, which we can build on and that's essentially as we talked about during Investor Day, our aim was to deploy some of our free cash flow into organic growth, so that we could think about earnings growth through cycles and have a positive slope through these cycles and I think we're starting to build a pipeline now.","Having done our ethylene expansions early and having paid for most of them by now, I think we now can focus on derivatives and we can focus on propylene chain, whether it's PO\/TBA or polypropylene. So I think this is sort of a continuation of what we laid out during Investor Day and our organic growth opportunities and pipeline, we have ahead of us. So to me, this is the next natural sort of organic growth opportunity after announcing polyethylene and PO\/TBA is to go to polypropylene where we see a market that's growing at reasonable rates. We have a global position in polypropylene.","We have a strong technology position with leading process technology and polyolefin catalyst. So, it's a chance to leverage technology in a region that we think is growing at a rate where there's an opportunity for more capacity to meet that growing demand. And really what we're thinking through beyond polypropylene is where that propylene will come from and we're thinking about whether we build our own PDH unit or we further purchase more propylene from the market. And to me that's really kind of a make versus buy decision and very return-oriented focus. So \u2013 but it's something that I'd like to see us move with pace and as the report suggest, currently we're on the trajectory of making a final investment decision by the end of next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura. You may go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Bob, just as a follow-up on a previous question. You outlined a fairly positive view of ethylene supply and demand in the short term and the long term. And also, you have a favorable view on ethane availability. So in that context, why is a large scale ethylene investment not on the table right now?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think, Alex, we have the opportunity to do so many other things at the moment that have equal or better returns. And so, our focus is to build out the polyethylene capacity after Hyperzone, we'll think about whether we want to do another polyethylene plant. We've talked about that. We're already doing now the PO\/TBA project. So again, to me, we have multiple platforms we can build on and at some point we will cross the decision of additional ethylene and polyethylene capacity. But in the meantime, we can diversify our project \u2013 our organic growth through the multiple platforms and that's really what I would prefer at the moment.","Operator","Your next question is from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. You may go ahead.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Hassan.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Bob, as I take a look at some of the pricing movements that happened post the hurricanes, obviously, ethylene pricing shot up as did polyethylene. But it seems polyethylene shot up at a more rapid rate than ethylene, right? And one of the arguments that I've been hearing is that there was a comonomer facility outage and there is sort of a fair bit of tightness within the comonomer market, maybe potentially explaining why polyethylene prices ran faster than ethylene. So would just love to hear your views on the comonomer side of things and the role that that may have played on the polyethylene, call it tightness or pricing movement?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think certainly, Hassan, those two are related, especially in early part of October and the latter part of September, we certainly were looking for other sources of supply for comonomer, and while we were doing that we couldn't run our polyethylene plants at full rate, so post-hurricane to the extent that we could run \u2013 we could only run about 80% in September and we've been able to ramp up a little bit more. But that comonomer facility has a significant percentage of supply, about half of the comonomer in the U.S. comes from that facility and on a global basis something like 20% I believe.","So, very important and that has constrained polyethylene production and therefore, the need for ethylene. I suspect that as we move through November, some of that will ease and the comonomer supply will resume. But we don't really know much more than that at this point. And then if you think about beyond that, by January, we already be moving into then the seasonal uptick as we do every year in Q1.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may go ahead.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. The polyethylene supply that's coming on in the U.S., how much has the right technical specification either to be shipped to Europe or absorbed by domestic demand in the U.S.? And are there any steps that Lyondell can take in order to preserve the premium pricing in those two regions?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think, Ian, first of all, I think it's important to look under the headline of polyethylene and consider how much of the new capacity is linear low density, low density and high density polyethylene. And it's the first thing to think about when we think about destination markets and impact on domestic premiums, if you will. And the conclusion I think is that there is a reasonable amount of balance between these three polyethylenes and on a percentage basis, by IHS data, it seems that the percentage increase in supply is the greatest in linear low density polyethylene and it's meaningfully so between the conventional and the metallocene linear lows. So, I can't speak for how others have planned for all of that, but I can tell you for us as a company, we've been thinking through all of that. We've been thinking through moving incremental product through our own marketing network both in Europe and in Asia and supply chains required to reach those markets, and we're very well-prepared and our plans are on a good timeline.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. You may go ahead.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, fellows.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Question. As you guys with your technology business have a pretty unique view on a lot of what's happening in the olefins in the future globally. Two questions of that, your best guess the range of how many new olefin crackers will be announced over the next year globally? And then the second one on that with the Chinese move on environmental stuff, do you think that does anything to their existing or their future plans around CTO and MTO?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Thanks, Duffy for your question. You can understand the confidential nature of our discussions in the technologies segment. So I'll be general in my comments. First of all, I think the move in China, specifically, are tighter environmental regulation and the move away from recycled polyethylene, both of those point towards more constructive markets globally, and meaning directionally less supply because of regulations and more demand for virgin polyethylene as opposed to recycled polyethylene in China. I think both of those, especially the reduction in recycled content directionally increases operating rates for 2018.","In terms of what we're seeing in our business longer term, I think we do see some delays in also olefin-type projects, especially in the coastal areas and generally some delays in polypropylene decisions as well. So, we don't see a significant sort of wave of expansions on a global basis beyond what's reported by IHS. So, I'll leave it there to be respectful of the confidential nature of that business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. You may go ahead.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","The numbers you listed earlier, you said demand growth of 4%, supply of 7%. I've seen the same numbers, but they just don't add up, right, because margins didn't change. So what do you think is wrong with these numbers or where \u2013 in what direction are they wrong or why don't they match up?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, it could be, Jonas, again I'm quoting IHS data and it could be that the expansions are sort of back end loaded in the year that could potentially explain part of that. But the other is and I continue to believe their operating rates are so high that 2%, 3% reduction in operating rates doesn't put us in a significantly different market environment. You add to that seasonality and now the hurricane impact, which likely moderates Q4 2017, I think all of that says, as we've suggested in our prepared remarks that markets are well-positioned to absorb a good bit of this new capacity that's coming. So, perhaps those things help explain what your question is.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may go ahead, sir.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Matthew.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I was just hoping you could talk about the refining side, the IMO 2020 sulfur spec. It seems that could be a pretty big positive to your plant, which I believe produces a relatively low percentage of fuel oil considering all the heavy crude it runs. So, are you seeing the same things and also would you plan any sort of investments around the refinery to better take advantage of this upcoming sulfur spec? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Well, Matthew, this IMO topic has gained more momentum as the year has gone on. And this is essentially the change in the bunker fuel spec for a shift that fuel would lower sulfur as a cap, if you will. Our refinery is really well positioned to take advantage of upside that this potentially might represent. The upside for the rest of our listeners, it really comes from two sources, one is from potentially wider light to heavy differentials on crude pricing. The theory being that heavier crudes will be more in supply as fewer refineries can meet the sulfur specifications. The other is, we think, as you mentioned, Matthew, stronger distillate margins, which again are very heavy, complex refinery \u2013 heavy crude processing complex refinery is well-positioned to capture indeed (47:34) stronger distillate margins come about. So as time goes on, we're going to monitor this and see how it plays out. But as it stands today, a new regulation will go into effect in January of 2020, which is not so far away now. And I think we'll have very good visibility next year.","So I like how our refinery is positioned. As to your question about what are we doing in the meantime? Our focus really is about having a highly reliable refinery, we've already made improvements from 2016 to 2017 as evidenced in our numbers, and we want to be positioned as well as possible to operate at very high rates, whether IMO has an impact or not. And so, we're quite focused on an improvement plan, which we're implementing and I'm quite pleased with the results in 2017 and very aware that we need to continue to deliver results year-after-year at our refinery, much like we do with all the other assets in the company. So, we'll have to see how this goes, but we're encouraged by what IMO may represent for our refinery.","Operator","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bob Patel for any closing comments.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","All right. Thank you, Michele. Well, with no further questions in the queue, let me close with a few remarks. We've operated well through Q3 this year and I'm especially proud of our team and how well they've responded to this extraordinary natural disaster that was Harvey. Nearly 40% of our employees in a significant part of our global asset base were in the path of the storm. Our team remains consistently focused on safe, reliable, cost efficient operations. I continue to believe these strengths and focus provide the foundation for future growth, towards which we have made significant strides in through Q3 2017.","In early February 2018, we look forward to discussing our full-year results from 2017 and we will have an expanded earnings call at that time, during which we'll provide updates on LyondellBasell growth strategy.

Good day to all of you participating around the world, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. During the second quarter, consumer-driven demand for our products and low feedstock costs improved profitability in four of our six segments. Despite concerns about capacity additions in the industry and a challenging business environment, integrated polyethylene profitability increased during the second quarter, with industry margins of approximately $600 per ton in Europe and $800 per ton in North America.","Across the company, our second quarter EBITDA improved by approximately 11% relative to the first quarter. Second quarter earnings were $2.70 per share, which represents a 23% improvement over the previous quarter. Our second quarter income was slightly below the guidance range we've provided in June primarily due to compressed margins from our refining business. As the price of oil fell by more than 15% from mid-May to mid-June, we saw many of our customers holding back on June orders, particularly in markets that are driven by industrial demand such as automotive, appliances and industrial construction.","During July, volumes for most products rebounded to levels 10% to 20% above June, and third quarter demand seems to be following typical summer seasonal strength. Our company moved forward on our disciplined value-driven growth strategy by announcing the second Spherizone polypropylene project at our joint venture in Thailand and ending discussions regarding the potential acquisition of Braskem.","We are leveraging our innovative technologies by expanding our footprint in the growing Southeast Asian polypropylene market. We're completing construction on our first Hyperzone polyethylene plant and building a new propylene oxide plant that addresses growing demand for polyurethanes. These decisions demonstrate our disciplined approach to investments, which are focused on growth opportunities, where we see a clear path to value creation for our shareholders.","Our strong cash flows and conservative balance sheet allowed us to launch a tender offer in June that resulted in the purchase of approximately 9.5% of our outstanding shares in July. Our actions in the last quarter are consistent with our balanced capital deployment strategy that positions us to grow cash flow and provide consistently strong shareholder returns in the form of both opportunistic share buybacks and a top decile dividend.","Let's turn to Slide 4 and discuss our safety performance. Our approach to the integration of the A. Schulman acquisition began by immediately instilling LyondellBasell's safety culture across our new assets, employees and contractors.","A. Schulman expanded our employee population by approximately 40%, and through the end of the second quarter, we achieved considerable progress to sustain LyondellBasell's leading safety performance.","And now Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the second quarter.","Thomas Aebischer","Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to Slide 5, which illustrates developments within our company during the quarter and over the trailing 12 months. As Bob mentioned, during the second quarter, four of our six business segments posted higher profitability relative to the previous quarter.","EBITDA for the entire company has continued to increase sequentially since the fourth quarter of 2018. Our business portfolio continues to provide earnings resilience through the diversity of our petrochemical products and markets and can often reduce volatility for the overall company performance.","Integrated polyethylene margins have expanded in both Europe and North America due to favorable feedstock prices. In addition, seasonally low butane raw material prices drove benchmark Northwest Europe, MTBE, oxyfuels margins to the highest levels since 2015.","In the first quarter, we mentioned that we had a minor impact due to the service disruptions related to the March fire at the third-party terminal on the Houston Ship Channel. The impact of lost sales volume and expenses extended to the second quarter, and we estimate that results for our I&D segment were impacted by approximately $50 million during the first half of 2019, primarily in our oxyfuels and related business.","We anticipate that third quarter results will have little to no impact due to this issue at the terminal. Our Houston refinery continued to run well at 97% of nameplate capacity. Unfortunately high prices on the portion of heavy sulfur crude oil we buy on the open Houston market, reduced profitability relative to Maya 2-1-1 referenced crack spreads. Our technology business delivered another quarter of outstanding results with several licenses reaching revenue recognition milestones.","On Slide 6, you can see that LyondellBasell's businesses generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operating activities during the second quarter. We raised the quarterly dividend to $1.05 per share in May, making this the 11 dividend increase over the past eight years. In addition to a strong dividend, our strong cash flows provided ample capability to continue our investments in organic growth project.","We are progressing construction on our PO\/TBA plant and wrapping up construction on our Hyperzone PE plant, where we will begin commissioning activities during the second half of the year. The quarter closed with over $1.9 billion of cash and liquid investments.","Please turn to Slide 7, the chart on the left illustrates our cash flow performance over the previous four years and the trailing 12 months. We believe that operating cash flow after accounting for sustaining capital expenditures provides visibility into our cash that is available for accretive investments in organic growth and M&A or for shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases.","During the last 12 months, LyondellBasell generated $4.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures during the second quarter were about $620 million with roughly 35% allocated to sustaining CapEx and the balance invested in profit-generating projects. This investment in growth has increased slightly during the second quarter, and we expect a similar trend over the remainder of the year as we complete the construction of our Hyperzone PE facility and accelerate the activity for building our new PO\/TBA plant in Houston.","The chart on the right of this slide illustrates our total liquidity for the same periods. The decline in 2018 reflects cash used for the acquisition of A. Schulman. As I've discussed in the first quarter earnings call, liquidity improved during the first quarter of this year primarily due to the new term loan facilities. We closed the quarter with total liquidity in excess of $8 billion.","At the beginning of the third quarter, we utilized $3.1 billion of our available liquidity to fund the tender offer, which closed on July 12. The tender offer resulted in the repurchase of 35.1 million shares. With loan interest rates and LyondellBasell's strong dividend yield, our tender offer is cash flow positive.","Cash savings from the quarterly dividends on the lower share count will exceed interest payment on the incremental bid. I would like to highlight the progress in reducing our effective tax rate for the quarter to slightly less than 15% and our cash tax rate for the year-to-date to slightly less than 12%. These rates are the result of many initiatives to optimize our tax planning with the largest benefits for this quarter rising from our success in obtaining incentives related to the company's targeted investments in research and development activity.","At the beginning of 2019, we provided guidance to our effective tax rate for the year will be approximately 20% and that cash tax rates will be slightly lower. We now believe that our effective tax rate for 2019 will be approximately 17% and our cash tax rates will be several percentage points lower. Our fundamental approach to capital deployment remains disciplined and unchanged.","Slide 8 is an illustration we have used to contrast the sources and uses of our capital in the past and going forward. We are first and foremost committed to a strong and progressive dividend. We will make capital investments that sustain and expand our asset footprint, pursue value-minded inorganic growth opportunities and return the balance of our cash through opportunistic share repurchases.","With that, I will turn the call back to Bob.","Bhavesh Patel","Thanks, Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 9 and review our business results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $635 million, $119 million higher than the first quarter. Results were driven by abundant and affordable natural gas liquids. Olefins results increased by approximately $90 million compared to the first quarter. This improvement was driven by a higher margin as declines in the cost of raw materials outpaced declines in the price of ethylene.","Ethylene operating rates remained strong during the second quarter, averaging 91%, exceeding industry rates by 5%. We continue to optimize our cracker feedslate to benefit from lower NGL prices in our U.S. Gulf Coast system. We've previously spoke about how much of our ethylene production was produced from NGLs. It may be more useful to understand the composition of our feedslate.","In the second quarter, we found advantage in low propane and butane prices. More than 25% of the raw materials used in North American crackers were propane- or butane-based and more than 55% was purely ethane. We continue to increase our utilization of mixed Y-grade NGLs as an advantaged ethylene feedstock. During the second quarter, mid single-digit percentages of our North American cracker feedslate was composed of Y-grade.","Polyethylene results increased more than $25 million during the second quarter. Polyethylene margin improved with the spread increase in polyethylene over ethylene of about $65 per ton. Spot prices of ethylene have risen during July due to industry downtime and continued delays in the commissioning of new capacity. North American polyethylene production is increasingly serving global demand and more than one-third of U.S. and Canada industry production is now being exported.","Slide 10, depicts historical and forecast impacts from capacity additions on global polyethylene operating rates. The green dash line illustrates consultants' forecast from 2016 for the impact of the current wave of new capacity coming into the industry. Some observers believed back then that this turnaround in operating rates \u2013 the downturn in operating rates would result in a period of compressed ethylene chain margins, similar to past cycles when effective operating rates tipped below 90%.","However, delays in the start of planned capacity allowed robust global demand to absorb the new supply. As shown by the dark gray line, the industry maintained high operating rates and relatively strong integrated ethylene chain margins have endured. The forecast from 2016 proved to be far more bearish than the actual outcome.","Similarly, current consultant forecast predicted the next wave of plant supply additions will lead to a small decline in global operating rates during 2022, illustrated by the gray dash line. Based on recent industry results, we expected that some of this planned capacity will also come online later than expected and some projects might be canceled.","These delays and the reduction of planned capacity are likely to once again produce a flatter operating rate profile that extends today's relatively high rates for the years to come. New industry capacity will create short-term fluctuations, particularly in local markets, but we believe global markets will remain balanced to tight, providing good profitability for advantaged producers.","Now please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, EBITDA was $331 million, a $35 million increase over the first quarter. Results were driven by continued seasonal improvement in polyethylene chain margins, with polyethylene price increases keeping pace with rising ethylene prices.","Olefins results improved more than $55 million. Margin improved as the ethylene contract price increased nearly $65 per ton and volume increased with improved operating rates. Combined, polyolefins results declined $15 million primarily due to a decrease in volume. During July, we have seen strong polymer demand in the region as customers returned to the market after taking a pause during the second half of June with the hope of \u2013 for falling prices.","Looking at our Olefins & Polyolefins from a global perspective, in both Europe and North America, polyethylene sales volume for July are projected at levels that are 15% to 20% above June. With six of our competitors', Western European crackers undergoing turnarounds during the third quarter, LyondellBasell will seek to catch our opportunities in the market.","I'd now like to take a moment to highlight some of the products our customers are creating with recycled polyethylene and polypropylene that we produce at Quality Circular Polymers, QCP, our joint venture with SUEZ in the Netherlands.","On Slide 12, you see our collaboration with Samsonite to create the first suitcase made using post-consumer recycled plastic waste. The outer shell is made from QCP post-consumer polypropylene resins and the inside fabric liner is made with PET from post-consumer bottles. We've also collaborated with Unilever to supply recycled plastic for Dove and Axe consumer product packaging.","As the circular economy increases in prominence, we believe that demand for premium recycled materials will continue to grow. Our innovative joint venture with SUEZ harnesses each partner's strengths and deploys LyondellBasell's deep knowledge of polymer technology to convert plastic waste into new materials and products that are valued by consumers. We believe that mechanical recycling will become an essential component of LyondellBasell's sustainable business model.","Please turn to Slide 13. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $448 million, a $58 million increase over the prior quarter. Results were driven by consistent performance of the I&D business portfolio bolstered by seasonally strong oxyfuels profitability.","PO and derivatives results declined by $35 million, primarily due to decline in volume. Intermediate Chemical results improved more than $25 million compared to the first quarter driven by an increase in volume for most products.","Oxyfuels & Related Products results improved by nearly $75 million as we saw strong seasonal margin increases driven by lower butane feedstock prices. As Thomas mentioned, our Oxyfuels & Related Products results would have been even stronger if not for the disruption of the Houston terminal fire. Fortunately, we expect oxyfuels margins to remain strong during the third quarter, and we anticipate little to no impact from the terminal incident on our business.","Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $120 million, a $25 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. The seasonal strength that we anticipated for this business in the second quarter did not materialize. Results were lower due to diminished demand in both automotive and the industrial construction markets. A. Schulman integration costs for the second quarter were $19 million and impacted earnings by $0.04 per share.","As we discussed in prior earnings calls, both transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition are included in the results for the third quarter 2018 and only integration costs are included in the fourth quarter 2018 through the current quarter. Compounding & Solutions results for the first quarter declined approximately $20 million driven by softness in the automotive market.","Volume decreased for most products and margin declined for polypropylene compounds primarily due to a lag in propylene pricing. Advanced Polymers results were relatively unchanged. The second quarter is typically the strongest for this business due to the summer industrial construction market. That was not the case this quarter, and volumes were down by 15% compared to the same quarter last year.","Our integration of A. Schulman is progressing very well. At the end of the second quarter, we are capturing cost synergies at an annual rate of approximately $100 million, and we are well on track to meet the target of $150 million before August of next year. We expect volumes to be fairly stable for the third quarter, with some potential for seasonal demand improvement.","The return of typical demand for the automotive market will be slow, particularly in Asia, where 17 Chinese cities and provinces have accelerated the implementation of stricter automotive emission standards that has reduced demand for non-compliant models during July. Customer applications for APS products extend beyond automotive and construction to markets such as electronics and appliances, packaging and agriculture.","On Slide 15, we highlight a specific type of polymer compound called anti-blocking masterbatches. Masterbatches are customized blends that can be mixed with commodity polymer resins during processing to improve both production efficiency and the properties of the finished product. Anti-blocking masterbatches are used in plastic films to reduce friction during processing and prevent a roll of film from sticking to itself prior to use or during use.","An effective anti-blocking masterbatch streamlines the fabrication process and improves the usability of the film to minimize waste. By customizing properties to meet customer needs, our anti-blocking masterbatches serve a wider range of end products, including agricultural films, food packing and tape.","Turning to Slide 16, let's discuss the results for our Refining segment. EBITDA for the second quarter was a negative $66 million, a $51 million decrease compared to the first quarter. We continue to demonstrate the benefits of our reliability program at the Houston refinery with crude throughput increasing to 261,000 barrels per day and operating rate at 97% of nameplate capacity for the quarter.","The Maya 2-1-1 crack spread improved significantly in April and averaged approximately $19 per barrel for the second quarter. Unfortunately, we were not able to capture the full benefit of that crack spread improvement because our refinery does not source all of its crude oil on a Maya price basis. The heavy sour crude oil processed at our refinery are sourced from Mexico, Canada and other locations.","High prices on the portion of heavy sour crude oil we buy on the open Houston market created a challenging market for our refining business during the second quarter. We continue to anticipate that margin benefit from the IMO 2020 regulations will bolster our refining results during September and October of this year.","On Slide 17, let me summarize this quarter's highlights. During the second quarter, we achieved earnings of $2.70 per share. Low feedstock costs and resilient consumer demand for our products drove EBITDA improvement in four of our six segments, resulting in an overall EBITDA increase of 11% for the quarter. Over the past 12 months, our company generated $4.6 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed to funding for increased capital investment, paying a top decile dividend, completing $1.9 billion in share repurchases and acquiring A. Schulman.","We move forward on our value-driven growth strategy by announcing the second Spherizone polypropylene project at our joint venture in Thailand, and we exhibited our disciplined approach by ending discussions regarding the potential acquisition of Braskem. We are advancing construction of our PO\/TBA facility and will commission our new Hyperzone polyethylene plant during the second half of this year.","Going forward, we expect that our business will continue to benefit from resilient consumer demand. In North America, low-cost NGL feedstocks should provide advantage for both our O&P and I&D segments.","In our I&D segment, strong oxyfuels profitability should persist for the remainder of the summer driving season, with Northwest Europe benchmark margins reaching the highest level seen since 2015. Additionally, as refining markets adopt new marine fuel regulations, we will be ready to capture improve margins with high operating rates.","Our global portfolio of businesses provides confidence in our ability to remain advantaged, resilient and poised to capture opportunities across a range of market environments.","Before we open the line for your questions, I want to make you aware of our upcoming investor event. On Tuesday, September 24, we will hold our next Investor Day here in Houston, Texas. We are planning a full day event, with a plant tour of our channel view site as well as our Houston technology center. You will have the opportunity to talk with members of our executive leadership teams and learn more about our plans for the future. Please watch your e-mail for invitations or contact our Investor Relations team for further details.","With that said, we are now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Bhavesh Patel","Good morning.","Arun Viswanathan","Just wanted to ask about the outlook for the rest of the year. You mentioned that July, you saw some improvement from the weakness in June. Conversely, polyethylene looks like there was some movement up in mid-June and then that kind of looks like it's going to recede in July, August. I mean that could be typical seasonality, too, but if you can just give us your thoughts on both the polyethylene as well as I&D and related to your earlier comments about July improvement. Thanks.","Bhavesh Patel","So Arun, I mean we've continued to see the consumer demand driving demand for our products. Where we see a little bit more tepid buying is on the industrial side. As you know, there's a lot of concern about trade and tariffs and Brexit and the direction of interest rates. Our view is that that's all causing industrial sentiment or industrial buyers to be cautious in what they buy. Having said all that, we still see in the case of polyethylene, demand growth for this year of at least 4% year-over-year. And as new supply comes on, we think that the demand is there to meet it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning, guys. A question just on your PO project. The polyurethane chain has been weak recently. When you look out, how does that impact your PO when it comes online? Do we need to see kind of an acceleration in growth in the polyurethane chain for that to be a healthy launch when that plant comes on? Can you just kind of walk through maybe how the economics look to you today versus when you pull the trigger on that plant?","Bhavesh Patel","Yes, Duffy. They haven't changed considerably. I mean it's really \u2013 what we're seeing today is a slowdown in the automotive market that we think is more temporary for a variety of reasons. Some are economic. Some are because of standards. For example, in Europe, diesel standards are changing and emission regulations are changing.","So frankly speaking and I mean I think consumers in Europe don't know today what type of car they should buy, so they're just forgoing purchases until there's more clarity in the regulatory environment around emissions and so on.","So our belief is that as the middle class grows in India, China and the rest of the world, and we think that automotive demand, although it's cyclical, longer-term, we believe that more automotive ownership and generally the middle class buying furniture and all the other things that polyurethanes go into really will underpin that investment. So our view has not changed in terms of our ability to price the product or to deliver the returns that we expect.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your lien is open.","Dylan Campbell","Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. Earlier this year, you guys talked a little bit on I&D in terms of contract improvements, maybe adding $100 million of EBITDA starting essentially around now. Have you guys have any update on those contract improvements?","Bhavesh Patel","I mean those are \u2013 Dylan, those are coming through our P&L now, and you see those in the results. And there's a lot of kind of moving parts in I&D, with styrene and methanol and so on. But I can tell you, we see it in our oxyfuels business and even more importantly, the advantaged butane especially here in the U.S. has been a really \u2013 a good positive driver for I&D earnings. So it is in the P&L.","David Kinney","Dylan, this is Dave. I would remind you of Thomas' comments around the $50 million hit that we've taken in the first half of this year related to the ITC buyer. That's primarily been felt in that segment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy","In the data that you've provided in the supplemental section of your release, it looks as though your polyethylene sales volumes declined 15% year-over-year in O&P-EAI. I know you mentioned June was soft and just wondered if you could elaborate on that. Was it due to the monthly sales patterns or did you have any operational or other issues that would explain that?","Bhavesh Patel","Yes, Kevin. Good morning. We did have some operational issues in one of our crackers, where we can't really buy ethylene to supplement. So that was most of that change in volume that you see, and some of that was just kind of managing our inventory. But most of it was unplanned maintenance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you very much, Bob. On the Hyperzone project, could you give us a little more definition on the timing of the startup and the ramp? And then also what's your view on the export markets pricing and sort of ability to move that volume? And then to which regions will you go?","Bhavesh Patel","Yes. So Vincent, we're going to start to \u2013 we're starting to get systems turned over to us now. We're not mechanically complete yet, but the commissioning process will really begin in earnest here in the coming month or two. And our idea is that we will have production in Q4 on the Hyperzone project.","In terms export markets, the way to think about it is that we're going to export from the system on the Gulf Coast, so it's not that all of the product that comes out of Hyperzone will be exported. We'll export some also from other segments.","Our early indications from what we did with customers in Europe and some in Asia was that indeed, the products that will come off of Hyperzone are expected to be unique and provide unique characteristics, for example, large-part blow molding. And so we have a very good, detailed marketing plan that includes all regions and aims to capitalize on the uniqueness of the products that come off of Hyperzone.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Bob, with Braskem not happening, are you thinking perhaps ramping up ramping up your organic growth activities? And as part of that, can you discuss maybe your ethylene strategy going forward? You've been prudent not adding ethylene capacity, but you are an ethylene company, so you might \u2013 at some point I'm sure you will. Thank you.","Bhavesh Patel","Yes. Thank you, David. First of all, as we think about organic and inorganic, our capital allocation strategy is really geared around funding organic growth from operating cash flow. And so I wouldn't make a direct tie to not pursuing Braskem with increasing our organic programs. And we'll provide more of an update at the Investor Day. But our strategy around organic growth has not changed.","After we complete PO\/TBA, we potentially can do one or two more derivative one or two more derivative plants. I actually think that our organic growth program in terms of the funds require will scale down somewhat after PO\/TBA. And we don't anticipate that changing. So I think we'll continue to strengthen balance sheet capacity for primarily in organic which as we demonstrated who quite patient.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question come P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar","Quickly on \u2013 butane was your cheapest feedstock. I mean how much max butane can you go? And was there any benefit of lower butane in oxyfuels? And then you mentioned wider NGLs. How should we think about wider NGLs? The margins there would be your regular cracker margins plus captured in frac margins. Is that the way to think about it?","Bhavesh Patel","Yes. So first of all, your question on butane really we should think about propane and butane together. We can crack up to 40% - or 40% of our ethylene can come from propane and butane. 40% of our feedslate can be propane and butane. Yes, indeed, it did benefit our oxyfuels as well especially here in the U.S. So I think there was \u2013 again, it highlights our feedstock flexibility and our ability to be resilient in a range of energy price environments.","In terms of Y-grade, we're continuing to increase our demonstration of our ability to crack Y-grade. So soon, we'll have demonstrated on four of our crackers on the Gulf Coast that we can crack Y-grade. So when ethane prices were a bit higher, Y-grade made a lot of sense for us. Today with where ethane is, ethane is far better from an economic perspective. So I think, P.J., the way to think about Y-grade is that it's one more lever in our ability to flex feedstocks to maximize value. And I think now we're very confident that we can do this at meaningful rates.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.","Hassan Ahmed","Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Patel","Good morning.","Hassan Ahmed","Bob, just wanted to focus on near-term, compare and contrast relative to the back half of last year. It just seems that in the U.S. in particular, it's exactly the opposite. You have ethane, which is [indiscernible]. You have spot ethylene, which is topping. And like you said in your prepared remarks, the scale of 30% increment, not a 30% increment but 30% of the remaining capacity that was expected between 2016 and 2019 is yet to come. So what are you guys seeing on the ground?","Bhavesh Patel","Okay. Well, there is a lot there, Hassan, so I'll kind of take it in pieces. First of all, when we think about the feedstock environment, you'll recall that even six months ago, we were concerned about another run in ethylene prices and that hasn't materialized. So why is that?","Well, first of all, there's a lot of wet gas coming out of the Permian. There's been more pipeline capacity added, more fracs have been added. We've also had the turnaround season and project delays. So all of that has led to ethane prices falling below even, frankly, our expectations.","I've had recent conversations with a couple of midstream company CEOs, and the impression I get is that there's a lot of ethane available that's going in the rejection now. It wouldn't take much of a price increase to bring that ethane out of rejection. So our view is that even with new cracker start-ups and turnaround season ending and so on, there's plenty of ethane. And we think that ethane price could perhaps return to recent levels before this latest decline, but we don't see a large runoff.","On the polyethylene side, demand is still growing at reasonably good rates globally even with the backdrop of all of these concerns that are on peoples mind. So my sense is that I don't think inventories are terribly bloated. And some confidence returning to the market could boost the operating rates and the firmness in the market.","Lastly, I think as you think through these new plants that start up, you have to remember that in our business, the supply comes on in a very lumpy fashion and demand grows over time. So generally, when I look at our business, I step back and look at quarterly operating rates and I look at annual operating rates.","And that's why taking back to the chart that was in our presentation that annual operating rates are still very high, and I think that should be a good guide in terms of how we should think about profitability. So we're very constructive even in this environment where there's a good bit of uncertainty. I think if some of this uncertainty clears, confidence will come back to markets.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Your line is open.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning, Bob and good luck with getting that uncertainty cleared up anytime soon with Brent down 7% today. Hey, listen, I was interested in your thoughts on the Exxon Baytown accident, the unfortunate accident there and what the impact might be on the propylene business. And just in general, what your outlook is for propylene into polypro.","Bhavesh Patel","Yes. So Frank, certainly, the uncertainty will have to \u2013 it won't be solved overnight, and there will be, I suspect, more news flow on that. On the Exxon fire, first of all, I was really pleased that there were no significant injuries. That's the first thing that I look for when I see incidents like that, so I'm really pleased to see that. In terms of the impact on the propylene market, it could have a modest impact. I mean, I think we need to see how this plays out, but if you look at propylene prices, they've dropped a good bit compared to where they were a year ago.","So to give you some round numbers, propylene was about $0.60 on average in Q3 last year, about $0.50 in Q4 last year, and we dropped down to $0.38 in Q1 this year and then $0.37 in Q2. So I cite all of that only to say that it seems that propylene prices are kind of \u2013 it seems they wouldn't go too much lower. And we'll have to see how this Exxon fire and their disruption impacts prices, but I would suspect there will be some modest impact.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning, guys.","Bhavesh Patel","Good morning.","Jonas Oxgaard","I want to return to your comment around the demand has been growing well this year. I find it hard to square with Asia margins now being down to four-year lows even though we haven't added any real capacity in the last six months. So what am I missing here?","Bhavesh Patel","Well, I think part of that, Jonas, is that new \u2013 well, new capacity is coming to the market over the last 12 months. And I think that buying patterns are more dynamic now than they were before because of the trade news and the tariffs and so on. But again, our perspective is that we're seeing growth in all three regions in polyolefins generally. So yes, I mean I think that this is just a reflection of oil price movements and buyers sort of anticipating the direction of prices.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay. Bob, what we've seen, though, is that demand has been declining in practically every petrochemical in Asia over the last six months. So why would polyethylene be the exception here?","Bhavesh Patel","Well, our view is that that's because of the consumer \u2013 consumable nature of a lot of the end users. And our presumption has been that for the growing middle class, you have more consumption of those sorts of end users.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Luke Washer","Hi, good morning. This is actually Luke Washer on for Steve. I was wondering if you could give us some update on the progress you've made on your footprint and headcount consolidation at A. Schulman.","Bhavesh Patel","Yes. So as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, our synergy run rate that we've captured thus far as of the end of Q2 were at about $100 million of synergy run rate. We've announced some closures of sites with \u2013 and we're working through our plans on that. And the restructuring on the business side is moving very swiftly. So we've made lots of progress.","I won't get into specifics about each site, but generally, when we announced the transaction, we said that we would reach a run rate of synergies of $150 million per year about 18 months after the transaction was completed. We're not quite at 12 months, but we're about at the 12-month point this month and we're at a run rate of $100 million. So I think we're well on track.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Alex Yefremov","Thank you. Good morning. Your refinery has been running well recently, and you have \u2013 you lost money last quarter. Is there a structural disadvantage in crude purchasing? And how long do you think it will continue? And other investments you can make to overcome this disadvantage?","Bhavesh Patel","So, on the refinery, I think you have to look at both sides of the equation, the crude side and the product side. So on the crude side, we do purchase Canadian crude by pipeline, so we processed about 25% of our crude slate in Q2 was Canadian crude.","As we buy other like crude-by-rail or other sour crudes, those do tend to be higher priced than the pipeline crude. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the way you think about our crude slate is that we don't buy all on a Maya basis.","And what we've had is a situation with Venezuela going out is that the supply of sour crude has shrunk, and with the Permian doing so well, the supply of light crude has increased, and that's what's caused this light-heavy differential to narrow.","Just to give you some idea, that light-heavy differential was about $5 per barrel in July. It should be more like $8 to $10 per barrel. It's extremely leveraging. I think the other thing that probably is not on the investors' radar is that on the product side, because the propylene prices have declined so much, that's impacted profitability. I cited of some of those numbers.","We've dropped from the $0.50 to $0.60 per pound range down into the high 30s, so that's had an impact. And lastly, at our refinery, our configuration is such that we don't convert naphtha into gasoline, but we don't have reformer. And with a lot of light crude processing in the industry, there's more naphtha available, which has impacted the price of naphtha. So I think all of this could normalize here with IMO approaching, as sour crude gets pushed back into the market and some of these product markets normalize.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts","Thank you. Bob, it seems like every earnings call has more discussion about sustainability and more of your efforts of recycling in new product. Do you have any overarching targets longer-term, say, five years, in terms of sales that you want to get to? Or any other metric you're using?","Bhavesh Patel","No, we haven't stated targets nor will we. But the idea, John, is that we do see a business model here in terms of capturing the value that exists in plastic waste, and it's going to come through in a range of forms. So it's going to be mechanical recycling. We're also doing some research on chemical recycling. And I think this is going to be a growing area for us and one that will create value over time. We\u2019ve not set hard targets. As you know, we're a very sort of return-minded company. And as we think through investments, we think about the value-creation potential on each investment. But I do see this growing in our portfolio over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.","Matthew Blair","Good morning, Bob. Maybe just to circle back to refining, it looks like DOE data indicates that your Houston refinery is running perhaps a little bit more domestic crudes this year than the same point last year. It seems some other Gulf Coast refiners are lightening up their slate over the past few years. Is that an option that you're thinking about or considering? And if so, any thoughts on what kind of spending that would take?","Bhavesh Patel","Good morning, Matthew. We have increased slightly our light crude processing. We can go up to about 10% in our light crude cracking. It would require a significant investment for us to increase the flexibility to do more than 10%, and our current plan is not to do that. So we think, again, that with IMO 2020 around the corner here, we think that some of these markets are going to normalize and move in favor of the configuration of our Houston refinery. And as I've mentioned in prior calls, we are ready to meet those specifications, and we've completed really all of our turnaround activities. So we're prepared to run at full rates through 2020.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Bob, another question on recycling. First of all, your efforts here are commendable and your QCP products that you showed look quite look. And you also have this other alliance with chemical companies and some customers about ending plastic waste. So if you take a step back and look at how recycling is playing out, how would it impact virgin plastics demand? And then maybe in recycling, could you potentially get higher margins if customers want these products?","Bhavesh Patel","Yes. So as you have several questions there and it's a very big topic for us, so I'll start with your last question, which is how customers perceive recycled product. Many of the consumer brands have announced targets of how much recycled content they will have in their packaging, so I do see demand for recycled \u2013 high-quality recycled resins increasing.","And I think what's unique about our joint venture with SUEZ is that it really combines the strength of both of the companies. So in the case of SUEZ, their waste collection infrastructure, sorting infrastructure brings to our joint venture segregated polyolefin waste, which enables high-quality recycled products. And then when you combine that with our technological know-how around polyolefins, you can see from those couple of examples that we've really created some unique and high-quality recycled products.","I think the degree to which recycled products impact virgin resin demand growth, that's something that we'll have to monitor as recycling ramps up. One of the challenges, as many of you know, is that recycling in the past has been difficult because mixed waste is the challenge and sorting has been prohibited from an economic perspective. So if the waste is very mixed coming in, then the recycled product is of very poor quality. I think that's the thing that we've been able to solve at QCP.","So I think it's something we'll have to monitor. Let me say a couple of words about The Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which you also asked about. So you'll recall that we launched this alliance at the beginning of this year in January. We've increased our membership now by 14 more companies in the last couple of months to 39 companies across the value chain.","So we have brand owners, we have chemical companies, we have waste handlers, and we have converters, and we're seeking to add retailers as well. I think what's really great is that this \u2013 we all have rallied around the thought that plastic waste has value. It's now about how do we create infrastructure and systems to collect the waste? How do we innovate so that we can use the waste and convert it to recycled products that can be reused? How do we educate consumers on how to responsibly dispose of waste so that the value can be captured?","And ultimately, the alliance will also aim to fund projects that remove waste from the environment. So we're making great progress. We had a great board meeting in July, and the momentum continues to build around The Alliance to End Plastic Waste. So thanks for that question. Okay.","Bhavesh Patel","So if there are no other questions, then let me offer a few closing remarks. First of all, the combination of our advantaged assets and consumer-driven demand for our products is generating resilient performance during somewhat uncertain times in terms of industrial demand. You can see from our quarterly results that with the portfolio of businesses that we have and our organic and inorganic growth, we're able to continue to provide strong earnings in a range of environments. I mentioned during my prepared remarks as well as during the Q&A that we continue to invest in feedstock flexibility. I think that we'll continue to strengthen our ability to do well in a range of energy and feedstock price environments.","And lastly, we talked a lot about capital allocation and our disciplined approach to capital allocation. You should continue to expect that we will focus on a strong and growing dividend over time. Our organic growth program will be modest and very disciplined. I expect that our CapEx will probably come down after the PO\/TBA project is completed. And our aim ultimately is to deliver strong and consistent value for you, our shareholders.","So with all of that said, thank you for your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you on the third quarter earnings call. In the meantime, we hope to see many of you at our Investor Day. Thank you and have a great weekend.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Doug Pike ","Thanks, Sharon. Welcome to LyondellBasell's Fourth Quarter 2014 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.

But before turning the call over to Bob, I\u2019d like to call your attention to the non-cash Lower of Cost or Market inventory adjustment that we recognized during the fourth quarter. This charge is driven by the use of LIFO accounting, our 2010 fresh start accounting as we entered the public markets and the recent declines in pricing for many of our own aw materials and finished goods inventories. And Karyn will discuss that adjustments later in the call, but the comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impact of this LCM inventory charge. With that being said, I now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Patel","Thanks, Doug. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining our earnings call. I am pleased to be here today conducting my first earnings call as the CEO of LyondellBasell. I am surely honored with along our stakeholders and I am excited about what the future holds for our great company.","I joined LyondellBasell five years ago in order to be part of the team that would deliver one of this industry\u2019s great transformations under Jim Gallogly\u2019s leadership; we\u2019ve put in place a strong work as basic philosophy and a solid foundation. I am grateful for his support and mentorship over the past five years. I\u2019m also grateful for the hard work and support of all my colleagues at LyondellBasell. We are enormously proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together thus far.","We have an excellent safety record, world-class assets, outstanding operational efficiency, a strong balance sheet and exciting growth projects underway. It\u2019s my mission to build on this success and ensure LyondellBasell continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers and pure leading value to our shareholders.","I am taking over as CEO of a company that is well positioned to excel under all circumstances. This company has an excellent foundation upon which we will build. I\u2019ll talk more at the end of this call about my approach, philosophy and strategy, but for now I would like to discuss the 2014 results. As Doug mentioned at the start of this call, a set of presentation slides accompanying the call is available on our website.","Let\u2019s take a look at Slide number 4, and review a financial highlights. The fourth quarter set a record for the period and marked the third consecutive quarter of record results with EBITDA of $2.1 billion and earnings per share of $2.48. Our EBITDA results were $578 million higher, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our annual results also set a new record. For the year, our income from continuing operations was $4.7 billion or $8.92 per share. The chart on the bottom of the page highlights the strength of our earnings and the annual growth realized over the past several years.","Within our portfolio, the fundamental drivers of our performance were unchanged. Both Olefins, Polyolefins Americas and EAI segments again achieved record results in 2014. The Intermediates and Derivatives segment continued to be a strong stable performer generating approximately $1.5 billion of EBITDA in each of the past three years. Our Refining segment EBITDA more than doubled and the Technology segment continued to generate steady and strong earnings.","I will speak more about the performance of each segment later in the call, but I first wanted to highlight a few of our 2014 accomplishments.","If you turn to Slide number 5 of the presentation, I\u2019ll begin with environmental, health and safety performance. Those of you who have followed us know of our commitment in this area. I want to assure you that under my leadership, LyondellBasell\u2019s focus on environmental, health and safety performance will not cage.","This has been and will remain our first priority; our outstanding track record can be seen in these charts. As they were last year, our results are consistent with top and solid performance. Over a five year period, our total recordable incident rates is down approximately 50% and our environmental and process safety incident rates have declined by approximately two-thirds.","While these numbers represent good progress, they are not zero, which is our ultimate objective. Performance in this area protects our people, our assets, and the communities in which we operate. We will continue to strive for perfection and this will remain our number one focus and priority.","Turning to Slide number 6, we\u2019ve outlined some of our key financial and operating accomplishments. First, let\u2019s cover our financial accomplishments. Profits during 2014 surpassed last year\u2019s record earnings. We generated $6 billion in cash flow from operations while returning $7.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","We purchased more than 63 million shares and increased our dividend by 17%. Our finance team took advantage of a favorable lending market by issuing $1 billion in 30 year bonds at favorable rates and we initiated a commercial paper program.","Turning to operating accomplishments, you\u2019ll note our outstanding operating rates. The US Ethylene operating rate remains near our nameplate capacity for the third consecutive year when normalized for the La Porte turnaround and expansion.","Our European Ethylene operating rate of 95% was 12 percentage points higher than the industry average. Our propylene oxide and refinery rates also improved year-over-year. In addition to our excellent operating rates, we increased our feedstock flexibility enabling more production from advantaged feedstocks.","In 2014, approximately 90% of our US Ethylene production was sourced from NGLs and approximately 53% of our European Ethylene production came from advantaged feeds. At our refinery, approximately 10% to 15% of our production was sourced from lower cost Canadian crude and during the second half of the year, the refinery operated at 99% of capacity.","As you know, we\u2019ve always emphasize cost control. For the sixth consecutive year, we offset inflation and maintained flat underlying fixed costs. During 2014, we executed on our growth program. In addition to operating the Channelview Methanol plant, for the full year following a free start, at the end of 2013, we delivered two significant growth projects.","The first major ethylene expansion in our growth program was completed at La Porte during last summer. This project brought online an additional 800 million pounds of annual ethylene capacity. We also commissioned an additional 200 million pounds of polyethylene capacity at our Matagorda site.","Together these projects contributed approximately $80 million to 2014 EBITDA. During 2015, we expect to realize the full year benefits from both projects. Along with completing these projects, we began construction on two other ethylene expansions in the US and we are actively developing another. We also announced that we are in the process of developing plants for our new propylene oxide plant.","Slide number 7 summarizes the impacts of our growth programs. Overall, we will increase our US ethylene capacity by 25% and global propylene oxide capacity by approximately 35%.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide number 8 and look at some of the metrics that drove our performance in 2014. Off the top of the page reported our key volumes. I want to focus your attention on our ethylene production. Over the past several years, our cracker operations have been strong and we\u2019ve been able to operate in both regions above industry average rates.","Our US data represents production after operation of our flux unit which converts ethylene into propylene. Taking into account, this ethylene consumption and our plant turnaround downtime, our US crackers again operated near our nameplate capacity of approximately 10 billion pounds.","In Europe, our crackers operated at 95% of nameplate capacity, a new record for those facilities. On the charts along the bottom of the page, you see a summary of product margin to Spreads. The indexed chart represents our internal data while the others represent industry benchmarks. The charts on the left highlights strength of the US ethylene cans and our performance and then our outperformance in Europe as we increased feedstock, flexibility and operating rates during 2013 and 2014.","On the right-hand side, we have product MTBE, and refining industry spreads. MTBE continued to deliver solid spreads during 2014. In refining, the industry Maya 2-1-1 Spreads has been fairly steady.","While we have pursued internal improvements in our operation and flexibility to adjust to the changing crude oil environment, overall these charts provide a good perspective of the margin and volume factors that helped to generate record earnings during 2014 and in each of the last three years. Perhaps most important, we captured the value that a strong market afforded through our solid operations and advantaged feedstock positions.","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks Bob. Before I review our cash performance, I thought I should help you understand the lower cost for market inventory adjustment or LCM as that it\u2019s somewhat unique.","Please turn to Slide number 9. The simple pie chart has been added to help the reason for the non-cash LCM adjustment. This adjustment impacted our reported EBITDA numbers in the fourth quarter by $715 million and by $760 million for the full year. While this may be unique to us and that\u2019s highlighted by our competitors, it must be remembered that we use LIFO accounting and our balance sheet is fabulous during mid-2010 when we reentered the public markets, but whereas at this time that our inventory was valued at market prices.","Crude oil was approximately $85 and natural gas was at $4 per MMBTU. On the right, we have included and issued prices for key raw materials and products. In the graph, you will see that at the end of each of the subsequent years crude oil ranged higher than $85 price in 2010.","The market value of our crude oil in trade was like in excess of the 2010 value. With the rapid decline of crude oil, the raw materials and finished goods pricing during the second half of 2014, GAAP accounting requires us to adjust the value of inventory held on our balance sheet show lower market prices. This is what has generated a large non-cash inventory adjustment.","If you seen the tables, there have been further declines in both raw materials and products during January. If these conditions persists, we would expect to record additional LCM adjustments during the first quarter.","Please turn to Slide number 10, as Bob already mentioned, this has been a record-setting year for both EBITDA and operating income. Olefins & Polyolefins \u2013 Americas EBITDA reached $4.2 billion for the year and grew more than $1 million per quarter. For Olefins & Polyolefins EAI exceeded $1.4 billion for the year, a mark achieved very far away just a few years ago. This performance was driven by our differentiated position and internal actions of Olefins & Polyolefins businesses.","Intermediates & Derivatives continued to deliver stability to the portfolio and segment earnings were up approximately 4% versus 2013. While we often focus on the results of Olefins & Polyolefins \u2013 Americas given its size, it is important to note that Olefins & Polyolefins EAI and Intermediates & Derivatives together generated EBITDA totaling nearly $3 billion.","As it\u2019s particularly impactful as only $432 million of capital is needed to support the operations resulting in excellent cash flow. Refining also contributed as EBITDA more than doubled from the very difficult 2013.","Please turn to Slide number 11, which provides the picture of our cash generation needs. During 2014, we generated $6 million cash from operations. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $1 billion at an average coupon rate of 4.875%. Our commercial paper borrowings ended the year at $252 million. The cash and short-term securities balance ended the year at $3 billion.","On Slide 12, you can see the $6 billion in cash from operations. This is $1.2 billion higher than 2013. This cash generation has allowed us great flexibility. And for the capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion during 2014 allowing us to progress our growth projects. We have also continued our commitment to return cash to our shareholders and you can see the significant step forward that was made during 2014.","During the last 12 months, we have returned $7.2 million for our shareholders repurchasing over 63 million shares in the process. During the past four years, we have paid dividends of $7.8 million and devoted $7.7 billion to share repurchases.","To-date, we have repurchased approximately 91 million shares since the share repurchase program began in 2013. This equates to approximately 16% to the total shares outstanding at the time the program will be initiated.","As you may recall, we are authorized to purchase 10% of our shares before the end of October 2015. Herein, we have ample cash to acquire remaining 20 million shares under this authorization. We continue to remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. There has been no change to our capital deployment or our financial policies in this regard.","So this is the beginning of the year, it is that time we\u2019ll address some of your 2015 modeling questions. Regarding capital, we are currently planning to spend approximately $1.6 million during 2015. This spending level progresses with our base statements and growth programs.","Approximately 40% is targeted toward our growth program. During 2015, major projects had good turnaround at the refineries, two propylene oxide facilities and ChannelView methanol. Majority of the growth spending will be divided between the ChannelView and Corpus Christi ethylene expansion. ChannelView expansion should be online during the second quarter and Corpus Christi is now expected to begin production during the second quarter of 2016 following a first quarter turnaround.","Our cash interest expense is expected to be approximately nearly $369 based on $6.8 million of long-term debt at an average rate of approximately 5.3%. We also expect to have $10 million of interest on our short-term facilities as well as an estimated $4 million per quarter of non-cash amortization.","During 2014, we executed $2 million of fixed to floating interest rate swaps and $2 billion of dollar to euro cross currency swaps. At year end 2014 conditions, we expect these positions to reduce our interest expense by roughly $60 million in 2015.","However this will fluctuate with underlying movements of interest and currency rates. I look forward to optimize our interest rate mix with interest rate swaps. We also expect to continue our short-term investment strategy which is based on ensuring the safety and prioritization of our investors. This strategy provided over $30 million in interest income in 2014.","However this line of income changed depending on the level of interest rates and cash that is invested. And depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.2 billion during 2015. We plan to make regular pension contributions that totaled approximately $110 million and estimate pension expense of approximately $55 million.","We currently expect a 2015 effective tax rate of approximately 26%. The cash tax rate is expected to be somewhat lower. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bob for a further discussion of our business results.","Bob Patel","Thanks Karyn. As mentioned previously in my discussion of business results will be in regard our underlying business results excluding the impacts of this LCM inventory charge.","Let\u2019s discuss segment performance beginning on Slide number 13 with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas. Excluding the LCM charge, fourth quarter EBITDA was $1.3 billion, $72 million greater than the third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $4.2 billion, an outstanding year. Relative to the third quarter, ethylene margins were unchanged. The decline in pricing of approximately $0.06 per barrel was offset by a lower cost of ethylene production.","Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter averaging 97%. The additional La Porte capacity was fully online during the quarter that operated nearly at full capacity. 73% of our production was from ethylene and 88% came from NGLs. The differential between ethylene and propylene prices allowed us to profitably operate our flex unit throughout the quarter. This added approximately $19 million to our results.","In Polyolefins, our polyethylene\u2019s price expanded by approximately $0.04 per pound, while the polypropylene\u2019s price was up approximately $0.01 per pound. Polyethylene volumes decreased by approximately 6%. Polypropylene experienced a sales volume decline of approximately 14% due to holiday slowdowns and some late December customer destocking.","For the full year, results surpassed 2013 by $617 million primarily due to higher Olefins and polyethylene results. Olefin results benefited from higher prices due to tight industry supply for much of the year as well as a lower cost of ethylene. Polyolefin\u2019s results showed the greatest improvement increasing $530 million versus the prior year as PDE volumes and Spread over ethylene improved significantly.","Overall, 2014 was an excellent year. Industry fundamentals were strong. Our crackers continued to operate reliably near nameplate capacity and we normalized for the La Porte turnaround. We also completed the La Porte ethylene expansion and began realizing financial benefits of that production.","In January, ethylene price margins have come off their record highs as prices in the market have followed crude oil lower. We continue to see natural gas prices below $3 per million BTU and NGL prices have been weak as inventories have reached record high levels.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide number 14 and review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and international segments. During the fourth quarter underlying EBITDA was $392 million or $49 million higher than the third quarter. For the full year, underlying EBITDA was $1.4 billion, a $571 million increase versus 2013.","Olefin\u2019s results increased versus the third quarter by approximately $70 million, as a result of the lower cost of net debt, more than offset declining ethylene prices, polyolefin results decreased on lower volumes as sales decreased approximately 3% to 4%.","Our Polypropylene Compounding and Polybutene-1business results modestly declined due to lower sales volumes. Seasonal declines of this magnitude are typical in Polyolefins, Polybutene-1 one and Polypropylene Compounds. Equity income from JVs was relatively unchanged. For the full year, segment results increased by $571 million. Olefin\u2019s results increased by approximately $260 million. This increase is largely the result of lower cost of ethylene as a result of lower naphtha costs, increased advantage feedstock processing and higher production.","We operated our crackers at 95%, approximately 12 percentage points higher than industry rates. The benefit associated on advantaged feeds totaled approximately $220 million. Our Polyolefin results increased approximately $235 million year-on-year reflecting improved sales than higher volume in polyethylene.","Polypropylene Compounding and Polybutene-1 results were relatively unchanged versus 2013. Equity income from our joint ventures increased by $55 million. 2014 also benefited from the $52 million environmental settlement that was recognized during the first quarter, while 2013 benefited from a $25 million insurance settlement.","2014 was a record year for the O&P EAI segment. We are realizing significantly better results following the challenging two years of restructuring and difficult market conditions. Having worked with this team over the last four years, I am very proud of their accomplishments. Their value-oriented approach to markets, focus on feedstock flexibility and restructuring activities ahs enabled this performance improvements surpassing $1.4 billion of EBITDA is an achievement worth calling out.","During January, prices continue to adjust to a changing raw material environment. January orders are in line with normal all the quarter activity and our margins and operating rates have been resilient. JVs related earnings are anticipated to moderate consistent with the lower global polyolefin prices.","Now please turn to Slide number 15 for a discussion of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $364 million, a decline from the third quarter of $19 million. For the full year, the segment generated EBITDA of nearly $1.6 billion and $60 million more than 2013.","The quarterly decline was attributable to lower propylene oxide and derivatives following a strong third quarter. In our Intermediate Chemicals business, EBITDA increased approximately $10 million, as strength in our results from declining benzene more than offset the decline in key four chemicals resulting from seasonal impacts and scheduled maintenance.","As the Oxyfuels results were relatively unchanged and Oxyfuels results were lower by approximately $10 million. The impact of lower gasoline prices and its typical seasonal declines were partially offset by tight Oxyfuels markets. Declining raw material costs and strong obtained premiums during October and November.","The full year 2014 increase versus 2013 reflects strength and stability in our propylene oxide business and increased contribution from our expanded methanol business. You\u2019ll recall that the methanol and the ChannelView was restarted during December 2013.","While this asset has not won LyondellBasell\u2019s standards, it did contribute to our earnings and remains a sound investment for the segment. The ChannelView methanol plants ran at 68% utilization rate during 2014 and was a primary driver of a $175 million EBITDA improvement in the acetyls business.","Oxyfuels\u2019 results decreased by approximately $30 million versus 2013. Volume and product mix were the primary drivers. Our gasoline and octane premiums have supported the business for most of the year. The New Year has started with a little change in propylene oxide market as the supply and demand fundamentals have remained strong. Oxyfuel prices have moderated, as crude oil and gasoline prices continue to decline. However, Spreads are in line with norms.","Methanol prices have also come under some pressure. During the first quarter, we will be conducting scheduled maintenance on ChannelView methanol plant. Based on January margins, we estimate that this will impact segment results by approximately $20 million versus production at full rates.","Let\u2019s move to slide number 16 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $33 million, a decline of $77 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $409 million of EBITDA, an increase of $227 million versus 2013.","During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 Spread averaged $17.72 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 266,000 barrels per day at our refineries. Spreads at the refinery declined less than the nearly $7 decline in the Maya 2-1-1. The lower Maya Spread was primarily driven by gasoline. The refinery benefited as the negative spread between secondary product values and crude oil price declines. The cost of RINs during the quarter were relatively unchanged from the third quarter. 2014 saw improvement in the Refining segment. Crude throughput averaged 259,000 barrels per day, up 27,000 barrels from 2013.","2013 included a turnaround on a crude unit and a co-product. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark increased by approximately $1.50 per barrel to average $24 per barrel. Cost of RINs decreased by approximately $20 million during the year.","Thus far in 2015, the Maya 2-1-1 Spreads averaged approximately $19 per barrel. There is no major maintenance planned at our refinery during the first quarter. We received our initial shipments of Canadian crude through the Enbridge Flanagan South Pipeline system late during the fourth quarter. These volumes should increase across the first quarter.","Turning to Slide number 17, let\u2019s step back from the details and think about the business environment more broadly. Over the fourth quarter \u2013 overall, the fourth quarter and 2014 were record periods while margins have eased our positions remain advantaged. Importantly, we continue to generate strong earnings and cash flow.","We started the New Year beginning the new chapter in the life of LyondellBasell. While this is a new chapter and many teams will sound familiar, first, we\u2019ll always be committed the safe and reliable operations. Safety is our first priority and it\u2019s a part of our core values as evidenced by our top safety performance.","We will also continue to pursue operational excellence focusing on running our world-class assets reliably and efficiently. During 2015, we should benefit from the increased production at La Porte, we anticipate the completion of the expansion of ChannelView and new volumes beginning in the second quarter.","We also expect improved operating rates from the ChannelView methanol unit in 2015 following the first quarter maintenance. Cost management will continue to be part of our everyday operations. I believe that our fixed cost should not vary depending on the business cycle. Our structure and resources are designed to function well under a range of industry conditions. Our costs did not escalate during this times when we don\u2019t expect to end very much in difficult times.","We\u2019ve built the company to deliver differential results for our shareholders at all business climates. My goal is to leverage this strong foundation and to build upon it. While we anticipate that US ethylene margins will ease to a record 2014 levels consistent with lower oil and gas prices they remain relatively strong. In fact, IHF estimates current ethylene margins to remain above $0.25 per pound.","Our business continues to generate significant recessionary cash over and above of our capital program and dividends. The returns on our growth program continue to be excellent and our projects are generating earnings today.","We\u2019ve greatly reduced our share count and continue to repurchase shares. Furthermore, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet allowing us to pursue both our expansion plans and other opportunities if and when the timing is right.","I look forward to leading this team into 2015 and beyond as we continue to build momentum across the company. Before we open the line for questions, I wanted to make you aware of our upcoming Investor Day. Our executive team will be conducting this session in April 29 in New York. We tentatively planning for the meeting to occur between 8 AM and 1 PM. We will be finalizing the details and we will notify you of the location in the coming weeks. Please plan to join us for the event.","We are now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you and, Bob, congratulations on your new position.","Bob Patel","Thank you, PJ. Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar","Good morning. And, as you make your mark on the company, I would like to know how do you think about \u2013 has build efficiency and what it mean by that is, you can build the new plants or expand an existing plant or in buy in, you can buy in your existing businesses or in some \u2013 so just, sort of take a step back and tell us how do you think about all the decisions?","Bob Patel","Well, PJ, when I think about buy versus build, we really have to step back and look at free cash flow deployment. So how do we think about our free cash flow deployment and our balance sheet. First of all, our priorities are to maintain our existing assets in top condition. So our maintenance capital is a high priority to us, then our current dividend is also a priority. Beyond that, our focus as has been in the past it should have a stable and growing regular dividend, to have a good focus on growth plans \u2013 on CapEx to the extent that we still have opportunities and then share repurchases. We still see our shares has being a compelling value. We still see the ethylene advantage as being live and well. And we see a bright future for our company. In terms of M&A, we have to compete M&A \u2013 competes with all of these other priorities and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate all of our options as we carry forward the strategy of our company.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you. And then secondly, there were lot of talk about at the exports and capital being deployed there. With the recent change in the NLG complex, how do you see exports of NGLs or exports of raw materials out of the US? Thank you.","Bob Patel","Well, exports of ethane is probably a little bit different than exports of propane and butane. At today\u2019s crude oil price, ethane exports will look less attractive, but over the long run as we have mentioned, in prior calls that there are crackers in Europe and perhaps some in Asia who are uniquely placed to import ethane and benefit from those imports. We don\u2019t expect this to be a very broad sort of program. It\u2019s specific for a few crackers. In the case of propane, propane exports have been increasing. But here in the US, we still see a significant amount of propane supply and ethane supply. Ethane rejection levels today are 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day. So while ethane exports and NGL exports in general will be persistent in the market. We don\u2019t expect those to change the outlook of the US ethylene advantage.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your line is open.","John McNulty ","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and again congratulations on the new role. When I look at Lyondell, we see you are at levels where you are industry leader in terms of profitability, you are industry leader in terms of safety levels and yet in some of the opening comments and in the release, you had indicated you want to the take the company to the next level. So I guess, I am wondering, how do you think about what the next level is, whether it\u2019s more cash to shareholders or M&A or new platforms being added on. I guess, how should we be thinking about what the next level is in your mind?","Bob Patel","Well, thanks John. First of all, when I think about what gets us to the next level, our focus has to be in the near term on running what we have today as well as we possibly can. That enables a generation of free cash flow which affords us to have the opportunity I think about the other items you mentioned that\u2019s just been the job here less than 30 days. We are going to build out our strategy, we are going to work with the Board to discuss an array of options, organic growth, no other growth options that maybe available to us, we\u2019ll develop that over time. But we do see these share repurchases as being a continued focus. We\u2019re likely to ask our shareholders to approve another share repurchase program after this one from this course in May, June. So share repurchases will continue to be something that you will see from us. In addition to that, we will build out our strategy and think about other ways to take the company to the new level.","John McNulty ","Great, thanks for the color. And then I guess, the second question, you indicated \u2013 as far as your fixed cost you don\u2019t really see that changing all that much and I guess, when we look and we see crude prices getting cut in half and commodity prices rolling over, I guess, are there things that you or Lyondell can do to help to weather this? Are there actions that we should be thinking about that you\u2019ll be taking going forward, or is it pretty much you are going to live and die to some degree what the commodity prices actually do?","Bob Patel","Well, first of all, I would remind you that we\u2019ve gone through a fairly significant cost reduction program following 2009 and 2010. And I can tell you that the culture of our company as we don\u2019t wait for prices to change our costs. We manage our cost tightly in good times and in bad times and while we don\u2019t have a program that we are running through the company at the moment, we have opportunities to incrementally improve our cost structure whether it\u2019s in \u2013 more in specific sites, or in specific businesses, those are things that we pursue everyday and we\u2019ll continue to do that for the rest. Our job is to be nimble from a commercial standpoint as these markets are dynamic and continue to run our assets as reliably and safely as possible. We think that that is - that\u2019s our formula and it has been effected \u2013 it will be effected in the future.","John McNulty ","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMC. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas ","Hi, good morning. I was wondering, Bob, over the next five years, what do you think is the probability that Lyondell might make a significant acquisition. Do you think it go downstream or complement its upstream operations?","Bob Patel","Well, Jeff, it\u2019s a good question and I want to make sure I don\u2019t get ahead of my board and ahead of the team that works together with me here at LyondellBasell. And but certainly, we are going to build out our strategy, we are going to continue the evolution of our company. We think about where we\u2019ve come from, we\u2019ve gone from a company that was really focused on day-to-day survival in 2009 and 2010 to a company that got its cost structure right put in place incredibly strong operating discipline which enabled the free cash flow that we enjoy today. We\u2019ve reached the benefits of internal organic growth opportunities. We still have many ahead of us which we simply can\u2019t lose our focus on those. There is some fairly big projects that are underway and then, of course, as we mine those, we\u2019ll then think about the next steps in terms of strategies. So you will hear more from us as time goes on and we\u2019ll share a bit more with you when we come up to New York for Investor Day. But, think about going through an evolution is most companies has built through and we\u2019ve come a long way and I think we have a long way to go.","Jeff Zekauskas ","Thank you. And my follow-up, the price of oil has been bouncing around between $45 and $55 a barrel on a Brent basis and if you go back in time, maybe back to the 2008, 2009 recession, the North American ethylene price was in the high 20s, rather than in the high 30s. And of course, ethylene can always fluctuate crude oil the direction it goes with it. Do you have any thoughts on why ethylene is as high as it is given the current Brent price?","Bob Patel","Well, generally in our markets, Jeff, the cost part of the equation tends to fall faster than the price part of the equation. Having said that, we have lot to do with how fast and how dynamic prices move. Today, operating rates are relatively high all over the world and when we think about inventories in the value chain they are relatively low. Crude price has been dropping for the better part of 60 days. Based on our past experience in 2008 and 2009, all the participants in the value chain had a propensity to reduce inventory quickly because it did values everyday. We think that\u2019s kind of run its course. As we see here today in January, and as crude oil prices perhaps stabilize and there is an indication of a bottom likely, we are going to see some inventory replenishment and we are going to see a seasonal uptick in demand as we move into March, April, May timeframe. But I think all those factors point to a net positive picture from a demand standpoint. Operating rates are reasonably good. So, and on that slide, perhaps you haven\u2019t seen the kind of impact on ethylene price. And the other thing I would say is that the price of ethane is more tied to gas than it is to oil. So here, as I mentioned earlier, the ethane supply demand indicates that there is an abundance of ethane and rejection levels have reached as high as 400,000 barrels a day. So there is plenty of ethane, there is lots of propane here to compete with ethane to get into the cracker and frankly, we don\u2019t see that changing in the near term.","Jeff Zekauskas ","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Bob Koort ","Thanks and welcome back to Houston, Bob. I guess, here a month into the job, you got one of the top three performing chemical stocks. So you are certainly a pretty good President. Couple questions for you. One on \u2013 I think you guys have said in aggregate you are going to add maybe 2 billion pounds your US ethylene capacity and maybe 1 billion pounds of polyethylene. I am just curious what your approach is to being a merchant seller or how you view being long or short olefins versus polyolefins as we look to all the capacity additions that are coming into the industry over the next three or four years?","Bob Patel","Well, we are a significant merchant player today and we\u2019ll likely be a merchant player in the future in the ethylene market. Our expansions in terms of ethylene, so we\u2019ve got the La Porte one up and running at 800 million. We have the next ChannelView expansion in Q2 of 2015. We have Corpus Christi in Q2 of 2016 and the ChannelView, another ChannelView expansion in 2017. In total, we\u2019ll add about 2.3 billion pound to 2.4 billion pounds. Part of that is to fully support the assets we have on the ground today. You have to remember we also have a flux unit which produces propylene which consumes a significant amount of ethylene. So our options in terms of future integration of ethylene, we could build more polyethylene, we could build another flux unit. We continue to evaluate those options. But I do expect us to be a reasonable size merchant seller of ethylene as well. We feel with those three options, I think we have a reasonable amount of potential to supply new ethylene that will come online.","Bob Koort ","If I might ask another sort of longer term question, I was at a presentation yesterday by one of your soon to be new polyethylene competitors and they talked about maybe placing two-thirds of their polyethylene output into the export markets which will be a dramatic increase from the rates that the US exports today. What\u2019s your sense on volatility of the industry as all these new units come on over the next few years and the need to export and rely more on the export markets for off-take, is that something that creates a greater risk or what\u2019s your sense of that might develop?","Bob Patel","I am not sure about it, that presents risk. Maybe you step back and look at the supply demand outlook for ethylene globally. The US is really the only region that\u2019s having significant amount of ethylene capacity. You don\u2019t see a lot of this in Asia. Asia is more focused on coal-based propylene or PDH-based propylene and there are some crackers but not significant. In Europe, there really is, there are many expansions. So we think about global demand growth of ethylene and you think about the amount of ethylene expansion here in the US, the two match up relatively \u2013 and so we have the Middle East adding ethane-based ethylene production. We do have some mix feed crackers there that are planned with \u2013 being one of them. But, I really see America as being the next exporter of ethylene to support global demand growth and therefore I think prices will equilibrate to kind of international arbitrage and the product will be placed. So, it\u2019s only natural that more product will be exported to meet the demands for the rest of the world.","Bob Koort ","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Arun Viswanathan ","Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great year and those in the management of Bob as well to you. I guess, my first question was on polyethylene and polypropylene. You guys went through some late December destocking in polyolefins. Is it your sense that some of that has run its course? I think you mentioned that as well and what\u2019s your outlook, I guess, for the next six months or so and how that continues?","Bob Patel","Well, thanks, Arun for your kind words. In terms of the inventory downstream, I think that across the world, whether you talk about Asia or Europe or US, the inventory in the value chain is on the low end of normal range. And I think buyers are looking to see \u2013 looking for signs of a bottom in prices and in crude oil and as I mentioned earlier, if you think about some level of restocking coupled with a seasonal uptick in demand, going into the next few months, I am relatively bullish about the demand outlook globally on polyolefins. And I think that will carry its way through at least June.","Arun Viswanathan ","Okay, thanks. And I guess, my next question is on cash flow in the balance sheet. First, do you expect a working capital benefit in 2015? And then, on your buybacks, you mentioned that in the past conversations that you would consider repurchasing up to 10% of your shares, is that still something you are considering and cash flow is lower, would you reduce use you commercial paper or other sources to make that happen? Thanks.","Karyn Ovelmen","With regards to the working capital, we do expect to see kind of the continued trend in terms of pricing and in course you\u2019ll see our receivables coming down faster than our payables and so, it will be one of our consistent trend there as we head into the first quarter. With regards to the next 10%, we\u2019ve completed the existing 10% tranch that we are working through right now by May and start to indicate our expectation is that we would look for authorization approval from the shareholders at the next Shareholders Meeting for another 10%. And in terms of funding that, we have consistently been using the balance sheet, we\u2019ve been raising debt as well using discretionary cash flow beyond our working capital, our growth CapEx and our dividend needs to fund that program. We have always said we want to season into this investment grade space into the strong triple D. We\u2019ve been doing that and we are aware that there are opportunities there, it\u2019s indeed we need to fund the next tranch and supplement that with our free cash flow as we go through the next 12 months or so.","Arun Viswanathan ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Sir, your line is open.","Vincent Andrews ","Thank you and good morning everyone. Probably, I was wondering if I could ask a bit on the demand side of the equation, the GDP multiplier for ethylene is kind of the kind of spec around one is slightly below one for, kind of the post financial crisis period. In prior times, when we think of lower oil prices and lower plastics prices the multiplier has been higher, what is your view on demand, if we are going to stay lower oil prices and consequently lower plastic prices and I guess, the second part of the question would be do you think it's possible that demand drives us into a ethylene sort of super cycle, if you will?","Bob Patel","Well, from a demand standpoint, Vincent, I think, we should think about demand improving based on lower oil price and as emerging markets continue to consumer more polyolefins per person. So, those trends I think are still in place. I am not sure if I am ready to declare some sort of super cycle at this point. But I do think demand will improve incrementally and again, I would point you to, especially in polyethylene or ethylene and derivatives look and see how much new capacity is coming outside of the US and there is not that much. So, we could see, reasonably high operating rates over a longer period of time. But we will have to watch all this and see how demand evolves.","Vincent Andrews ","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open.","David Begleiter ","Thank you and Bob, congratulations as well. Hey, Bob, just on your ability to crack propane butane in the Unites States, I was - thought you may have cracked actually more in Q4 than you actually did. Can you talk about why that was the case and potentially going forward for increasing propane and butane crack?","Bob Patel","Thanks, Dave. We are known for here in the US is our feedstock flexibility and so, we can crack ethane, propane, butane, we can even crack heavy liquids. But we\u2019ve changed our cracker profile over the past that our cracking profile over the past three four years. We\u2019ve not given up a lot of our flexibility, but what part of that does is, we can\u2019t crack a lot of any one thing. But as you look at where relative propane and ethane prices has been, we\u2019ve been able to capture the value of the NGL barrels being advantaged. And so, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s held us back. It might have some competitors who can crack a lot more propane than we can. But I would tell you that we have industry-leading flexibility which I think will service over the long run.","David Begleiter ","Very good, and just on the refinery, Bob, can you give us your thoughts or philosophy and how that business fits into Lyondell in the near, medium and longer term?","Bob Patel","Well, when I think about more broadly any of our assets, I expect that every asset should realize its full potential. It got to run well and the refinery has certainly made great strides in that area. They have to outperform their peers and our refining is \u2013 probably I think this area as well and more to go we\u2019ve identified many more improvement areas and Kevin and his team are working diligently to realize that potential. We are likely \u2013 all of our businesses at a minimum have to generate positive cash flow and the refinery is doing that. So - and looking forward, we see some potential upside from Canadian crude moving to Houston, we are already realizing some of that to Flanagan South Pipeline and we expect that more of that in full year 2015. So, I still see potential there. The refining business is challenging and we know that, but, we are going to continue to work this asset and make sure it realizes its full potential.","David Begleiter ","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust. Go ahead. Your line is open.","James Sheehan ","Thank you. Could you give me your outlook for MTBE raw material margins over the next twelve months?","Bob Patel","Yes, I think, generally, butane looks to be favored, butane is abundantly available, especially going into the summer months. Recently when I was in Europe, and we were getting butane at prices we haven\u2019t seen in many, many years. Here in the US the same. So, our view is that it\u2019s part of the broader NGL story and we think butane will be abundant and we will contribute to the profitability of our MTBE business going forward.","James Sheehan ","Thank you and also, as you added towards condo crackers change in the low oil price environment?","Bob Patel","Well, we are always open to considering different contracts and options. But as you know, we have a strong list of projects in front of us and as I mentioned earlier in the call, 2.3 billion pounds to 2.4 billion pounds of ethylene expansion. Beyond that, we are always open to considering other projects, but we have enough on our plates and we want to execute well and let\u2019s see what\u2019s ahead of us.","James Sheehan ","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer","Yes, good morning. I want to jump to Europe if we could, your operating rates relative to the industry were outstanding, but do you see others trying to imitate you and going more to NGLs and basically reducing their cost so that you might have to run more in line with industry averages over the next couple of years?","Bob Patel","Good morning, Duffy. Well, in Europe, the landscape is a little different than the US, because each cracker has its own set of circumstances given that there are \u2013 there isn\u2019t a robust logistics ethylene system or feedstocks and for products. So, lot of the crackers in Europe, they are tied to the neighboring refinery and often the ownership is the same. So while they might aspire to crack more propane or more butane, their peak rate maybe more fixed given location and ownership structure and those kind of things. So, incrementally, the industry over there likely will crack a bit more propane. But I don\u2019t see that materially impacting our operating rates or our ability to leverage propane and butane there.","Duffy Fischer","Okay, and then another one around Europe, is the Middle East can basically ship products to Europe or Asia and there is kind of a swing factor, do you see lower oil changing the competitive balance between Asia and Europe as a home for Middle Eastern product?","Bob Patel","Well, those are the two most natural destinations and over time, generally they tend to come in where the Middle East could be a different. I will tell you that the Asian market is easier to serve than is the European market and it\u2019s some more natural destination for Middle East product. We\u2019ll also have to watch the euro dollar exchange rate as the euro weakens, Asia could look like a more attractive export destination. And likely, European buyers are more sophisticated at times require more higher end products and so on. Typically, not the kind of products we would produce in large facility in the Middle East. So, a lot of factors that point through Asia being the more likely destination of the Middle East exports.","Duffy Fischer","Great, thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Aleksey Yefremov","Good morning. I wanted to come back to MTBE. Is there any reason why for MTBE would be weaker in 2015 versus 2014, perhaps there would be less demand for octane or any other reason?","Bob Patel","Hi, Aleks. I think, when you think of MTBE, you have to remember really what it is, right it is basically it\u2019s high octane gasoline component. It would be \u2013 no sulfur, it seem very well into the environment. So it\u2019s going to see ups and downs based on octane demand, operating rates and things like that. But generally what you find in here is, you have a market where octane engine demand, there is a number of higher wafer pressure, lower octane materials available in the forms of \u2013 refrains in the US. And MTBE is a natural blending component around the world. So, I think you see a solid market. Or you basically have another gas to oil situation in which butane price, butane inventories are as long as they have which responded to the lower level price oil environment. And our continued volumes are good","Aleksey Yefremov","Great, thank you. And as a follow-up, turning to Olefins and Polyolefins, are there any meaningful annual contracts that repriced this year through the annual contracts that could benefit you in 2013? For example, we saw that polypropylene contracts were reported as being more advantageous to producers this year? Is there anything like that going on in polyethylene or ethylene?","Bob Patel","No, there is really nothing significant there we\u2019d call out here.","Aleksey Yefremov","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy ","Yes, good morning. Can you speak to the extent to which you r long-term view of US NGL supply may have changed given the collapse in crude and the impact on drilling activity. I guess, I\u2019m kind of interested in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe given the probability that the early wave crackers start-up and our understanding is somebody ethane exports have take or pay contracts. Just wondering if you can see a rebalance sooner than you previously did and if so, whether or not that will impact your capital allocation beyond late 2017 in your Channelview project there?","Bob Patel","Good morning, Kevin. We haven\u2019t changed our view on ethane supply demand longer term. In the near-term the market will go through a bit of transition. As you\u2019ve probably read, as all have read there, it\u2019s been a pretty significant response on the supply side and oil. Most of the majors have announced 30% to 50% caught on their CapEx budgets, while our E&P companies have announced cut as well. Likely, this will \u2013 to the response in oil price, I can\u2019t tell you when likely that will happen and longer term, we think the US will continue to be a strong producer of natural gas at NGLs and we don\u2019t see the availability of ethane materially changing. And the answer to your question about the capital program, I don\u2019t have any price to adjust to our capital program based on the current market condition in terms of our growth plans on ethylene. We are going to continue on the path we are on, we are going to continue both ChannelView expansions and the Corpus Christi expansion.","Kevin McCarthy ","Okay. And then a follow-up if I may on the issue of destocking and restocking I suppose. If I look at the volume numbers that you have on slide 13 and 14, it looks like the sequential volume decrement for whatever reason was a lot larger in the Americas versus Europe, just curious as to why that might be the case and whether or not you're seeing different behavior along the lines of inventory management in the two regions?","Bob Patel","We are not seeing anything that\u2019s really different or unusual. The metrics might, seeing sort of a normal end of season decline. As I have mentioned, we saw little bit of a slowdown in buying which we think is some destocking with it. But overall, we are not seeing a big reaction to the pricing and I don\u2019t see anything different across either of the two regions and both are really pretty good line and pretty difficult of what we\u2019ve seen at year end.","Kevin McCarthy ","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Frank Mitsch ","Yes, hi good morning folks, and let me also offer my congratulations, Bob, on the new position. Hey, first a clarification, as I am looking at the slide 9, you talked about polyethylene being down $0.05 in January versus December here in the US. And I guess I was hearing in certain circles that it was only down $0.04. Can you clarify what - where did the industry settle?","Bob Patel ","The industry settled at $0.04.","Frank Mitsch ","Alright, great. And then in terms of the new projects, your predecessor laid out that the ChannelView expansion would probably be contributing on an annual basis $90 million of EBITDA and the Corpus Christi expansion, that\u2019s going to be adding about $300 million of EBITDA, once everything was fully up and running and obviously that was at a level the oil wasn\u2019t really higher than it is today. How should we think about those projects in terms of what the ultimate contributions can be? And then, I also noted I think on Corpus Christi, originally that was supposed to come up late 2015 and now it looks like it\u2019s going to be coming up in the second quarter 2016? Was there anything behind the move to delay that expansion?","Doug Pike","Hi, Frank, this is Doug. Let\u2019s first talk about the contribution, I mean, it\u2019s still 800 million pound expansion. So we see the margins at over the market turns out to be, think of where we are now is perhaps is showing ethylene margins at over $0.25 a pound. So, we\u2019ll see where things move in this world that we are in where things are moving up and down a little bit right now. But, regardless, on the way it settles very strong, rather it\u2019s going to be a 2013, impossible for us to say at this juncture. Now as far as the timing of Corpus, what we\u2019ve done is, we are going to do our turnaround in the first quarter at Corpus and as you can understand we are making a significant increase in the capacity and we tied a lot of new equipment. So we have to start the expansion with the turnaround. So with new turnaround in the first quarter, that will contribution be bring up the expansion in the second quarter. It\u2019s very much like we do that report. It\u2019s just a matter of framing, Frank.","Frank Mitsch ","All right, terrific. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Don Carson ","Yes, thank you, I want a discussion of where ethylene margins might go, but can you also talked about polyethylene over ethylene spreads is your chart on page 8 shows it widen considerably in the US in the last few years. What drove that and where do you see that heading over the next one to two years?","Bob Patel ","Well, part of what drove that, Don in the past years is just supply demand. The market has been very strong in the US and we haven\u2019t had expansions here in quite some time. So, market dynamics are very good here. In the near term, I think demand as I mentioned earlier should be incrementally better as we work through the year with the restocking as well as some seasonal uptick in demand. Longer term, our prices in the US tend to be and will be more so in the future tied to export equivalents and so on, especially more for the commodity products. And there again with the wide crude to gas ratio and abundance of ethane here in the US, American producers should enjoy a reasonably good margin.","Don Carson ","So it doesn't sound like you are in the bear camp that there was spreads and there was lot of controversy over the whether those spreads are sustainable or not to appreciate that color. And then finally, if you can just clarify, obviously with a lot of plants in the US you consume a lot of natural gas just as a fuel for those plants. Just ignoring the feedstocks out of the equation, what's kind of your exposure to the decline in natural gas that we've been seeing in the US?","Bob Patel ","We certainly b benefited from the natural gas price dropping some \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Doug if we have a number.","Doug Pike","Utilities typically for us across all the facilities, a dollar in gas can be about $250 million in utilities that\u2019s including the refinery and the crackers et cetera.","Don Carson ","Okay, thanks Doug.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Advisors. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Hassan Ahmed ","Hi there, Bob. There were obviously a couple of questions earlier about, I guess, the resilience of ethane prices in light of declining crude. I would imagine one of the reasons for that would be significantly lower co-product value contributions, right? And I would imagine again in particular propylene. So just wanted to hear your views about the near to medium term outlook for propylene prices, particularly keeping in mind how you're running, crackers in Europe pretty hard, as well as a fair amount of call it PDH as well as methanol to propylene capacity coming online?","Bob Patel ","Yes, good morning Hassan. When you think about propylene in the US, they were net short on a capacity basis, our derivatives ability to consume propylene and the amount of propylene that's produced. And our propylene prices already corrected significantly in the past couple of months. And as methane and propane compete be in the lay for crackers, the amount of propylene supply will vary. My sense is that, at these prices, propylene is on the low end. But we'll just have to see how supply demand plays out. But just remember that there is more consumption capacity of propylene at the moment than there is production capacity.","Hassan Ahmed ","And as a follow-up, one of the things I sort of read in your press release was, in terms of 2015 goals improving your performance on the methanol side of things. Just wanted to get a sense of why they were deflated operating rates to the course of 2014 on the methanol side? Where you see operating roots going for the course of this year, particularly in light of significantly lower methanol prices as well?","Bob Patel ","Well, you\u2019ll recall that that\u2019s methanol plant was idle for many, many years and we restarted it. So, generally, when you restart units that have been idle for that long, if I am going to discover things as we restarted up and we need to on \u2013 and quite frankly, we got this project done quickly and we came back and found that we need group few things and we\u2019ve done that. So we\u2019ll do that here in Q1. Having said all that, that is still an incredibly profitable project for us providing very strong returns and so we have to work through a few of the things last year. For this year, we expect based on our view on natural gas and our methanol prices that running at full rates will be the right thing to do this year given our outlook on margins. And so we expect to run after the first quarter maintenance activity to run at full rates.","Hassan Ahmed ","Super. Thank you so much, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts ","Can you hear me now?","Operator","Yes.","John Roberts ","Congratulations, Bob. Karyn, do we have to worry about foreign exchange at all in 2015 or most of your US exports in dollars and European margins basically adjust to a US dollar equivalent quickly?","Karyn Ovelmen","I think that\u2019s basically right. So our gross transaction exposure. That essentially, the majority of that will have \u2013 50% of that transaction exposure really has financial offset and the remaining exposure is generally netted to our FX derivatives. So the exposure to the combination, there are lot of factors. Substantially it\u2019s due to our naphtha purchases in Europe. Our ID business also played well and our imports in US in US dollars and euro purchases, sell-through euro entities in dollars and MTBE, styrene, butane feedstocks. And it is in our catalyst \u2013 the business which is in US dollar related for dollar euro companies. So though we got a total FX exposure, half of that is internal offsets and remaining that net amount is hedged externally. We do have translation impacts in the balance sheet. And we always see that, but that related to another P&L impact that does with other comprehensive income. And as we are closer to getting the number this year, it\u2019s only 1.38 to 1.21 year-over-year, so there is about 639 reduction on shareholders\u2019 equity, but that is surely with balance sheet only. And then on a translation perspective, it will turn another ratio play out. But year-over-year to 2014, we really didn\u2019t have any significant impact. So, we were at 1.33 for the average to the last year, be 84 and then 1.33 in 2014. So overall, the translation on a P&L\u2019s perspective, there was very minimal impact.","John Roberts ","Thank you.","A \u2013 Doug Pike","I think we have one \u2013 take one more question. We are probably little bit over time. It's being Bob's first opportunity to speak to you, but I think we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Nils Wallin ","Great, thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon. I know, Lyondell has been pretty - saying that there is some expectation in all the new builds and the US could get pushed out just because of the normal length of time it takes to build these plants. Now with more oil, there might be less desire to push these plants as quickly as possible, bring them up but on the offset you\u2019d obviously have probably lower labor cost due to all the energy CapEx reductions. What's your view today of when these plants come on-stream? Are they delayed? Are they is it the same? Just - some color there would be appreciated thanks.","Bob Patel ","Good afternoon, Nils. Well, there are several projects that are already underway in terms of construction. And so, something like seven crackers, and likely those will be built and whatever the pace the projects progress at, it\u2019s likely the second wave of project that were announced which will be revisited. But I think the seven or so that are under construction or will be soon very likely to come up.","Nils Wallin ","Got it, and then just sort of, I guess a little bit of a technical question on the difference between ethane and propane cost, so historically propane was sort of thought as the ceiling to the ethane price once you net it out all the co-product credits. Now it's below ethane. So curious as to why and the projection is certainly for to be, to continue to be below ethane for the reminder of the year. So, curious as to why you think ethane will correct down to return to its historic relationship and what might be presenting that?","Bob Patel ","Well, short term you get these kind of dislocations based on inventory or maybe specific logistics-related constraints. But longer term, or later on this year, I would expect that propane we\u2019ll start pursuing, and on the outset you remember that ethane too much below it\u2019s and that\u2019s been trading right around its true value. So, I think the two will completely open, I don't know if propane will really remain more advantaged that ethylene through the entire year, that remains to be seen. The good news is that both are in abundant supply and therefore we should see an advantaged feedstock position here in the US for this year.","Nils Wallin ","Got it, thanks very much.","Bob Patel","All right, well, thank you for all your questions and I\u2019d like to just close with a few comments. First of all, we had a banner here in 2014 and I am not going to repeat all of the operational accomplishments and so on, but, it\u2019s worthy of highlighting that we returned $7.2 billion to shareholders in 2014.","We have a regular dividend and share repurchase program, we\u2019ve remained committed to the share repurchase program. We have a very strong and flexible balance sheet which will be durable really in any environment and we\u2019ll support our strategy going forward. While I am new to the CEO role, I am not new to the company and I am certainly not new to the industry.","You should expect that in the near tern our focus is going to continue to be our safety and operational excellence and cost management and delivering on all these growth programs we have in front of us. Longer-term, we\u2019ll continue to build out strategy and align with the Board and the kind of things we want to do to the extent that we can discuss some of that with you, we\u2019ll do so at our Investor Day on April 29. So, thank you very much for your continued interest in our company and we\u2019ll look forward to you next time. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference.

And with that being said, I would like turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our Web site. Let\u2019s take a look at Slide Number 4 and review a few financial highlights. Second quarter earnings per share were $2.22, with EBITDA up approximately $1.94 billion, both represent record quarterly results. Every segment contributed to our strong earnings. Underlying oil and natural gas fundamentals continue to provide a strategic advantage of our North America businesses. However, the quarter could have been even better, had we not experienced various internal operating issues and third-party disruptions.","These issues particularly impacted our O&P Americas and intermediates and derivatives businesses. I will speak more about those in a moment. Turning to Slide Number 5, you will see that our safety statistics continue at the level that we established over the past several years. We were recently recognized by the American Chemistry Council as the Responsible Care Company of the Year in our size category. We are very proud of this award as it demonstrates our strong commitment to safety and environmental stewardship. I would now like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.","Karyn Ovelmen","","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Slide number 6, which charts second quarter and last 12 month segment EBITDA. As Jim said, our results have been strong and steady. Within the segments, the O&P Americas business established a new record as EBITDA was slightly less than $1 billion. In O&P-EAI, our EBITDA of approximately $320 million was slightly higher than the strong underlying first quarter result. Intermediates and Derivatives continued to follow normal trends. Oxyfuels results improved as we entered the summer gasoline blending season. Exclusive of this seasonality, results were relatively unchanged from the first quarter.","Refining posted results similar to the last two quarters. The Technology segment continued to report consistent strong earnings. Slide 7 and 8 provide a picture of our cash generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated $1.6 billion from our operations. Our cash and short-term security balance declined by $850 million, as we devoted $2.2 billion to share repurchases and dividends. Capital spending was consistent with our full year guidance of approximately $1.6 billion.","During the past 12 months, we generated $5.3 billion in cash from operations and raised $2.5 billion from bond issuances. This cash was devoted to share repurchases and dividends totaling $6.1 billion. Another $1.5 billion went towards capital investment with approximately 50% towards growth projects.","I\u2019ll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.","Jim Gallogly","","Thanks, Karyn. Let\u2019s discuss segment performance beginning on Slide number 9 with Olefins and Polyolefins Americas. Second quarter EBITDA was $978 million a record quarter and $242 million greater than the first quarter. Operationally our La Porte Olefins plant was down throughout the quarter versus the planned mid June start up. The plant operated briefly during early July prior to shutting down to address a compressor issue. We restarted over this past weekend. Second quarter sales were met through inventory, new purchases and some operating adjustments across our system, however July sales have been impacted by the equipment issue. In total the turnaround and subsequent equipment related delay have reduced annual ethylene production by approximately 600 million pounds.","We estimate the delayed restart impacted the second quarter by approximately $50 million. Despite the delayed restart Olefin results significantly outperformed the first quarter increasing by approximately $220 million. This was partially related to the impact of first quarter ethylene purchases and inventory build in preparation for the turnaround. The second quarter benefited from a lower cost per unit of ethylene production due to both lower raw material cost and increased co-product values.","During the quarter ethane accounted for 72% of our ethylene production and NGLs represented 85%. Our average ethylene price decreased by approximately $0.01 per pound, contribution from our Naphtha\u2019s unit was relatively unchanged. Within Polyolefins to polyethylene spread over ethylene increased by approximately $0.02 per pound. Polyethylene sales were steady with exports representing approximately 13% of the volume.","Our 200 million pound per year polyethylene expansion at Matagorda operated to expectations throughout the quarter, however during June tight ethylene availability impacted polyethylene sales volumes. Polypropylene results were relatively unchanged. Thus far during the third quarter industry conditions have remained relatively strong and are benefiting from lower ethane prices. The delayed La Porte restart is expected to impact third quarter ethylene production by approximately 100 million pounds. The delay will also impact ethylene derivative sales. We expect to increase ethylene production at La Porte to the expanded capacity during September. This 800 million pound expansion will increase our U.S. ethylene system capacity to 10.7 billion pounds annually.","Work continues on the 250 million pound per year Channel View expansion. Additionally we\u2019re beginning construction on the 800 million pound Corpus Christi expansion on receipt of our environmental permits. Let\u2019s turn to Slide number 11 and review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $319 million, exclusive of the first quarter environmental indemnity settlement, this was approximately $15 million better than the first quarter. Olefin results improved moderately versus the first quarter, naphtha cost increases and a $0.02 per pound ethylene price decline were more than offset by increased co-product prices and the benefit from processing advantage raw materials.","Approximately 55% of our ethylene production was sourced from advantage raw material such as propane, butane and condensates. Our ethylene plants operated at approximately 95% of capacity, significantly above reported industry rates and slightly above our first quarter rate. Results for both Polyolefins and Joint Ventures also improved from the first quarter. Combined polypropylene compounds and PB1 results were unchanged. Following normal seasonal trends third quarter polyolefin and polypropylene compound volumes are expected to be slightly lower than the second quarter. Naphtha prices have fallen somewhat which is expected to improve olefin margins at least temporarily. During the third quarter equity earnings are anticipated to be impacted by the scheduled turnaround at two Joint Ventures.","Now please turn to Slide number 12 for a discussion of our intermediates and derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $430 million, $55 million higher than the first quarter. The primary contributor to this improvement was a typical seasonal increase in Oxyfuels margins and volumes. Propylene oxide and derivative results declined by approximately $20 million versus the strong first quarter results, a portion of the decline can be attributed to seasonal propylene glycol demand into the aircraft deicing industry. Lower solvent margins also contributed to the decline.","The quarter finished with tight market conditions following a fire at a European competitor\u2019s facility. Intermediate chemical performance improved by approximately $10 million. Styrene results improved by approximately $20 million from higher volume and margins following first quarter maintenance, this helped to absorb lower EOEG results driven by lower margins. Within acetyls, lower methanol margins were offset by increased acetic acid and final acetate monomer results.","During the second quarter, we experienced some planned and unplanned downtime at our Channelview and La Porte acetyls complexes. The seasonal increase in Oxyfuels margins and volumes led to an approximately $65 million increase in results. The majority of the improvement can be attributed to lower butane raw material costs relative to gasoline prices. The change in the industry benchmark can be seen in the chart on the lower right.","Across the segment, overall July business conditions have been relatively similar to the second quarter. We anticipate that the incident at our competitor\u2019s propylene oxide styrene monomer facility would benefit propylene oxide during the quarter. However styrene margins have temporarily declined due to increase benzene costs. It is difficult for Oxyfuels margins to decline late in the third quarter, but it\u2019s difficult to forecast either the timing or the magnitude of the decline.","Let\u2019s move to Slide number 13 for a discussion of the refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $137 million slightly better than the past two quarters. During the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $27.01 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 257,000 barrels per day. The spread at the refinery decreased following a trend similar to the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark. Crude oil throughput increased versus the first quarter, contributing approximately $10 million to second quarter results. Fuel products yields improved versus the first quarter but this was largely offset by lower byproduct values.","During the quarter, Canadian and light crudes represented almost 25% of our throughput. Exports accounted for approximately 5% of finished fuel product sales. July benchmark spreads have averaged approximately $26 per barrel in line with the second quarter spread. Thus far, RIN costs for the quarter are relatively unchanged. Operationally, during the third quarter, we have a scheduled HTS catalyst change which is expected to negatively impact product yields. EBITDA in the Technology Segment contributed -- continued to be strong at $71 million. In summary, during the second quarter, we generated record EBITDA and earnings but results could have been even better due to equipment and supplier problems.","We completed our initial 10% share repurchase program and initiated purchased under the second 10% authorization granted in April. We finished the quarter with 515 million shares outstanding, a reduction of 62 million shares since the program began for approximately 11%. Apart from the delayed La Porte turnaround, business conditions during the first weeks of the third quarter have been similar to the second quarter with some typical industry volatility. We have now restated the La Porte ethylene plant and expect to implement the ethylene expansion later in the quarter. The Channelview and Corpus Christi expansion are progressing as planned.","We are now pleased to take questions, Holly.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Jim I am curious on your latest and greatest thoughts on the NGL complex. We can look out now, it looks through the 2016 and see sub $0.30 ethane prices, I think there have been some concern maybe as units came back online, this summer you get a rally in ethane but it doesn\u2019t seem to be happening, so I wonder if you could just give us some assessment of maybe ethane, propane and if you have any thoughts on butane?","Jim Gallogly","Bob, the ethane prices have fallen quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. They are down in the low 20s at this point in time I think most people did expect rise in the summer but they are doing exactly the opposite. Some of that is due to various operating issues. As you are probably aware, there is complex at Port Arthur, a olefins cracker that is down due to fire, there has been a variety of operational issues, our turnaround went long. And so as a result of those things and then very, very strong supply, the prices have fallen. I think that\u2019s very, very positive for a business. Propane prices have come down some butane prices. That\u2019s been helpful for us in Europe, particularly in butane. We have been cracking lighter there particularly out of there facility. So all of this has been positive for our results and natural gas prices have also fallen and so things are looking good.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","I know it\u2019s not a huge business but certainly helped incrementally in the last couple of quarters the methanol industry is seeing price drop to about a two year low, is that just an echo of gas or do you think there is incremental supply that\u2019s pressuring prices or what\u2019s happened there and what\u2019s your outlook on methanol?","Jim Gallogly ","","Methanol has come down as you say, natural gas prices have come down, that\u2019s part of it people have cooperated a bit better. There were some turnarounds earlier, so my impression is that we bounced off the bottom there. It seems to be firming a bit, so we will see how that develops.","Operator","","Next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","","Yes, good morning. The first question is just around La Porte, how should we think about the effect of the July shut down and how should we think about the ramp of that 800,000 pounds coming on in September, when will that kind of get the full run rate?","Jim Gallogly ","","First about the turnaround, we have originally thought that turnaround will take us about 80 days it took us about 115 days. We had a considerable amount of work to do. It took longer than we had expected and then we had the first stage compressor of our crack gas machine blow a seal there when we restarted that took us a couple of more weeks to get back on line that certainly wasn\u2019t expected. But our people worked incredibly hard and I am proud of what they have done. It just took so much longer than we expected. I indicated about how much that impacted our first quarter, our second quarter in our prepared comments, about a 100 million pounds here in July.","In terms of the 800 million pounds, we have got two furnaces that are almost mechanically complete. They are on schedule. We have increased the budget for that project as you know in-part because we can see the turnaround cost probably going up and labor cost increasing, productivity going down a bit. So, it\u2019s about at the cost that we had forecasted recently, taking a bit longer will bring one of the new furnaces up in the second and it shouldn\u2019t take us very long to line them out. We haven\u2019t operated before the big furnaces but we are pretty hopeful we will get those on-stream and bring them up rapidly. One item taking care of the start-up of La Porte was pretty smooth. ","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","Great and then on the tax rate getting better, some of that I am assuming is just because Europe is contributing more profitability in vacuum NOLs and lower tax rate there. But is there some other structural stuff and how should we think about the tax rate going forward?","Karyn Ovelmen","","With regards to the effective tax rate, there is a change in the mix of the earnings floor primarily due to increases in non-taxable income and some internal financing and partially offset by changes in our valuation allowances. Going forward for the remainder of the year, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 28%.","Operator","","Next question is from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse ","","Wanted to check with regard to your European business, clearly Europe you are really processing a lot of advantage raw materials at 55% of your suede. How much further do you think you can push at this point and are there other opportunities may be adjustments if you can make with a little bit more investment that even further broaden that opportunity?","Jim Gallogly ","John, European crackers are running lighter than they used to, to be sure whether it is propane or butane we have been able to crack lighter. Our folks over there learning from what we have done here in the United States and the way to take those flexible crackers and take them to new levels. We have very modest capital that we are putting in to help but it\u2019s minor. It\u2019s more of a learning as we go, obviously we have improved there. We have also cracked more common sites and that\u2019s been positive for us. So, we are running at great rates, 95% utilization is so far above what\u2019s happening in the rest of the industry that\u2019s a plus for us. I think between the cost structure changes that we have made 1,000 people or so less than we used to operate within that region. Lining out our operations and working hard on the revenue side. We have been able to post quarter after quarter good solid results in Europe.","John McNulty - Credit Suisse","","Thanks. And then just a quick question, we have seen with some of the outages we have seen really moving north pretty solidly over the last month or so, yet we haven\u2019t really seen much on the polyethylene side in terms of movement. I guess if you can give us an update on your thoughts on that and what may be holding it back or if it\u2019s just a timing issue?","Jim Gallogly","Polyethylene margins are very strong right now and a lot of price increases haven\u2019t happened. Our perception is that market is extremely tight, some of these ethylene outages have an impact on those derivatives and we have seen some competitor announcements of force majeure. We have been in force majeure. I think the market is tied and I think some of the forecasters are saying polyethylene prices should go up in the United States.","Operator","","Next is Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Yes, good morning. Jim, there has been some tremendous M&A activity recently across the chemicals industry. Just wondering if you could comment on whether you see anything in your pipeline that might be tempting or whether it\u2019s more likely we will continue on in the current passes returning cash through meaningful repurchase activity\u2026","Jim Gallogly","Kevin, we\u2019ve been very active in the M&As here but buying our own shares. We still think we are the best investment out there and we completed our first 10% program, commenced the second 10% program. We watch every asset that comes to market, we evaluate it. So far we haven\u2019t seen something, that\u2019s been attractive to us, but we remain open to accretive transactions if they appear. We obviously have a great balance sheet and the ability to execute should something appropriate appear. But again, today we like ourselves as the best investment. And in terms of whether returning cash to shareholders, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated year-to-date that we are very willing to do that in a significant way.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Certainly. And as a second question, can you provide us any updates on your timelines for expansions at Channelview and Corpus how is that tracking?","Jim Gallogly","Yes. The Channelview and Corpus projects are tracking as we expect. The last time we talked that everyone on our earnings call, we did update the cost profile that was primarily related to Corpus. The Channelview expansion is two furnaces, we already have the tie-ins ready. So that should be a fairly simple transition from to bring those assets online. That\u2019s expected to be early 2015 for Channelview for the couple of furnaces and then at Corpus, like 2015, we expect it to progress as we earlier indicated.","Operator","Next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","There seems to be a targeted effort to export more hydrocarbons from the U.S. did the approval of this condensate exports recently. So how does it impact your Corpus Christi operations, but you are buying some distressed cargoes and then also your refinery?","Jim Gallogly","Yes. So far P.J., we haven\u2019t seen much impact at all on condensate, so they are very long in South Texas and seem to be increasing instead of decreasing. What we are working on right now is getting some of that pipeline up into the Houston region instead of barging to reduce our cost even further. So far that\u2019s been in the mix. I think when the original announcements of a couple of people moving some condensates offshore and that was approved by the department of energy when that was approved people thought gee maybe that\u2019s a change step. I think after that\u2019s been evaluated people maybe don\u2019t believe that so much. And we still think that these discounted Texas condensate show up in our mix, primarily in cracking more at Channelview and some at Corpus, but not so much in our refinery at this point.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","Thank you. And have you seen any progress on ethane exports on the U.S. I mean have you heard of any new contracts being signed or what are your thoughts on sparking LNG with ethane? Thank you.","Jim Gallogly","Well, so far I haven\u2019t heard of any new thing, so there has been an announcement that Reliance is looking building some tankers, but how that\u2019s sourcing there hasn\u2019t been a lot of detail. But still based on maybe a feature of 300,000 barrels per day things that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s still in the 2020 period, something 10% to 15% of the volume, so we think it\u2019s manageable. Of course we\u2019d rather stay home, but it is competitive world and some volumes could be exported.","Operator","Next question is Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan ","I was surprised that how strong your EBITDA was in the olefins business in the United States. I would have thought that benchmark margins year-over-year were lower both on the NGL side and on naphtha side. So my guess is that there might have been a positive artifact from the purchases of ethylene in the first quarter. Was there a material benefit or could you quantify that benefit that you might have received?","Jim Gallogly ","Jeff, there is arguably some benefit. Movement from first quarter to second quarter, but we already talked about that in our prepared remarks. I actually was disappointed in our Olefin results in the second quarter. As I said the turnaround went longer, I wish we would have been up in the middle of June with our cracker and posted some more numbers. So it was a record quarter for that business as I have tried to be very clear, we could have done even better. ","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","I don\u2019t recall the quantification that you\u2019ve provided.","Jim Gallogly ","Jeff, maybe I can help you out a bit. If you recall what we\u2019ve done is with the turnaround at La Porte in the second quarter, we were preparing for that in the prior quarters. So as we spoke about first quarter results, we talked about a $150 million basically it was from purchases and inventory, so some of that moved forward. Now if you think about that, so that impacts the first second quarter comparison. In the second quarter what we have is really the turnaround running a couple of weeks longer that required us to go into the market and purchase some additional inventories and that\u2019s the $50 million that Jim spoke about previously.","","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","All right, and I can follow up on that. And then secondly, the crack spreads seem to be moving lower, can you talk about prospects for your refinery operations in the third quarter and do you plan to provide methanol volume, methanol production volumes in your I&D segment in the future as you provide so many of the data for the things you produce. ","","Jim Gallogly","","Yes, let me comment a bit, first on refining and then I\u2019ll talk about methanol volumes. On refining, the two on one crack spread is down a bit; we\u2019re running very well at the refinery at the moment, well above nameplate. That\u2019s positive. We haven\u2019t done that recently but you know I\u2019m quite pleased that Todd and his team are doing a nice job running the asset hard like we should. We\u2019ve had better yield structure, I think we\u2019ve been doing a pretty good job of purchasing crude and so while the two on one is a bit lower, we\u2019ve been able to make up for that. We\u2019ve now been able to post a few quarters in a row of decent refining margins and I\u2019m happy to say that business operationally is doing better. On I&D in methanol, we had some downtime. We had some supplier interruptions in one of our sites and then some of the loan downtime at Channelview, we don\u2019t typically give those volumes but they have been -- there\u2019s room for improvement there as well. ","","Operator","","Next is from Evelyn Rodriguez with UBS, your line is open.","","Evelyn Rodriguez - UBS ","","Thank you, good morning guys, just one quick question. Of course given that fundamentals are not very strong we\u2019d just like to change the subject a little bit to something that investors seem to be focusing on. That\u2019s MLPs. Can you remind us again why, or why not, is that more of a challenge for you to do something similar that your competitor in Houston is doing and what assets are available for you to potentially do some that way.","","Jim Gallogly","","We'll continuing to study the possibility for an MLP, we\u2019re watching very closely our competitor and how that transaction goes over the next days and we obviously could do the same thing, our asset base is dramatically larger and so that opportunity is greater, we\u2019re not sure the market\u2019s that\u2019s big but certainly we could do that. ","","Olefins is a core business for us, is very-very key as we talk to investors some favor this, some don\u2019t but we will continue to study it. One of the differences is, we went through bankruptcy in 2009, early 2010 and our assets were written down so you know the tax basis is quite different so I suspect our economics are different in that particular transaction in a variety of ways. ","","Operator","","Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities your line is open.","","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","","Good morning folks and congrats on the record, and obviously a record in O&P Americas despite the issues at La Porte. As I think about it, you\u2019re going to continue to have some issues here in Q3 in La Porte but the order of magnitude is going to be lower than what is was in Q2 and it sounds like margins are trending in the right direction for O&P Americas in Q3 so, would it be surprising if we sit here three months from now talking about yet another record in O&P Americas in Q3?","","Jim Gallogly","","Well we try not to give those kind of forecasts but the market is very tight right now. Ethane prices are low and we\u2019re running better, I mentioned that the refinery is running above nameplate. We\u2019ve got all that horsepower now at La Porte and we\u2019re running above nameplate there despite the fact that we don\u2019t have extra couple furnaces. So we\u2019ll try to put products in the pipe and we\u2019ll see what margins are.","","Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities","","All right, fair enough and then just looking at I&D, you know you mentioned the [indiscernible] business margins are improving in the VAM area obviously there were some operational issues that probably contributed to that. Can you update us on where that stands and where the [indiscernible] stands in that area?","","Jim Gallogly","","Yes, VAM margins are strong right now, we\u2019re back running but we got to rebuild inventories so you know assuming we can continue to run well there we should be in good shape, we\u2019ve got the issues that we had lined out at this moment, some of those were third party issues as well, occasionally the things that happened on our equipment but in some of that it was third party.","","Operator","","Don Carson with Susquehanna, your line is open.","","Don Carson - Susquehanna","","Jim, a question on some of your future growth projects, as you complete Channelview and Corpus Christi next year, you will have the bulk of your expansions behind you. I know in the past you talked about perhaps 400 million of growth projects that you identified. Beyond that have you identified more and as if not, as your CapEx starts to wind down because your expansion spending declines, should we expect an acceleration in return of cash to shareholders?","","Jim Gallogly","","Don, we'll continue to work potential growth items. I did mention that we have an opportunity at Channelview to do some backend work. It looks like a very good project economics as we do our preliminary engineering, look like may be a 400 million pound expansion there. In addition to what we already have is the possibility at we think a reasonably low cost, so we'll keep working there. We have talked about a polyethylene plant. We are studying a couple other growth projects. We are always aware that capital costs are going up in the timeframe of \u201816, \u201817, \u201818 because of all the work going on. So, we are going to be hopefully smart about what we bring on and when we do it but some of these debottleneck opportunities and expansion opportunities still look very good to us.","","In terms of return of cash to shareholders, I think since we have been a new company regardless of whether it\u2019s being special dividends, regular dividends, share repurchases. I think we have set a very nice track record of being shareholder friendly.","","Don Carson - Susquehanna","","So, with that $400 million basket you have identified as possible growth projects beyond 2015, is that number now growing with some of these other things you have identified?","","Jim Gallogly","","We're continuing to work right now and the capital budget cycle at the front end of that and looking at a variety of things that we began to do the initial engineering on. So, it\u2019s a bit early for me to comment on what all we'll include but we've been spending roughly $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in capital. We've got -- we should expect something like that next year although that budget isn\u2019t finalized and then after that we'll see what else we can add to the portfolio.","","Operator","","Next is from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Your line is open.","","Nils Wallin - CLSA","","With ethane here in the low $0.20 range and natural gas below $4 it seems like ethane prices are actually below their fuel value. I know you said that there were some turnarounds that probably affects it but is there anything else, is there incremental supply that is contributing to this below fuel value price for ethane and do you think that\u2019s going to continue through the rest of the year?","","Jim Gallogly","","The apex line is running now, that help bring in some supplies, as a result of natural gas prices being higher. I think there was a drill bit response having formally been in that business they have prospects ready to drill typically when the prices are there recognizing that you get a decline curve in something like 60%, 80% depending upon which player and we're going to drill those wells when the gas prices are elevated like they will over the winter. And so I think some of this is a response with the drill bit. Overall it'sshaping up very nicely for the petrochemical industry though.","","Nils Wallin - CLSA","","And then just on your crude slate, I know at one point you talked about having Western Canadian almost 20%. Would you remind us if that\u2019s still the number you are looking for and whether you've started to receive any shipments from Flanigan as yet?","","Jim Gallogly","","Yes, at this moment our crude slate is about 75% formed mostly Maya and a variety of other crudes, about 60% Canadian, 8% domestic. We expect that once Flanigan is running and at this point in time we are hoping late third quarter, early fourth quarter that we can get our slate up to about 35% Canadian. Obviously, today dependent upon dislocations in crude, we also did some work on our crude units so that we can have light crude capacity of about 50%. But we do hope to have more Canadian later in the year and that should help our refining results.","","Operator","","Next is David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","","Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank","","Good morning. This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. Guys, obviously strong performance in O&P-EAI for the last two quarters given elevated operating rates, do you sort of view $300 million plus run rate for the back part of the year and into \u201815 is reasonable? ","","Jim Gallogly","","We've obviously had a few quarters that have been in that range. You remember that EAI has about half of this portfolio that\u2019s pretty stable between our compounding business PB1, some of our joint ventures. There is an element of EAI that\u2019s nice and stable. We've now seen some contribution on a fairly steady basis from the more commodity oriented olefins and polyolefins business. Our inventories have been tight. We have been running very hard. We have had some operational bubbles there too and I think our results could have been better in the second quarter in Europe as well. We have got a nice structure there, our cost structure and we\u2019re monomer short, so we can run our crackers hard. We are doing everything we can to improve the feedstock slate. So Bob and his team keep delivering and we told him we'd like that to be a normal term.","","Operator","","Next is Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","","Just a quick question. If you take out the issue at La Porte, what was your capacity utilization in the U.S. this quarter?","","Jim Gallogly","","We ran without La Porte at about 96% to 97% utilization. But if you remember that this was same company that ran over 100% utilization first solid year. So our expectations of ourselves are pretty high.","","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","","And what -- if you know the delta between running at 96% to 97% versus over a 100%, is something within your control or is it just the way the quarter plays out?","","Jim Gallogly","","We\u2019re running mechanical equipment but we work our maintenance hard and we\u2019ve got some people who know this business inside and out. I\u2019d like to say that our La Porte turnaround was not represented of what we typically do. Having said that, it was not for a lack of effort, we had people working amazingly hard to get all of that work done, it was a huge amount of work that we had in front of us given that we're reworking a bunch in towers and everything for else for this increasing capacity. So most of the industry can do a 95% something like that. It depends on the moment whether you include turnarounds are not in there, but we typically are operating more for percentage points about our competition. And when you look at some of the Salomon data and all of that, we benchmark extremely well.","","Operator","","Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","","I guess I just wanted to ask a question about how you look at the industry and overall projects I mean [indiscernible] you guys with the brownfield and Dow with Freeport in a couple of years. I mean how are you looking at ethylene supply generally and is there any risk to being oversupplied in the U.S.?","","Jim Gallogly","","Generally there is - at the same time, the ethylene capacity is being added, derivatives are being added. We are long ethylene, we have a portfolio of customers that we sell to, we're in constant discussions with them about the following -- the years following our expansions. And so for now we're feeling comfortable that we would be able to move the product. The United States is in such a nice advantage cost position that if we need to export, we can. And I think that\u2019s been a realization of all the competitors and gives them confidence to go ahead and expand capacity.","","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","","So just along those lines, can you just talk a little bit more about the potential for greater PE capacity addition as well you said you were considering a project there?","","Jim Gallogly","","We\u2019ve been talking about the polyethylene expansion with a brand new technology. We think that will be a very competitive line both in terms of the product that makes and the value it brings the capital cost. But also very importantly, this should help us a significant amount in our licensing efforts. We are going to build serial number 001 of the new technology and we\u2019re already very strong and low density polyethylene, the best in polypropylene in our view and this will add another leg to our technology stool that we think is very positive.","","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","","I am sorry, what\u2019s the potential timing on that?","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, that project is supposed to come about 2017 middle part of the year as best we can predict at this moment. ","","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","","And have you disclosed how much that\u2019s going to add to your PE capacity or\u2026","","Jim Gallogly","","Yes, it\u2019s about 1 billion pounds; maybe we\u2019ve get more than that.","","Operator","","Next question is from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Your line is open.","","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","","I have two quick ones. Can give a sense for the rhythm of outages over the next four quarters, so how the back half compares to the first half of the year but also how you think this first half of next year might look by comparison?","","Jim Gallogly","","Laurence, are we talking about industry-wise or us?","","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","","Just for yourself, it\u2019s just for yourself.","","Jim Gallogly","","Okay. Yes, we have BOTBA turnaround coming at Bayport. There is a couple of JV turnarounds coming but otherwise we expect to be running and I am hoping that we get ourselves lined out here shortly and that second quarter was an anomaly.","","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","","And then I guess secondly just a longer term question. If single step conversion of methane to ethylene becomes viable I guess there is one of your competitors is doing a plant that was to come on next year. Is that something that would be significant for you in terms of a potential extra feedstock or how do you look at that. I know it\u2019s been talked about for a few decades but","","Jim Gallogly","","I haven\u2019t been too worried about that one way or the other at this point, there is always something new like that but it\u2019s a maybe, but been around the industry a long time and haven\u2019t seen many of those maybes turned into reality, so we\u2019ll see, I just don\u2019t know yet. ","","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies","Okay, thanks.","","Jim Gallogly","","One of the things I failed to mention but I did in my prepared remarks is, we do have an HS unit at the refinery that will go down and turnaround too and that\u2019ll affect yield but not volume very much.","","Operator","","Next is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global, your line is open.","","Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global","","Morning, Jim. Question around the sustainability of these good results that you\u2019re seeing at O&P-EAI, you know good Q1, other good Q2 and as I took a look at your presentation slide for the segment, your July margins were even better on the ethylene side than Q2 margins. I was talking to one of your competitors in the US with a large sort of European asset base and they were telling me that they\u2019re running their ethylene facilities at 90% plus operating rates, so now is this a sign of call it an evolving sort of tightness in the broader cycle in your mind?","","Jim Gallogly","","Well I think it\u2019s too early to say that. The rates have been higher you know our inventories are low in polymers, we\u2019ve been running our crackers hard, some of the product that has been coming into Europe from the Middle East is going to Asia. There have been some new duties and things like that but there has been a bit more strength in Europe than there\u2019s been in the past but it\u2019s still an oversupply condition in my mind still near bottom of the cycle type economics. But you know, one of the things that happened in July was naphtha prices came down and that always builds a little bit of margin so that\u2019s a positive.","","Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global","","Sure thing. Now can you guess to the methanol side of things, you know a couple of moving parts over there obviously? You know pricing had come down but I just noticed this morning, methane exports did their August prices which were flat with July level so seems to be some semblance of a bottoming out there, but then again you know towards the end of the year methane ex itself would bring online some incremental capacity. So how much sort of comfort do you have in your earlier sort of comment about a bottoming out or maybe even potentially an uptick in methanol pricing near term.","","Jim Gallogly","","So we\u2019ve got to watch what happens in natural gas pricing, but at this moment our sense is that we hit a bottom and we\u2019re headed a little bit up instead of down again, we\u2019ll see how the market develops, some -- we have to watch and see what happens in China too. If there\u2019s strength there or not strength later in the year, but we also could do a bit of self-help, we could have run better.","","Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global","","Fair enough, and just adding on to that, I mean Q1 seemed to be a bit of a quirky quarter where you had some [indiscernible] outages obviously, you know the real outages were there as well but did you see a fundamental sort of improvement in demand in Q2 and where we are right now call it in July for ethanol.","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, for instance in VAM I think there\u2019s a structural change going on, you know there is some capacity taken down in Europe because it simply wasn\u2019t competitive on a cost basis and as a result of that the United States capacities have increased margins and able to ship to different places in the world. So VAM I think it\u2019s structural, acidic acid is pretty strong right now and again the same thing, if we run a bit better those businesses can do better.","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Charles Nievert with Cowen and Company, your line is open.","","Charles Nievert - Cowen and Company","","Well just well, actually sort of a series, when you looked at the turnaround that you made at La Porte is that going to improve cost structure through that or is it just something versus where it was whenever you took it offline for getting the expansion that\u2019s going to come with it, or does it improve throughput on top of the expansion and the same would go for the other expansions as you're looking at ethylene does, is there going to be a little bit of a cost benefit once you make the turnaround?","","Jim Gallogly","","On a unit basis that will be a plus for us, because we got a 1.7 billion pound a year cracker already, we add 800 million, that\u2019ll make it one of the biggest most efficient crackers in the United States, we hold ourselves accountable in order to get our cost structure on a continuous basis lower. La Porte\u2019s in a good position to do that, Corpus the same thing, it\u2019s a different kind of turnaround, we\u2019re retubing furnaces and a variety of things down at Corpus, but both of those will be far more competitive assets. ","","We have Channelview that\u2019s already a very competitive asset; add a couple more furnaces there. We\u2019re very well positioned cost structure wise within our olefins assets in the United States, I didn\u2019t mention so far in this call our Midwest assets, Morris and Clinton, you probably have noticed that ethane prices have fallen rather rapidly there as well and they\u2019re extremely well positioned despite being smaller assets and they\u2019re running nice and hard.","","Charles Nievert - Cowen and Company","","Okay and just to reiterate on the refinery, the changes you\u2019re making with it, the turn you\u2019re going to take on the refinery, your throughput shouldn\u2019t change as the mix of products will, I mean for the time while you are doing that.","","Jim Gallogly","","That\u2019s generally a proper statement. The yield structure will change, crude units should run hard but when you got some -- the next unit down, it will tuck the yield structure just a bit.","","Charles Nievert - Cowen and Company","","Okay, so you ran 258, you said you are now at nameplate on the refinery which is in the 260s, so given everything we should see an increase overall quarter-over-quarter in the refinery throughput number. The crack spread may change but\u2026","","Jim Gallogly","","Yes, depending upon where we are cracking, I mean we have gotten real close to 300,000 barrels a day with our refinery in some of the recent days, so we can run that thing harder now that we have done some work on the units there. So, we haven\u2019t been able to sustain above nameplate in any of the quarters but I certainly have a challenge out to the team to accomplish that. I think some of them are probably listening to this call. They have heard that before, they just heard it again.","","Operator","","P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.","","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","","Jim, you talked about M&A and you said that you are looking at every opportunity. Are you willing to get into new chemistries of new molecules to what you have in your portfolio?","","Jim Gallogly","","I never ruled that out P.J. It is a possibility but it has to be the right value. I wouldn\u2019t say we are actively engaged in M&A activity. We evaluate everything that comes to market and see if it will make us better. One thing that we generally bring to the table is the ability to run assets and so even if it\u2019s different chemistry, we would have to look at it and see if we could contribute to improvement in whatever the structure is today. But again our focus remains on our share repurchases, ever increasing regular dividends and being shareholder friendly.","","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","And one quick question for Karyn, your accelerated repurchase as an option instead of buying your regularly?","","Doug Pike ","","I am sorry, P.J., this is Doug; you broke up in your question.","","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup","","Sorry, do you see accelerated repurchase as an option instead of buying your stocks on a regular basis?","","Doug Pike ","","You broke up again but you said do we see expanded stock purchases?","","Karyn Ovelmen","","Accelerated repurchases versus our buying today. Our view and approach to buyback really hasn\u2019t changed. We had a few more shares that we purchased this quarter than we have historically and that had to do with really just a bit of overlap as we were wrapping up the first 10%, 2013 authorization as we began executing on the second 10%, 2014 authorization. ","","So, we have outlined that capital strategy and we have been executing on that. Broadly speaking, nothing has really significantly changed in our view of the buyback and oil and gas ratio and our own operating fundamental to drive the strong cash flow remain in place. Our growth plans and actions should grow our future earnings and so we are in a position where we will continue to execute.","","We won't speak prospectively as market factors could change, however today no change in our capital deployment policies and we'll continue to report what we have done each quarter on our activity.","","Operator","","And I am showing no further questions at this time.","","Jim Gallogly","","Well, thank you. Let me make a few final comments. We did have a record quarter almost $2 billion of EBITDA, earnings per share of $2.22. We completed a first 10% share buyback program. In the last six months, we've had $6.1 billion of share repurchases and dividends. While these are very good results, we could have done better. ","","We built a reputation for operational excellence, strong safety performance, environmental stewardship and reliability. We didn\u2019t deliver fully on that last leg. We had a long difficult turnaround at La Porte. It\u2019s completed. We are running above nameplate. Our people work incredibly hard but we didn\u2019t get it done within an acceptable timeframe. We had other operational bubbles. We will get ourselves back on track. We will continue to earn your trust and faith and our operational excellence and the markets have been kind, ethane prices are lower, the U.S. advantage is very strong at the moment.

Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2018 Teleconference. I am joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today\u2019s call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.","I would also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.

Thank you, Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world and thank you for joining our 2018 year-end earnings call. Let\u2019s begin with slide three and review the highlights for 2018 and our progress in advancing our value-driven growth strategy.","Record setting earnings in our Intermediates and Derivatives and Technology segments partially offset declines, primarily in our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment to provide $4.7 billion of net income and $6.9 billion of EBITDA for the year.","Increased cash generation helped to fund growth investments, while we improved our free cash flow yield by over 200 basis points and posted a strong 27% return on our invested capital during 2018.","The acquisition of A. Schulman in August made LyondellBasell the world\u2019s largest plastics compounding company. In conjunction with this acquisition, we launched our Advanced Polymer Solutions business segment to provide focus and visibility for this new global platform and quickly went to work on integration that achieved an annualized synergy run rate of $47 million by the end of the year. Progress continues and we remain confident that we will meet or exceed our target to capture $150 million of integration related synergies within two years of the closing date.","In March, we launched an innovative plastics recycling joint venture with Suez that provides a meaningful and sustainable solution for plastic waste. We are pleased with initial market demand for this premium recycled plastics and continue to optimize the operational and commercial performance of the business model with an eye toward replicating this model in other parts of Europe.","We advanced our pipeline of organic growth projects during 2018 with our new Hyperzone HDPE plant scheduled for start-up in the third quarter of this year and construction of the world\u2019s largest PO\/TBA plant on track for completion in the latter part of 2021.","These projects not only increase our production capacity but also represent milestones for the commercialization of proprietary technologies, such as our new Hyperzone process for polyethylene and the latest developments from our advantaged propylene oxide and co-product technologies.","We continue to actively manage our business portfolio with several small acquisitions and divestitures around the world, while we evaluate other opportunities, including a potential acquisition of Braskem.","In the meantime, our cash flows enabled us to opportunistically repurchase 19.2 million shares of LyondellBasell\u2019s stock and return over $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","In 2018, our company continued to deliver on our promise of value-driven growth through a balanced strategy of operational excellence, profitable organic expansions, accretive M&A and significant shareholder returns.","Please turn to slide four, where I am proud to report that LyondellBasell\u2019s employees and contractors finished the year with a significant 14% improvement in our safety performance. During 2018, our injury rate was challenged by the need to improve upon the safety performance at the facilities we acquired from A. Schulman.","We are diligently working to ensure all of our employees, contractors, assets and the communities in which we operate, finish the day in the same or better condition than they were at the start of the day. Our goal remains zero incidents or injuries every day of the year.","Let\u2019s turn to slide five and review some of the detail behind our fourth quarter and annual results. Diluted earnings were $1.79 per share for the quarter and we earned $12.01 during the full year. As shown in the chart on the left, after excluding significant non-tax -- non-cash tax benefits in 2017 and 2018, earnings per share increased by approximately 10% in 2018.","For the fourth quarter of 2018, we incurred $20 million of integration costs related to the Schulman acquisition that impacted quarterly earnings by $0.04 per share. Transaction and integration costs impacted the full year results by $0.14 per share.","In addition to typical fourth quarter seasonal headwinds seen in our industry, our business was challenged by the substantial 40% fall in the price of crude oil that began in early October. Customers often delay orders and destock inventories during periods of declining oil prices, in expectations of lower petrochemical and plastics prices.","Volumes decline in nearly every business across our six segments during the fourth quarter. As crude prices rebound in late December and January, our order volumes have improved. We have seen European and Asian industrial demand impacted by disruptions in the automotive sector arising from issues with Chinese consumer lending, new vehicle testing standards in Europe and trade uncertainties. We believe that global consumer demand remained strong and we will be closely watching trends in Asia after the Lunar New Year holidays in early February.","During our third quarter earnings call, I outlined three major plan maintenance outages that were estimated to impact fourth quarter earnings by total of $95 million, extended maintenance, low Rhine River water levels and feedstock supply disruptions at one of our suppliers increased the fourth quarter impact to our O&P-EAI segment by approximately $110 million.","Additionally, results were impacted by approximately $20 million by unplanned events in our Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining segments. Altogether, planned and unplanned downtime impacted our fourth quarter earnings by approximately $225 million. We do not expect such high levels of maintenance over the coming months.","During the first half of 2019, our only planned maintenance is scheduled for the first quarter in our O&P-Americas segment. We expect that first quarter downtime will impact earnings for the whole company by approximately $60 million to $70 million.","And now, Thomas, will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the year.","Thomas Aebischer","Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to slide six, which illustrates the developments of our business segments over the past two years. In 2018, LyondellBasell\u2019s business portfolio demonstrated remarkable resilience to changing market environments.","Our Intermediates and Derivatives segment profitability improved by approximately 35% and for the first time exceeding $2 billion in EBITDA.","Our Technology Group granted 16 licenses for new polyolefin plant designs that helped improve segment EBITDA by 47%. As seen in the chart, these improvements helped to offset declines in O&P-EAI.","The profitability offsets provided by the geographic and product diversity of our business portfolio is a recurring theme for LyondellBasell and an attribute that we seek to maintain, manage and extend as we consider strategic options for the company.","In Olefins and Polyolefins Americas, high industry margins for polyethylene helped to offset the majority of the decline in Olefin margins. Our business continues to benefit from strong demand and advantaged shale-based feedstocks that enabled us to retain 95% of our prior year profitability for the segment.","The results for our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment includes contributions from the A. Schulman acquisition beginning in late August 2018. Our progress towards our goal of $150 million in synergies is on schedule and will become more apparent during 2019.","Our Houston refinery run very well during 2018 and we completed all major scheduled maintenance for the next two years. We expect refining market conditions to rebalance during the first half of 2019 and look forward to strong refinery runs that will capture expected benefits of new sulfur regulations for marine fuels in late 2019 and 2020.","Now please turn to slide seven, where you can see that our businesses generated $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities during the fourth quarter, which contributed to $5.5 billion of cash generation for the year.","During the quarter, investment in capital expenditures increased to approximately $700 million, as we ramped up construction of our PO\/TBA plant and continue to move our Hyperzone plant forward towards start up.","As the stock market entered a correction during the fourth quarter, we significantly increased our share repurchases in response to lower share prices. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 11.5 million shares, the most in any quarter, since 2016. We returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share purchases during the fourth quarter.","In 2018, our opportunistic buyback strategy allowed us to repurchase 8% more shares than would have occurred, if we deployed the same amount of cash in equal amounts every trading day of the year.","The quarter closed with over $1.8 billion of cash and liquid investment on the balance sheet, we approximately -- with approximately $2.5 billion of unused and available credit facilities, we completed the quarter with a total liquidity in excess of $4 billion.","Turning to slide eight, let\u2019s review our capital deployment over the past six years. The light blue bars depict our cash generation from operating activities, which has ranged between $4.8 billion to $6 billion since 2013. The stack bars on the right depict our uses of cash ranked in order of priority.","Our highest priority is represented by the dark blue on the bottom, our progressively growing dividend. During 2018, we increased our dividend by 11%. This strong increase reflected an improved outlook after we updated our views on Tax Reform and the petrochemical industry. We have a top-quartile dividend that is currently yielding approximately 4.6% return.","Our next priority is maintenance capital to support the safety and reliability of our operations. Going forward, this baseline investment is approximately $1.1 billion per year. The remainder of the orange bar is allocated to profit generating capital investment to support growth projects. We estimate this investment will increase to $1.7 billion in 2019.","The gray bars reflect our share repurchases. We have returned over $18 billion in share repurchases since the inception of the program. Our buybacks add up to over 280 -- 208 million shares or 36% of the shares that were outstanding in 2013 at the inception of the program. Opportunistic share repurchase will continue to be a component of our capital deployment.","The green bar represents last year\u2019s A. Schulman transaction, our first significant acquisition. We continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet that provides optionality to pursue value creating opportunities and we will continuously reevaluate the relative merits of organic projects, grows through M&A and share repurchases to optimize returns for our investors.","Now please turn to slide nine, where I would like to address some of your annual modeling questions for 2019. Regarding capital, we are currently planning to invest approximately $2.8 billion during 2019 to support both our base maintenance and growth programs. Approximately 60% is targeted towards profit generating growth, the majority of this growth investment in 2019 will be dedicated to the new PO\/TBA plant.","Although not all plants are finalized, we estimate capital spending will average $2.8 billion annually through 2021. For 2019, we have a fairly typical plant maintenance schedule, activities during the year will impact annual EBITDA by approximately $160 million to $200 million.","In addition to the first quarter plant maintenance in O&P Americas mentioned by Bob the segment will also have a cracker turnaround in the third quarter that is expected to impact EBITDA by approximately $70 to $80 million.","In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment we have planned maintenance event that will impact EBITDA by approximately $30 million to $40 million in each of the third and fourth quarter.","Our net cash interest expense for 2019 is expected to be approximately $400 million. 2019 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.3 billion.","We plan to make regular pension contribution in 2019, that total $110 million and we estimate the pension expense of approximately $90 million.","We currently expect that 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 20% and that our cash tax rate will be slightly lower than the effective tax rate.","I will now turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Thank you.","Bob Patel","Thank you, Thomas. Let\u2019s turn to slide 10 and review our segment results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $631 million, a $73 million decrease versus the third quarter.","For the full year, segment EBITDA was approximately $2.8 billion. Relative to the third quarter 2018, Olefins results improved by approximately $70 million due to higher ethylene prices and the declining Gulf Coast ethane costs.","Our cracker operating rates averaged 93% during the fourth quarter, exceeding the average industry performance of 87%. Approximately 80% of our ethylene production was from ethane and 94% came from NGLs.","Polyolefin results were approximately $115 million lower than the prior period primarily due to a $0.04 per pound decline in polyethylene spread over ethylene. For the full year, results decreased by $137 million, Olefin results declined by approximately $445 million primarily due to a $0.06 per pound reduction in ethylene price.","Spread improvements in polyethylene and polypropylene of $0.07 per pound and $0.03 per pound, respectively, drove an approximately $360 million improvement in polyolefins to mostly offset the declines in Olefins.","IHS is currently forecasting relatively stable polyethylene chain margins for the first quarter. We are optimistic that 2019 will offer our earnings growth for the segment has the pace of polyethylene capacity additions slows, while global demand growth remained steady.","Please turn to slide 11 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segments. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $127 million or $135 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was $1.2 billion. We continue to optimize our portfolio in the fourth quarter by divesting a carbon black subsidiary in France. This benefited the quarter by $36 million.","Compared to the third quarter, Olefins results decreased by approximately $75 million primarily driven by a decline in volume, combined Polyolefin results decreased approximately $35 million driven by decreased margins, equity income decreased by $43 million primarily due to planned maintenance at our Polish, Korean and Saudi joint ventures.","Full year EBITDA results were $764 million lower than 2017. 2017 benefited from a gain of $108 million on the sale of our interest in Geosel, 2018 results included the benefit from the sale of our carbon black subsidiary and a favorable impact of approximately $95 million due to an increase in the euro versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate relative to 2017.","Olefin results for the full year decreased approximately $370 million compared to 2017. Increased feedstock costs during most of the year resulted in margin declines, while planned and unplanned maintenance and low Rhine River levels resulted in a volume decrease of approximately 10%.","Combined Polyolefins results decreased approximately $345 million due to $0.03 per pound and $0.02 per pound lower spreads in polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. Joint venture equity income decreased by $46 million primarily due to lower Polyolefins spreads. In January, demand is improving, following the typical seasonal declines and destocking of the fourth quarter.","On slide 12, let\u2019s take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $379 million, a decline of $125 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated over $2 billion setting an annual record and improving over the prior year by $521 million.","Fourth quarter PO and Derivatives results decreased by approximately $10 million when compared with the prior period, primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by higher margins, Intermediate Chemicals decreased $65 million primarily due to reduced styrene and acetyls margins, Oxyfuels and Related Products results decreased approximately $40 million driven by margin declines due to higher ethanol pricing relative to crude oil and a volume decline due to planned maintenance.","During 2018, the $521 million improvement in EBITDA was largely driven by margin improvements across all products due to tight market conditions and improved contracting strategies. We are very proud of the team\u2019s accomplishments in 2018 and we expect continued benefits from this work in future years.","While IHS is forecasting some moderation in methanol pricing for the first quarter, we should see improved PO and Derivatives volumes for the segment due to the completion of the planned maintenance at our Bayport, Texas facility during the fourth quarter.","Slide 13 charts the full year results from I&D business improvements we discussed during our second quarter earnings call. You might recall that while the majority of the increased profitability was attributable to tight market conditions and reduced maintenance downtime at our facilities, we also described LyondellBasell\u2019s improved contracting strategies and reliability as sources of durable improvements that should persist beyond 2018.","Historically, our Intermediates and Derivatives segment generated relatively consistent EBITDA that averaged approximately $1.5 billion per year. We believe our new midpoint in typical markets will be approximately $1.7 billion, while the strong markets seen in 2018 may moderate, we do not believe these improved margins will fully revert in 2019.","In addition, we have not stopped pursuing self-help within this business. This year we expect I&D contracting improvements to provide an additional $100 million of annual EBITDA for the segment starting in mid 2019.","On slide 14, let\u2019s review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $86 million, a $16 million improvement over the prior period. For the full year, EBITDA was $400 million. Fourth quarter transaction and integration costs were $20 million.","Compounding and Solutions results improved approximately $15 million over the third quarter, as we realized the full quarter of contribution from the addition of A. Schulman product lines. This was partially offset by volume and margin declines in polypropylene compounds.","Advanced Polymers results decreased approximately $15 million due to lower margins and volumes. Full year EBITDA results for the segment were $38 million lower than 2017. Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition impacted the segment by a $69 million in 2018.","Compounding and Solutions results improved approximately $15 million, with higher volumes from new product lines, partially offset by lower volume and margin in polypropylene compounds.","Advanced Polymers results increased approximately $15 million due to higher volumes. Integration activities are well underway and we have captured $47 million in forward annualized run rate synergies as of December 31st. We expect to see continued improvement in this segment, as we begin 2019 with a return of higher seasonal volumes and our continued focus on capturing value from the integration activities.","Turning to slide 15, let\u2019s discuss the performance of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was negative $84 million, $168 million decline from the third quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was $167 million or a $10 million improvement over 2017.","Planned maintenance on one of our two crude and coker trains was completed in November. As a result, the average crude throughput was 184,000 barrels per day or 48,000 barrels per day less than the third quarter. With this work behind us, the Refinery is prepared to run full rates for the next two years and benefit from expected market opportunities.","In the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread declined significantly, averaging less than an $11 per barrel for the first quarter and only $9.57 during November. Over the previous 12 years, the Maya 2-1-1 has been below $10 for only one month in December of 2011. The average over this time period is more than $22 per barrel. Spreads are improving as Pemex adjusts a monthly K factor of the Maya crude oil price formula to ensure that Mexican crude remains competitively priced for the U.S. Gulf Coast refining market.","For the full year, Refining margins increased when compared with 2017 due to discounted Canadian crude pricing and improved fluid catalytic cracker conversion rates. Crude throughput was 231,000 barrels per day in 2018, slightly lower than 2017. Absent our recent planned maintenance, throughput would have averaged 256,000 barrels per day for the full year. I\u2019d like to congratulate our refinery team for their diligent work and dedication to improve our Refinery reliability.","With our planned maintenance completed, we look forward to stronger contributions from our Refinery in 2019 as we continue to benefit from improved reliability and an increase to Maya 2-1-1 crack spread.","I would not like to turn to slide 16 and speak with you about a topic of growing global concern, the management of plastic waste. I think most of you are well aware of how billions of people benefit from advances in plastic. In fact, our products are well aligned with the United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals such as a reducing hunger and food spoilage by durable packaging. Delivering safe drinking water with plastic pipes and reducing energy consumption with innovative materials.","However, we now face the growing problem of what to do with the plastic once it has served its initial purpose. The concern over plastic waste management is leading governments and consumers to consider bans on plastic straws and bags.","But these products make up only a small fraction of the plastic waste that ends up in our oceans. Some suggests that we should replace all plastics with alternative materials, but most alternatives bring higher overall environmental and economic costs.","On slide 17, I am very proud to highlight an alliance formed by LyondellBasell along with more than 25 of our industry peers and other participants across the value chain that make, use, sell, process, collect and recycle plastics. Together, we have committed over $1 billion with the goal of investing $1.5 billion over the next five years in collaborative partnerships to advance meaningful solutions that eliminate plastic waste in our environment.","The alliance\u2019s approach is based on four pillars, infrastructure that stops plastic waste from entering the environment, innovation in materials, technologies and business models that increased the value of plastic waste, engagement with partners and government, business and consumers to enable solutions, and meaningful projects to cleanup plastic waste that has already escaped into our environment, new infrastructure to prevent and cleanup plastic waste is especially important in emerging economies where collection practices often lag the developed world.","Once plastic is collected and appropriately sorted, the waste can become a valuable feedstock for technologies that create versatile new materials from these post-used plastics. LyondellBasell\u2019s QCP recycling joint venture with Suez is an example of an innovative business model that embraces this vision for a circular plastics economy.","Education and engagement with governments, businesses and communities is critical to the success of these initiatives. The collaborative work of our alliance will be more powerful and efficient than fragmented efforts by each member of company working alone.","Our surveys show that 10 rivers transport more than 90% of the river based plastics to the ocean and more than 50% of land based plastic waste leakage comes from only five countries. There will be a focus on developing solutions that stop this leakage at their sources and cleanup areas with the existing plastic waste by recognizing the value of reusing plastic.","While we certainly have an immense challenge ahead of us, I am confident that our alliance will find meaningful solutions to help end plastic waste and create a sustainable future for our industry and our planet.","Now let\u2019s turn to slide 18 and discuss the outlook for 2019. Ethylene feedstocks were volatile during the second half of 2018 with U.S. Gulf Coast ethane prices spiking up in September and then reverting in November.","As we discussed during our third quarter earnings call, LyondellBasell has the optionality across our U.S. assets with ethylene production from both low cost Midwest ethane and feedstock flexibility at our Gulf Coast crackers.","NGL prices are likely to show some volatility during 2019 with increased demand from the remaining new ethylene crackers likely to arrive ahead of planned NGL pipeline and fractionation capacity additions.","We expect that this pattern of prolong startups for ethylene crackers along with NGL supply additions will smooth the path forward towards forecast for a return to plentiful feedstock availability within the next year. We are encouraged by a forecast for polyethylene demand growth to continue with long-term historical ranges of 4% to 5%.","Over the past three years, capacity additions have surpassed demand and moderated operating rates, with less global capacity scheduled to start-up during 2019 and 2020, we believe that LyondellBasell\u2019s new Hyperzone HDPE capacity will find favorable markets as we ramp-up during the second half of this year.","Turning to slide 19, let me summarize the year\u2019s highlights. In 2018, our strong earnings were supported by record annual EBITDA in our Intermediates and Derivatives and Technology segments. We will continue to benefit from some of the improvements from both segments through contracting changes in I&D and licensing growth in Technology.","Our company generated approximately $5.5 billion of cash from operating activities. This strong cash generation contributed to growth through profit generating capital investments and the acquisition of A. Schulman.","Furthermore, we continue to provide significant shareholder returns through a growing top-quartile dividend and $1.9 billion in share repurchases. By completing the acquisition of A. Schulman, we have created the world\u2019s largest plastics compounding business and we are well underway with integration activities that are capturing significant synergies in our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.","Our strong cash flows and healthy balance sheet leave us well-positioned to take advantage of additional value creating inorganic opportunities. In 2018, we advance on the construction of our Hyperzone polyethylene plant and we look forward to the added profitability will contribute to our O&P Americas segment, following the startup in the third quarter.","Last August, we also began construction of PO\/TBA plant that will start up in 2021 providing further earnings growth for our I&D segment. We move forward on sustainable solutions for our company by forming quality circular polymers, our premium plastics recycling joint venture with Suez.","And in collaboration with our industry leaders we formed the alliance to end plastic waste to generate sustainable global solutions for plastic waste that will benefit our industry and the environment.","Going into 2019, we look forward to increase production and availability of shale-based feedstocks and a moderation in the pace of capacity additions that should provide a favorable environment for our new HDPE capacity and that allow us to maximize value from our diverse global business portfolio.","With that said, we are now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning, fellows.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Duffy Fischer","First question, IHS is calling last year polyethylene demand up about 7%, which is pretty meaningfully higher than, say, the 20-year run rate. One, would you agree with that, and two, where was that extra demand coming from, what caused that to accelerate in your mind?","Bob Patel","So, Duffy, we in fact did see that especially in the first three quarters of the year, quite a bit of it was in the Pipe and Packaging segment of the business. So not only here in the U.S., but more exports as well which drove global demand growth.","Duffy Fischer","Okay. And then on the supply side, again several of the global consultants now have less -- they would have in excess of 20 new naphtha plants coming online in China. They kind of call it 2021 and beyond, obviously you guys got some insight into that with your licensing business. How should we think about what the knowledge base you have kind of across that space, what will that wave look like, obviously it\u2019s not going to be that many, but is it 10, is it 15, how many in that mid 20s periods should we think about naphtha crackers in China?","Bob Patel","Yeah. Duffy, as we have our discussions, we don\u2019t see that magnitude in that timeframe, a lot of them are under consideration. But I would say the timeline is much later than what\u2019s described and so we will look for those updates as those projects reach final investment decisions, but we expect that -- those will go forward further in terms of timing.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you guys.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter. Your line is open.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","David Begleiter","Bob, just some on Braskem, is there a point where you need to make a decision either way and just move forward as is has been sorry to, say, dragging on for quite a while here?","Bob Patel","Yeah. Well, David, we have -- it\u2019s a very -- as I have talked about in the past it\u2019s a very complex transactions. And in terms of the timeline, the part of the protracted timeline has been the pause because of the change in government and given sort of the shareholder ownership that you all know about Braskem.","So I can tell you that we have completed very high quality due diligence. We have a few follow-up items. But I think as we sit here today, we better understand issues and value creation drivers. We had been in discussions with relevant stakeholders, including Auto Brasch. We don\u2019t know whether these discussions will lead to an agreement. We will -- and but I can tell you we\u2019d only move forward at the right price and if we believe the transaction creates significant value for all of our stakeholders.","David Begleiter","Very helpful. And just one last thing, Bob, on O&P Americas EBITDA in 2019, I think, you said you think you can grow this business in \u201819 versus \u201818. Can you provide a little more color on that thought process, given again some new capacity coming on stream and low polyethylene prices in Q4?","Bob Patel","Yeah. I think a lot of that, David, is the Hyperzone plant, our new polyethylene capacity coming online. You will recall today, ethylene margins are -- have been very thin, so to the extent that we can integrate downstream and capture more of the ethane to polyethylene chain margin that will contribute and it\u2019s a world scale plant. So it will make a difference in terms of the O&P Americas profitability.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Bob are you -- I am looking at your table two, with the volume that you sold, obviously in polyethylene in the U.S. it was the lowest number on that page and I am assuming the same is true in many of the other products around the world. So are you carrying a lot of inventory into 2019 and assuming you run at usual production rate should we -- should 2019 be a much bigger volume year on an organic basis?","Bob Patel","Yeah. So in terms of inventory, no, we are not carrying unusually high amounts of inventory across our entire system. So I think there is some inventory build for turnaround that we are expecting here in the U.S. of our largest polyethylene plant. It\u2019s a 2 billion pound per year of polyethylene plant that will have a turnaround in the Q1.","Otherwise, the inventories, we don\u2019t see is being high across the system. And frankly, downstream because the destocking happened and we think that inventories are quite moderate or kind of below average downstream as well.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And as a -- as a -- go ahead.","Thomas Aebischer","When you look at the inventory difference year-over-year on a cash basis, it\u2019s about a $90 million change versus 2017, so really small.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. And in the I&D business, one of the bright spots in 2018 was the acetyls chain and the spot margins, if you look at those have just come in considerably since the third quarter of \u201818, what are your expectations for those margins can get back to in 2019?","Bob Patel","Well, Vincent, I mean, it\u2019s difficult to predict where they will go. But you have seen the potential in \u201818 and the correction has been fairly significant. So we will have to see how that develops. I think when you think about our I&D business, the methanol, the acetyls and the styrene margins tend to be the most dynamic part of the portfolio.","But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, underlying all of that, we have more contracting improvements that will accrue to the earnings of I&D starting about mid-year. So, I think, we have reached that sort of the base in I&D from 1.5 to 1.7 and if styrene and methanol markets turn out to be directionally what they were in \u201818, then we should have another very strong year in I&D.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Sounds great. Thanks so much.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov. Your line is open, sir.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. You indicated in one of the slides where your -- you expect PO\/TBA earnings to be based on the average for 2014, 2018 margins. But where are the margins today relative to that historical average?","Bob Patel","I don\u2019t know where the margins are today versus the historical average. But we tend to take periods of time when we communicate, because if we take narrower timeframes, price margins can be much higher or lower. So we are very constructive about the market.","And if you think about TBA, and specifically, MTBE last year, especially in the second half, gasoline demand and gasoline margins were quite low. So we think some improvement in that in addition to lower butane prices which we saw during the winter. We think those that boded very well for the MTBE part of our I&D business.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you, Bob. And you spend some time in recycling, how strong is the business case for some capital deployment into -- to recycling today and also do you see sort of some threat to plastics demand in the near-term and over the next 12 months, 24 months, especially in Europe from government policies here?","Bob Patel","Well, so first of all, what we have learned from our QCP joint venture is that, collection and segregation are very important and in the past what has ailed the recycling business is this -- that the input is very mixed. And so I think that\u2019s what\u2019s the differential about our joint venture with Suez as we get relatively segregated polyolefin waste that and is further segregated in our venture and then washed and then recycled.","In terms of impact on demand, I think, it will take a bit of time for the infrastructure to get in place and to be built out. So in the near-term, we don\u2019t expect, meaning the next two years, three years, four years and we don\u2019t expect a meaningful impact, and we will just have to watch and see the pace of infrastructure growth.","In terms of Europe, I can tell you that even in recent meetings with that my team has had with leadership in Brussels, the focus is more on a circular economy rather than de-selection of plastics and that was again reaffirmed in recent discussions. So we think that our approach with the QCP venture is very well placed and the idea for us is to now build out that platform throughout Europe, and we are focused on doing that.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Koort. Your line is open.","Dylan Campbell","Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. A quick question, one of your competitors is pushing a price increase for, they were for January and they are for February for polyethylene in Americas. I guess what is Lyondell\u2019s expectation for the first quarter here for polyethylene price and given that at least one consultant is saying that inventory levels are at the highest level and maybe a decade?","Bob Patel","Well, first of all, I don\u2019t want to comment on direction of prices here on the call. But I can tell you that as we look at January, we are seeing in the U.S. more return to more normal demand and we expect as February, March and April progress, seasonally we tend to see an uptick in demand, because of packaging and so on, and what we hear from our customers is that, that seasonal uptick in demand should be expected.","And if you think about downstream inventories, because of the destocking that occurred with the reducing oil price, we think downstream inventory are quite lean. So when you look at inventories, you really have to look at the inventories in the chain rather than just in one part of the chain.","And so, I think, all this will normalize and our sense is, if you step back and look at operating rates globally, they still look to be among the highest we have seen in polyethylene in the past four years.","So I think the setup is very constructive for the entire year, given that demand typically grows in the first two quarters to three quarters of the year. And so, I mean, I think, operating rates are high and that points to a very constructive market.","Dylan Campbell","Got it. Thank you. And I guess a quick clarification question. You guys mentioned, polyethylene to ethylene spreads declined $0.04 per pound sequentially quarter-over-quarter. But I guess if I look in your data supplement, polyethylene prices declined by only $0.01 per pound to $0.02 per pound and ethylene was fairly flat quarter-over-quarter. I guess was Lyondell selling a bigger discount versus the market or can you just help working me through that math?","Bob Patel","Sure. So that you are referring to the polyethylene gasoline margin for us and the way we transfer ethylene price internally is, it\u2019s a spot -- it\u2019s a blend of contract and spot and you will note that in Q4 we saw a rising spot price of ethylene. So really there was more margin in Olefins and a little bit less in polyethylene. It\u2019s not a reflection on the revenue of polyethylene.","Dylan Campbell","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan. Your line is open sir.","Arun Viswanathan","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, first off, just wanted to ask about kind of the level of earnings here was kind of penetrated pretty substantially in Q4 to 1.2, 1.3, I guess we saw like a 1.4, 1.5 in Q4 of \u201816. I guess what gives you guys the confidence in this snap back in Q2 through Q4. I guess, I am just curious on Europe and Refining as well, feedstocks have come down in Europe, is there a possibility that you could see some recovery there or would be -- or pricing would be challenged to take in a lower feedstock environment like that? Thanks.","Bob Patel","Yeah. Thanks, Arun. First of all, so if you think about Q4, there were kind of three big drivers that we think are kind of one-offs. First of all, we talked about the environment of declining crude oil price and the related destocking, and how price moves in that kind of environment, a 40% decline in one quarter is really enormous and that\u2019s largely played out and oil prices rebounded. So we think that\u2019s constructive as we look at first half of \u201819.","In terms of Europe and EAI, just from one cracker turnaround that extended past our planned window and the Rhine River and some, so we had one of our suppliers of feedstock had a disruption, that all we think impacted earnings by about $100 million in Q4 largely behind us. Rhine River is back to normal levels, our cracker is expected to be for most of the quarter at full rate, so $100 million impact we think is really isolated to Q4.","And then in Refining, I mean, we are sitting here with Maya 2-1-1 spreads that are the lowest we have seen since the \u201808 timeframe and what\u2019s driven that is a few factors. First of all, you will recall that the K -- the so called K factor is what get determines the delta between Mexican crude and light crude, if you will, that K factor has been slow to adjust, so the light-heavy differential has been almost zero of late.","So we think that will revert, we are already seeing some correction to the K factor and we expect more to come and of a long gasoline market that I described, which may persist, I don\u2019t know. But I do think the light-heavy differential and in particular, how Maya is priced, we should see improvement as the quarter progresses. So largely the maintenance impacts in Europe were isolated to one unit and they are kind of behind us.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up, maybe, could you -- I don\u2019t know what you can say on this, but maybe if you could just explain, maybe from a high level some of the strategic benefits in a potential Braskem deal, would it allow you to reduce your long ethylene position and it obviously will grow in polypropylene. But and then also how do you feel about the vinyls chain and participating there, is that something that is, would be considered core to you guys? Thanks.","Bob Patel","Yeah. So in terms of the strategic merits, I mean, I think, and first of all, when you think about Brazil. The outlook for Brazil continues to improve and the expectations are positive under the new government. So and it\u2019s an economy, if you look at the IMF report, it\u2019s one of the few in the world that\u2019s expected to grow at a reasonably good rates. We think longer-term the economy there hold good potential, a scenario where we don\u2019t have much of a position, so it makes us even more of a global producer and seller of Polyolefins.","In the case of the U.S. and Europe there is in part a consolidation opportunity and also a lot of our technology is deployed within Braskem. So those are just a few of the merits -- strategic merits of a transaction like that. As I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s got to be at the right price and it has to be significantly value creating for our shareholders.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar. Your line is open.","PJ Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","PJ Juvekar","On Refining, you didn\u2019t mention IMO 2020 and we are hearing some mixed reviews about the benefit of IMO 2020 to GRMs, I was wondering if you could comment on that?","Bob Patel","Well, thank you for asking that. I was hoping somebody would ask me, so I could work it into my commentary. I mean, I think, P.J., IMO we still see meaningful impact, especially because we have such a heavy crude processing refinery.","Yes, recent press suggests that maybe some of the impact will be muted. We actually think if we look at forward curves now perhaps the expectations have corrected to the low side, whereas perhaps at the end of last year, there was a little bit more enthusiasm.","We do continue to believe that there will be a positive impact from IMO starting in late Q3 into Q4 as the inventory is rotated into the lower sulfur and diesel and that\u2019s deployed across the network around the world and then 2020 we do expect some meaningful impact from IMO 2020.","So but the thing we can control is, we have got to operate well, and I think, we have positioned ourselves by completing all of our maintenance to run at full rates and capture whatever opportunity lies ahead and I continue to think that there will be a meaningful benefit and late this year into 2020.","PJ Juvekar","Great. Thank you. And secondly, I am glad to see you taking the lead on plastic recycling issue. I think the industry needed to do something there. I guess when you look at plastic recycling, the issue has been the economics of recycling and recycling never made any money in developed markets like the U.S., maybe it makes money in the emerging markets because of cheaper labor, but can you talk about the economics of that and how do you work that into the solution?","Bob Patel","Well, I think, P.J., well, first of all, I appreciate the recognition in terms of the momentum around the alliance and so on, and it\u2019s -- credit goes to a lot of companies who have been really a catalyst for getting this going.","In terms of the economics of recycling, as I mentioned earlier, really better collection and segregation of the source is critical to the economics and then building up scale and doing the recycling closer to where the waste is collected as it\u2019s adding costs by moving waste around the world detracts from the economics.","So -- and to tell you that\u2019s what we are focused on as -- with the QCP venture in Europe and we believe it\u2019s a model that can be replicated, certainly within Europe and as we develop that further we will think about other jurisdictions around the world.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Bob Patel","All right. Thank you.","David Kinney","Yeah. If we could limit to one question, we still have eight folks in the queue and I don\u2019t want to take up your lunch hour there today. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Jonas Oxgaard","If we are sticking to the plastic waste here, you have a slide there 17 it shows four different pillars. Can you talk a little bit about how do you actually intend to or how does the alliance intend to invest here? Are they giving grants to companies, universities, is that you are expected to do it in-house? And can you give us a little bit of a breakdown on how much do you think is going to be focused on each of the four pillars?","Bob Patel","Well, so that the -- in terms of the allocation, there will be -- we will move in parallel on all four. There is not waiting more strongly towards one or the other. But if you were to go to the website, endplasticwaste.org you can see the initial actions the alliance will take which were backing and supporting an effort through a company called Renewlogy that is converting waste plastic into fuel. There is a fund called Circulate Capital that\u2019s funding initiatives around the world that directionally end plastic waste.","So, Jonas, I\u2019d encourage you to look at that and that\u2019s going to be -- we want to move on all four fronts. We do believe that we have got a slow down and stop which entering the environment, we need to address what\u2019s already in the environment and education and innovation are going to be what\u2019s going to make this more sort of structural and sustainable part in the fund over the long period of time.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts. Your line is open.","John Roberts","Thank you. Slide 18 talks about the expected volatility in ethane, which I assume is even after the Sasol cracker has been pushed out to the back end of this year. Do you think the industry needs to do additional here in the short-term to maybe pulling forward some downtime to ease up on the ethane pressures that might cause another spike?","Bob Patel","Yeah. So, John, that some of the news around the delays is quite fresh and we have not included that in our analysis here. But indeed you are right that what I have read certainly says that, there are some incremental delays in some of the new crackers coming.","So our view is that in a lower oil price environment like we have and you will recall last year we said that more of the NGLs that are coming from the Permian contain more butane and propane as ethane was rejected, which caused kind of this run up in ethane.","All of this is to say that alternative feedstocks like propane, butane, liquids will be very competitive at lower oil price, more propane and butane available especially after we get through the winter season and export capacity in the near-term is we don\u2019t know of any really big new capacity coming for propane.","So I think that in the environment that we are in, you could say that the volatility should be less, if at all, especially with the delays. So -- and you saw some evidence of that in Q4 when oil price dropped, you actually saw propane and butane become a lot cheaper and they were very competitive as feedstocks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good morning.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Kevin McCarthy","Bob, I was wondering if you could elaborate on your outlook for olefins and polyolefins EAI. If you look back to the prior oil collapse in late \u201814, that segment really enjoyed a nice year in 2015, up nearly $450 million, and listening to you today, it doesn\u2019t sound so you are as constructive on that segment relative to the Americas, for example, notwithstanding, some of the one-timers, Rhine River, et cetera. So would you compare and contrast the current environment versus what we saw in the following oil collapse or the previous one, sorry?","Bob Patel","Right. So, Kevin, in the Q4 we had a significant reset in prices and I think that\u2019s, because of oil price declining, that\u2019s occurred. And my team tells me that in January orders look very good in Europe, so we have seen demand come back. And so I am actually quite constructive about the supply\/demand balance in Europe. So and I think there will be some impetus to improve profitability as the year goes on.","Again, if you step back and you look at global operating rates rising this year and now that supply chain could reset because of the declining oil price we are coming into a seasonally strong period. This is a -- all of this is a set up for improving profitability as we work through the first half of the year. And I think EAI should benefit from the higher global operating rates and the oil price correction behind us, so I am actually quite positive about EAI.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch. Your line is open.","Frank Mitsch","Hey. Good morning. And, Bob, I guess, I now have to start watching your interaction at industry events with Frank Bozich. Hey, you said earlier that you are closely watching Asia post Chinese New Year, obviously, it starts in less than a week and I am curious as to what your best guesses as to what we will see particularly with respect to the automotive markets, obviously, very important for polypropylene. What are your expectations that we are going to see in a few weeks\u2019 time there?","Bob Patel","Well, I think, ultimately, we will see what happens in about 10 days or 14 days. But, I think, Frank, given that we have been through a pretty big destocking cycle and my view at least on the packaging and the non-durable side is that, demand is growing and all of sort of the demographic factors that we have discussed in the past that is still in place.","In terms of automotive, I think, credit is loosening over there and the middle class is growing. So it seems to me that demand for automobiles should be constructive, barring some event that none of us can predict. So I am quite optimistic and hopeful about what we will see post Chinese New Year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed. Your line is open.","Hassan Ahmed","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning, Hassan.","Hassan Ahmed","Well, the question on the U.S. ethylene market, as we took a look at \u201818, obviously, there was extreme volatility I\u2019d actually even call it a fairly sloppy market. Beyond obviously oil doing what it did, I think, one of the main reasons was obviously a mismatch between ethylene capacity coming online, derivatives not sort of following suit immediately. It seems now that as we look at \u201819, both ethylene and deriv capacity seems to be coming online in lockstep. So is it fair to assume that the ethylene market in the U.S. should not actually see the sort of volatility we saw last year?","Bob Patel","Indeed, I mean, I think, Hassan, the volatility could come from the degree of reliability we see in the various crackers and as new very large world scale units come online, can imagine if one 3 billion pound cracker comes offline and that could cause a significant change in the supply\/demand balance.","The other thing that, I think, we will have to watch is the timing of derivative expansions versus cracker expansions. If derivative expansions come sooner, that could actually cause more firmness in the ethylene market. I think the opposite is unlikely, with anything, derivatives could come a little bit earlier, especially in one or two projects that are more integrated in terms of their setup.","Thomas Aebischer","It\u2019s not just polyethylene, it\u2019s glycols, it\u2019s alpha-olefins and lot of other ethylene consumers as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Oils rebounded since the beginning of the year from roughly 50 to 60 in brent terms, but hopefully and really hasn\u2019t moved in the United States, maybe polymer grade is still a little bit under $0.40 and it\u2019s come down from $0.60. Can you talk about some of the dynamics that have pushed propylene down, what are your expectations for this year and are you surprised that it hasn\u2019t moved?","Bob Patel","Well, I think, Jeff, as we see more PDH capacity come into the market, it will probably reduce the volatility of propylene, because now you have a bigger base that generally runs and is not dependent on feedstock flexibility, right.","So that\u2019s been part of the source of propylene price volatility is when feedstocks change in the past that it had a big impact on the amount of propylene volume that was available. But now as the base of PDH capacity grows, it will probably act to stabilize and maybe reduce some of the volatility.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne. Your line is open.","Ian Bennett","Hi. Thanks. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. The past couple of quarters as Lyondell\u2019s EBITDA has been declining, your net debt has been increasing to buy back more stock and I think that sends a strong message about your view of the longer term trajectory of the earnings and value of this business. If EBITDA were to continue to decline, how willing are you two continue to increase net debt to buy back stock and does that affect your ability at all to pursue Braskem?","Bob Patel","Yeah. I will have -- Thomas will take that question.","Thomas Aebischer","Well, thank you, Ian, for the question. So, I think, if you look, so first of all, we took a significant advantage of attractive share price, especially in the fourth quarter. We have always said that we are buying back our own share opportunistically.","I think it\u2019s, when you ask your question it\u2019s important to note that the -- we obviously increased net debt, you are absolutely right. But the main reason to increase net debt or the reason is actually the Schulman acquisition. So if you look at cash flow from operating activity, is $5.5 billion for the year. We have CapEx of $2.1 billion and dividend and share buybacks of $3.1 billion. So for the share buyback program we actually did what we always said, that we are using excess cash flow to buy back our own shares.","Now we are at a point where we have to make decisions as the share price stays attractive to actually raise debt in order to replenish our debt portfolio, which we have used the cash to -- for the acquisition of Schulman. So we have sufficient funds as I said, the liquidity is about $4 billion. We have sufficient funds to pursue our growth initiatives, as well as to continue with our share buybacks opportunistically.","Bob Patel","Yeah. And Ian, if you think, step back and strategically look at what we have been doing. We have been looking to create shareholder value by pulling a number of levers. We had meaningful organic growth in \u201818, inorganic growth with the Schulman acquisition and we bought back a meaningful number of our shares.","So I think you ought to look for that to continue, because this is a company that has many levers and we will look for the one that creates the most value as we think about deploying our operating cash flow or our balance sheet.","Operator","And our last question comes from Matthew Blair. Your line is open.","Matthew Blair","Hey. Good morning, Bob. So last quarter enterprise announced a couple of new PDH plants, we are wondering, if you can say whether you are a customer here and how might this affect your potential polypropylene and I guess potential PDH plant as well?","Bob Patel","Yeah. So with all of the other initiatives we have had going on, we have kind of, with the PP plant we are still considering it and certainly the buy versus build scenario on propylene is one that we are contemplating today. And as you know from your conference, I know, Jim very well, and I spent some time with them, so that\u2019s an option, depending on the economics of buy versus build. We will continue to evaluate that.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no other questions at this time.","Bob Patel","Okay. Great. Well let me offer a few closing remarks, if I may. So, after a challenging fourth quarter, where a typical seasonality was exacerbated by declines in crude oil. We are looking forward to rebounding demand from restocking of supply chains. In 2019 we will continue to accrue synergies in our APS segment from the Schulman acquisition.","We look forward to growth from our new Hyperzone production and anticipate an improving refining market, with a lighter planned maintenance schedule in 2019, we are really well prepared to maximize production to meet the needs of growing markets and our global business portfolio provides resilience, we are well-positioned to pursue any other value creating opportunities.","So thank you for your interest and we look forward to updating you in April on our first quarter results. With that we are adjourned.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect at this time. Have a wonderful day."],"13962":["LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today\u2019s presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Kinney","Thank you, Britney. Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell third quarter 2019 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today we will be discussing our business results while making references to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com\/investorrelations.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with other disclosures including the earnings release are also currently available on our website.","Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time today until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on December 1 by calling 888-568-0509 in the United States and 203-369-3479 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 5713.","During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives.","With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Patel","Thanks, Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide 3 and review the third quarter highlights.","During our Investor Day in September, we emphasized how our leading and advantaged portfolio of businesses is poised to deliver resilient performance and strong cash flows across a range of market conditions. The company delivered on this commitment during the third quarter with $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities.","Our third quarter EBITDA of $1.5 billion represents a decline of approximately 4% relative to the second quarter and 13% relative to the prior year. Third quarter earnings were $2.85 per share, which represents a 6% improvement over the previous quarter. This is our third consecutive quarter of increasing earnings per share.","The advantage of abundant low-cost natural gas liquid feed stocks continue to benefit our North American businesses. Demand for our consumer-driven non-durable products reflected typical seasonal strength with a 5% increase in our global polyethylene and polypropylene sales volume relative to the second quarter.","Industrial driven markets for durable products saw weaker margins and demand due to trade uncertainty. Despite the challenging market conditions, our portfolio of businesses performed well during the quarter continued to efficiently deliver outstanding cash flow.","Let's turn to slide 4 and review our approach to maximizing the returns from this cash generation. We have followed a consistent and disciplined capital allocation strategy that provides a sustainable balance between value-driven growth and strong shareholder returns. Our growth investments in new capacity are underway with our Hyperzone polyethylene capacity being commissioned as we speak.","We now expect sales volumes to ramp up during the first quarter of 2020 with increasing profitability throughout the year. Cost for the project is estimated at approximately $900 million. This project continues to be very attractive due to our advantaged feedstock position in North America and the differentiated technology, which will deliver new high-performing products to our customers.","During our recent Investor Day, many of you toured the construction of our new propylene oxide plant that is being built across two sites outside of Houston, in Channelview and Bayport. We continue to expect this plant will be completed in the second half of 2021 and further increase our cash generation during 2022. The box on the right of the slide illustrates our progress on additional value-driven opportunities.","In late September, we extended our long-term relationship with Enterprise as the anchor customer for their second propane dehydrogenation plant that will start in 2023. This contract provides LyondellBasell with additional propylene supply at cost-based economics to support our downstream capacity growth in propylene oxide.","Earlier in September, we announced a memorandum of understanding with Liaoning Bora Group to form a joint venture that will rapidly expand our global olefins and polyolefins network in China. The project provides LyondellBasell with the local production presence in a market that is growing at more than twice the rate of global GDP. This project is more than 50% complete and expected to begin operations in 2021.","Finally, we completed a tender offer in July that resulted in the repurchase of approximately 9.5% of our outstanding shares for $3.1 billion. These actions demonstrate our discipline and commitment to balancing growth with substantial returns to our shareholders.","Let's turn to slide 5 and discuss our safety results. Our emphasis on operating safely is embedded in our culture. It is never taken for granted. We realize that we need to work every day to cultivate processes and behaviors that support leading safety performance for our employees, contractors, our communities and our business partners. We will continue to maintain a consistent focus on safety, as we believe it underpins everything that we do.","Let's turn to slide 6 where we highlight LyondellBasell's activities in advancing our sustainability agenda. During the same week as our Investor Day in September, we published our second annual sustainability report. This report is on our website and it describes our goals and progress over the prior year.","Our company is also developing innovative business models that advance the circular economy. In addition to our PE and PP mechanical recycling business and usage of bio-based feedstocks to produce new plastics, last month we announced the construction of a new pilot facility in Italy for our MoReTec molecular recycling technology.","We are moving forward with these three business models to increase circularity and develop sustainable and profitable business platforms within the next decade. It's important to remember that plastics provide many benefits to society and will continue to do so in the future. However, we must address the issue of plastic waste. We have committed to pursue zero loss of plastic pallets from our production facilities and we are leading meaningful solutions to eliminate the leakage of plastic into the environment through the Alliance to End Plastic Waste.","Additionally, our company is targeting a 15% reduction in carbon dioxide emission intensity by 2030. We hope that you as our investors and stakeholders will take time to review our sustainability report and provide us with your feedback on our progress.","And now, Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the third quarter.","Thomas Aebischer","Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to slide 7 where you can see the growth of our earnings over the past three quarters. As Bob mentioned, third quarter earnings of $2.85 per share were supported by strong consumer driven seasonal demand for our products as well as our sizable share repurchases.","Third quarter results included an $85 million non-cash benefit from the settlement of prior tax year positions that increased earnings by $0.25 per share. Integration costs during the third quarter related to the Schulman acquisition impacted net income by $33 million or $0.10 per share. During the third quarter, we repurchased 37 million shares.","Now let's look more closely at our consistent and efficient cash flow performance on slide 8. Our businesses have generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities over each of the prior four calendar years and $5 billion over the trailing 12 months. With $1.1 billion required for sustaining capital expenditures, our free operating cash flow yield was 13.2% over the past 12 months.","Slide 9 describes our cash flow generation and deployment during a very active third quarter for our finance department. Cash flow from operating activities effectively doubled our starting balance of $1.9 billion. Debt increased by net $1.7 billion, during the third quarter. While the timing of the increase debt aligns with our July tender offer, you will recall that we invested approximately $1.9 billion of cash on hand in acquiring A. Schulman last year.","During the third quarter, we issued $1 billion in Eurobonds, in two tranches and used the proceeds to repay a term loan and a portion of our short-term debt. The coupon rates for the notes were the lowest in our company's history, 0.875% and 1.625% for seven- and 12-year terms respectively.","Near the end of September, we priced $1 billion in 30-year dollar notes, that's held in October. The 4.2% coupon rate for these notes is also the lowest in company history for U.S. bonds of this tenure. We used these proceeds to repay short-term debt.","During the third quarter, as mentioned before, we repurchased 37 million shares and in addition, paid dividend, returning a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders. Capital expenditure for the third quarter were approximately $740 million with roughly 60% invested in profit generating growth projects, with the remainder allocated to sustaining capital.","Our investment in growth has increased in second quarter. And we expect a similar trend over the remainder of the year, as we complete our Hyperzone PE plant and accelerate the activity on construction for our new PO\/TBA plant in Houston.","The quarter closed with approximately $1.1 billion of cash and liquid investments. Slide 10, illustrates the maturities of our long-term debt, after the October issuance. The two recent bond offerings reduced our weighted average cost of debt, by 42 basis points.","We have a well balanced maturity profile that reduces refinancing, risks and enables the company to benefit from a consistent presence in both, U.S. and euro fixed income markets. Let's turn to slide 11 and review our disciplined approach to capital deployment that we discussed in detail during our Investor Day.","The principal for our capital allocation strategy have remained consistent. Our businesses generate tremendous cash flows. We are first and foremost committed to a strong and progressive dividend.","We will make capital investments that sustain our manufacturing reliability. And expand our asset footprint. We will pursue value-minded inorganic growth opportunities. And return the surplus cash to share repurchases. All of these decisions points are underpinned by our commitment, to the flexibility provided by our strong investment-grade credit ratings.","With that, thank you very much. And I will turn the call back to, Bob. Thank you.","Bob Patel","Thank you, Thomas. As many of you know, Thomas will be retiring from the company in the coming weeks. I want to take this opportunity to thank Thomas for his hard work over the past four years to build and enhance our finance organization.","These contributions to the development of our growth strategy, and his leadership in standardizing several of our processes, I wish Thomas and his family all the best. I particularly wanted to thank Thomas for agreeing to help us manage a thoughtful transition for a successor Michael McMurray, who will join the company as an Executive Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer next Tuesday, November 5.","Michael joins us after serving as CFO for Owens Corning, in a career that spanned more than 30 years in various finance, treasury and investor relations roles, for Owens Corning and Royal Dutch Shell. I hope you will all join me in warmly welcoming Michael to LyondellBasell.","Now let's turn to slide 12 and review our third quarter EBITDA performance. Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio, continued to demonstrate strength and resiliency in a challenging market environment. EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.5 billion.","Profitability, for integrated polyethylene production remains strong in both the Americas and Europe with, industry benchmark chain margins of approximately $700 and $600 per ton respectively during the third quarter.","During the quarter, we maintained high crude processing rates at our Houston refinery and benefited from improved margins relative to the second quarter. Several of our intermediate chemicals businesses, mainly styrene suffered from weak margins due to lackluster industrial demand in a well-supplied market.","Let's begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on slide 13. Third quarter EBITDA was $653 million, $18 million higher than the second quarter. Profitability was driven by robust global demand and our capability to capture the benefits of abundant and affordable natural gas liquids, through our feedstock optimization.","Olefins results increased by $120 million compared to the second quarter. Margins expanded on higher ethylene sales prices and lower feedstock costs. Ethylene operating rates fell to 80% due to a planned maintenance turnaround that we completed at our Clinton, Iowa facility during the third quarter.","As propane and butane prices fell by nearly 20% in the third quarter, we captured value from the high feedstock flexibility across our fleet of six U.S. ethylene crackers. We increased utilization of propane and butane feedstocks by nearly 10 percentage points to 35% in the third quarter.","Polyolefin results decreased by about $100 million during the third quarter, Polyethylene spread over ethylene price declined by about $220 per ton, partly due to higher ethylene costs and declining polymer prices. Polyolefin volumes increased due to an increase in polyethylene exports.","We expect the fourth quarter will follow typical seasonal trends, with reduced demand as customers take holiday downtime. And seek to minimize year-end inventories. With approximately 80% of the new U.S. polyethylene capacity now in the market, this is an opportune time to review the impact of new capacity and polyethylene pricing.","Slide 14, illustrates quarterly contract price change, for the North American polyethylene industry, over the past five years. The green bars indicate increases, orange bars represent decreases. The amplitude and volatility of price changes during the 2018 and 2019 have been relatively moderate when compared to the prior four years. In fact, the net reported price change over the first three quarters of 2019 has been zero.","Industry statistics indicate that days of sales in inventory, fell in September, with export sales now representing 35% of production. Increasing exports, decreasing inventories and muted pricing responses, all imply that the new capacity is meeting demand in the global market.","Our view is that, the new capacity will create short-term fluctuations particularly in local markets. However, we believe the new capacity is ultimately needed and global polyethylene markets will remain relatively balanced, providing good profitability for advantaged producers such as LyondellBasell.","Now please turn to slide 15 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $291 million, a $40 million decrease compared to the second quarter. Underlying business results, were impacted by lower polyethylene chain margins, but supported by healthy polyolefins demand.","Olefins results decreased by about $10 million due to a small decline in volume, combined polyolefins results were comparable to the previous quarter. Polyethylene volume increased 10% over the second quarter, with customers returning to the market, after taking a pause during the second half of June.","Polyethylene margins declined offsetting the improvement in volume. Modest reductions in margins across our joint ventures contributed to a decline in equity income of approximately $15 million. We expect the fourth quarter to follow the same seasonal trend, as the Americas with reductions in year-end demand.","Please turn to slide 16. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $390 million, a $58 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Results were affected by a decline in margins, due to a well-supplied market for our intermediate Chemicals business, but bolstered by seasonally strong Oxyfuels profitability.","Intermediate Chemicals results decreased by $95 million compared to the second quarter, driven by a margin decline in all businesses, primarily styrene. We began planned maintenance at our Acetyls plant in La Porte in the third quarter, which will reduce volumes for both the third and fourth quarter.","Oxyfuels & Related Products results improved nearly $30 million as we saw margin increases driven by higher gasoline blend premium and lower butane feedstock prices. During October, oxyfuels margins have declined with weaker gasoline demand as the summer driving season ends. We expect typical fourth quarter seasonal declines for the segment and continued pressure from a well supplied market.","Now please turn to slide 17 to review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $102 million, an $18 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Results were impacted by increased integration costs and continued headwinds in the automotive sector partially offset by a modest improvement in construction demand. Included in the results were $43 million of integration costs for the third quarter, which impacted earnings by $0.10 per share.","Compounding & Solutions results were relatively unchanged due to the softness in the automotive market. Advanced Polymers results increased by $10 million. Third quarter performance was supported by improved seasonal demand from the roofing market. Our team is making continued progress on the integration efforts. In fact, we increased our two-year cost synergy target by $50 million to a total of $200 million.","At the end of the third quarter, we are capturing cost synergies at a forward annual run rate of approximately $125 million. We expect profitability for the segment to follow normal seasonal trends. Trade uncertainty and labor disruptions continue to affect the automotive industry and our business is likely to continue following the general sentiment for that market.","Turning to slide 18. Let's discuss the result for our Refining segment. EBITDA improved by $60 million over the second quarter to negative $6 million for the third quarter. We continue to demonstrate the benefits of our reliability program at the Houston refinery with crude throughput increasing to 264,000 barrels per day operating at 99% of nameplate capacity for the quarter.","Our Houston refinery processes heavy sour crude oils from Mexico, Canada and other locations. In the third quarter, refinery margins benefited from improved diesel spreads and stronger discounts for the portion of heavy sour crude oil we purchased on the open market in Houston. The U.S. refining market has been challenged by global disruptions in the supply of heavy sour crude oil resulting in a string of quarterly losses in our Refining segment.","During September, profitability was further impacted by unusual increases in the formula pricing from higher crude from Mexico. These pricing decisions have spurred us to pursue increased utilization of alternative crude oils for the long-term supply of our refining business. As the implementation of the IMO 2020 marine fuel regulation inches closer, we expect continued margin improvement in our refining results during the fourth quarter. We are well positioned to take advantage of this regulatory change by converting high sulfur crude oils into more environmentally friendly marine fuels.","Please turn to slide 19 as we review the results of our technology segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $83 million, a decrease of $24 million compared to the previous quarter. The business model for our technology segment is based upon the licensing of polymer production technologies and catalyst sales.","Individual contract terms and the timing of project milestones drives the pace of licensing revenues for the business. In the third quarter, we had fewer licensing milestones than the prior quarter, which resulted in reduced EBITDA. Catalyst sales volumes and licensing activity are projected to be strong during the fourth quarter.","On slide 20, let me summarize this quarter's results. During the quarter, we increased our earnings to $2.85 per share. Our profitability remained strong and generated cash from operating activities of $1.9 billion. Our company is delivering resilient performance in a challenging market where trade uncertainty and lack of confidence in the industrial sector has reduced demand for many of our products. The long-awaited polyethylene cycle is now upon us with approximately 80% of the U.S. capacity now online.","Polyethylene spreads over naphtha in Asia are approaching 10-year lows. With inventories largely destocked any improvement in industrial confidence is likely to reverse these trends and trigger restocking that should tighten markets and increase margins. In addition to the market improvements, LyondellBasell has tangible sources of cash flow growth that are independent of market sentiment.","During October, the looming implementation of the IMO 2020 marine fuel regulation drove favorable crude oil differentials and higher diesel spreads that improved profitability for our business in October. We will increase our polyethylene capacity and reduce our CapEx over the next year with the completion of our new Hyperzone plant. With higher earnings and lower capital spending, we expect additional cash flow to provide further support for our secure dividend and opportunistic share repurchases.","We continue to advance our growth objectives by pursuing a new partnership in China and a propylene supply agreement with Enterprise. In short, we're leveraging our leading portfolio in advantaged positions to support disciplined investments that should deliver sustainable value for our investors.","We're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Duffy Fischer","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Bhavesh Patel","Good morning.","Duffy Fischer","First question is just if you look at a number of the major consultants in the space, they would have integrated polyethylene margins coming down kind of throughout or all the way through 2020. Obviously, you get their data and kind of analyze it. Where do you think they're getting it wrong? What are they too punitive on that they would be more negative than your outlook for polyethylene?","Bhavesh Patel","Well Duffy first of all, if you consider the market environment today and if you look at prior downturns, on the demand side, we already have a lot of uncertainty that's impact demand. You think about the auto sector, trade uncertainty, recession fears, Brexit and so on those have all weighed on demand all year long and we've seen destocking. So we think on the demand side, we've already seen somewhat of a downturn. And to your question about what they might be missing. If you -- I would point to the Asia PE to naptha spread. It's approaching $300 per ton. And if you look over the last 10 years that's reaching the lows over that period of time. And it seems to me that that's pointing towards a trough in polyethylene margins.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Bob, a couple of questions on the refinery. You referenced IMO 2020. Can you talk through the expected impact of that event? Does it influence the way that you're running your asset in terms of catalyst slates mix of products and how did the unit run in October please?","Bhavesh Patel","So the unit ran very well in October. And if you'll recall from our prior conversations, the impact from IMO comes in several forms for us. One is that we'll benefit from a wider light-heavy differential meaning that sour crudes will see less demand as not all refineries are able to meet the new specifications. We should also see wider distillate spreads -- diesel spreads. We're already seeing that -- some of that and October. So to give you some points of reference, the September Maya 2-1-1 was about $14.60. The October average is now $21.30. So we've seen approximately $6.50 improvement in the Maya 2-1-1 from September to October. We think that as we go into next year, we have significant leverage to that improvement toward the widening of the light-heavy differential.","In terms of our refineries positioning, you'll also recall that we've completed all of our turnaround work. So next year, we do not have any major turnaround activity in our refinery. So we're prepared to run at full rates next year and we're doing our best to buy the most competitive crude oils that suit our refinery and we're going to continue to focus on that. So, I think we're really well-positioned and we think about the volume leverage at 950 million barrels per year that we process.","Thomas Aebischer","95.","Bob Patel","95. Sorry 95 million barrels per year that we process. So every dollar has a pretty significant impact over a year when you multiply it by the 95 million barrels.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Bob, just on Hyperzone. Can you discuss whether the expected EBITDA contribution remains the same? How are you going to seed your volumes? Who are you -- how is that progress progressing? And did the cost at the end increase for the project? Thank you.","Bob Patel","Yeah. So, about cost and schedule first, David. So on cost, yes, it did increase. We're showing about a $900 million sort of CapEx number at this point. Still very competitive compared to bills that have occurred recently. In fact, I would say still better than market average from what we can tell. Schedule-wise, we're commissioning now various parts of the plant, and we expect to move into production very late in the year or early next year.","In terms of the EBITDA contribution, it'll ramp up through next year as we demonstrate the production and start to demonstrate the types of products that that plant can make it. What's very typical of new starts is that you have some ups and downs early on to make some off spec while you're trying to prove out the technology. And certainly by the back half of the year, we ought to be producing many of the products that we had envisioned that this differentiated technology will produce.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar","Can you talk a little bit about your feedstock slate on the Gulf Coast? You mentioned ramping up propane and butane feeds. One of your competitors went to zero naphtha. So, with your propylene deal with Enterprise, can you go even more lighter? Can you just talk about your feedstock slate and how do you see that evolving?","Bob Patel","Well, P.J. first of all, in our feedstock consideration, so far the amount of propylene we produced hasn't really driven the feedstock decision. It's more about the relative price and relative economics. Perhaps the price of propylene has more impact than the amount of volume we output, because we have our flex unit where we can also convert ethylene to propylene, if we needed more propylene and it made economic sense.","As I mentioned earlier, we increased butane and propane cracking up to 35%. And I think we could perhaps stress that a little bit more. And the key point on feedstock flexibility is that with our ability to crack that much of LPG and more Y-grade, if this Y-grade becomes the economical, I think we have the full range of feedstock available to us to capitalize on whatever feedstock environment presents itself. We still see ethane as being really well supplied and well priced to maintain the U.S. advantage when you think about a global cost curve.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Bob Koort","Thank you. Bob, I just wanted to talk a little bit about capital allocation, in particular reinvestment in LyondellBasell versus potential inorganic targets. I guess since the summer, we've seen a pretty good rally in some of these cyclical names at least in valuation levels as well as your own frankly. But can you just talk about the tension between how you think about M&A, and maybe the short-term fluctuations and valuations and long-term value? And then, maybe you could also speak to the Schulman integration costs and what that cadence looks like going forward. Thanks.","Bob Patel","So, Bob first of all on M&A, there are a few principles that we really hold to. One is that we're committed to a very strong investment grade rating through the cycle, minimum BBB rating post any transaction that we might consider is very important to us to have the flexibility and the strength in terms of our balance sheet. Secondly, must have strategic fit and we're going to be very value-oriented, patient and disciplined. And I think we've demonstrated all of those things through our decisions on what we have done and what we haven't done.","To your point about the tension between acquiring ourselves and acquiring perhaps others, the way think about this is that for the use of our operating cash flow, first and foremost, we're committed to the strong secure and progressive dividend over time. And as we demonstrated at Investor Day, it's really well covered.","Sustaining CapEx by $1.1 billion, organic growth will be declining, so we think we'll have excess cash flow to dedicate to opportunistic buybacks as we progress over the next 12 to 18 months. As far as using our balance sheet, likely we would not use that for buybacks. We would consider more of that for very value oriented M&A. So look for us to stay disciplined, stay close to our core and constantly solve for a strong investment grade rating.","And your question about Schulman integration, the integration costs will ramp up further, and Thomas, I don't know if you wanted to comment on how much will flow through 2020.","Thomas Aebischer","Right. So we -- thank you, Bob. So we -- you have seen the integration costs for the third quarter where we are now at $43 million, so we made further progress in accelerating the integration of Schulman off the tax $33 million. And so we are at the -- we will go live with a large part of the SAP integration of Schulman into LyondellBasell in the first half of 2020 and that's actually where integration costs will peak.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Bob, just another question on the refinery, and I guess my question is, as you've obviously improved the reliability of it. And now there's opportunity for a structural change in its margins or earnings power. How core to LyondellBasell is the refinery and would you consider monetizing it?","Bob Patel","Thanks for your question, Vincent. Well, as I've said in the past, I mean our focus has been to improve reliability and control the controllables, if you will, which is run the asset really well. And I'm really proud of the team at the refinery. I think they've delivered really great performance. We wanted to position ourselves for IMO 2020. I think we've done that completing our turnaround work, so we have a clear runway for next year to operate at maximum capacity.","The key focus Vincent, at the moment is, I want to see the refinery turn to profit, generate free cash flow that we can reinvest back into LyondellBasell. And we're going to continue to focus on that. And in terms of portfolio, we'll continue to -- we'll consider options over time. But at the moment, the key is to get the refinery to generate free cash flow.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Steve Byrne","Hi. Bob. You talked about both mechanical and molecular recycling, and I'm just curious your longer term views on these. Is your motivation to develop these projects to help drive a plastic recycling industry or do you think either one of them could become really meaningful contributors to your business model in, say, the next five years?","Bob Patel","Good morning, Steve. First of all, I think what's really important when we undertake this plastics debate is that we've got to close the loop. We have to prevent leakage of plastics into the environment as the first objective. Then when we've collected that waste my view is that we're going to need a range of solutions, chemical recycling, mechanical recycling and so on. And so, yes, indeed our ambition is to have a platform in both areas in mechanical and chemical recycling and have a sustainable business platform over the long-term.","We expect to earn returns just like we do in any other investment. Where I wouldn't -- where I would perhaps draw difference here is that the timeline will be a little longer in terms of how long it takes for us to have a platform that's scalable. We're very committed to that in both chemical and mechanical recycling. And I see a path to success there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. ","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Good morning. My question is on polyethylene. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on price evolution here. There was a $0.03 increase that the industry was able to get in September. Do you see that potentially sticking through the next quarter or two? And if so why? And if not would you expect prices to come down in December per usual kind of seasonality? What are the drivers that you're looking at to help you understand or form some outlook on polyethylene pricing? Thanks.","Bob Patel","Okay. So Arun first I start with the market backdrop. And in the prepared remarks in our slides we showed you that through the end of the third quarter, the net price change is zero so to me that indicates that markets are somewhat balanced. We've seen reasonable amount of destocking. Recent industry reports have indicated even PE inventories have come down in the U.S. So the backdrop going into the fourth quarter to us feels like there's not a lot of excess inventory downstream because of all of the factors that are -- the macro factors that have created lack of confidence.","Also I mentioned that the Asia PE to naphtha spreads are currently at very low levels around $300 per ton. And if you look back over the last 10 years these are kind of trough levels when we get to this point on Asia PE to naphtha spreads. So yes, we could have some seasonal pricing adjustments like we do every year in the fourth quarter. But I don't expect extraordinary changes because we've reached some evidence of trough, sort of, conditions whether you think about destocking or if you look at this PE to naphtha spread in Asia.","And I think that's one that's held through if you look back over the last 10 years. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about things. And then next year once we get into the spring season, we'll see continued demand growth like we do every year. And anyone will recall that typically the growth in a year happens in the first nine months of the year. So by the time we get into the spring we should start to feel the impact of demand growth going into 2020. So I'm quite constructive at all of this because I think we've already had in some ways quite a correction in terms of inventories and margins. And the evidence I would point to is the Asia PE to naphtha spread.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Bhavesh Lodaya","Hi. Good morning, Bob. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John.","Bob Patel","Good morning. ","Bhavesh Lodaya","On the Chinese JV with Bora, it appears everything is going according to plan there. Can you share what goalpost are you tracking there as you go ahead? And what gets you more comfortable in terms of making additional investments in the region?","Bob Patel","Well, there's a few factors especially with the Bora JV. First of all, it's based on our polyolefin technology. And the construction costs are almost half of what they would be on the Gulf Coast. So those are two really important factors. The construction is about 50% complete now. So by the time, we have definitive agreements and we're at a point where we're going to contribute equity into the venture, it'll be even more closer to startup. So all of those factors give us good confidence about the costs and the denominator and the return equation if you will.","It's product that's produced in China for China. So it's a large growing market. And we're very confident about our ability to place that product. And as we look ahead to other investments I think this will be a very good test case for us and build our capability and our presence locally in the region so that when there are future phases in the Bora JV we should be able to invest with confidence and grow our position in a very important market. So those are all of the factors that give us confidence in our investment when we conclude the joint venture with Bora.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now open. ","Frank Mitsch","Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Thomas it was nice to work with you and certainly wish you the best for the future.","Thomas Aebischer","Thank you, Frank.","Frank Mitsch","Bob, as I looked at the I&D business, you've had four quarters in a row of negative year-over-year comps and your LTM EBITDA is at $1.6 billion. Is this kind of the base level that we should be thinking about this business? Or how do you think about kind of the base level of earnings of I&D? And I guess as part of that is there anything you can offer with respect to what the pace of economic activity has been either on the industrial or consumer side that has had that impact on I&D being down as I said four quarters in a row?","Bob Patel","Well, so Frank the puts and takes on I&D have been that styrene has weakened considerably as has methanol. And as you know when you think about the I&D business that's the part of the portfolio that provides the upside. And when it's not there we kind of land where we are now. That's an indication of those value chains and how the demand is evolving in this styrene value chain.","PO has been a bit weaker as well because of automotive. That's been a consistent story throughout the year. And methanol has weakened as well. Now offsetting all of that has been a bitter oxyfuel business. So we've had not only better blend premiums this year, but also cheaper butane especially in the U.S.","So Frank for I&D, I mean, you really have to look at this whole portfolio because there are typically offsets. If one is doing better the other doesn't. Not that they're correlated but we find that it's unusual if all of them were trough conditions. So difficult to really point at an exact number, but the part of our portfolio that provides upside has corrected considerably when you think about styrene and methanol.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now open. ","Hassan Ahmed","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Hassan Ahmed","Bob, a lot of discussion around ethylene polyethylene and I think you've made your case pretty clear that most capacity additions are behind us things potentially could cycle up from here. Could you also give us your views on the polypropylene side of things? How are you thinking about supply\/demand over there? And how should we be thinking about sort of 2020? I mean, would sort of margins be a tailwind a headwind? Any sort of thoughts around that will be good.","Bob Patel","Sure, Hassan. So, on polypropylene, there is some new capacity that's starting up next year. But our sense is that, we kind of go sideways. As demand grows likely, this capacity, new capacity will be absorbed. And polypropylene growth rates have been pretty strong. We think those could be bolstered by an improvement in the automotive sector. We have seen this over the last 10 years that when the automotive sector comes back, you really see a big burst in demand. And we saw this back in '12 and '13. We saw it in '16, so likely that will benefit PP as well. And today, the economics include -- or today's margins factor in a very weak automotive market, which probably has more impact on PP than PE. So, I think kind of net of more supply maybe better demand, we go sideways from '19 to '20.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts","Thank you, and best wishes as well Thomas.","Thomas Aebischer","Thanks, John.","John Roberts","There's relatively little discussion about polypropylene. I assume, it underperformed polyethylene because its more durables exposed and was Europe significantly different than the U.S.?","Bob Patel","No. You'll recall that polypropylene is really more of a regional market. There is some global trade, but generally there's -- it's more of a regional market. So, Europe and U.S. in terms of demand performance are similar. U.S. probably a little bit better because the automotive sector has been hit much harder in Europe than it has here. And frankly, we see that more in our compounding business, where Europe is weaker. So, polypropylene has been a decent business this year for us. And as I mentioned in a prior question, that I see the net of sort of capacity additions and demand growth showing sideways sort of performance from this year to next.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Mike Sison","Hey guys, nice quarter. Bob, when you think about your outlook for the fourth quarter, you sort of talked about normal seasonal kind of decline fourth quarter versus third quarter and a lot of companies are seeing much more dire sort of outlook sequentially. So, is there anything different in either polyethylene or your other markets that you're not seeing sort of a weaker sequential decline?","Bob Patel","Well, I think we've already seen a lot of the destocking and sort of weakness in our markets throughout the whole year. I mean, if you go back to Q1, Q2 trade uncertainty, recession fears expectations of new capacity causing pricing to come down. That has all caused destocking downstream. And so, typically, when you go into fourth quarter, you see some destocking because of year-end, but my sense is a lot of that's already occurred especially in polyethylene.","And again, I would point you to the Asia PE to naphtha spread. I mean it's really showing trough conditions. So this expectation of weaker markets has been around and the sentiment has been there for most of this year and has driven buyer behavior. So, other than a directionally some seasonal impacts that we get every year, it's difficult to imagine there would be a lot more.","Thomas Aebischer","And Mike, I would remind you that the fourth quarter of 2018 was very weak, so it should be easy -- fairly easy to beat that comp.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Over the past four, five years, polyethylene globally has grown I think pretty close to 5%. At what rate do you think it grew or it's growing in 2019?","Bob Patel","So, Jeff polyethylene has grown probably more like 4% to 4.5% in the timeframe you described. And this year, it's still growing kind of in that range, maybe a little bit lower. Again, as I mentioned earlier with destocking happening globally and the concerns around trade and so on, I think we've seen a little bit reduction in this demand growth, but a lot of its packaging based, so -- and consumable end use demand. So we're still very constructive about demand growth on polyethylene going forward.","Thomas Aebischer","I think it's hard to sort out this year because the increased exports from North America. We're going to have to see where all that polyethylene ended up at the end of things especially after the trade lanes got readjusted after the tariffs.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Jim Sheehan","Good morning, Bob. You said earlier that return timelines and plastic waste projects might be longer than for conventional projects. Related to that, you recently signed on to a commitment with the trade association to serve the interest of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Could you please comment on how you would address another situation in which a stakeholder interest might conflict with maximizing value for shareholders? For example, if a stakeholder objected to using cash for share repurchases and instead wanted you to use that cash for something else, how would you resolve the conflict? I'm just trying to understand where shareholders fit in the hierarchy of priorities.","Bob Patel","Indeed. Well, I think with stakeholders, we have to emphasize that our aim is to be a going concern that generates good results, so that we can have sustainability in our business model. And we're responsible and disciplined on how we deploy the cash flow we earn not only how we do it, but what we do it that actually earn the cash flow. And so I would frame it in that way that it's important that we generate the results we do keeping all stakeholders in mind and deploy the cash flow that we deploy keeping all stakeholders in mind. And I think frankly, we've done that.","So I don't know that this new commitment requires a change in our approach. I think we've been living by this in the past, and we'll continue to do that in the future. And as it relates to share repurchases the idea is to have a really strong company over a long period of time. And so we're going to be very prudent in where we invest. And shareholders are a very important stakeholder constituency.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jonas Oxgaard","Thank you for squeezing me in here. You're talking about increasing export. Could you talk a little bit about what percentage of your PE is exported now where it's going and what kind of price realizations you get on those volumes?","Bob Patel","So today Jonas about 20% of our PE is exported. That's come up actually from low double digits. So we've already increased our exports. And I can imagine next year after we start Hyperzone that we will increase that further and approach the industry average of something like mid-30s, I think in exports 30% to 35% of export out of the U.S. We'll likely still be under that, but approach that a little bit more as we go into next year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. On the sustainability and circularity discussion could you provide some initial thoughts to help you think about what the next 10 years might look like in terms of your willingness to shift to using bionaphtha for example in Europe, your willingness to let circularity investment move above say 10% of CapEx over time. And would you be willing to buy recyclable products from other companies in order to get you a certain mix in your total portfolio over time?","Bob Patel","Yeah. So, Laurence on bio based naphtha, we've already demonstrated we can crack that in our investment Germany site. And as we find more sources of that, we'll \u2013 our aim is to scale that up. And I think over time based on availability of feedstock and our ability to evolve technology, I'm convinced that we're going to have very sustainable good return sort of business models and it's been sort of the nature of our industry, and our company is that first we innovate, and then we get to scale so we can earn returns. And I don't see mechanical recycling, chemical recycling any differently. We're on the front end of this investment","I'm fully prepared that while the investments are very modest at this point, we perhaps will have a little longer time horizon. But we will be able to scale up at the right time and we welcome the adoption of circularity. We think it's very important as we think about the use of plastics going into the long term. And again, as I mentioned earlier the most important comparative today is to prevent the leakage of plastic waste or plastic pallets into the environment. Then once we collect that companies like us are endeavoring to use that waste in many different ways to create new products to close the loop. And we're very committed to that, and we'll continue to invest in that regard.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.\\","Matthew Blair","Hey, Bob. Thanks for taking my question. So naphtha pricing has generally weakened this year relative to crude. There's a thought that it may soften more going forward and that can either come from the demand-side as a crackers shift to lighter feedstocks or maybe from the supply side as U.S. shale crude production grows. Do you \u2013 what's your view on this? Are you worried about naphtha getting weaker? And if so how would that affect the cost curve for PE and potential pricing for PE?","Bob Patel","Hey, Matthew, good morning, good question. So as you mentioned rightly naphtha's already come-off quite a lot. And frankly, that's part of what's ailing our refining performances. We don't have a refinery, so when some of these products like naphtha and propylene and others come down in price that further directionally affects the results at the refinery. Having said all that, I always kind of go back to historical naphtha premiums or discounts. And I think we're at a point where, if there is \u2013 if there is further reduction in naphtha relative to crude oil, it's hard to imagine that that would be sustained. If it does there are offsets. Obviously, our European operations would benefit from that because naphtha will become a lot cheaper. We also could crack more naphtha, if it was advantaged compared to ethane here in the U.S. So I mean, I think they're sort of \u2013 there's two sides to the ledger in terms of naphtha and we'll have to work our way through that. But it seems to me that a sustained step down in naphtha is more difficult to contemplate.","Operator","Thank you. And that was our final question. And I will turn the meeting back over to Mr. David Kinney.","Bob Patel","Thank you. This is Bob Patel. I'll offer a few closing remarks. First of all, thanks for all the great questions. Our company is delivering resilient performance during these times of macro uncertainty, market headwinds and weak industrial demand.

We're taking steps to further increase our cash flow, make disciplined investment decisions and create more value for our shareholders.","Thank you for your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you on our full year results and growth initiatives during our fourth quarter earnings call.

And during today's call, we'll focus on first 2012 performance, the current environment, and the near-term outlook.","With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompany this call and are available on our website.","Let's begin by taking a look at page 4 and reviewing a few financial highlights. The first quarter reflects a strong rebound following the slow fourth quarter. Net income was $599 million and EBITDA was $1.24 billion. The recovery was led by improved margins in the O&P Americas and Refining and Oxyfuels segments, but all segments recorded gains. Earnings per share increased to $1. Karyn and I will discuss the quarter in detail, but I thought I would quickly summarize a few highlights and trends from the quarter.","In North America, we benefited from increased ethylene margins. European Polyolefins volumes returned to third-quarter levels following the fourth quarter slowdown. Intermediates & Derivatives results returned to a more difficult level following the completion of fourth-quarter maintenance. Refining spreads improve as the quarter progress while Oxyfuels margins were unseasonably strong throughout the quarter.","As a result of our 2011 performance we were honored by Hart Energy as the Refining and Energy Company of the Year. Operations at the Berre refinery were suspended on January 4 and the refinance the majority of the remaining balance on our 2017 and 2018 bonds at an average interest rate of 5.25%.","Overall it was a good quarter. Our personal safety performance was no exception. ","On slide number five we have updated our safety data. I'm proud to say that we have started the year well. There were some minor injuries primarily related to Channelview turnaround work. For the first quarter statistics improved versus 2011, a tribute to both our employees and contractors. Our safety record is very near best in class. Now I would like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss some key elements of our financial performance.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks Jim. Please turn to slide number six, which charts are first quarter and last 12 months segment EBITDA. The $1.24 billion of EBITDA reflects a strong beginning to 2012 particularly when one considers that the first quarter is typically a seasonally slow period. From a segment perspective, O&P Americas continue to be our strongest segment generating approximately $600 million of EBITDA. The majority of this was in Olefins where the benefits of ethane cracking were particularly strong. It is also important to note that these results were generated while we conducted significant maintenance at our Channelview site.","O&P EAI produced approximately $100 million of EBITDA consistent with past quarters that differentiated polyolefins products and our joint venture's performed well. The improvement versus the fourth quarter was driven by improved olefin and polyolefin volumes and margins.","Following the fourth quarter turnarounds, Intermediates & Derivatives segment results returned to strong historical levels with EBITDA of approximately $280 million. The Refining and Oxyfuels segment generated over a $190 million of EBITDA in what is historically a seasonally slow quarter. Oxyfuels results were particularly strong.","The Technology segment continues to benefit from steady catalyst sales leading to EBITDA of approximately $55 million. The bar chart on the right depicts the last 12 month's EBITDA by segment. Over the period total EBITDA was approximately $5.1 billion. Approximately 45% was generated from O&P Americas while the Intermediates & Derivatives and Refining and Oxyfuels segments, each generated approximately $1 billion.","You return to slide number seven. We have plotted the key components of our cash flow. During the first quarter, cash balances increased by approximately $600 million, closing the quarter near $1.67 billion. Typically, the first quarter is characterized by relatively weak cash flow and several annual payments including property taxes, customer rebates, insurance premium payments and employee bonuses are made during the quarter. This year was somewhat of an exception as strong earnings and the receipt of approximately $250 million from tax refunds more than offset these items. CapEx spending was slightly less than our planned rate.","On the right side of this chart, you can see that over the last 12 months our cash balances declined from $4.4 billion to $1.67 billion. Operations, including working capital generated, over $3.6 billion of cash while usage included approximately $1 billion for CapEx, $2 billion of debt repayment and $3 billion in dividends.","Before I leave this chart, I wouldn\u2019t like to point out that our first quarter\u2019s financials do not reflect the premiums and other costs associated with our recent financing. The transactions were closed during the second quarter and will be reflected accordingly. By way of guidance, I estimate the second quarter will include a charge of approximately $330 million representing tender premiums and the write-offs of previous financing fees.","Of course, this is a non-recurring item and approximately $35 million is non-cash. Most importantly, I want to highlight that going forward our cash interest expense will be approximately $250 million annually. The average interest rate on our remaining debt is slightly greater than 5.5%.","Let's move to slide 8 to look at a few balance sheet statistics. On the left, you can see that working capital was relatively unchanged during the quarter as inventory declined while receivables increased. The inventory reduction is related to both our Channelview turnaround and the sale of the Berre refinery inventory.","On the right, we included a few key statistics. As you can see, we closed the quarter with $4 billion of debt and net debt of $2.3 billion.","During the past two quarters, we have significantly restructured our debt and improved the balance sheet. In fact, since our original financing in 2010, we\u2019ve reduced debt by more than 3 billion, reduced the average interest rate by approximately 4.5% and decreased annualize interest by more than 400 million.","Additionally, our credit rating has improved substantially. Notably, one of the agencies recently raised our corporate rating to investment-grade.","Now, I\u2019ll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.","Jim Gallogly","Thanks, Karyn. Let\u2019s discuss segment performance beginning on slide number nine with Olefins & Polyolefins-Americas. First quarter EBITDA was $598 million, an increase over $191 million versus the fourth quarter. Olefins EBITDA exceeded $500 million despite having significant downtime related to the Channelview turnaround.","During the quarter, maintenance activity reduced ethylene production by approximately 200 million pounds. A combination of fourth quarter product purchases and a first quarter inventory draw enabled us to meet our customers\u2019 product needs.","I would like to discuss a few metrics to put results in perspective. Relative to the fourth quarter, our average ethylene price increased by approximately $0.02 per pound, while the cost of ethylene production metric decreased by approximately $0.10 per pound.","The later decrease was primarily related to the lower cost of ethane. Our average ethane cost declined by $0.28 per gallon in the Gulf and approximately $0.10 per gallon in the Midwest. During the quarter, 82% of our ethylene was produced from natural gas liquids, with ethane accounted for 68% of the ethylene production.","Polyolefin results also strengthened versus the fourth quarter as EBITDA increased by approximately $60 million. Margins drove the increased performance. Versus the fourth quarter, the average polyethylene sales price increased by approximately $0.06 per pound while the polypropylene price increased by $0.02 per pound. Prices for both polymers were relatively unchanged. During the quarter, we received $10 million dividend from our Mexican joint venture.","Overall, the first quarter was a good for this segment and the underlying fundamentals have remained intact. Ethane prices have remained low while industry turnarounds have made ethylene availability tighter than normal.","Our Channelview olefins plant turnaround is complete and the plant is being restarted. During April, the turnaround impacted ethylene production by approximately 150 million pounds.","Let\u2019s turn the slide no. 10 and review performance in the olefins and poly-olefins Europe, Asia and International segment. First quarter EBITDA was $103 million, a $41 million improvement over the fourth quarter. The improvement was generated in European olefins and commodity polyolefins.","During the quarter, our differentiated products such as polypropylene compounds and Catalloy resins continued to perform well, generating results consistent with prior quarters. Equity income associated with our joint ventures increased but due to the timing of payments, we received $40 million fewer dividends. Although profits in European Olefins & Polyolefins increased, they were still relatively weak as most of the improvement occurred during March.","Product prices increased as the quarter progressed but raw material cost increases offset a significant portion of the benefit. Quarterly sales volumes improved returning to third quarter levels. First quarter results were negatively impacted by an explosion in one of our low density polyethylene facilities at in Wesseling, Germany.","During the quarter, we recognized a $22 million charge for damage to the asset, an estimate about a $10 million impact from lost sales. Thus far, second quarter trends have remained largely unchanged. ","Within Europe, the environmental olefins and polyolefins remained difficult. However, raw material costs have stabilized and we are benefiting from butadiene pricing. We anticipate that joint venture dividends will be consistent with historic averages, but it can be difficult to predict the timing of the payments by quarter.","Now, please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of the intermediates and derivates segment. First quarter EBITDA was $282 million, an increase of $109 million from the prior quarter, which included the impact of substantial maintenance activity. First quarter results were on track with performance seen during the first three quarter of 2011.","Absent the impact of the fourth quarter turnaround, propylene oxide and derivate results were largely unchanged. Volumes benefited from the absence of the turnaround activity and stronger trade sales.","Acetyls volumes and results also improved poly in fourth quarter maintenance and PO co-products, TBA derivatives benefited from strong margins but styrene margins declined. Ethylene oxide and glycol results were relatively unchanged.","Underlying business trends were largely unchanged from the first quarter as we head into the second quarter.","Let\u2019s move to slide number 12 for a discussion of the Refining & Oxyfuels segment. First quarter EBITDA was $192 million. Throughout the quarter, Oxyfuels spreads were strong and as the quarter progressed, the Maya 2-2-1 benchmark spread improved from its December low point.","Houston refinery quarterly EBITDA improved by approximately $30 million. Margins improved as the quarter progressed and the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark spread averaged approximately $20 per barrel.","The refinery operated at near-full capacity consuming approximately 259,000 barrels of crude daily. Although quarterly results improved, they lag the benchmark. The following factors contributed to the shortfall.","January results were negatively impacted by the residual effect of late 2011 crude price volatility. Efficiencies between the refinery and Channelview were impacted by the olefin\u2019s turnaround. This impacted results by approximately $20 million.","And although the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark serves as a good indicator of trends, it does not reflect the pricing of byproducts such as coke which did not increase in concert with first quarter crude oil prices.","As I previously mentioned, our Berre refinery ceased operations during early January. During the quarter, we continued to incur fixed costs and some utility spending as we secured and mothballed the asset. This resulted in an EBITDA loss of approximately $35 million.","However, we also sold the existing product inventories at a gain, a portion of which is related to our use of LIFO inventory accounting. Consequently, EBITDA was near breakeven and we generated positive cash flow.","First quarter Oxyfuels results were unseasonably strong, improving by approximately $80 million versus the fourth quarter. Margins accounted for the majority of the improvement; relatively good demand for Octane, coupled with high gasoline prices and low natural gas based raw material costs generated strong margins.","As you can see on slide number 12 during April, Refining and Oxyfuels margins have been very strong. However, margins declined as the month progressed and although we expect them to remain quite good they may not maintain April levels throughout the quarter. Specific to our operations, the Channelview turnaround impact should be limited to the first quarter. But coke coal pricing has remained depressed relative to crude.","The Houston refining has operated near-full rates and is expected to do so throughout the quarter. You should anticipate that the Berre refinery will continue to incur fixed costs during the second quarter.","Let\u2019s step back from the details and summarize the business environment on slides number 13 and 14. Most importantly, on slide number 13, you can see the pace and magnitude of the industry margin recovery across the first quarter and into April.","Clearly, our O&P Americas and refining segments are in a good position. As I mentioned, we are also seeing positive trends in Oxyfuels and good butadiene pricing. And in our other businesses trends have been largely unchanged from the first quarter.","Before we finish our prepared comments, I want to mention that our growth projects are moving forward consistent with the spending and timing outlined at our Investor Day presentations. We will do our best to bring these additional volumes online as soon as possible given the excellent margin environment we expect to see in the future for the US Olefins, methanol and European butadiene.","We\u2019re now pleased to take questions Debbie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","I know it\u2019s not your preferred method of talking about the business, but a lot of people seem pretty cautious about stepping into a stock like your with you know all the crackers coming up over the next several months and the draw that\u2019s going to put on the ethane side of things and potentially the amount of ethylene that are put into the market.","Can you kind of give your best guesstimate how the summer looks as far as the spread between ethane and ethylene goes and just that interplay with all the crackers coming back up in the near-term?","Jim Gallogly","","Well, a number of crackers are already coming up. There are several down as I mentioned, OP-2 came up earlier in our company a day or two ahead of schedule. OP-1 is starting up as we speak. If you look at ethane pricing today, things are about where they have been. It\u2019s Gulf Coast, $0.50 plus or minus a gallon and EP at Conway\u2019s in the teens. So that\u2019s working pretty good.","Volumes have been holding up. The economy has been pretty good in the United States. As a company we don\u2019t export much as you know Duffy, so we are not as dependent on the China market. So things still look very good and remember we\u2019ve had incredible margins in this business recently, so we expect them to be good, the question is how good.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","And then you mentioned the $20 million number for the synergy that was kind of foregone between Channelview and the refinery, was that just for that aspect or was that also including the purchases, you are still underwater a little bit for January within the refining business as well?","Doug Pike","","Hi Duffy, this is Doug. Now that $20 million is related to the turnaround only. If you recall, we have the Alky unit and also an MTBE unit over at the Channelview side, but our process refinery materials actually got impact well, it\u2019s in that quarter. That\u2019s a completely separate thing from any purchasing.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital","Okay great. Thank you, guys.","Jim Gallogly","The other thing that you are mentioning there Duffy, we did have some residual effects of, some of the WTI and Brent pricing flow into the first quarter that we had experienced at the end of the fourth quarter; that\u2019s separate.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","Jim, can you talk a little bit about the residence time of a gallon of ethane going through your system production into ethylene and down into derivates and then ultimately being sold and put on a cost to good plan?","Jim Gallogly","Well, we try to make that very quick. We don\u2019t hold much inventory of either ethane or ethylene; the industry has got to the point, it\u2019s really a very rapid process. And then, even into polyethylene, if you look at our days they sail on hands it\u2019s always into 20s kind of a number of days, so things move through the system pretty rapidly.","Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs","And how much capacity do you have to store and how fixated should we be on spot transit; that certainly gets most of the attention on Wall Street, but I suspect most of your sales are on monthly contracts. So can you tell me how much or what you\u2019ve been storing from a raw material standpoint and then, is there a reason to or not to fixate on the spot trends?","Jim Gallogly","First let me comment on ethane storage; we do store some ethane, but we try not to hold a lot of inventory; it just doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, so that\u2019s not a big issue. We did hold a lot of ethylene inventory from the fourth quarter and into the turnaround at Channelview, because when we have the two largest units down like that that\u2019s pretty significant and we wanted to make sure that we were in good shape.","So you saw that the inventories depleted here in the first, that's as a result of the turnaround in the use of that ethylene we stored, spot prices are somewhat important but it just kind of helps on trend on contract. So we don't, it's important, but the contract price is far more important.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","","You mentioned that you are restarting Channelview now, there seems to be plenty of real estate at Channelview. Any thoughts on the condo cracker that you talked about at that site and do you have any partners lined up?","Jim Gallogly","Well, a number of people have come to us when we indicated that we would be interested in the condo cracker and there are multiple parties have announced crackers. I don't expect most of those to build their own cracker. They are raising their hand to say we are available. A number of them have contacted us. Channelview could be a site but we are still in early discussions with folks on that. So I don't want to signal anything at this point in time.","P.J. Juvekar - Citi","And just wanted to get your thoughts Jim, on co-products propylene and butadiene. Can you give us an update on your metathesis expansion and then the industry is now beginning to talk about BDH units, sort of butane dehydro units. What do you think can be done in the tight butadiene situation? Thank you.","Jim Gallogly","Well, as you may recall, we announced butadiene expansion in Europe. We had the feedstock, that's one of the big questions is do you have the feedstock for that kind of an extraction unit and we did within our European system, so while we are not trying to grow Europe, in general a butadiene unit at our Wesseling facility made a lot of sense and has just really outstanding economics and that project remains on track. It was approved, you know it\u2019s a construction and so that looks very good.","The reason butadiene is so strong is because everybody is cracking [lighter]. As result of that, the polypropylene molecule has been short, butadiene has been short and you\u2019ve heard people talk about PDH units, metathesis units. We also are looking at expanding our metathesis unit at Channelview and continue to study that. We will pay a lot of attention to the propylene molecules as we make our final investment decisions. There haven\u2019t a fair number of announcements related to PDH units and as you know people can over build pretty rapidly. So we\u2019ll look at relative economics and make sure that that\u2019s still makes sense as we develop the engineering on that project.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMC. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMC","When you look at the amount of that same capacity which is coming on in the United States, is it sufficiently visible that you can making an assessment of whether you think ethane prices on average might be lower in 2013 and then in 2012 or is it not so well defined?","Jim Gallogly","Well, at this point in time you know there is over a million barrels a day showing up. That\u2019s more than last year, against basically the same capacity. You know there has been a little bit of deep bottleneck. We\u2019ve done a bit of that you know to be able to take a little more ethane, but the nice thing about having retained our swing capacity, we will watch everyday and see does it make sense to crack ethane, does it make sense to crack a little more propane.","We have got some very nice corn intake pricing from some of the South Texas fields and the Eagle Ford that have been coming on and we will make a daily call on all of that but at this point in time, things look reasonably balanced. And we think that following year in 2016, ethane gets pretty long and should be very, very good for our industry. But coming into the second, third quarter, I think things are pretty balanced and then start to go long ethane.","Doug Pike","And Jeff this is Doug. I might point out that we do have a presentation on our website where we spoke to the balances going forward in actually in six months increments over the next couple of years of how we see ethane demand and ethane supply developing out with fractionators and pipelines.","Jim Gallogly","And one of the things I will add that I probably didn\u2019t focus on enough is propane is pretty helpful. The propane crack is pretty good right now. As you know it was pretty warm winter, propane went long. Everybody is exploring as much of that as they can and still very readily available and so that\u2019s a pretty nice crack right now which takes some pressure off of that thing.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMC","Okay, and then secondly, can you tell me what your maintenance cost or turnaround cost for your I&D business in fourth quarter of 2011?","Doug Pike","If I recall correctly, in our fourth quarter call, we said there was about a $75 million impact from the combined turnarounds of the propylene oxide and related units and the acetyls units in the I&D. So that was sort of the lost opportunity from this.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Yes, Jim a few questions on demand. I mean once all these outages are behind us, I think assuming (inaudible) of current name plate offering rates is about 83% and I am just wondering what you are seeing in terms of polyethylene demand domestically, are buyers holding off in anticipation of lower prices and I know you don\u2019t you export much if any to, to Asia but what are your thoughts on Chinese demand and the implications for them being able to take more Middle Eastern material and hence make Europe a little less over supplied as well?","Jim Gallogly","Well when China came out of the Chinese New Year, very early in the first quarter, people expected demand to pick up, but I don\u2019t think we have seen that. I think demand has been slower than we expected in Asia at the present time and that has put pressure on European margins.","And as the companies you mentioned Don, we do not export to China much out of the United States and so it has limited impact on this business. You saw the impact that it had on Europe and continues to have. It's to be seen you know lot of people are watching which way crude is going, which way naphtha is going.","Here in the United States, demand has been pretty good. People again are watching you know as people have the turnarounds being completed, which way our margins is going to go, so you know if you try to predict within a given week or two, you'd probably miss it and lot of times that\u2019s what people try to do, but I think the US economy has been pretty good overall. China has been reasonably week and Europe quite week and so you see that reflected in the first quarter numbers, so we remain pretty optimistic going forward. ","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","And just a follow up on Europe, can you update us on where you are on your restructuring plan which I think you have identified about $200 million of potential benefits there?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, we\u2019re in pretty good shape on that. You know a lot of the work in Bob Patel\u2019s area in Olefins and Polyolefin\u2019s is nearing completion. We continue to work on some of the other staff cost. I try not to go into too much details, because we have work\u2019s counsels there and we always have to have robust discussions with our employee groups in advance of announcing things and quarterly reports like this. But we remain very, very actively engaged in reducing costs, because frankly your profitability is problematic as you can see in the first quarter results.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitch of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo Securities","Just a couple of questions on the Refining and Oxyfuels side of the business; you had a good Oxyfuels result in Q1 and it sounds like you are expecting more of the same here in Q2. So I guess, at this point, if the quarter were to end, you are pretty much looking for a pick-up relative to Q1 on that deal?","Jim Gallogly","You know Oxyfuels has performed very well, and seasonably strong results in the first quarter; you know we get some benefit out of low natural gas prices in that business, so the spreads have been good, demand has been good, people have wondered octane gasoline prices have been very high, because of high crude prices.","Usually the fourth and first quarters in Oxyfuels are weaker and we had a, you know we did pretty well through those quarters and so that continues, it usually gets stronger going into the second quarter.","We've seen either Maya 2-1-1 do pretty well in April, it fell off a little bit over the last few days, but its still pretty strong. And so as I mentioned in the planned remarks that coke prices, some of the byproduct prices are a bit depressed, but overall Refining and Oxyfuels should do well.","Frank Mitch - Wells Fargo Securities","And you mentioned that there were some fixed costs that were sticking with the Berre facility. Can you size that for us; is it bigger than bread box?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yeah, going forward through the end of the year, we do expect to have continued fixed costs for the second quarter order of magnitude somewhere around $30 million to $35 million. And then for the following you know five to six months around $10 million for the quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","I would like to expand a little bit on the previous question. So butadiene and other co-products and international Olefins; I think we have (inaudible) and been looking perhaps a bigger earnings list in the co-products. Can you provide us a little bit more background on prices you\u2019ve been seeing in local markets maybe sequentially and the strength that we might be looking at three months from now?","Doug Pike","Mike this is Doug, I\u2019ll take it first and then maybe Jim can take up on a broader answer. One of things you want to think about across the first quarter is what you saw was rising prices across the quarter in most of the co-products since you recall we finished fourth quarter pretty weak, I mean tough even across the quarter.","Also with Channelview site being down for turnaround in March that is one of our main co-product locations and producer of our key co-products for us. So Q4 recovery units were down, metathesis and of course the crackers at OP-1 and OP-2 for a while.","So all those things have some impact on our side of things in the co-product area and Jim mentioned before, we have to see how thing come in, people come back from some turnaround, but we still have a lot of capacity off in April and due in May as well.","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, butadiene prices have come down just a bit, but from very high elevated levels. And so we still feel very good about that business in co-product pricing. Again, as people continue to crack light in United States, it puts worldwide pressure, butadiene, propylene or oil treated commodities. And so we expect that pricing to stay in good shape.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","And then, can you discuss a little bit more on the timing issue, the JV dividends that you highlighted in your prepared comments; where the dividends just pushed forward into 2Q, so it will be the $40 million seen in license 2Q versus 1Q?","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah, on dividends, it is fairly lumpy. It\u2019s very hard to predict; you know when the JV Board\u2019s are going to actually declare dividends, but the earnings have been nice and strong across those businesses and so we expect the dividends to come. We just can\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019s first quarter or second quarter and so we expect that the forecast that we have given on that will remain true. The businesses have been reasonably strong still.","Doug Pike","","I expect a lot of focus more on the equity earnings rather than specific timing of dividends.","Operator","Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is open.","","Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global","Just wanted to expand a bit further on the dividend side of things, I know there was a bit of power outage in Jubail, as well as I understand it, some PDH related issues as far as Al Waha goes. So was that factored into the timing of the dividends or the timing of the announcement? And if you could just give a sense of how much earnings reduced because of those things?","Jim Gallogly","","Yeah. First, you are correct that there was a power outage across all of Jubail and that did slow things down for a couple of weeks. That isn\u2019t that material in our overall program.","The significant dividends that we see are from the other two joint ventures, not Al Waha, in Al Waha we\u2019re still paying down debt. We have had periodic PDH unit issues in terms of hitting maximum rates, but the economics of that plant have improved over the last year and half and we\u2019ve gotten rates up in general on poly propylene plants running a lot better; we have our plant manager in there, but you haven\u2019t seen dividends from Al Waha; you have been seeing SEPC and SPC and others have bit of an outage, and I don\u2019t think that was material given our percentage interest.","And then of course Thailand is another venture where have a nice feedstock advantage and you\u2019ll see good dividends. You\u2019ll see bits and pieces sometimes from Indelpro like you saw $10 million in this quarter, those have come periodically, but a couple of big Saudi joint ventures, Thailand joint ventures are the ones to really watch.","Operator","Our next question is from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Jim as your cash builds nicely through Q1, can you update us on your thoughts about another one-time special dividend at year end perhaps?","Jim Gallogly","I\u2019ll let Karyn talk about our dividend policy; we get that question often lot and so I\u2019ll let her discuss that.","Karyn Ovelmen","Just in terms of our special dividend, it is a good way to return value to the shareholders if there is no other immediate or appropriate accretive opportunity to do so. And of course we would balance that with any potential other opportunities we have and then also in terms of our goal to become investment grading; maintenance of strong investment credit grade metrics.","But generally speaking, our cash balances today in absolute terms as well as a percentage of our market cap or EBITDA is lower and in many cases significantly lower than our peers, so no urgent cash deployments needed in the very short term.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","And Jim just on the Conway advantage, you talked about the sustainability of that advantage as some other efforts under way to move some of that Conway EP down to the Gulf Coast?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, there will be a pipeline built to move some of that product. We think that's a 2013 event. For now though ethane EP is very long there and we are seeing prices in the teens, so a very strong advantage. We have a couple of billion pounds in that region and so it's very helpful. Recognizing the strand and nature of that, like always happens, there will be pipelines built and some of that will be remedied and we expect that to happen. ","Now having said that, there still will be an ethane advantage there at the transportation differential and those crackers are still going to look good going into the future and as supply demand tightens, we still feel very good about our Morris and Clinton assets and in fact they are doing a little bit of debottlenecking to the extent we can to maximize that.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Rob Walker - Jefferies","I guess first as you mentioned in the quarter you were 68% ethane in the US. With Channelview back online has that figure increased further and if so how much?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, let me give you kind of a couple of kind of high level comments on that. We can at this moment I would guess 80% to 82% maybe system-wide US production from NGLs and you know by the time we get into September, that will probably be closer to 85%. In terms of ethane high 60s maybe 68% system-wide ethane and again in September following a little bit of work we\u2019re doing, that will be probably be around you know low 70s. I think our target is about 72%. So I think those numbers will give you pretty good idea.","Rob Walker - Jefferies","Okay, thanks and then just trying to par some of the commentary around the Houston refinery and then the R&O segment. I guess can you clarify that in Q2 there are no substantial overhangs that allow you to earn closer to or even above the industry margin benchmark? And I guess and then how much did you get in Berre in terms of the $30 million to $35 million. Is there any other inventory that you could still liquidate?","Jim Gallogly","There is a little bit of inventory left at Berre. But it's fairly modest and that will be liquidated at the right time. In terms of the overhang, the Channelview turnaround impact it does talk about you know, that\u2019s done and that was, those units were started up a couple of weeks ago and so that impact is gone.","Now having said that when you look at the Maya 2-1-1, one of the points I continue to make is byproduct pricing like coke has been depressed and so you don\u2019t always realize the full Maya 2-1-1. It just depends on how co-products move in that business to so to speak.","And so the crude oil trading between the WTI and Brent, that caught us at the end of last year, that was more of a January event and so things look pretty good. We\u2019re still buying some distressed cargos and we running very well at the refinery and so hopefully we post some good numbers.","Rob Walker - Jefferies","And can you just clarify the last point, so theoretically the Houston asset might be roughly a hundred million below what the benchmark would have suggested the Maya 2-1-1, your cracks spread capture rate, the $20 million is from the synergies, with the remainder, if you had to divide that up between coke versus other trading activities?","Doug Pike","I would say yeah, 20 million from the first, the January and trading actually activity going to hang over the WTI, we had about 20 from the turnarounds. And then the balance really are things like the coke side, also just timing of things. One thing you got to remember that this refinery is a very big facility. So the timing of purchases and sales can have an impact on results in any one quarter.","So there is always going to be a little bit of variability from the benchmark here. So and sometimes that will be on positive side, sometimes it will be a little bit negative. I think there was a timing impact that impacted, it had a first quarter impact to us. But we wouldn\u2019t really change our thoughts going forward and what we've guided you to for a metric and a formula to be used for the benchmark with the exception of remember what Jim said is some of co-products like coke you know had a lower price being depressed by this right now. ","Jim Gallogly","I think an important takeaway though is it, this refinery is running so much better than it did in prior years. We can exceed nameplate fairly regularly and we are much smarter about the way we buy crude and sell our clean products. So it\u2019s totally a different asset than it used to be","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. I just wanted to circle back on the ethane price commentary and if I have mischaracterized what you said, Jim please correct me. But I believe you are sort of indicating that you weren\u2019t concerned of the ethylene prices going up in the back half the year which is consistent with what one of your peers said last week.","So I just wanted to revisit that and then also I do have that slide deck out from the presentation, I believe that I referred to earlier and if you could just sort of comment a little bit on what your expectations are on the demand side of things over the next let's say 12 or 18 months and may be specifically what I am thinking about is just sort of the level of capacity creep that could take place in the industry that might not be announced or visible from some of your competitors and how if all that factors into your thought process here?","Jim Gallogly","Well I think the specific thing that I said Vincent is that ethane was around $0.50 right now plus or minus some, could they go up some in the third quarter. I think it could, how much? It is very, very difficult to predict. But we have a lot of variables that play here. As you know rig count has dropped pretty significantly as a result of lower gas prices. We are above $2 and them now again, it really needs to be much better than that just to sustain the heavier rig count looking for natural gas.","Having said that because liquid prices are much better. You still see pretty good rig counts in the fields that are [wet] and that\u2019s positive that you know they are still looking for that and adding the volumes. We have had some studies done internally where we looked at supply demands on NGLs and you know say they are reasonably balanced. I think it was the words that I used into the second or third quarter may be starting to go a little long in the fourth quarter and then the next year we think they should be long from everything we see. ","And in terms of the demand side, the US economy has been better than other parts of the world. This is a, lot of our product goes into the domestic market and so a lot depends on the economy, but it's been reasonably good. So we still feel pretty good about our business going forward. Out into 2013 and 2014 we feel very good. Ethane gets long, propane has been helping us some and we think that there's not much new capacity being added in the early years and so it should be very good. ","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","So just then, is it fair to assume that you do not believe that there's any risk from, what you would call sort of hidden capacity created from your competitors in the next 12 to 18 months, if that's properly reflected in your forecast?","Jim Gallogly","Well, hidden capacity increase on the ethane consumption side?","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, or is the risk just not material? That could be answer to it.","Jim Gallogly","Well, I just done explaining to someone that we might go up 2% to 3% here or there in our capacity to crack ethane and other NGLs and I think other people are trying to do that. A part of that depends on where they are in turnaround schedules and all because sometimes you need to turn around to capture that capacity, you have to actually change hardware.","And you need to be down to accomplish that. So I think everybody who could, has been but I do want to make a special point about propane because it's helping and propane has been pricing reasonably close to ethane and obviously you get to more co-products with that and so if other people are like us, they maybe running some more furnaces on propane than they had in the past based on relative pricing.","Doug Pike","And Vincent one other thing I would say is one other thing to think about is the turnaround activity and what we have seen this year is we are talking about ability to consume, but we\u2019ve also seen ethane production records in ethane and propane inventories both rising a little bit fast by multiple month. So you\u2019ll see the balances.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Cash of UBS. Your line is open.","Andy Cash - UBS","Firstly, stock behaving where it is and I would imagine that you would like to buyback some stock here, but given the Dutch tax penalty, I am just curious maybe you could go through and explain to us what the earliest date that you think you could buyback some stock without that penalty and after that penalty is waste what will be the latitude let\u2019s say over 12 month period of time how much stock you could buyback if you decided to buyback?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yeah, beginning in January of 2013 we could potentially review our options as it related to share back buybacks without that significant tax penalty. Beyond the tax publications, we would look at obviously any share buybacks in relation to the any other accretive growth projects; cash use overall outlook in the market.","It doesn\u2019t mean we will or having intention at this point, but just that there was tax issue would no longer for preclude at. However, regardless of this, we would still need to keep in mind our current ownership structure and the potential concentration of ownership; our larger holders do not participate in that share buyback. But going forward, after January of 2013 those tax issues will no longer have on that kind of onerous consequence for us.","Andy Cash - UBS","And as far as the magnitude excluding the potential ownership is it something that has to relate to the dividend, how much dividend you paying and how much buyback it could be. Could you talk about that explain that?","Jim Gallogly","Well, Andy they are -- and it is that dividends are paid thus far and of course but not too that point in time yet; it is a substantial amount.","Andy Cash - UBS","And then if I could just to follow-up\u2026.","Jim Gallogly","Over a number of years.","Andy Cash - UBS","And just a quick follow-up, given that your turnaround of (inaudible) and Channelview, was the 1.5 billion pounds of polyethylene in the first quarter, was that low watermark for polyethylene this year.","Jim Gallogly","Well, we\u2019ll see how the year develops for the sales you mean.","Andy Cash - UBS","Yeah, as far as the volume; I mean I was surprised how strong it was; that was very strong.","Jim Gallogly","Remember Andy, we just spoke about it and built inventory of ethane prior to the fourth quarter so we can meet the customer requirements. So I think as you are commenting on demand, it was okay in the quarter and we were able to meet the demand through the actions that we took in anticipation that it turnaround. We\u2019ll see how the rest of the year develops out for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Gregg Goodnight of UBS Financial. Your line is open.","Gregg Goodnight - UBS Financial","Good mornings. Congratulations on your safety performance. That\u2019s truly outstanding for turnaround quarter.","Jim Gallogly","Thanks Gregg. That\u2019s something we worked very hard at.","","Gregg Goodnight - UBS Financial","Could you comment on the timing of tax refund Karyn, is that a first quarter or second quarter event?","Karyn Ovelmen","We received the $250 million in the first quarter. The cash has been received.","","Gregg Goodnight - UBS Financial","Second question, the Clinton shutdown as I understand that has been scheduled in May, perhaps five to six weeks. Is there any chance of delaying that outage now that the margins are so spectacular on the very cheap Midwest ethane?","Jim Gallogly","No Gregg, we don\u2019t have the six week outage at hand.","Gregg Goodnight - UBS Financial","I am sorry; I picked that up from a consultant.","Jim Gallogly","I know its been reported before; we may have some downtime to do a little bit of work over the next couple of quarters but nothing else of that magnitude at this time.","Gregg Goodnight - UBS Financial","Okay, maybe a couple of weeks or something like that, what would the timing be?","Jim Gallogly","We don\u2019t have a turnaround in that one, it\u2019s scheduled as you are suggesting here; we\u2019ve had a little bit of an outage but, no turnaround and activity like that. We have been doing some premise maintenance, but I am not sure where that\u2019s coming from.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Charles Neivert of Dahlman Rose. Your line is open.","Charles Neivert - Dahlman Rose","A quick question on the turnaround of Channelview what would you clarify is the cost of sort of using inventory ethylene instead of because it\u2019s got a lot higher cost structure in it from whatever feedstock\u2019s you are using considering especially the drop across from fourth quarter into 1Q in terms of the cost structure; can that get quantified in the first quarter; how much of the effect cost you?","Jim Gallogly","We\u2019ll try to keep things I think that is, basically the turnaround work impacted production by a couple of hundred million pounds, as we said, it\u2019s really matter of pressing the needs so we have a couple of hundred million pounds that have been able to reduce it.","Charles Neivert - Dahlman Rose","But I mean what you used out of the inventory to basically keep your supply more\u2026.?","Jim Gallogly","If you recall from our fourth quarter call, we said we actually purchased (inaudible) inventory, so we purchased inventory here, so we referred to seeing under 50 as we\u2019ll produce them into 20.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi Jim, you referenced a few times that the propane crack is becoming fairly competitive with the ethane crack. And so I am wondering if propane continues to lengthen over the summer here such that that becomes an advantage feed relative to ethane, what is the maximum amount of propane that your US asset base could handle in percentage terms and does that figure changed at all with your Channelview feedstock flexibility project once that's done?","Jim Gallogly","We can go back to where we were, we can still crack very heavy at Channelview, we can still do the same thing down the Corpus and so propane is very, very easy to take into our furnaces and so I don't think we will be very limited on that.","In fact another way of thinking about that is if we can do high 60s in ethane and we want to start pulling in propane that number goes up if we needed to.","Now I am not trying to infer that propane will overcome ethane longer-term in terms of overall pricing, I am saying that it does kind of help put a cap on things. And it does overall improve the relative pricing of ethane because of additional propane that's being cracked because of good economics.","But I don't see it going really long propane and you know a lot loss ethane. I think ethane will stay favorite. Realistically, I think probably ethane has to react.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","So just to clarify, if I look at the 82% figure you mentioned for NGLs and 68% ethane, I guess we are running 14% as the sum of propane and butane; it sounds to me like that number may not necessarily move a lot higher, but if the propane crack improves your benefit through a loser ethane market essentially; is that fair?","Jim Gallogly","Yeah, it could increase significantly, if we wanted it to, but we wouldn\u2019t probably because what I am saying is that ethane should stay the lower and to favor crack. But let\u2019s see, how would I say that differently that I am trying to say that ethane, in this coast of the argument that ethane gets short into the third quarter and fourth quarter and as result their price will spike like we saw following some outages at Bellevue last you related to a fire; I don\u2019t see that happening absent some unusual situation like that again, because we are very along at propane right now. That was the one I remember.","Doug Pike","I think keep saying the number the problem is that its really only one -- well two places for ethane to go. One is to stay in fuel up to a certain extent, but at the point its only working about $0.15 like we\u2019re seeing in the Midwest right now.","The other alternative is to crack it, so we tend to think its going to remain -- have to remain competitive to the propane side of it and as Jim was saying, propane is going to cap your ethane situation.","As you think about it, what we\u2019ve done is lately opened up the feeds there. You know there is always a lot of discussion about ethane coming off of these wells, now 47% ethane is about 28% propane, but it really opened up the cracking like in the industry propane is competitive.","And Jim has a couple of comments he would like to make to close.","Jim Gallogly","Yes. Let me just finish that up. I believe we did have a very solid start to the year. First quarter is normally a weaker quarter, but several of our businesses had excellent results. U.S opens at over a $500 million a quarter, despite Channelview, OP-1 and OP-2 being down a fair amount of that quarter. It\u2019s very rare when both of those are down, but we still had that kind of Olefin result.","Refining & Oxyfuels also had a very good start to the year and I&D continues to perform well quarter-after-quarter. Obviously, the fourth quarter we had some turnaround activity, but if you look at a normalized I&D quarter, very, very solid. We are finishing up our refinancing efforts and our stand of course has given us an investment grade corporate rating and this is a major milestone for the company; something that we wanted to see for quite some time, a very solid balance sheet at this point in time.","We\u2019re in cyclical businesses, we are going to closely monitor European and Asia business conditions, but overall we feel very good about our relative competitive position.","Thanks for joining us.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today\u2019s presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the call -- conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Doug Pike","Well, thank you. Hello. And welcome to LyondellBasell's First Quarter 2015 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions. Before we begin business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website www.lyondellbasell.com.","I'd also like for you to note that the statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. And for more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at lyondellbasell.com\/InvestorRelations.","A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website lyondellbasell.com.","Finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today until 11 p.m. Eastern Time on May 24th by calling (866) 839-4837 in the United States and (203) 369-3588 outside the United States and the pass code for both numbers is 4558.","Now during today's call, we'll focus on first quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. But before turning the call over to Bob, I\u2019d like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustment or LCM that we recognized during quarter.","This charge is somewhat unique to our 2010 company formation, when all assets and liabilities were measured at fair value, our use of LIFO accounting and the recent declines in prices for many of our raw materials and finished goods inventories. The comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impact of LCM inventory charges.","That being said, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning. Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanying this call and is available on our website. Let\u2019s take a look at slide four and review a few financial highlights.","First quarter earnings per share were $2.54, but EBITDA of $2.04 billion, excluding a $92 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment. This quarter the EPS figure is a new high for LyondellBasell and our EBITDA has now averaged approximately $2 billion in each of the last four quarters. This can be seen in the lower left chart.","Strong operational and business performance coupled with share repurchases contributed to a quarterly diluted earnings per share increase of $0.82 per share since the first quarter of last year.","Over this one year period, our outstanding share count was reduced by 58 million shares or 11%. At the end of March, we had 475 million shares outstanding and as of the 22nd of April approximately 473 shares are outstanding.","Overall, our business portfolio has continued to perform well, margins and volumes have been good leading to consistent strong results. Our revenues have declined since product prices have followed crude oil price declines. Ultimately, in our business, profitability and cash generation are more important metrics and both have been strong.","The sustained strength of LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability over the past year in this volatile crude oil environment can be attributed to a combination of items which have helped offset the impact of lower product prices related to the decline in crude oil.","First, tightness in the global ethylene and polyethylene supply and demand balances help support product prices. This has been driven in part by planned and unplanned industry downtime, which is persistent into the early weeks of April.","Coupled with our solid operations, our O&P segments have benefited from these favorable balances. Additionally, our O&P and I&D segments have benefited from lower U.S. natural gas and NGL prices, which have lowered our production costs.","In Refining, increased availability of Canadian crude oil and improving ratio of byproduct pricing to crude oil have benefited the Refining segment. First, we are also benefiting from the ethylene and polyethylene expansions that we completed last year, and our share repurchase program and resulting lower share count having a material effect in raising earnings per share.","On slide five, you will note that our safety performance continues to be very good and is showing some improvement when compared with 2014. While we are proud of these results, we certainly not satisfied until we reach perfection in this area.","Please turn to slide six and our first quarter and last 12 months EBITDA results. Within the segments, the O&P-Americas first quarter EBITDA was just shy of $1.1 billion. Olefin prices declined with lower global crude oil prices. However, polyolefin in change margins did not fall as much.","In O&P-EAI, EBITDA exceeded $350 million. As in the Americas segment olefin prices and margins declined, while polyolefin results improved. In the Intermediates and Derivatives, EBITDA exceeded $375 million, Ethylene oxide and derivatives continued to demonstrate steady performance, methanol results declined due to scheduled first quarter maintenance.","During the first quarter, Refining posted EBITDA of $154 million, a highest quarter in more than two years. Crude oil throughput was down but margins increased. Our Technology segment continued to enjoy consistent strong earnings.","I will now turn the call over to Karyn for our summary of cash flow.","Karyn Ovelmen","Thanks, Bob. Slide seven and eight provide picture of our cash generation and use. During the first quarter, we generated $1.5 billion from our operations and issued $1 billion in 40-year bonds at an interest rate of 4.625%.","Our cash and short-term securities balance improved as a result ending the quarter with $3.6 billion or about $600 million more cash and securities than at the end of 2014. Cash used for share repurchases and dividends totaled $1.7 billion during the quarter.","During the first quarter we make several annual payments, including Taxes property taxes, customer volume rebates and employee bonuses. Together, these payments totaled approximately $465 million.","During the past 12 months, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations, while raising $1 billion from bond issuances and issuing over $4 million in commercial paper. Almost $7.4 billion were used for share repurchases and dividends and another $1.5 billion invested in capital expenditures.","Before I wrap up, I want to point a couple of other items that might help your analysis. First, our book tax rate was 27% in line with our previous guidance. Depreciation and amortization was $287 million. However, this includes a non-recurring $35 million impact from amortization of an environmental credit.","Thus, the first quarter run rate is below previous guidance. Assuming the euro dollar relationship remains near first quarter levels, we would expect depreciation and amortization to remain near the adjusted first quarter run rate.","The final point, I want to discuss is our overall foreign exchange exposure. We have defined some of the pertinent points on slide nine. There are lot of moving parts in our global business but in the end, we believe that the real economic and business exposure to foreign exchange is small relative to the size of our business.","Our businesses tend to be global in nature and priced off of crude oil based raw materials. Therefore our products are generally priced in relation to dollars. Of course, we do experience translation impacts in our reported numbers. This quarter the reported translation impact is $45 million as compared with the fourth quarter exchange rate.","However, we believe that this was mostly offset within the business and the true economic impact was not significant within our earnings. Along with the nature of the business serving as a foreign exchange buffer, we also hedged our net transaction exposure. When all aspects are considered, we don\u2019t believe that exchange rate had a significant impact on first quarter results.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Bob.","Bob Patel","Thanks Karyn. Let\u2019s move to a deeper discussion of the underlying segment results, excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charge. Slides 10 and 11 pertain to Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas. First quarter EBITDA was $1.07 billion, about $200 million less than the fourth quarter.","Olefins results declined by $280 million as ethylene prices declined by $0.14 per pound from Q4 to Q1. This was partially offset by lower cost of ethylene production, which modestly declined due to lower feedstock and natural gas cost.","Our U.S. olefins plant ran at approximately 97% operating rate during the quarter, approximately 10% ahead of the U.S. industry average. Our metathesis unit ran throughout the quarter generating approximately $20 million of EBITDA. Approximately 90% of our ethylene was produced from NGLs with ethane representing approximately 70% of ethylene production.","On slide 11, we have plotted the key NGL prices and the costs of ethylene production metrics as estimated by IHS. These provide good perspective on the NGL price response to the decline in the price of crude oil as well as the impact to the cost of ethylene production.","You can see that U.S. propane and butane prices largely followed the price of crude oil lower. Similarly ethane prices followed natural gas prices. These movements accompanied by co-product price movements result in IHS' estimated cost of ethylene production metrics, plotted on the right hand side of the slide versus the first quarter of last year, IHS' estimates that the price of ethylene declined by nearly $0.14 per pound while the cost of ethylene production metric declined by nearly $0.10 per pound.","Our margin results show a similar trend while volumes are benefiting from our expansions in the absence of last year\u2019s significant turnaround activity. While the olefins results declined sequentially, polyolefin results improved by approximately $75 million as price declines lagged the declines in monomer prices. This led to an increase in margin versus the fourth quarter of 2014. However, both polyethylene and polypropylene margins declined as the quarter progressed and finished the quarter lower than where they started.","Thus far during the first weeks of April, sales and production volumes have been relatively consistent with the end of first quarter pace. We don\u2019t have any significant maintenance plan for the quarter. Our 250 million pound per year Channelview ethylene expansion is scheduled to be online late in the second quarter. From a cost standpoint, NGL and natural gas cost remained low. At this time, April product prices are still being negotiated. So I won\u2019t offer further commentary.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 12 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. First quarter EBITDA was $357 million or $35 million less than the fourth quarter. Olefin results declined by approximately $105 million, similar to the America segment, the decline is related to lower pricing versus the fourth quarter of 2014, the first quarter average ethylene price declined by $0.14 per pound roughly equivalent to the decline in the Americas segment.","Our cost of ethylene production metric was relatively unchanged in dollar terms. We produced almost 50% of our ethylene from raw materials with the cost advantage to naphtha. While still significant, the contribution from these feeds declined by approximately $15 million versus the fourth quarter.","Olefin operating rates remain strong at 94% of capacity, more than 10% ahead of the European industry average. Combined polyolefin results partially offset lower olefin results as EBITDA improved by approximately $45 million.","Volume increased in polyethylene and polypropylene by 22% and 16% respectively. Polyolefin spreads improved roughly 9% in local currency but they were unchanged on a dollar basis. Polypropylene compounds and polybutene-1 benefited seasonally as volumes improved by approximately 12%, coupled with increased margins, EBITDA increased by approximately $30 million. JV equity income increased slightly to $57 million. April business conditions have been relatively consistent with those experienced during the first quarter.","Now, please turn to slide 13 for discussion of our intermediates and derivative segment. Exclusive of the LCM impacts, first quarter EBITDA was $381 million, $17 million higher than the fourth quarter. Propylene oxide and derivatives results improved by approximately $15 million on 11% higher volume. Industry maintenance and sales into the aircraft de-icing end use contributed to the volume increase.","Intermediate chemical performance improved by approximately $35 million. However, it is often the case, individual products saw varying results. Acetyl results declined by approximately $20 million due to our scheduled Channelview methanol plant maintenance and lower product margins, each was responsible for approximately half of that decline. The methanol plant returned to operation in March and ran near full rates since that time.","The acetyl decline was offset by stronger EO, EG and styrene results as well as the absence of some fourth quarter costs. Oxyfuel results were lower by approximately $35 million, primarily due to lower margins following a typically strong fourth quarter margins.","For oxyfuels, our year-on-year comparison removed seasonality and provide a different perspective. On this basis, you can see in the chart on the lower right that raw material margins are relatively unchanged. This variance might surprise you given the decline in crude oil and gasoline pricing. However, butane and methanol raw material cost have also declined.","April business conditions have been generally similar to conditions experienced late in the first quarter. We\u2019ll have a PO\/SM unit turnaround at Channelview during the quarter. This will impact propylene oxide and styrene production. Although plans have been made to minimize the impact, we estimate that second quarter segment results will be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million.","Let\u2019s move to slide 14 for the discussion of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $154 million. Excluding LCM impacts, this is $121 million quarter-on-quarter increase. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $23.74 per barrel. The realized spread of the refinery was relatively consistent with the Maya 2-1-1 spread.","Crude throughput averaged 241,000 barrels per day, a decline of about 25,000 barrels per day, primarily due to maintenance and the third-party off-gas processor and some maintenance within the refinery.","The lower throughput impacted results by approximately $20 million. During the quarter, we increased shipments of -- we received increased shipments of Canadian crude oil, as a result of the volume of combined Canadian and light U.S. crude process doubled versus the fourth quarter, reaching almost 30% of our crude slate.","However, during the period, the per barrel advantage was relatively small versus other heavy crude oil. The capture rate on the benchmark spread improved as the price difference between byproduct and crude prices declined. This has waived the capture rate on the spread to the low 70% level from approximately 60% during 2014.","RIN costs were relatively unchanged versus the fourth quarter. April benchmark spreads have averaged approximately $23 per barrel. The third-party facility that impacted first quarter operating rates has completed their maintenance.","During April, we have operated the refinery unit less than full capacity as we conducted some maintenance ourselves. We plan to increase rates shortly. This will slightly impact second quarter throughput.","As you may know, the majority of our employees at the Houston refinery represented by the United Steelworkers union remain out on strike. The company has negotiated diligently and in good faith with the union from the beginning and we remain committed to negotiating in good faith and for a fair and responsible contract.","To date, the parties have been unable to reach agreement on local issues and the strike continues. As a result of this strike, we\u2019ve decided to delay our planned fourth quarter FCC turnaround to first quarter 2016.","I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank all of our employees and contractors who have been operating the refinery during this period, including employees represented by the union who have elected to return to work. Through their commitment, we\u2019ve operated the refinery safely, reliably and enabled it to achieve the best quarterly results in over two years.","Our technology segment continued to perform well, with both the catalyst and licensing businesses slightly ahead of fourth quarter results. In this segment, licensing revenues can be lumpy.","We would now turn to slide 15. I'll briefly summarize and then we'll take your questions. The key point, I want to emphasize is the consistency and strength in our results across the past four quarters and while we have experienced a very volatile crude oil and raw material market, our businesses have performed consistently well.","In O&P Americas, we\u2019ve been aided by strong operational performance, olefin margin improvement and low-cost natural gas and NGLs. In O&P-EAI, it is a similar story as both naphtha and advantage raw material costs have declined to offset falling product prices.","Although, we have a translational effect related to the euro-dollar exchange rate, increases in euro based results offset the impact. As a result, dollar based margins and spreads were relatively unchanged.","Our I&D segment continued to show consistent results of the characteristics of its product, contracts and portfolio dampen the impacts of raw material volatility. The Houston refinery bounced back from a weak fourth quarter to post results that exceeded the past nine quarters.","Our first quarter results in my comments regarding April business should provide a level of comfort that our business is responding very well in this period of crude oil price volatility. Our focus on operations and optimization enable us to move quickly. ","Meanwhile, our project teams continued to move our expansions forward with the next start-ups scheduled for the end of this quarter. It\u2019s difficult to say that every quarter in 2015 will achieve the earnings results of this quarter. However, our focus on safety, operational reliability and costs position us to perform relatively well in any environment. Thus far, April has not disappointed.","At this time, I will close the formal comments by reminding you that we will hold our Investor Day next Wednesday in New York and via webcast. With that, we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just wanted to understand some of your comments. You've pointed out some outages that are supporting pricing right now and you said that conditions are relatively consistent. Can you comment on the demand trends that you're seeing in April and maybe your expectations for May and June? Do you expect restocking or increased consumer demand, especially in Europe as well just given a weak euro? Thanks.","Bob Patel","Market conditions are very strong, as I mentioned in the previous earnings call. Generally, we see seasonal improvement in our demand going in Q2. So if you look back in time, Q2 tends to be one of our stronger quarters in terms of demand. As we sit here today, supply-demand balances are well balanced and any small outages have caused tightness or even shortage in regional market. So my sense is that volumes will remain strong in U.S. and Europe in April, May and June. Small outages or regional outages can cause local disruptions. We are at that point on the operating rate curve where markets are -- supply and demand are well balanced.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up in I&D as well, you stated in the press release that there are some seasonal benefits. Maybe you can just help us parse that out with some of the downtime. Do you expect Q2 results to be up? And then how does the rest of the year play out? Thanks.","Bob Patel","Generally, Arun in I&D, the seasonality comes from oxyfuels where we benefit from butane is becoming relatively less expensive in the summer months and the blend season kicks in. So, I expect that oxyfuel results should improve as they do each year seasonally in Q2. For the rest of the year, we expect very good demand for all of our products in the I&D business.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi. You may ask your question.","PJ Juvekar","Yes. Good morning, Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","PJ Juvekar","European and Asian ethylene seems to be quite tight. And I think there are a couple of things going on. I think 10% to 12% of Asian capacity is out for maintenance. And then secondly, oil prices have gone up. So that might cause some restocking. So how do you think about this tightness and how do you think that plays out for rest of the year?","Bob Patel","In the case of Asia, supply and demand balances are tight. And then as you rightly note, there were lot of outages in Q1. From what we see in the IHS information, the planned outages are actually going to be higher in Q2 compared to Q1. So, I would expect that in a rising oil environment, the restocking plus seasonal demand increase should be positive for products sales into Asia. And I think that should tighten the global supply demand balance, especially for polyethylene.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you. And then secondly, just on a longer-term issue, oil and gas CapEx has come down quite a bit. The rig count has fallen and it seems like the labor pressure on the Gulf Coast is easing a little bit. Would you like to take advantage of that with any further brown field or green field projects, or is that too early to make a call? Thank you.","Bob Patel","Thanks, P.J. Well, I think it\u2019s a little early to make that call, because we really haven\u2019t seen the labor rate stabilize yet. Perhaps it\u2019s safe to say that the rate of increase in labor rates has not been as much as what we\u2019ve experienced. We will continue to evaluate that, but as you know, we have a lot of projects still in front of us that we need to execute in terms of the bottlenecks.","We remain focused on those as those are low costs, high return and they will be well ahead of the first class routes capacity that will come out. So we will evaluate as we continue to evolve our strategy, but at this point, we remain committed and focused on executing what we have in front of us and then we will see how labor markets evolve.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","David Begleiter","Good morning. Bob, can you discuss your view of U.S. ethane now $0.18 a gallon near all-time lows. How do you see that price trending this year and how you do ethane supply demand going forward over the next three or four years, given perhaps maybe a little lower growing activity and increased demand from new crackers and export facilities?","Bob Patel","Well, in terms of supply demand balance, we see still an abundance of ethane. They are somewhere 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day of ethane being rejected today. So that\u2019s a significant amount and could supply several world scale crackers that will be built in the U.S.","In terms of the near-term price dynamics, it seems to me that the ethane has been trading right around its field value and with propane being abundant, propane will be competing to be in the cracker feed slate here in the U.S. So between both of those being well supplied, my sense is that ethane will be closer to its fuel value in the foreseeable future. And with natural gas prices at $2.50 coming in the December months, I expect that ethane prices should be where they are today.","David Begleiter","Very good. And Bob, just make -- I am sure you will address this Wednesday, but how do you view acquisitions and what role they might play in Lyondell\u2019s future over the next five to seven years?","Bob Patel","Our focus David has been on share repurchase as a means of deploying our free cash flow. That\u2019s really the benchmark that we compare acquisitions to. We will continue to develop our strategy with our Board and we will look at different alternatives, but frankly we have to think about why -- what are we trying to sell for. It is an acquisition for the sake of growth or to become bigger not necessary as we are already a very large company with the global footprint.","We have incredible scale and we will show you that next week at Investor Day. So we are in a great spot. We don\u2019t have to do something in terms of an acquisition today. We will evaluate different options of our strategy with our Board and in the meantime continue to focus on delivering on our CapEx that we in front of us and continue our share repurchase program as we have outlined.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. You may ask your question.","Hassan Ahmed","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Hassan Ahmed","You broadly spoke about demand obviously being good and you mentioned restocking generally. My question is a bit more specific about the polypropylene side of things. If I take a look at sequential volume improvements, a good 6% in O&P Americas, up 16% within EAI. Is this sort of sustainable? Is this primarily restocking related? I mean, if you could talk a bit about the polypropylene market in general.","Bob Patel","Yes. I think in polypropylene in both regions, demand is growing at a reasonable rate. There is some restocking that probably occurred in Q1 and some destocking on our side. So if you think about an inventory in the value chain, I am not sure that has increased significantly. It\u2019s probably shifted a little more downstream.","Having said that, I don\u2019t think inventory downstream is on the high side, it\u2019s probably about right going into a seasonal uptick in Q2. So could we experience 16% growth quarter-after-quarter probably not. There are some timing effects here. But I do see demand being very strong globally. And Q2, as I mentioned earlier, tends to be our stronger quarter in terms of volume.","Hassan Ahmed","Fair enough. Now as a follow-up, as sort of more of your brown field facilities come online and expansions happen. Within the Americas you are becoming net long ethylene to the tunes of I would say over 1 billion pounds. So what is the plan associated with that ethylene? Do you want to continue sort of being a merchant seller of ethylene? Do you want to integrate into may be polyethylene units, I mean what\u2019s the strategy there?","Bob Patel","Well, we have many options in front of us. This is one of the topics that we will discuss next week at Investor Day, but briefly the options we have in front of us are merchant sales which there is still plenty of opportunities out there, a new polyethylene plant, or we could build another metathesis plant to make propylene.","So we continue to evaluate that and we will discuss a little more in detail next week at Investor Day how we think about those options, but we think we have a solid options ahead of us and the bottleneck projects have very good returns.","Hassan Ahmed","Very good. Thanks so much, Bob.","Bob Patel","Thank you, Hassan.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Bob, could you talk a little bit about sort of where we -- how we should think about the European operating rates over the next couple of quarters, obviously very high this quarter and obviously lot about it just, but how should we thinking about it into Q2 and then maybe thereafter?","Bob Patel","European operating rates have been strong and in my view will be strong going into Q2. Vincent, there is a couple of things that are going on in Europe and I think are benefiting the operations there. One is the weaker euro is improving export competitiveness of our customers as the end users of our products. And we are seeing less imports because of the weaker euro.","So more and more of what we are seeing is competitiveness of polyethylene or polypropylene exports as well as finished goods. The other is of course lower oil price makes Europe competitive on the global cost curve. So my sense is that we are going to run at full capacity for the foreseeable future Q2 and Q3. I don\u2019t expect that to change.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up, you addressed sort of how you think about the ethane price forecast going forward as it relates to new capacity. But what do you think might happen on the outlook price, on the polyethylene price as always new crackers come along, and presumably that product has get forced out into the export market and what do you think that could do to spreads for sort of balance for North America?","Bob Patel","Well, I think longer-term as some of the larger green field capacity comes online that product will be exported on the increment to either Asia or to South America. And so the margins in the U.S. will largely depend on the crude to gas ratio and cost of production in destination markets like China.","And so my sense is that just like the Middle East and years ago built out their capacity to export, will the U.S. will fulfill ethylene derivative demand growth in the coming years. And so I think the margins will still be good and in the sense the U.S. advantage is present today and could get better as the crude to gas ratio increases again.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thanks very much.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura. You may ask your question.","Aleksey Yefremov","Good morning. Your working capital declined slightly quarter-over-quarter? Do you expect to realize more pronounced benefit later in the year in terms of your working capital? Thank you.","Karyn Ovelmen","We don\u2019t expect any major swings in working through the end of the year. We exclude LCM in some of the Forex. It really were pretty flat on a normalize basis in terms of working capital. And we expect that kind of -- we\u2019ll see some seasonality towards the end of the year, but no significant changes in working capital through the year.","Bob Patel","Yeah. We don\u2019t have any significant inventory dislocations in our system.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you. And as a follow-up, another question on ethane, do you think there is enough pipeline capacity that connects the Northeast NGL producing regions to the Gulf Coast? We currently have one pipeline? Do you think there are more pipelines needed and if that is the case, do you think those pipelines can be build in time for ethylene crackers startups in 2018?","Bob Patel","Well, I think, there is sufficient supply of ethane here on the Gulf Coast already. And as those crackers get built out, I would imagine that some of the lines that we are going south to north will be reversed and will get more ethane from the north.","Sergey Vasnetsov","Yeah. Aleksey, I think, in general Marcellus and Utica as they build up. Off take has been one of the issues. It\u2019s been address first by the ATEX pipeline. There have been two more pipeline proposals. It\u2019s a same in gas coming off of those facility but they have to build out the infrastructure. And really this is all part of what\u2019s been going on in the industry really for the last five years. The E&P progresses than the midstream catches up and we been a logical beneficiary of it as they develop.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. You may ask your question.","Don Carson","Thank you. Question on U.S. feed slate in the quarter and going forward. Bob, you mentioned that you -- 90% of your feed slate was NGLs, was 70 percentage points ethane. Is that 20% dealt to the max propane and butane you can crack and if so would you plan on any investments to increase your flexibility to crack propane and butane?","Bob Patel","Yeah. Don, not necessarily that that 20% is the max and we have more flexibility within that. It\u2019s just a question of economic and optimization, and how we run our crackers week to week, but we have flexibility. And remember we also crack some liquid feed stocks down in Corpus Christi. So its not just ethane and propane, we kind of crack full range.","Sergey Vasnetsov","And we\u2019ll talk to this some more in the Investor Day as well.","Bob Patel","Yeah.","Don Carson","Okay. And then just a follow-up on near-term pricing, it looks like polyethylene is going to rollover flat in April. There is an industry thought an initiative in May that looks like it has real support? How long you think this tightness in polyethylene is seasonal uptake that we\u2019re seeing? What\u2019s kind of your price outlook for not only in Q2 but also going into the second half of the year?","Bob Patel","Well, I\u2019ll speak to markets rather than price and I would say that, the supply demand is very firm today. And so there is market underpinning or what you see -- and so we\u2019ll just have you see how the quarter develops. But I\u2019m very bullish about demand for Q2. I think demand for Q2 will be very good as it is seasonal.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Operator","And so our next question comes from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. You may ask your question.","James Sheehan","Thanks. Question for Karyn. How do you see the pace of share buybacks occurring through the rest of the year?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yeah. We are going to -- we\u2019ll continue to on the pace that we are at. We have the second 10% that will be wrapping up here in the May timeframe. And in our next Annual Meeting we have the authorization that we expect to get approval for an additional 10% going forward.","James Sheehan","Thanks. And on the Refining segments you mentioned some maintenance occurring here in the second quarter. How do you see that affecting throughput?","Sergey Vasnetsov","I think it will be minimal. We just about completed and already started, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be material for the segment.","James Sheehan","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. You may ask your question.","John Roberts","Good morning. Nice quarter. One of the messages from the IAHS Conference last month was that we\u2019re heading into a period where propylene would be long relative to ethylene. I don\u2019t know if you agree with that? And if you do agree with that, how does -- is that going to play out through your polypropylene, propylene oxide. You mentioned you're looking at expanding metathesis? I don't think you do that along propylene market, but maybe if you could give us your outlook on propylene?","Bob Patel","Sure. Thanks for the question, John. Well, propylene is one of those molecules that when its get long, the sources of production tend to adjust. So, for example, when propylene values fall, generally you crack less propane, you crack more ethane.","For us we have the flexibility to run the metathesis unit or not to run the metathesis unit. We\u2019ll certainly evaluate that as we think about investment. I know that IAHS has a view on propane.","To propylene, the PDH plants when they come on. But remember as propane balances become narrower and propane price could rise and therefore, propylene from propane could become more expensive. So there are a lot of factors that impact the propylene price and it is very dynamic. So before we make an investment, certainly we would think through all of those factors.","John Roberts","So you\u2019re thinking propane rises or are you thinking propane stays low?","Bob Patel","I think if there\u2019s a lot of propane consumption, propane could rise. And remember propane can be exported as well in a much larger quantities that ethane can. So we\u2019ll just have to see how those supply-demand balances develop over the longer term. It all just depends on the timeframe.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","And so our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good morning. Bob, if we look at the industry data, looks like polyethylene resin exports surged something like 42% in March after five straight months of decline. So if you could talk about your own mix of domestic polyethylene sales versus exports and with outages overseas, would you expect the international trade component to remain strong?","Bob Patel","Kevin, our exports have increased a little. But we -- as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past calls, we tend to export a little bit less than the industry average. And generally, we have longer-term sales contracts going to South America rather than Asia. So our focus is less on Asia when it comes to exports. I do think that the industry has exported a bit more, I\u2019ve seen that in some of the data that\u2019s been published but for us it\u2019s not significant in terms of the increase.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. And then as a second question, it looks as though you're propylene monomer production increased 12% in 1Q versus 4Q. Is that all explained by your metathesis unit and then did you run that unit full out in the quarter or did you crack more propane as well?","Bob Patel","It\u2019s the combination of the two, Kevin. We did run the metathesis unit most of the quarter. That contributed to most of the propylene production increase. And then some of that was a bit more [Technical Difficulty] propane.","Kevin McCarthy","Okay. Thank you very much.","Bob Patel","Mostly, metathesis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.","Frank Mitsch","Yes, good morning folks. And obviously a great start to the year. Bob, I\u2019m just curious, obviously, a big deal relative to the three. From your perspective where there any big surprises, relative to what your expectations were three weeks ago, I'm sorry three months ago or not necessarily?","Bob Patel","Good morning, Frank. For us I think what\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen develop over the quarter is that the market is a lot stronger that we expected and supply demand are much more balanced, some of these outages that we didn't predict. Our sense is that we are really realizing markets where operating rates are in that 90%, 92% range and when there are outages, it causes some margin expansion. And of course, I think prices come off a bit during the period. Our share repurchases have benefited us as well. There are a lot of factors. And we ran well as we are known to do. So not necessarily surprises, but I would say just more confirmation that we have a fairly strong market environment.","Frank Mitsch","All right. Terrific. I do concur that given everybody running as hard as they are, you are bound to have more unplanned outages than what the consultants are setting out there. So knock on wood, it\u2019s not even obviously your safety. Your safety slideshows that you know how to run assets? And then if I could ask a question on the I&D segment, you were talking about the PO\/SM turnaround being about a $20 million impacting Q2. If I am not mistaken, I think you were thinking that the methanol turnaround in Q1 was also going to be a $20 million impact. But I think your comments today suggested that was closer to $10 million, is that correct and if so why was it less of an impact?","Bob Patel","Yes. Actually, it\u2019s just because of the way the margins evolve in the methanol business during the quarter versus our prior estimate. And then on the PO\/SM unit it\u2019s based on what we know today in terms of margins. But we\u2019ve largely prepared and mitigated most of the impact of that PO\/SM outage. And by the way methanol plant is running very well and at nameplate capacity. So the team at Channelview did a really nice job in conducting the maintenance, getting it back up and delivering on what they had intended.","Frank Mitsch","Terrific and thank you so much.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA. You may ask your question.","Nils Wallin","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. In terms of your own operations obviously olefins in Americans has been running at very high rates for multiple quarters. Is there a risk that do you need to either pull back on those units at some point to prevent an unplanned outage or how do you look at the higher rates over sustainable period?","Bob Patel","Yeah. Good morning Nils. No, we are not running these units at above benchmark. We are not pushing them beyond their capability. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in past calls, we\u2019ve been very diligent in doing our turnarounds at the prescribed cycles and so on.","So I would say that our discipline around maintenance and around how we manage our operations allows us to run at our nameplate capacity. But we're not pushing beyond that necessarily. We don\u2019t want to go beyond the capability of the plant for near-term gain, that\u2019s not our philosophy so. And we\u2019ll continue to run within the capability of each of our units.","Nils Wallin","Understood. And then with respect to polyethylene inventories, do have a sense of what level they might be down at the customer converter level? There has been some discussion that distributors are starting to get their warehouses pretty full?","Bob Patel","No, I haven\u2019t heard any significant trend there. It could be that one or two have a bit more. But going into Q2, a bit more inventory shouldn't concern anybody because generally demand is very good. So my sense is inventory is kind of at par in the value chain. I don't think it\u2019s very high or very low frankly.","Nils Wallin","Thanks very much.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Good morning.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Jeff Zekauskas","Hi. Lyondell was always contemplating NLPs. Has it made a decision yet or positive or negative?","Bob Patel","Jeff, that's one of the topics we were going to cover at Investor Day next week. So, we\u2019ll provide our analysis and how we think about it and we'll discuss next week at Investor Day.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. That sounds great. And then secondly, your tax rate keeps coming down even though you make more in the United States. Can you explain why that's the case and if there\u2019s a difference between your book taxes and your cash taxes?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yeah. As far as the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, it\u2019s pretty much still in line that we are on 27% for an effective tax rate. And then on a cash tax basis, we are lower than that and we are in the 23% range. It\u2019s fairly consistent with prior years.","We continued our optimized -- our tax cash structure but we did see a slight, slight uptick here this quarter with larger earnings in the U.S. And you will see that as the mix of earnings for more North America based, you\u2019ll see our rates 10 and 12 depending on what jurisdictions our earnings are at.","Jeff Zekauskas","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning, guys.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Duffy Fischer","Questions on say just the last 12 months if we step way back 50,000 foot view, lot of volatility in oil and some of your inputs, not very much volatility in your earnings, Bob, I wonder if you could just kind of -- if you step back a year ago and we told you what would happen with energy, what surprised you and what actually played out over the last year versus what you would have thought a year ago?","Bob Patel","So, I think markets, they were a lot stronger than we thought they would be a year ago. Demand growth has been very good globally. There have been these unplanned outages recently that we discussed. Natural gas price has drifted down. So if you look at the graph that we had in our earnings report here. While crude oil price dropped and butane and propane dropped as well, ethane dropped. So we\u2019ve seen our cost come off a bit.","Our share repurchase program has also helped in terms of EPS, which is the intended purpose of the share repurchase program. And we continued to push reliability and push our units hard. So, I would say if there's one thing that I could point too to that\u2019s perhaps a bit different is that supply-demand is just much stronger. And so price declines on products have not been at the same pace as the oil price might indicate.","Duffy Fischer","Okay. Thank you. And then your catalyst business gives you a pretty good insight into what people are thinking about building on the olefins, polyolefins chain. When you look into that business, how do you see the next three to five years as far as your Olefins, polyolefins business grows global build out?","Bob Patel","Yeah. So in the case of polyethylene, if you just look at IHS data, it\u2019s even beyond our catalyst business. And supply growth is going to be somewhere in the 3% to 4% range annually. Demand grows at above that same pace. So our sense is based on what's been announced and the likelihood of some of the projects being pushed a year or two based on recent announcements. Our sense is that new supply will meet incremental new demand and that we could have a period of relatively high operating rates. And we\u2019ll show that next week when we have our Investor Day, our own view and IHS\u2019 view on operating rates.","Duffy Fischer","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Bob Koort","Thank you very much. Bob, you mentioned the volumes of your plastics in Europe were really quite exceptional. I think there maybe five or six force majeures during the first quarter or so. Where did all that product go? Were you displacing your competitors that couldn't run their plants at rates, or was there some restock inventories build and I'm speaking to Europe specifically and then how do you see that normalizing through the rest of the year? ","Bob Patel","Yeah. So in Europe, I think there were three factors. One was restocking. The other was just higher demand from our customers because of their export competitiveness, especially in film. Out of this film is where we see that the most.","And then, yes, we did displace some of our customer sales when they had issues. And we also had a little bit of an issue at M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster, which we resolved. So it\u2019s a combination of factors. My sense is that the European market is going to be pretty strong here in the foreseeable quarter or two. And then we'll have the typical seasonality in Q4, barring any sort of economic issue.","Bob Koort","And if I may follow up in the Americas looks like Total and Shintech have put their name to the list that\u2019s growing for U.S. new plant builds. I\u2019m just curious do you think Lyondell will ever build a brand new plant or will continue to be the incremental adds?","And then secondly, you mentioned ethane at fuel value, but the need maybe to start sucking in some barrels from North and Northwest or Northeast, would you expect that at least you see the ethane price have to accommodate that transportation tariff down to the Gulf Coast or do you think you can still sell below fuel value plus traditional spreads out into the future?","Bob Patel","In the case of our expansion, Bob, we still have quite a bit in front of us in terms of the debottlenecks. We really evaluate as we do many other alternatives, green field type project, that completes with share repurchase program and other projects. So we\u2019ll evaluate that. I know I wouldn\u2019t say that we would never do it. It is one of the options, and so we will just continue to think through that.","In terms of ethane and maybe incremental increase because of ethane coming north to south, it\u2019s possible. But even if that increase were do occur, when you think about it on a global basis, ethane will still be advantaged compared to polyethane production in China based on naphtha.","So my sense is that the ethane advantage and the U.S position on the global cost curve will largely be what we think it is today. There will be plenty of ethane and supply of this new expansion that are planned. And in the case of Shintech and Total, the timing of those were already essentially in the middle of the 2015. So I expect there are going to be towards the end of this wave of capacity that\u2019s been announced.","Bob Koort","Okay. Thanks very much.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","Laurence Alexander","Good morning. Can you aggregate your cost advantage feedstock tailwind that you had in the quarter, in Europe and the U.S. and how you think about it for the balance of the year?","And given the strength in the supply-demand balances that you're seeing, do you expect sort of bump in the number of brown field announcements before the wave of green field announcements gets done? Or do you think that that sort of capacity is tied off at this point?","Doug Pike","Laurence, this is Doug. Let me try to take that first and then maybe Bob will add some. I think when you think of the advantage feeds, let\u2019s go to Europe and look there. As we said about half of our ethylene was produced from advantage feeds. As percentage wise that where we\u2019ve been running. What perhaps is different about that is this year because of the pricing of NGLs, we\u2019ve been able to do it throughout the winter quarters.","Now, the advantage we said it was down about $15 million from quarter-to-quarter, so it\u2019s a little bit of that trending there. And of course, like we told you last year in our facilities, the benefit from advantage features a little lower $200 million across the year. So I\u2019m going to give you kind of the picture of it, but I think key was the dynamic of the NGL markets even in the lower crude price allowed us to continue process enough at those rates.","In the U.S, we are pretty much -- I think the graphs that we showed you pretty well showed you how you follow through. Our mix moved a little bit as it always does. Our guys optimize almost daily and weekly. So you move your mix a little bit around. Propane was attractive for a while, but that\u2019s a penny or two versus ethane. So we\u2019ve been able to hold those types of opportunities and advantages as we move forward.","Bob Patel","And Laurence to answer to your question about brown field, potential brown field expansions, I think a lot of the debottlenecks sort of opportunities have been harvested because of the advantage that existed over the last two, three years. So, well, we might find some more, other companies might find some more. I would imagine that most of what was possible has already been harvested.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, I\u2019m showing no further question.","Bob Patel","Okay. Well, then I\u2019ll offer just a couple of comments as we close out the call. Look we had a terrific quarter with strong performance across the entire company. Our focus on safety, operational reliability, commercial agility, and cost discipline, they continued to prove resilient in a volatile crude oil environment.","I'm extremely proud of what our team across the world has accomplished and their continued focus on everyday excellence. I think that's really what defines us. We look forward to seeing all of you next week at Investor Day and thanks for your continued interest in our company.","Operator","Thanks. And this does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines."],"13960":["LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

The pass code for both numbers is 3108.","During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives.","That being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Patel","Thanks Dave. Good day to all of you participating around the world, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call.","Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. During the first quarter, our Company demonstrated strong operational performance and moved forward on our value-driven growth strategy by advancing our business portfolio and delivering on synergies.","Sales volumes for our Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International business increased to levels seen during the first and second quarters of 2018, while profitability improved to regain some of last year's margin compression, more than doubling our fourth quarter EBITDA for that segment.","Across the Company, five of our six business segments improved upon fourth quarter profitability. First quarter earnings were $2.19 per share, which represents a 22% improvement over the previous quarter. We continue to actively manage our business portfolio by acquiring a synthesis gas plant in La Porte, Texas. This acquisition included a minority interest in our former methanol joint venture at the site.","The same gas plant converts natural gas into raw materials that we use in the production of methanol and acetic acid. We expect the transaction will provide synergies and operational efficiencies to generate accretive returns and materially exceed LyondellBasell's high standards for investment.","In the seven months since we closed on our acquisition of A. Schulman in 2018, our synergy capture increased to an $85 million annual run rate by the end of the first quarter. This represents more than half of the annual synergies we initially expected to realize within two years. These synergies are becoming apparent in our advanced Polymer Solution's profitability and we anticipate exceeding our initial $150 million annual synergy target.","Our organic growth program is in full swing with our new hyper-zone polyethylene technology approaching a third quarter start up in La Porte and considerable progress underway on construction of the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant at our sites in Channelview and Bayport in Texas.","This new capacity from these investments will serve global market's growing demand for polyethylene, polyurethanes and transportation fuels. As we continue our evaluation of the potential transaction with Braskem, the Company remains committed to a strong and progressive dividend while pursuing opportunistic share repurchases.","LyondellBasell returned an additional $884 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter. All of our capital allocation decisions are guided by our commitment to be a solid investment grade Company.","Two years ago, at our Investor Day in New York, we described how LyondellBasell's resilient business portfolio and a more balanced approach to capital deployment would provide strong shareholder returns while also supporting long-term value driven growth.","I'm pleased to report that during the first quarter, employees of our Company continued to deliver on these promises and advance the strategy. Each year marks a fresh start for tracking safety performance and 2018 will be the first full year where our metrics include the 20-plus percent of our workforce who joined LyondellBasell with the Schulman acquisition.","Prior to the acquisition in 2018, Schulman's injury rate was 1.54, seven to eight times higher than typical LyondellBasell performance. On Slide 4, you can see that our first quarter combined safety performance is quite similar to the record setting levels we achieved for the full year 2018.","As you know, we strongly believe that safety performance is a leading indicator of strong operational results. The rapid improvement in these safety metrics provides further evidence of the deep and robust integration management process underway within LyondellBasell.","All employees want to go home to their families safely and we're grateful for the sense of ownership displayed by our employees and their frontline supervisors. We look forward to driving further improvements towards our goal of injury free operations.","And now, Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the first quarter.","Thomas Aebischer","Thank you, Bob and good day to all of you.","Please turn to Slide 5, which illustrates developments within our Company over the trailing 12 months. Our portfolio of diverse petrochemical businesses continues to be a source of resilience during times of challenging market conditions with improvements in two segments partially offsetting declines in other segments over the past year.","As Bob mentioned, during the first quarter, five of our six business segments posted higher profitability relative to the previous quarter. Total EBITDA for the trailing 12 months declined in comparison to a relatively strong prior-year period.","During the first quarter, we incurred service disruptions related to the March fire at a third-party terminal in the Houston Ship Channel.","The impact was primarily felt within our Intermediates and Derivatives segment and was not material to the Company's first quarter result. We are still assessing ongoing disruptions and we expect second quarter impact will be similar to slightly higher than the first quarter.","In North America, falling ethylene prices had declined faster than feedstock costs and the steep drop in propylene prices drove first quarter margin compressions for olefins. In the rest of the world, olefins and polyethylene margins improved on the back of strong volume recoveries, relative to the fourth quarter.","Our Intermediates and Derivatives businesses exhibited stability with relatively balanced markets, persisting through a - the typical slow fourth and first quarters. We continue to run the Houston refinery well with our ninth consecutive quarter of strong operations. Unfortunately, high gasoline inventories and low discounts for heavy sour crude oil, resulted in historically low refining crack spreads during most of the first quarter.","Our technology business delivered another quarter of outstanding results with continued improvements in licensing revenue that increased over both the prior quarter and the last 12 months.","On Slide 6, you can see that LyondellBasell's businesses generated nearly $660 million of cash from operating activities during the first quarter. During the first quarter, we managed our debt portfolio by entering into a $2 billion term loan at favorable rates that was used to early refinance $1 billion of bonds that were due in April, 2019, which the balance used for general corporate purposes.","Beyond our quarterly dividend, our strong cash flows provided ample capability to continue our investments in organic growth projects, while returning $512 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. The quarter closed with over $1.3 billion of cash and liquid investments on the balance sheet.","Please turn to Slide 7. The chart on the left illustrates our cash flow performance over the previous four years and the trailing 12 months. During the last 12 months LyondellBasell generated more than $5.1 billion of cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures during the first quarter were nearly $600 million, with roughly 40% allocated to sustaining CapEx and the balance invested in profit generating projects.","We expect that investment will slightly increase over the remainder of the year, as we complete the construction of our Hyperzone PE facility and accelerate the activity for building our PO\/TBA plant in Houston.","We believe that operating cash flow after accounting for sustaining capital expenditures provides visibility in our cash flow that is available for purposes such as dividends or accretive re-investments such as share repurchases, organic growth, or M&A. The chart on the right side of the slide illustrates our total liquidity for the same period, the decline in 2018 reflects the acquisition of A. Schulman. Liquidity improved during the first quarter of 2019, primarily due to the new drawn and undrawn term loan facilities. We closed the quarter with total liquidity in excess of $8 billion.","With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you very much.","Bob Patel","Thank you, Thomas.","Let's turn to Slide 8 and review our business results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $516 million, $115 million lower than the fourth quarter. Results were driven by lower margins due to well-supplied markets for most products.","Olefins results declined by $130 million compared to the fourth quarter 2018, driven by a decrease in ethylene price, but more than $40 per metric ton. Propylene prices also fell with the decline of more than $300 per metric ton. These price declines largely offset reductions in feedstock costs.","Ethylene operating rates remained strong during the first quarter, averaging 93%, exceeding industry rates by 5%. We continue to optimize our cracker feature to benefit from lower NGL prices and found opportunities to capture discounts for un-purified [indiscernible] grade NGL feedstocks in our US Gulf Coast system. 83% of our ethylene production was from ethane and 93% came from NGLs.","Polyolefins results decreased by $30 million during the first quarter. Margins declined in both polyethylene and polypropylene, partially offset by an increase in polypropylene sales volume. Polyethylene chain margins are showing signs of improvement in April, as feedstock price trends - prices trend lower and we enter the higher seasonal demand period.","Now please turn to Slide 9 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins-Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $296 million, a $169 million increase over the fourth quarter, representing 133% improvement. Results were driven by increased volumes in all products and margin improvements for both ethylene and polyethylene. Market conditions improved with the strong recovery of polymer volumes following an unusually slow fourth quarter.","Olefins results improved more than $95 million. Volume and margin increased, driven by the completion of planned maintenance in our cracker investment in Germany, partially offset by some unplanned maintenance across our system in the first quarter. Combined polyolefins results increased more than $55 million.","Polyolefin sales have rebounded in the first quarter, with the volume improvement of 18% for polyethylene and 16% for polypropylene. Our polyethylene chain margins improved in the first quarter, as fixed and variable costs declined, due to the completion of maintenance. Joint venture equity income increased by $25 million.","Industry polyethylene chain margins in Europe have remained stable in the first quarter at $560 per metric ton. A similar level to the average seen in the region for the full year 2018. We see potential for improved margins in the second quarter with early indications of ethylene and propylene prices outpacing feedstock price increases.","Slide 10 reflects the recently updated views of industry consultants on global supply and demand balances for both ethylene and polyethylene. Recent ethylene demand growth has outpaced new capacity, resulting in very high effective operating rates, exceeding 95% over the past three years.","We continue to believe that any reduction from these high operating rates during 2020 and 2021 will be relatively modest. The industry's recent experience with delayed in the new capacity should not be forgotten. And any future delays will only serve to further improve upon this forecast.","Polyethylene supply and demand balance is shown in the chart on the right, illustrates similar constructive trends. The upturn in the global operating rates for 2019 provides optimism for a good market to start our new Hyperzone capacity, while typical delays in forecasted capacity, could reduce the impact of the most - of the modest downturn projected for 2020 to 2022.","New industry capacity for both ethylene and polyethylene will create short-term fluctuations, particularly in local markets. However, global operating rates are forecasted to remain in the mid-to-low '90s, as illustrated by the shaded horizontal bands on the charts, where we believe markets are balanced to tight, providing good profitability for our advantage producers.","Please turn to Slide 11. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $390 million, and a $11 million increase over the prior quarter. Results were driven by the balance in this business, as margins and volumes improved modestly. PO and derivatives results improved by nearly $30 million, volumes increased with completion of planned maintenance at our Bayport Texas facility in the fourth quarter.","Intermediate chemicals results decreased close to $50 million, compared to the fourth quarter. Volumes declined for most products, margins decreased primarily for methanol and ethylene glycol, which was partially offset by margin improvements for styrene. Oxyfuels and related products results improved more than $15 million, as margins increased slightly due to lower butane feedstock prices.","During April, European industry MTBE raw material margins have nearly doubled over level seen in the first quarter, and are exceeding the $225 per ton margins seen for the second quarter of 2018. This indication of constructive fuel markets coupled with low butane pricing provide support for earnings improvement moving into the second quarter.","On Slide 12 I would like to highlight our Circular Steam Project, which is under construction at our Maasvlakte site in Rotterdam. In coordination with the Dutch government we are advancing on a sustainable project that contributes to the Dutch ambition of a 49% reduction in CO2 by 2030 through conserving energy and reducing costs. This project includes the construction of a new bio-based waste treatment plant an incinerator that deploys innovative technology to convert our water-based waste into energy.","In short, the wastewater from our production unit will be separated into two streams. One stream will be sent to the bio plant for treatment to remove hydrocarbons, the recovered hydrocarbons then will be used as fuel for the incinerator.","The second stream containing mostly caustic water will be sent to the incinerator where steam is produced and recycled back to our production units. The circular steam project will allow us to realize an annual reduction of 140,000 tons of CO2, which is equivalent to taking 31,000 cars off the road.","Additionally, the project contributes annual energy savings of 0.9 peta joule which is equivalent to the annual electricity usage for 90,000 households. This project is not only a great step towards a more sustainable production process but also results in lower operating costs for our site. I look forward to providing you with updates as we make further progress on other sustainability programs.","Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the results of our advanced Polymer Solutions segment. First quarter EBITDA was $148 million, a $62 million increase over the prior quarter. Results were driven by seasonal margins and volume improvements as the market showed modest recovery from an unusually weak fourth quarter. Results also benefited from our increasing capture of A. Schulman synergies.","As we discussed in the two prior earnings call, transaction and integration-related costs to the A. Schulman acquisition were $49 million during the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, integration costs were $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $16 million in the first quarter of 2019. All results depicted here include these transaction and integration costs.","Compounding and Solutions results for the first quarter were more than $40 million higher than the prior period, driven by seasonal volume improvements and higher margins following a modest recovery for the week automotive market seen in the fourth quarter. Advanced polymers results improved by more than $5 million when compared with the prior periods. Our plans for the integration of A. Schulman are progressing very well and delivering results. As I mentioned earlier, at the end of the first quarter, we have already captured cost synergies at an annual rate of $85 million.","When you consider our first quarter EBITDA and add back the integration costs. We are nearing our expected quarterly run rate for this segment plus synergies. We anticipate continued strength in the business as we enter the second quarter, which is a period of seasonally higher demand for most APS products. I'm very proud of our APS team and their hard work and continued focus on integration and synergy capture.","On slide 14. I would like to highlight the Engineered Plastics business, that we acquired from A. Schulman is now part of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Engineered Plastics are similar to LyondellBasell polypropylene compounding products. But the compounds are made with different base resins such as nylon, styrenics, polybutylene or polyethylene terephthalate.","The resulting polymer compound is developed mostly to replace metal and has high structural integrity and strength. It has low distortion and high heat resistance. There are multiple end markets for these plastics, including building and construction, automotive and recreational products.","This slide shows two-end users for Engineered Plastics with which you may be familiar. [indiscernible] which is manufactured using our proprietary technology is a nylon compound used in the Duracell battery end cap assembly. This product helps to extend battery life and prevents battery fluid leakage. On the right you can see one of our styrenics alloy products that is used in manufacturing GPS domes used in John Deere farm equipment. The alloy provides improvements in UV stability and radio frequency transmission while reducing costs for our customers. Both of these products are sold to our customers in an easy to handle pellet form to facilitate manufacturing efficiency.","Turning to slide 15. Let's discuss the results of our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was a negative $15 million, a $69 million improvement over the fourth quarter. Crude throughput at the refinery increased to 259,000 barrels per day following the completion of planned maintenance during the fourth quarter. Maya 2-1-1 crack spread reached historically low levels in January, but gradually improved and average more than $13 per barrel for the quarter. Unusually low discounts for heavy sour crude oil combined with high gasoline inventories created a challenging environment for our refining business during the first quarter. Fortunately refining markets corrected over the month of March and during April we continue to see substantial improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread.","Slide 16, provides further detail of the refining spreads and shows the recovery in March and April. The price spread between Maya and Light Louisiana Sweet Crude has improved during the first quarter as shown by the dark blue portion of the bar chart. However, Maya pricing is still strong relative to other crudes due to the Maya pricing formula. Weak gasoline crack spreads in the fourth quarter persisted through February.","The turquoise portion of the bar chart shows a significant improvement in gasoline crack spreads in March and April. As we enter the summer driving season we anticipate an improvement in the refining business through continued reliable operations and improved Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads.","On slide 17, let me summarize this quarter's highlights. During the first quarter, we achieved earnings of $2.19 per share. Our O&P-EAI segment strongly rebounded from an unusually slow fourth quarter. Over the past 12 months our company generated more than $5.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed to funding for increased capital investment paying a top quartile dividend, completing over $2.2 billion in share repurchases and acquiring A. Schulman. Within two and 1.5 quarters of acquiring A. Schulman we've achieved more than half of our annualized synergy run rate target of $150 million for our APS segments.","We're advancing construction of our PO\/TBA facility and approaching the startup of our new Hyperzone polyethylene plant. We've continued to manage our portfolio through the acquisition of the same gas plant in La Porte, Texas and we're continuing to evaluate the Braskem opportunities. Going forward we see improvement in market sentiment with continued strong global demand. We expect most of our businesses to benefit from seasonal margin and volume improvements.","Additionally as refining markets adapt to new marine fuel regulations will be ready to capture improved margins with our continued stable operations. Our global portfolio of businesses provides confidence in our capability to remain at advantage, resilient and poised to capture opportunities across a range of market environments.","With all that said, we're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Don Campbell on for Bob. There kind of the 4Q earnings call you noted some improvement in the first few weeks in January. It sounds like you're seeing something similar with the first few weeks of April. Can you talk a little bit about what you've seen in terms of demand sequentially across the four months this year across January, February, March and April and how that sequential movement and demand has trended this year versus maybe last year or years before?","Bob Patel","So we've continued to see demand grow sequentially in all of our products. I think what's been more noticeable is that because Q4 was so weak. We're seeing now the seasonal uptick in for example polyethylene and polypropylene globally. And that is more typical of the kind of demand we would expect at this time of year. And as I mentioned, in EAI the volumes are already back to levels that we saw in Q1 and Q2. So we're seeing very typical volumes, now that we're into the spring months.","Unidentified Analyst","And then for polyethylene prices, I heard that April negotiations and then the May negotiations as well. It seems to be a little bit of a mix bag. Brent crude is up close to 40% year to date, but there is new supplier continuing to come online in the market. So I guess, what are your expectations for April and May negotiations?","Bob Patel","Well, on the back of my earlier comment about volume improving, it would seem to me that, seasonally stronger period markets are to be much former. I think some industry consultants have pointed towards potential increases in Q2. And if you think about it, we're talking about flat to higher prices during a period when a historic build-out of new capacity is coming. And is already in the market, two thirds of it is really in the market already. And in my view, I think this is really the ultimate evidence that operating rates are quite high. And the new capacity is frankly coming online at a time when it\u2019s needed.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar","As oil prices rallied this year, NGL prices have declined, and the delta is good for you. But on the flip side, polyethylene prices are also kind of they are stalled, despite the oil rally. So can you give us your view on how do you see the margin progression happens where oil is, and your view on Slide 10 with supply demand?","Bob Patel","Well, I think, first of all on the NGL side, you've seen NGL prices come off some, because the supplier has increased. And we've seen new pipelines come online from the Permian to Mont Belvieu for wide grade more fractionation capacity has come online. What's also really important PJ is that, the NGLs that are coming from the Permian now have more ethane, so there's less rejection. I think that all is a good setup for ethane.","And with potentially modestly higher polyethylene prices through the Q2 and into Q3, we could see some margin expansion. I think pricing and margins have been stable, because there is new capacity coming, but it's coming at a time when it\u2019s needed. So it seems to me that we have a very well balanced market with some tightness in seasonally strong periods.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Steve Byrne","Like to hear your views on whether you'd wait for a 20-F filing by Braskem, before you move any further than that, but really more importantly, this compounding business that you've expanded. The EBITDA in that business was essentially half of the EBITDA in your Olefins and Polyolefins outside of the Americas. I would assume, just a fraction of the installed assets. Can you talk about what it will take to grow that business from here. Do you need to acquire more or can you organically grow into new products in new geographies?","Bob Patel","So our first priority is to continue and complete our integration efforts with the A. Schulman acquisition. And as I highlighted in my prepared comments, we're making excellent progress and well ahead of schedule in terms of our integration effort. Once we have that platform established through the completion of the integration. I fully expect that we'll continue to evaluate other smaller inorganic opportunities. And along the way, especially in Asia, we'll likely have opportunities to build new plants as well. So I think we'll be able to do both, Steve, with respect to our APS segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bhavesh Lodaya","This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Good morning. I would like to ask the demand question in a bit differently. After the de-stocking phase you saw in late 4Q and early 1Q, are we seeing the decent re-stock phase or our customers just running low inventories now. And also the volume growth we saw in the quarter, is there a way to separate both and I think the restock demand versus what you are seeing is core end market demand?","Bob Patel","Yes, good question. I mean, I think this is always a bit elusive in terms of being definitive. But I can tell you directionally, my impression is that, given the macro backdrop of trade and Brexit and all these other things that create uncertainty. I continue to believe that buyers are really kind of buying what they need. I don't think we've seen a significant restocking that occurred year-to-date. The increase in volume, I interpret that as an increase in the underlying market and how the market is developing.","Also as is well known, buyers are expecting more capacity to come online. So in a backdrop like that, unlikely they would aggressively restock. So I think these are very healthy signs of underlying demand being very good and growing year-over-year, as we come into the spring season and into the summer season. Restocking, let me just add one other thing. Restocking, I think we just add another layer of growth, if and when it occurs.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Begleiter","Bob, just on Braskem are we gaining some point we need to make decision in the next few months. And if the decision is no, is there a Plan B for M&A or capital allocation?","Bob Patel","Well, first of all, I mean yes, it has been a rather lengthy period that we've been discussing with our counterparts. But David, on the other hand, it is a very complex transaction that has \u2013 it's multifaceted one of the facets was raised in a prior question. So we're working through it very methodically and thinking through value creation and weighing sort of the risk reward very carefully. And if we don't do it, we do evaluate, have a very robust pipeline of ideas that we can develop.","But just to go back to what we said at Investor Day, two years ago, which was that, our priorities are to continue to pay a strong dividend that's progresses, buybacks will be in the mix and funded by operating cash flow. And when it comes to inorganic, we have return hurdles we want to meet and will \u2013 our return aspirations will be adjusted based on the risk that we see in the transaction. So I think, all things are open and we continue to think about how we can build a great company over the long-term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer","Two questions around your Slide 10, which is the ethylene polyethylene supply demand. One, can you square Bob with your comment that two-thirds of the new capacity wave is already in the market. But yet on those charts, it looks like we peak in operating rates in 2019, and then move down each of the next three years? And then the second question would be, if we do move down in similar fashion to the way those charts are. What would your history and your gut tell you would happen to margins, if we left everything else equal, you know in natural gas, oil, all that stuff?","Bob Patel","There is a lot there in that question, so let me unpack it a little bit at a time. First of all, on the two thirds my comment really related to the U.S. capacity that's coming online. And I think we would have \u2013 but the numbers suggest that we're kind of in the latter innings of this round of capacity additions. And in fact in some cases the derivatives are already online before the crackers are online. And so from a polyethylene impact standpoint, I think we've largely seen the impact of the new capacity.","Referring to the charts, this is the latest IHS data. So we decided not to provide our interpretation through the graphs, but perhaps through the voice over here. So if you look at IHS they've added quite a bit of new Chinese capacity, Wood McKenzie have not. So had we included the Wood McKenzie forecasts it's actually quite different. No history would suggest that likely we are going to come out somewhere in between. As you know and as all the industry watchers know that typically new capacity if anything is delayed some of this is still haven\u2019t gone into FID yet especially in polyethylene.","So I think we'll have to see, but what my takeaways are from these graphs is that even with a more robust a list of projects in Asia, you still see operating rates in the balance to zones still in the low to mid '90s. Any delays of a few units could flatten out the line more material delays could actually create an upward slope in the operating rate. So we're kind of right on the margin. And lastly, I would say if you think about the new capacity that's included now in the balances really most of the new additions are in the third and fourth quartile of the global cost curve.","So they're not coming in advantage regions so I think to me all of that is a setup to say that we could have really very stable markets for a longer period of time. And if there are few delays or cancellations, you could actually see this operating rate graph turn up again. So I think we'll have to see, but our history globally in the industry has been that projects tend to get delayed and some still haven't reached FID yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Arun Viswanathan","I guess just a quick two part question. So first off stuff during the last quarter. And if you carry your statements out and just looking where we are on see margins you've seen a little bit of improvement in Europe, looks like the polymer side has increases recently. I know that North America folks have been trying to get a price increase in polyethylene for a little while.","Your commentary sounds like it's potentially improving in terms of as we go restocking in Q2. My question is, I guess have you, do you feel that we've hit a bottom and polyethylene margins and you think we couldn't solely climb out of that and if so, how long would it take and maybe you can just include your thoughts again on the global capacity build out and I know it's obviously the upper end of the cost curve, but it seems like there's been recent additions of even more capacity in China. So maybe if you can just include that in your analysis that would be great?","Bob Patel","Sure. Well, again, I mean I think as you look at the new capacity coming online this year, not only in the U.S. but globally. It's really meeting the new demand growth that we see year-over-year and I think the demand growth projections are still similar to what we've seen before. Q4 was just extremely weak as we, as we look back on and because of the de-stocking and some of the macro concerns. I think buyers really, really pulled back and, but we don't believe that the demand growth trends have changed materially.","So my view is that I think two thirds or more of the new capacity is in the market as we go through the rest of the year, demand will grow to absorb the remaining capacity that's coming online. And yes, somewhere in here in the mid of this year, we should make a turn as there is less capacity coming in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is open.","Hassan Ahmed","Not to bore you with sort of yet another question on Braskem but obviously, it's an important one. Look, obviously we saw business conditions turn very sour very quickly in Q4. Right? And you guys always talk about being sort of very prudent in thinking about M&A and the like. So my question is that, let's assume this draconian scenario that over the next couple of quarters maybe the business environment becomes like the Q4 '18 again. I mean in that scenario, we saw sequentially Braskem's EBITDA go down by as much as 50%. Now, if that was the base case would you guys still consider that acquisition as accretive and would the synergy is still sort of justify that acquisition at that run rate of EBITDA?","Bob Patel","So I mean, first of all Hassan, it's a very good question.","Hassan Ahmed","And I know I'm being draconian.","Bob Patel","Yeah. I understand, but I think for us when we think about acquisitions of the size and magnitude of a Braskem. We've got to really take a longer-term view rather than one or two quarters. So, frankly speaking me what I would do is sit with my team and go through whether we think the business model has been altered or if there is some structural change in our view of the value creation from those assets. If there is, then we rethink it. But we don't, believe that to be the case. And so, I mean I think we just have to think through the reasons for this scenario that you described. And if its short-term versus long term. So that's kind of the deliberation we would go through.","Hassan Ahmed","And I would also imagine the asset quality is very high right thinking about replacement value and the like?","Bob Patel","Absolutely, and I\u2019ve mentioned this on previous calls that we've been through diligence and one outcome from the diligence was that we've confirmed that indeed the assets are of very good quality. So again, it's about thinking long term rather than medium to longer term as opposed to the next quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","You did a nice job of laying out what's happened in the NGL markets and think in particular, but as we look into the back half of the year as the new ethylene capacity starts up in the U.S,. Now where do you think price gets back, do you to think we're talking high '20s, low '30s, where do you see the price in the medium term?","Bob Patel","Vincent, it's hard to, sort of forecast a short-term run up in the price like we saw last year. But my sense is that as more of this ethane. So if you go back and dissect last year's spike, we'll call it that, there was actually less ethane coming down the Y-grade line from the Permian and other parts of West Texas down into Bellevue, that has now correct itself and there's a lot more ethane because there's new pipeline capacity, there are more fractionation capacity now, there is another one that's supposed to start up in the second quarter, incremental delays help propane and butane prices are very low right now and company like ours have also now validated our ability to crack Y-grade.","So to summarize, first of all, I think there's plenty of ethane but if ethane prices were to rise because propane and butane are so abundant, I think they will quickly compete in terms of feedstock flexibility and now Y-grade will compete as well.","So all of that should really allow the feedstock price to be relatively stable through the rest of this year and then next year there are six to eight new fracs coming in most of them are in the first half of the year and by our math is like almost 0.5 million barrels a day of new ethane coming to market in 2020. So I think there is a good base case here that says, we don't see a spike or any material sort of rising ethane price unless gas price changes or something.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura. Your line is open.","Matt Skowronski ","This is Matt Skowronski on for Aleksey. PO and derivatives results were up quarter-over-quarter. Can you kind of talk about what you think about PO supply demand for the rest of the year and maybe 2020 as well?","Bob Patel","Yes so, PO demand is still pretty good. We went through it a little bit of a soft spot in Q4 and there is some tied to automotive. So, but all of that seems to be recovering very nicely and we see our PO business being as solid as we've seen in years past, with modest year-over-year growth.","I think given that you've asked this question, I think the more important driver in Q2 will be the TBA portion and the Oxyfuels. Because you know in Oxyfuels, we had - they did parallel to our refining business and that when gasoline values are low it impacts our Oxyfuels business as well. And so, gasoline recovering will help Oxyfuels values quite a lot. Blend premiums are up as well.","On the cost side, butane is extremely cheap. So, we're seeing pretty meaningful upticks in Oxyfuel margins. So when I think about PO and derivatives together, the derivatives, especially Oxyfuels could provide pretty meaningful earnings improvement in Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts","Bob, you've taken a leadership role in plastics recycling. At the IHS conference last night, it seems without them, was I just misperceiving how it went last month?","Bob Patel","Well, I - you are not misperceiving. I think they will join the broader movement. They already have initiatives in PET. And now it's just a matter of bringing it together under the umbrella of this alliance to end plastic waste.","John, I think the key is collection of waste. And we start with the presumption that plastic waste has value. Then the highest priority is to collect it closest to the source, where the waste is generated. So it doesn't leak into the environment and we can reuse, recycle, recover the value that's in that plastic waste.","And I think, those principles are universally applicable to all polymers. And we are really gaining momentum and on this alliance to end plastic waste. And you'll see more and more as the year progresses on tangible actions that the value chain are taking. Because ultimately, plastics are really a great sustainability story, the issue is dealing with the waste. And we're starting to see real solutions on how to deal with the waste. So I'm extremely encouraged and I think PET will join.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy","Bob, I was wondering if you could comment on the volatility we've seen in inventory levels of propylene monomer. Depending on when we start measuring, I guess have tripled from the bottom or doubled versus long term averages. And then we started to see some regression back down over the last six or seven weeks. So, could you comment on A, why they did they serge so high in late February or early March; and B, what is your outlook? Do you think that we've seen the peak and we come back down to more normal levels or has something changed there will be more durable or structural in nature?","Bob Patel","Yes, Kevin. You know our VC3 inventories of propylene inventories, they are really related to how well the PDH is drawing in. We've had the large new PDH as that have been built, and have been running better as my impression. And when you couple that with the slower demand growth that we saw, especially early in Q1, in January and February. I mean, both of those things sort of went in opposite directions. So demand was slow, the big PDH has ran very well.","I think ultimately also refining FCC units have some role to play in this. So FCC run well you get, more propylene as well. So propylene has been volatile for number of years now. And I think as these new PDHs run well and our part of the base load supply, we'll start to see these inventory swings moderate quite a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is the [indiscernible] William sitting in for Frank. Bob, I was wanted to follow up on the IND business. Obviously, you spoke very positively about MTBE into the second quarter. Last quarter you spoke about that business having a $1.7 billion EBITDA base case. Would you - would your comments be implying that, that we should start thinking about numbers north of that?","Thomas Aebischer","Well, Frank. Let's see how the year plays out. But we've said 1.7 to 1.8could be kind of the new normal in terms of the run rate for IND. And I think we're very much in that zone. And with cheap butane prices as they are today. Again, I think it points to the abundance of NGLs. And that business in particular really benefits when global butane prices are lower. And today you're seeing butane trading around 50% of crude oil value which is on the low end of recent ranges. So let's see how things play out, but we think certainly the 1.7 to 1.8 range, as the base case is still in a very good range to consider.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas","Since the beginning of the year oil prices have gone from $50 a barrel to $70 a barrel. And the price of polyethylene in Asia and the export price in the United States, who really hasn't moved. Are you surprised by that and how do you diagnose that there's really been no change. Because normally those numbers really move together?","Bob Patel","Right, Jeff. It's a very good question. And I think it's really a result of a couple of things. First of all, in Q1, we still had demand that was coming off of very low levels. And as I said earlier in one of the other questions, is that buyers still don't have conviction to build inventory, I think they're buying what they need. And so, so those two things probably led to this more sideways movement in polyethylene price.","But again it's during a period when we're seeing kind of the later innings of this new capacity build out. I think that set up is not so bad. Actually, because it indicates that markets are still pretty resilient. And there were still decent margins in Asia, even after some rise in the naphtha price. So think we'll have to see how this develops in - and as we come into the seasonally strong periods of April, May, June.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard at Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard","First of all I would like to thank you on behalf of humanity for first off going metric. And second for promoting waste incineration. Thank you.","Bob Patel","Well, Jonas we are an international company. So we decided we better just go to metric tons across the board and global company.","Jonas Oxgaard","You know, it could not have happened a decade early. The actual question though. Since the Asia polyethylene decided at the polypropylene floor now, which means polypropylene outlook becomes a lot more important. Do you have any views on where we can see Asia polypropylene going, both over the next year and if you think about the next five years or so?","Bob Patel","Well, we're still seeing very good demand growth year-over-year. I mentioned in my earlier comments that even in the U.S., we've seen volumes improve very well. There are some signs of stimulus being added in the economy in China. For example the VAT cut that was implemented recently.","Typically our impression is that these, these actions to provide stimulus in the economy. You see those maybe 90 to 120 days later. So we think those should bode well for polypropylene demand growth over the time - over the summer months and going into the full year.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay. And on the supply side?","Bob Patel","Supply side. I mean, I think it's well known. I think overall polypropylene operating rates are still very good. Globally, even with some new capacity coming in Asia and particularly China this year. So we continue to be very constructive about polypropylene going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.","Matthew Blair","Looks like your refinery ran about 8% Venezuelan barrels approximately, just curious how you've been replacing those barrels this year, have you found any alternatives in South America are you running more Canadian or have you had to move to a lighter slate and run more U.S. shale?","Bob Patel","No, I mean, we\u2019ve been able to buy some Colombian barrels and a little bit a few more barrels from other regions. And the challenge for us Matthew, in the refinery has been that the light-heavy differential is so leveraging to that refinery and we've had both sides of the equation go in the wrong direction frankly early on the sour side, we've seen reductions in supply from Venezuela, there is little bit less coming out of Mexico, OpEx cuts take out some of the sour crude and on the other side, the light crude LLS has come down, or has not gone up as much because there's a lot more supply coming out of the Permian, but I know you closely watch these things and you've seen that that differential is starting to open up again.","As various market factors kind of normalized, so we think this is going to be a very important driver of earnings, the light-heavy differential normalizing in Q2 and Q3 and then while I'm talking about the refinery. I think IMO still in front of us, as we look at Q3 and Q4 and the new marine fuel has to be deployed in the system globally, so that would, there's compliant starting January 1 of 2020. So I think lot of these sort of extraneous factors are already starting to normalize benefit our refinery.","Operator","Our last question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Nick Cecero","This is Nick Cecero on for Laurence. So within the IND business more specifically ethylene glycol, it seems as though inventory levels in China had been climbing pretty rapidly for some time. So just wondering how quickly inventory work-downs can happen from current levels and then maybe just your view on supply demand dynamics over the next few years?","Bob Patel","Well, I'm kind of ethylene glycol. There is also a seasonality to that business. Because some of that ends up in PDT and summer months more demand for more disposable goods a fewer products, if you will. So my sense is that the inventory will get worked off and the thing to really watch there is more about the pace of new supply compared to demand growth just like we look at fundamentals in the other businesses and we see reasonably good patterns ahead of us.","I think when you - Nick, when you think about our IND business. The biggest drivers are going to be PO, MTBE, methanol and styrene. And so we really kind of focus on those as the big drivers for earnings while BDO and glycols are important and sort of the bigger levers are the ones that I just described.","Thomas Aebischer","And with low cost ethylene in the United States. This is the best place to be producing ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol. So, that is helpful. But you're right, Nick prices have been very challenging this year.","Operator","And we have no further questions.","Bob Patel","All right, so let me close with a few closing thoughts. So you know as we look ahead to the balance of the year, as you've heard through my commentary and through our prepared remarks. We do see improvement in market sentiment continuing and supporting continued demand growth and more importantly tangible earnings growth.","We see opportunities to grow our earnings through A. Schulman acquisition, our new polyethylene capacity that will come online later this year. The IND business some more pricing improvements that will come through as well as the Oxyfuels improvement that I mentioned earlier, refining margins we think are normalizing and most importantly, we're seeing that the light-heavy differential is opening up.","So I mean I see in each segment of our business signs of sequential earnings growth as markets normalize and\/or we implement our growth strategy. So with all that said, I look forward to giving you all an update at the end of our second quarter and give you a progress report on our growth projects as well. So with that, we'll conclude our call. Thank you very much for your interest.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect at this time.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this teleconference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answering session.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Great. Thank you, Carla. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's second quarter 2017 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I would also like for you to note that statements made in this call related to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com\/investorrelations.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on August 28, by calling 800-294-5423 in the United States and 402-220-9786 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 2526.","During today's call, we will focus on the second quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments for LCM that we have discussed on past calls.","As previously explained, these are adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and declines in prices of raw materials and finished goods inventories in previous periods. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the prior LCM inventory changes.","With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thanks, Dave. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide four and review the highlights from the second quarter.","Our second quarter diluted earnings per share was a record at $2.82 per share. EBITDA was $2 billion. We delivered solid results with three of our five operating segments improving in profitability relative to the first quarter. Our Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment delivered record quarterly earnings in the second quarter with EBITDA improving by more than 30% relative to the first quarter.","Our operations ran very well during the second quarter, driving strong volume growth within our global Olefins & Polyolefins business and our refinery. We completed planned maintenance at our Botlek PO\/TBA site in the Netherlands and our Channelview methanol unit in Texas. Overall, planned maintenance impacted second quarter results by approximately $70 million. We continued to execute on our financial priorities during the second quarter and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments.","Slide five reflects the leading safety performance that our employees and contractors continue to achieve during the second quarter of this year. While our goal remains to prevent all injuries, I'm happy to report that LyondellBasell's safety performance continues to be among the best in our industry. As many of you know, we believe that our focus and discipline around the health, safety and environmental performance translates to strong operational reliability and ultimately, profitability. Slide 5\/6 illustrates our strong second quarter performance, with operating rates of 98% of nameplate capacity across our U.S. and European ethylene crackers.","Our polyethylene production operated at 95% of capacity. And I'm particularly pleased to report the rebound in performance at our Houston refinery, where crude throughput rates increased to an average of 99% of capacity during the second quarter. The combination of this strong operational performance and consistent cost management provide the foundation for our results.","Let's turn to slide seven and review how our U.S. ethylene expansions are allowing us to leverage these advantages across a larger asset base during 2017. Slide seven describes the progress of this growth program over the past four years. During 2013 and 2015, smaller projects in Clinton, Iowa and Channelview, Texas increased ethylene capacity with little disruption to existing production.","However, the 2014 expansion in La Porte and the 2016 Corpus Christi project both required significant maintenance outages of existing capacity. As a result, the full effect of our 2 billion-pound growth program has not been fully realized until 2017.","Let's turn to slide eight and review how our high-reliability, lighter maintenance schedule and increased capacity delivered increased production volumes during the first half of 2017. After completing four major ethylene cracker maintenance turnarounds during 2016, we have none scheduled for this year. This increased ethylene production enables us to run our downstream ethylene derivative units at higher rates.","And with planned maintenance at the refinery completed during the first quarter, we look for the strong second-quarter rates to continue. With all of this year's major planned maintenance complete, we are well-positioned to deliver strong volume growth during the second half of 2017.","And now, Thomas will discuss our financial highlights.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Bob, and good morning to all of you. On slide nine, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. As Bob mentioned, three of our five business segments improved relative to their first quarter 2017 performance. During the quarter, strong ethylene co-product pricing and reduced feedstock costs benefited our Olefins & Polyolefins segments. The refinery ran very well at nearly full capacity. However, unusually small discounts for heavy crude oil restrained margins and negatively impacted profitability.","Please turn to slide 10, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the second quarter, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of cash from operations, and about half of this amount was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Our investments in maintenance and growth capital expenses were $407 million during the second quarter, driven by maintenance turnarounds and the Hyperzone PE and PO\/TBA projects.","During the second quarter, our cash and liquid investments balance increased by approximately $400 million. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.3 billion of cash from operations and used approximately $3.2 billion for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program and other financial activities, the cash and liquid investment balance has remained relatively unchanged.","Slide 11 provides a longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. We finished the quarter with approximately $5.4 billion of liquidity and a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times. Our share repurchase program continues during the quarter with another 5.4 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have now repurchased approximately 186 million shares, or approximately 32% of the initial shares outstanding. Our second quarter activity shows that share repurchases continue to have a role in our capital deployment strategy.","Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that might help you modeling of our company. Excluding the first quarter bond redemption charges, we are maintaining our previous annual guidance provided in February for capital, interest, depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as our effective tax rate.","With that, I will now turn the call back to Bob. Thank you very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 12 and review our segment results.","As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory changes. In our Olefins & Polyolefin Americas segment, second quarter EBITDA was $859, a $136 million improvement over the first quarter.","The first quarter included a $31 million gain from the sale of property in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Relative to the previous quarter, Olefins results improved by approximately $100 million, primarily due to a $0.03 per pound improvement in ethylene margins.","Ethylene operating rates remained strong across our system during the quarter, averaging 97%. Our Corpus Christi ethylene plant operated at 88% of the expanded capacity during the second quarter. 75% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 88% from NGLs.","In Polyolefins combined results improved by approximately $80 million. Polyethylene spreads improved approximately $0.04 per pound due to an ethylene monomer price decrease and higher polymer prices. Polypropylene spreads improved approximately $0.05 per pound, primarily due to decreased monomer pricing.","During July, spot ethylene prices have decreased due to strong industry supply and increased inventories. After relatively light spring maintenance season, consulting services are predicting a return to typical levels of per-planned maintenance for September and October.","Polyethylene markets are balanced, while polypropylene demand is relatively strong. No major maintenance is planned in our olefin system for the remainder of 2017.","Let's turn to slide 13 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment.","During the second quarter, EBITDA was a record $699 million, $179 million higher than the first quarter. Olefins results improved by approximately $135 million, primarily due to lower feedstock costs. Utilization of advantaged feedstocks increased by 5%.","Our crackers operated at 100% of their nameplate capacity during the second quarter, exceeding the industry average performance by 14 percentage points. Combined Polyolefin results improved by approximately $15 million, primarily due to improved polypropylene margins.","During July, global markets remained balanced, with good demand. As in the U.S., no major maintenance is planned in our European olefins system for the remainder of 2017.","Now please turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $339 million, unchanged from the first quarter. Excluding first quarter charges related to the recovery of precious metals, results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $5 million, primarily due to planned maintenance in our PO\/TBA plant in the Netherlands.","After excluding precious metal adjustments from the first quarter, intermediate chemicals results declined by approximately $30 million, as styrene margins declined and methanol volumes were reduced due to planned maintenance.","Oxyfuels and related products results were relatively unchanged with seasonal margin improvements offsetting volume declines due to planned maintenance at our Botlek, Netherlands facility. We successfully completed our planned maintenance on this PO\/TBA facility and the Channelview methanol plant, which impacted second quarter earnings by $50 million and $20 million respectively.","Now let's move to slide 15 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $25 million, a $55 million improvement over the prior quarter. Operationally, we had a great quarter, with crude operating rates at 99% of nameplate capacity. With higher volumes, the cost of RINs increased relative to the first quarter. As Thomas mentioned, weak heavy-to-light crude differentials limited profitability from our strong operations.","Our Technology segment continued to perform well, with $48 million of EBITDA, a $12 million decline versus the first quarter, due to the timing of catalyst shipments to customers.","Let's move to slide 16 and review some important milestones for our organic growth program. In May, we began construction on our 1.1 billion-pound Hyperzone high-density polyethylene plant in La Porte, Texas. The new plant will increase our ability to capture the full chain margin benefits of our expanded ethylene capacity. And our innovative Hyperzone polyethylene process technology will produce differentiated polyethylene products and provide a new platform for licensing through our technology segment. The plant is scheduled to start in 2019.","Last Friday, we announced the final investment decision to build the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant. This plant represents the single largest capital investment by our company to date. Our leading PO\/TBA technology and shale-based feedstocks provides us with a durable advantage to serve growing global markets for urethanes and oxyfuels. Construction will begin during 2018 and the plant will be completed in 2021. We look forward to talking with you over the coming quarters about additional developments in building a sustainable pipeline of value-added organic growth for the company.","Turning to slide 17; the second quarter developed largely as we anticipated. We had record earnings of $2.82 per share as well as record profitability in Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International. Our 2016 investments in maintenance and capacity expansions are delivering strong operating rates and ethylene production improvements of 17% in O&P Americas, 11% in O&P EAI during the first half of 2017. With the completion of planned maintenance in our Refining segment, we increased crude throughput by 24% relative to the first half of last year.","Looking forward, we continue to see good olefin and polyolefin market demand supporting strong global operating rates over the near term. While strong industry operations and delays in new derivatives capacity have recently pressured spot ethylene margins in the United States, global demand for polyolefins remains strong and supportive of chain margins for both our shale-based and naphtha-based production assets around the world. We continue to see U.S. supply and inventories of natural gas and NGL feedstocks remaining abundant, and we're encouraged by increased production, transportation, and fractionation investments near the U.S. Gulf Coast.","In fuel markets, we're encouraged by improving demand, but remain cautious on the impact of range-bound crude oil prices on our oxyfuels business and weak discounts for heavy crudes processed by our Refining segment. We have no major planned maintenance across our global system for the remainder of 2017.","With that, I'm pleased to now take your questions. Carla, we're ready to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question came from the line of Mr. Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...statement. So you're saying more than 25% of the first wave of new ethylene capacity is in the market. Assuming that includes your own brownfield additions, that would be my first question.","And then secondly, what's the cadence you see for the rest of the capacity coming on? And what do you think will happen with margins as that comes on in both North America as well as Europe? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Arun. I missed the very first few words of your question, but I think what you're asking was, the first 25%, does it include our brownfield? And the answer is yes, it does. The pace of the new capacity expansions over the next 12 to 18 months are well-documented in a lot of places and we still think that by one quarter or so, polyethylene capacity is phased earlier than crackers. So we still think that's still the case in the second half. And then the rest of the ethylene capacity will come online over the period of the next 12 to 18 months.","In terms of impact on margins, certainly that's the nature of our business and we've talked about a modest or a shallow cycle here. So we would expect some margin volatility going into these next 12 to 18 months as these new units come on because of their size and as we trend towards the new normal of higher exports out of the U.S. But as far as the cycle goes, Arun, we continue to believe that this looks to us to be a fairly shallow and narrow cycle in terms of its duration.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just as far as polyethylene goes, the industry announced an increase for July that some have pushed to August. What's your read on potential success for that increased initiative? And you'd made some comments on inventories. So maybe you can just relate the inventory and demand side to your comments on the potential success of that increase? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes, I think markets are still relatively balanced here in the U.S. and globally. And so, as evidenced by initial reports of the rollover on polyethylene price here in July, I won't hazard a forecast on the future. But I think we're going into the second half of the year with pretty balanced markets and demand growing at a good pace globally. So I think that whatever lies ahead we're going into it with very strong operating rates and very constructive markets.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Stephen Byrne of Bank of America. Sir, your line is now open.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Bob, you had just mentioned there about exports being the primary target for a lot of this new polyethylene capacity. I was wondering if you were seeing any of it targeting any of your legacy U.S. polyethylene customers, either from this new wave that's on now or any preselling from capacity not yet onstream.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. We have not seen any significant impact in terms of local market dynamics. But still, the capacity hasn't come online. So I think we'll have to see how all this plays out. But so far, we've had a cracker and derivatives come online in Mexico, and that's in the market today. And we haven't seen a lot of impact from that. So far, I think it's early. So I don't want to, again, predict too much here. But it seems to me that exports are the destination for a lot of this new output that will come out of these new plants.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And do you see opportunities for more consolidation in the olefin and polyolefin industry? What would be your interest level in participating in that, say, versus diversifying your platform into more downstream derivatives or into new base chemistries? What would be your preferences in that, in those buckets?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, when we think about inorganic growth, if you will. We first of all think about what creates the most value and how can we leverage our strengths. And so, our strengths, we continue to believe, are in the safe, reliable cost-efficient operations. And I think certainly, given our base in olefins and polyolefins, if there were value-creating opportunities that were compelling, they could be of interest. And for the rest, I think we've discussed in many different forms that unlikely that we would pursue real specialty businesses. We would want to stay close to our core and leverage these strengths that I've described.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very good. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Mr. Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Over the past month, natural gas has been flat-to-lower. Ethane is probably moved up from, I don't know, $0.23 a gallon to $0.26. Do you see anything in that? I realize that there can be a lot of volatility in these numbers, but it seems that the trend is, for ethane, moving up and natural gas moving down. What do you make of that?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I don't see anything specific that's driving that today. We step back and we look at the amount of ethane production; it continues to remain strong. Inventories are on the high end of the range. So you know, sometimes these price movements are just kind of what's happening at the moment in terms of logistics or local inventories near where crackers are. So far, we don't draw any conclusion from this recent diversion between ethane price and natural gas. Again, I come back to, I think there's still an abundance of ethane and plenty of it close to the Gulf Coast.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","For my follow-up, on slide 16, you have a potential EBITDA from your propylene oxide TBA new unit. And in the old days, I think you used to size the potential EBITDA as $300 million to $400 million, and now you've got $450 million to $550 million, though you footnote it and say it's a 2012, 2016 average margin. Has your view about the potential EBITDA of that unit changed? Or this is just a different guess?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","So Jeff, it hasn't changed. We just looked over a longer period of time, 4 years, which incorporates a variety of market conditions. So we've had 2015, which was one of the best years in that business and 2016 was on the low end. So you know, as we've sort of span the range of outcomes. And so no real change in our long-term outlook of the oxyfuels business.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","If the current environment was the environment that, that plant came on, would $300 million to $400 million be the right number?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No, we'd certainly be in the $400 million sort of range in the current market environment.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Sir, your line is now open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. Bob, a couple of months ago, the view was that ethylene would, supply would be tight as derivative units started ahead of the new crackers. Instead, I think you've notably seen spot prices decline quite significantly. Is this due to delays in the derivative capacity? Or is it more just better operations? And how would you see these ethylene prices unfolding as we move into Q3, the rest of Q3 and Q4.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Don, I think it's a combination of both. I think incrementally, this new polyethylene capacity has been delayed a month or two, that's our impression. And on the operating side, certainly, U.S. industry has run quite well through the summer. But now we are coming into September, October where there's relatively high planned maintenance schedule. I would anticipate that during that period, some of this new polyethylene capacity will come online.","So both of those trends will sort of reverse. And we continue to think that through 2017 as derivative units are phased ahead of crackers, we think ethylene should be constructive through year-end.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Then a follow-up on Europe. You had very strong, I think, record quarterly EBITDA in EAI. You often don't seem to get much credit for your European operations. What is the sustainability of this strength? Is this more just a function of relatively low oil to NGL prices? Or is it more sustainable than that?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. I appreciate you pointing out that we don't always get credit for that. As you know, I was over there during the more darker days in that business. And I think, first of all, I'm really proud of the results that our team over there is delivering. There's a few factors. Early in the decade we made a lot of change that I think structurally improved the earnings potential of that segment. We took out fixed costs. We improved the feed slate and we improved our market positioning. I think those things are structural that have improved the underlying performance of that segment which are internal improvements.","The market has also improved as operating rates have increased. There's not really been any new capacity that's been added in the past few years and none anticipated in the next, at least, couple of years. So demand has started to grow again. Weak Euro, lower oil price environment. I think all those things are constructive to the EAI segment. Now, as the new U.S. capacity comes online, we would expect that the EAI results would moderate some. But clearly, in my mind, there's a new level, given changes in oil to gas, Euro and then our own internal changes which we made.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Could you guys talk a little about what the volatility in RINs prices did either in the quarter, or what may do in the future, and how it affects your refinery profits? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","RINs prices, Bob, went up a little bit here in Q2. And I think we have to wait to see how the regulatory environment evolves. Dave, maybe if you want to add a little bit more into that.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes, Bob. There's been a lot of volatility in the RINs prices and I think we've seen higher RINs costs for the company during the second quarter as we had higher throughput through the refinery. But as you know, there's a lot of talk around the renewable fuel obligation and we're waiting to see what the administration has to say about that, so there's a lot of speculation in the market right now.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And if I might, Bob. Could you talk a little about, you mentioned trying to keep close to your core competencies here in terms of doing any acquisitions, or maybe going further downstream. How far downstream would you go? We heard a pretty impassioned discussion from Dow yesterday about how much value they get added by going cracker plus 9. We heard from Eastman this morning talking about vertical integration helping them in downstream. So how far would you be willing to go downstream? And then secondly, you guys aren't all that big in Asia. Is there any appetite for doing \u2013 and getting larger over in Asia? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","So Bob, first of all, downstream. The way I think about it is, when you get really far downstream you start to compete in various fragmented markets that have many competitors, and the scale becomes smaller. For us, I think it's sticking to large-scale assets, large markets, and where operational efficiency costs, competitiveness create value. And even within that, we do have differentiated products like our polypropylene compounding business, and Catalloy and so on.","So if you would consider that downstream, then I think we're certainly interested in that and we participate in that today. Unlikely we would get into the polyethylene conversion business. Now, that's a different kind of business and in prior lives, I've even seen the pipe business downstream and some mixed results. So I think it's really sticking to large-scale assets and not going so far downstream that we're competing in fragmented markets that have a very different competitive structure.","In terms of Asia, I step back and think about feedstock advantages being an important driver for our investment decisions. And clearly, in the ethylene chain, the U.S. is more favorable to us than Asia. As we move into C3-C4 chains, certainly Asia could be interesting. Today we participate through joint ventures. And it's possible that we could expand within those joint ventures which are very \u2013 we have great partners and strong positions that we could build upon to participate in the local markets in Asia in C3 and C4 chains.","And of course, we have a joint venture in propylene oxide in China, which we could build upon. So I think all those things are under consideration, and we just need to think through what drives value in terms of where we place our asset.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC",">: Got it, thanks very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Sir, your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","As oil prices ran up last year then dropped earlier this year, what is the mentality of converters in their purchasing patterns? Are they reluctant to build inventories because of this volatility or because of the new crackers starting up?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","P.J., I think converter inventories, their bias has been to keep lower inventories, especially after what happened in 2008. So I think that structurally changed how people think about inventory. I would say probably most importantly in the psyche of the customers, my sense is that the expected new capacity probably has them leaning towards the low side on inventories with what's expected in the second half. So I think we'll just have to see how these units start up and the timing of those units.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then with oil prices between $40 and $50, what changes are you making to Europe, feed slate in Europe in terms of LPGs versus condensates versus naphtha?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","In Europe, to the extent that we can purchase propane and condensates at a discount to naphtha, we continue to seek those opportunities and we're finding them. Especially in the summer months, we tend to find propane is more economical. So incrementally, we continue to push for ways to get non-naphtha feed into our crackers. And we're having some success, and we continue to push the envelope on that.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And one quick one on Hyperzone polyethylene plant. Is this technology tested, or what's the technology risk here? And in your EBITDA forecast, do you assume a price premium for Hyperzone PE versus regular PE? Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","So this technology, we actually practice an analogous technology in polypropylene today, so it is a proven technology in polyolefins. We've modified it to apply to polyethylene. It in fact does have the potential to produce differentiated products. Without getting overly technical, it's a multi-modal process, so we can make products that essentially allow our customers to reduce part weight, consume less polyethylene per part, and offer better strength in some cases. So we do expect some premiums, and that's what we've assumed in our modeling. But I would say we've done a lot of product development work and some test trials with some of our customers, and those have proven out the characteristics of the polyethylene that we expect to produce.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. China has reduced its importation of recycled polyethylene by about 50% since oil peaked in 2014. And the, earlier this week, or last week I guess, they filed with the WTO to ban importation of recycled polyethylene. So I just want to get your thoughts on what impact do you think that could have to the supply and demand balance of the overall market as we head into 2018.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Vincent, I think directionally that's a positive in terms of global operating rates. We'll just have to see if that recycled material ends up elsewhere. But to your point, at lower oil prices generally, recycled materials make less economic sense compared to what they did when oil price was $100. So I think directionally it's positive in terms of operating rates. We'll just have to see how it plays out.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up, as we think about 2018 and potential turnaround activity, should we be just assuming a normal year at this point or two years after 2016, will it be something more expansive?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No, 2016, we had a fairly significant amount of catch-up we needed to do. We had seven or so very large planned turnarounds. Our normal cadence is three to five, and you should expect three to five now for the coming years, and we'll phase it that way.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Vincent, I think we have two crackers on slate for next year, and one of the PO units and one of the trains at the refinery.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Could we please limit questions to just one question, so that we can get through everybody in the queue? Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Mr. Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Sir, your line is now open.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Good morning, guys.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Congratulations to finally getting that PO\/TBA off the drawing board. I'm very excited.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So I hope you don't mind, David. There's a couple of questions on this PO\/TBA. The first one is, I'm assuming it's intending all for exports, since you're already exporting today. And the question is really where will those cargos land? Is there a risk that we will have to accept a lower PO price, we have to go further away?","And then as a secondary question on this, chlorine prices have been up across the globe. How much benefit do you think there is to PO from chlorine, if chlorine keeps rising?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","So on PO exports, first of all, we do not plan to export much of this capacity at all. In fact, we've already entered into some long-term agreements to place a reasonable amount of that volume today. And we would expect that most of the propylene outside that will be produced from this plant in 2021 will be placed in the domestic market and into downstream urethane markets and so on. So I don't expect a lot of that.","In terms of exports, if it does go export, normally we export to Europe and Asia, and we have a system in Europe which we can plug into and supplement. So I don't expect that to be a drag on the project returns.","In terms of chlorine, as chlorine prices rise, and if you think about our technology, we have a co-product that benefits U.S. natural gas or NGL advantage, because we're upgrading U.S.-based butane, which is priced more off of gas rather than oil, up to MTBE. So I think that favors the economics of this PO\/TBA project, and given the scale we have, it should be very low cost, but I think it'd be very competitive globally.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That makes sense. Now the point on chlorine is that's the marginal production technology, so if chlorine keeps going up. That should be beneficial, but I don't know how much?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes, exactly. Directionally, you're right, and it's difficult to predict how much chlorine will rise. But, yes, we're well-positioned in terms of the cost curve with this technology.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

I ask my team that often. You know, I think, look we were working on ethylene debottlenecks. We were working on the Hyperzone polyethylene plant, PO\/TBA, and, frankly, you know, we're ramping up our resource and our capability to do several capital projects at one time. And so, I think it's a very logical sort of next step for us to consider polypropylene, and even perhaps propylene in the U.S., so stay tuned. Nothing today really to discuss, but it's certainly on our mind.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Instinet. Sir, your line is now open.","Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC","Good morning. Thank you. At your Investor Day, you talked about several projects to extend ethylene and polyethylene beyond the current La Porte HDPE project. Has your level of interest in those further expansions, especially downstream in polyethylene increased since then? Have those projects advanced?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. So, Aleksey, in terms of organic growth, beyond the PP and propylene-related investment that we might consider, we still have one more debottleneck we can do at our Channelview cracker. In fact, we delayed that in 2015 in preference for the Hyperzone polyethylene plant to make sure that our merchant position doesn't grow further.","So our plan is to execute that debottleneck, which will come in two phases, early in the next decade. And it would be very logical then to build polyethylene to consume that ethylene to maintain kind of a merchant ethylene position of something like 15%. So I suspect that as we work through the next decade, we'll do these two debottlenecks, which total about 550 million pounds at Channelview, both of them combined, and then another polyethylene unit behind that.","Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Sir, your line is now open.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, good morning. Bob, within the last week or so there have been some headlines emanating from Europe whereby competition authorities have paid a visit to a few different purchasers of ethylene in that market. Do you have any insights as to what's going on there? And as a manufacturer of ethylene, does Lyondell stand to benefit in any way? Perhaps you could educate us a bit on how monomer is sold locally in Europe?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think it's not a whole lot different than how it's sold here in the U.S. And we weren't approached. So, I don't know all of the details around the nature of their inquiries, but my impression, having worked in both regions is that it was very similar in both regions in how the market functions, and how buyers and sellers negotiate price. So at this moment, Kevin, I don't expect some sort of an impact, one way or the other in terms of the ethylene market over in Europe.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question came from the line of Mr. John Roberts of UBS. Sir, your line is now open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Back to the question on the PO plant. Do we need to see some isocyanate expansions announced to be able to absorb that propylene oxide?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I would say for two-thirds of it, not really. We've already \u2013 we have anticipation of demand and because it's out in 2021, I would suspect that we'll see some announcements as the next couple of years progress. So we've done a lot of work around placement of the PO and given the rate that markets are growing and the conversations we've had with some of our key customers, we think that we'll be able to place most, if not, all of it here in the U.S.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Carla, can we move to the next caller?","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Company. Sir, your line is now open.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Could you share with us your outlook for naphtha prices in Asia, and whether you think that crude oil prices are helping the naphtha-based production in that region?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I think in Asia, naphtha still is a very large source of ethylene production. And I think with low oil prices, certainly naphtha has become more competitive. I think with Asia, we continue to believe that as time goes on, methanol-based olefin production will be more relevant in terms of price setting. About half of the new capacity that's planned for ethylene in Asia, and specifically in China, will come from MTO or CTO. And so we think that the more relevant marker will be MTO-based economics, as it has been recently, but as it becomes bigger and bigger, even with slightly lower operating rates. We think MTO will be in the money and will determine the marginal cost of production.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Sir, your line is now open.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Hey, good morning, Hassan.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Bob, just wanted to revisit a couple of comments you made about EAI, and your feedstock slate there and the like. On the nearer-time side as well as the medium-term side. So and the premise of this question basically is that, at least as I see it, naphtha prices seem to be coming down on much harder than oil prices, right? Again, as I take a look at the sort of naphtha to oil ratio, it seems to have compressed quite dramatically relative to yesteryears. So the nearer-time question basically is, that Q1 to Q2 was there a meaningful change in your feedstock slate as far as EAI go? Lesser or more amounts of LPG used? So that's the nearer-time part.","And the medium-term part is that if at all this new relationship that I'm talking about, meaning a compressed naphtha to crude oil ratio, does continue or does linger on, would it not be sort of more economic just to use naphtha rather than sort of doing the switch over to LPG? I mean just, your medium-term thoughts about this new phenomenon would be appreciated?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. Excellent question. So the first question about Q2 and LPG cracking, it's incrementally, a little bit more LPG cracking, but not significant. So I would not consider that to be an unusual step up in LPG cracking. If there's some seasonality, generally in the summer months, we crack a bit more LPG. But it was not unusual.","Your point around naphtha, I think, it's a very good one, is that naphtha cracks have actually been pretty good and naphtha price relative to oil was somewhat strong in the past couple of years. And now it's kind of \u2013 it's again going back to a more historical relationship, or even weaker.","Simply put, the way we try to buy non-naphtha feed is there's a discount to the naphtha price. So if we can't get a firm advantage in the price mechanism, then we likely wouldn't buy it. And we would make the decision at the time.","And to your point, to the extent we're not able to do that, then we would just crack naphtha and capture that. So the advantage has to be firm for us to crack LPG.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Understood. Very helpful, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is now open.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, and good morning, and congrats on the record quarter. I was going to ask you if you guys are doing this call from the bat-cave because of the echo that's involved, but Dave was limiting me to one question, so I'm going to have to follow-up on that later on. Bob, you mentioned that Corpus Christi ran at 88% during the second quarter. I was wondering if you could parse that for us as the quarter progressed. And more importantly, where is that facility running through the month of July?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, first of all, thanks for your compliments about our quarter, and we're calling from a conference room, not the bat-cave. Corpus Christi, so we were ramping up in Q2. I think we had mentioned in Q1 earnings that we have some maintenance we needed to do. And so we've completed that. Today, the cracker is running in the mid to upper 90s% in terms of operating rate. As many new investments go, there's some teething that you find, and we have to correct small things. So we've basically materially increased the size of just about every piece of equipment in that plant. And so as we work through that, we find different things that we need to adjust. But we would expect that as the quarter progresses, we would run pretty close to 100% over at Corpus.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes, Frank, we have completed the rate tests at Corpus, so we have demonstrated the full capabilities of the expansion, and it's just normal operational issues over the past few weeks here.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Terrific, thanks so much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering. Sir, your line is now open.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on polypropylene. Is there any pent-up margin expansion potential in the U.S., given that the inventories have been falling and sales have been pretty strong, yet you've seen spreads between polypropylene and propylene remain flat for the past, I don't know, nine months or so?","And then also, it looks like there's been a fair amount of planned polypropylene expansions canceled either in China or other places of the world. Are you getting more optimistic on polypropylene margins going forward? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Matt. Thanks for your question. I think some very astute observations. First of all, yes. In the near term, inventories are quite low, as reported by different publications, so we have a $0.03 price increase announcement out for the coming month. So our sense is that the polypropylene market is very balanced, tight, and depending on the time of the year, and we would expect that to continue. And as I mentioned earlier in one of the other questions, it's part of our assessment in terms of our organic growth program going forward. So we do see \u2013 we see some of the cancelations that you mentioned and we're very constructive about polypropylene for the coming few years.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Another question came from the line of Mr. Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. A question about the balance sheet. Given the optimism you have about the structural dynamics in the industry, the breadth of the projects that you have in your potential pipeline for review, and the broader or deeper engineering talent to be able to handle more projects, has there been any shift in how you're thinking about the amount of leverage you'd like to take on, either on a mid-cycle basis or on a trough basis, in order to take advantage of those opportunities?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think so in the near term. Our view as we had expressed in Investor Day as well that we think we can continue to fund organic growth from our operating cash flow, given the level of cash flow we generate quarter after quarter. So I don't think we're going to necessarily need to avail ourselves of balance sheet capacity to undertake more organic growth. Essentially, I think the balance sheet is something we would use to undertake inorganic growth should we find the right opportunity. So our approach has not changed. It's more just a tilt towards organic growth as we find these opportunities to create shareholder value.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question came from the line of Mr. Marvin Schwartz of Neuberger Berman. Sir, your line is now open.","Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman Group LLC","Thank you. It would make me very happy if you really put on the back burner any thought of acquisition of any meaningful consequence because you have a major alternative, and it's buying back more of your own stock. You've taken your shares from 575 million shares in the first quarter of 2013 down to the current level of 397,000 (sic) [397 million] shares. But in the last six months you have really throttled back on the buyback.","Now your stock sells at one of the lowest price\/earnings multiples of any company on the New York Stock Exchange. One of the reasons is that there is a lot of concern about your 2018 earnings outlook, whether with the increase in industry-wide ethylene, you can continue to have up and what I think is likely to be record earnings, but others may disagree with that. But my more specific question is why not accelerate your share buyback program? After all, a few months ago you did announce your fourth 10% share buyback. Why don't you implement it more aggressively and it would help to assure that you'll have an improved earnings per share year in 2018?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Marvin, and thank you for your question. I frankly had expected this question to come up much earlier in the Q&A, so thanks for the question. Let me talk a little bit broadly about our share repurchase program and how we think about it.","First of all, share repurchase continues to be part of our capital allocation strategy in our plan. You see that we bought back shares in Q2. We've shown in various forums that our cash deployment priorities, they haven't changed. They're very consistent. It's to pay a strong dividend. We're going to continue to invest in maintenance of our existing assets. We're going to invest in profitable organic growth, and we still have excess cash, which we have dedicated to share repurchase.","I think there are two things, Marvin, that have changed in terms of share repurchase. First of all, when you think back to our first one or two \u2013 or actually the first two or three 10% programs, we funded those with about 6% to 7% of the 10% from operating cash flow, and then we incrementally added debt to supplement. One of the things we've said recently is that we would not add debt to supplement buybacks. We would take the excess cash flow, and then we would dedicate that towards buybacks.","The other thing we changed is that we're much more opportunistic in terms of our buyback program. And I think in Q2, it really showed some of the benefit of doing that because we could stretch our buyback dollars further and buy back more shares. So we're more opportunistic. But we continue to believe, as you do, that we're undervalued. And it's sort of, how do we stretch this 5% to 6% or so that we can do from our operating cash flow to buy the most shares possible?","So frankly, Marvin, I don't think anything has changed, and we continue to see acquiring ourselves as a very good alternative when we think about deploying our cash flow and we'll continue to do that. So, Thomas, I don't know if you wanted to add any more to that in terms of buybacks.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No. The only thing I would add.","Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman Group LLC","No, thank you very much. The truth of the matter is, if you added $500 million or even $1 billion to your total current debt, it wouldn't materially change the basic picture of your strong financial condition.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","This is Thomas Aebischer speaking. You're absolutely right with your comment about the size, if you use the size of $1 billion. However, buying back shares is an investment position like any other. And as Bob has mentioned, we are trying to create as much value as possible with our program. We have a 10% approved program, and we are executing this as we go forward. And you have seen, we have clearly increased our buybacks as the opportunities came across in the second quarter of 2017. So the capital deployment hierarchy really hasn't changed to what we have communicated over the last few months.","Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman Group LLC","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you for your question, Marvin.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","There being no other questions, let me close with a few thoughts. In the second half of 2017, we'll continue with our unrelenting focus on safe, reliable, and reliable operations, and a disciplined approach to costs. I think all of these things will deliver differential results for you, our shareholders. With no major planned maintenance for the remainder of this year, and a more typical cadence of about four turnarounds this year, we're well-positioned to capture market opportunities.","So with that, thank you for your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you in October.

The passcode for both numbers is 65468.","During today's call, we will focus on the first quarter results, the current environment and our near-term outlook. That being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. ","Bob Patel","Alright, thanks Dave. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter. The LyondellBasell business portfolio continues to exhibit superior cash flow generation as our growth strategy built momentum to deliver additional value for our shareholders.","Reliable operations and improving margins for several products provided an outstanding start for the New Year. Our first quarter diluted earnings were $3.11 per share. Both EPS and net income results for the first quarter represented a significant increase relative to the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, excluding the one-time tax benefits that occurred in the fourth quarter.","EBITDA was $1.9 billion, representing an 11% improvement over the fourth quarter and an 18% improvement over the first quarter 2017. Strong performance in our intermediates and derivatives business generated record quarterly EBITDA for that segment.","In the first quarter, we announced an 11% increase to our quarterly dividend, bringing it to $1 per share for the quarter. This increase reflects the confidence in our ability to continue providing strong returns to our shareholders through business cycles. Our growth program advanced in the first quarter with our announcement to acquire A. Schulman and the start of our Quality Circular Polymers or QCP joint venture with SUEZ.","While the A. Schulman acquisition will extend our range of innovative products and establish our position in high growth markets, partnering with SUEZ in the QCP JV, allows us to establish a leading position in the expanding market for recycled materials. Our organic growth projects also progressed during the first quarter. Construction on our Hyperzone HDPE project is on track for startup in 2019. And groundbreaking for our PO\/TBA project is scheduled for this summer.","Slide 5 highlights the continued improvements to the strong safety performance achieved by our employees and contractors during the first quarter. As you know, we believe that our commitment to help safety and environmental performance helps to drive reliable operations and ultimately profitability. Safety remains a top priority across our company and very pleased to see continued improvement over the first months of 2018. During the first quarter, chain margins across ethylene and polyethylene remained quite strong due to robust global demand growth.","Slide 6 illustrates some of the growing markets where our polyethylene enjoys leading positions, market such as film and sheet for packaging, high-density polyethylene for pressure pipe, plastic fuel tanks for transportation and wire and cable jacketing for electrical products. Global polyethylene market demand grew by 4% during the first quarter and the North American capacity additions will be needed to satisfy China's substantial and growing trade deficit for these plastics.","And now, Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the quarter.","Thomas Aebischer","Thanks you, Bob, and good morning to all of you. Please turn now to Slide 7 which shows our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. During the quarter strong polyethylene demand benefitted both Olefins and Polyolefins segment, a strong margin for styrene and other Intermediates and Derivatives products resulted in a quarter EBITDA record for the segment.","On Slide 8, we provide a picture of cash generation and use. During the first quarter we generated over $1 billion of cash from operating activities and approximately half of this amount was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases. We continue to view dividend as core to our capital deployment strategy and as Bob previously mentioned in the first quarter, we announced an 11% increase through our quarterly dividend, raising it to $1 per share. While we typically wait until the May board meeting to consider dividend increases, the combination of our improving view of market conditions and the benefits of U.S. tax reform provided the impetus for a larger and earlier dividend increase for 2018.","Our investments in maintenance and growth capital expenses were $429 million during the first quarter driven by planned maintenance turnarounds, the new Hyperzone plant and early work on the PO\/TBA project. During the first quarter our cash and liquid investment balance grew by $63 million.","Over the past 12 months, we generated more than $5.5 billion of cash from operating activities and used approximately $2.3 billion for dividends and share repurchases of the investments in our capital program and other financial activities, the cash and liquid investment balance increased by approximately $1.3 billion. Our share buyback program continued during the quarter with the Company repurchasing another 1.3 million shares. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchases approximately 190 million shares or approximately 33% of the initial shares outstanding.","In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early April, we recommend that our shareholders authorize a new repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares over the next 18 months. ","Slide 9 provides a longer perspective on LyondellBasell's substantial and consistent cash generation from operating activities. In each of the five periods, operating activities have generated between $5 billion and $6 billion of cash. After our investments in capital expenditure, our trailing 12 months free cash flow was $4 billion and we finished the quarter with approximately $6.9 billion of liquidity.","The bottom chart illustrates the consistency of our strong cash generation from operating activity as a percent of enterprise value relative to our industry peers. LyondellBasell leads the group with a strong and consistent ratio of approximately 13% and compares favorably to many of our more specialized peers.","With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you very much.","Bob Patel","Alright, thank you Thomas. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review our segment results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $780 million, a $4 million decline from the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of 2017 results included a LIFO inventory charge of $22 million. Relative to the previous quarter olefins results decreased by approximately $75 million, ethylene margin declined by approximately $0.02 per pound and volume decreased due to reduced derivative operating rates.","Ethylene operating rates remain strong across our system during the first quarter averaging 90%. Approximately 80% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs.","In polyolefins, combined results improved by approximately $35 million. Polyethylene spreads over ethylene increased by approximately $0.02 per pound. During our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we would incur impacts from unusually cold weather during the third week of January. This event impacted the first quarter results by approximately $45 million, roughly two-thirds of this impact is in our O&P \u2013 Americas segments with most of the remainder in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment.","Planned maintenance on one of our two crackers at Channelview negatively impacted the first quarter results by approximately $50 million. This work is near completion and the impact to the second quarter is estimated to be approximately $50 million. Over the past two months, spot ethylene prices have weakened due to strong industry supply, lower derivative operating rates and increased inventories.","However, the polyethylene market remains tight and margins are robust. Industry consultants are predicting an increase in ethylene cracker downtime during the second quarter. This increased downtime combined with improved operating rates on downstream derivative units should result in a more balanced ethylene environment in the coming months.","Turning to Slide 11, let's review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $518 million or $162 million higher than the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2017 results reflected LIFO inventory charges of $20 million and multi-employer pension charge of $20 million. Olefins result improved by approximately $70 million with ethylene margins increasing approximately $0.06 per pound. Our ethylene production volume increased due to the absence of fourth quarter maintenance at Wesseling site.","Utilization of advantaged feedstocks decreased by 2% as co-product credit out weighted the higher cost of naphtha feedstock. Our crackers operated at a 95% rate during the first quarter exceeding industry performance by about 5%.","Combined polyolefins results improved by approximately $50 million primarily due to higher sales volumes. During April, global markets remain tight to balance with increased maintenance across the industry during the spring months. Industry consultants are forecasting that three European crackers will be shut down for planned maintenance in the second quarter.","On Slide 12, we highlight the strong performance of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. The first quarter EBITDA was $486 million, setting a quarterly record and representing an improvement over $76 million from the fourth quarter.","Fourth quarter 2017 results reflected a LIFO inventory charge of $17 million. Results from propylene oxide and derivatives were relatively unchanged as margin improvement was offset by lower volumes. And increased margin for styrene was the primary driver for improved results of approximately $30 million in intermediate chemicals.","Oxyfuels and related products results improved approximately $20 million, primarily due to higher margins. During April, we're seeing strength in oxyfuel margins as we enter the period of seasonally high demand and lower butane prices. Prices for styrene and methanol remain strong but are expected to continue to moderate as industry production capacity returns to the market.","Now let's move to Slide 13 for a discussion of the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $63 million. The refinery continued operating at a strong rate of 252,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. The fourth quarter profitability benefited from the $38 million LIFO inventory adjustment and refining margins were relatively unchanged. The cost of RINs decreased relative to the fourth quarter.","During April, our refinery has continued to operate near nameplate capacity and refining spreads have improved with higher seasonal demand. The Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased to $26 per barrel, a significant increase from the first quarter average. We believe this favorability could extend through the second quarter as we enter the summer driving season.","Turning to Slide 14, let's take a closer look at the improvements in our operations and the outlook for our refinery. Operating rates improvement significant in 2017 and the upward trajectory continued during the first quarter. I'm proud of the dedication of our team and their efforts to improve reliability at the refinery, enabling a return to the high operating rates we've seen over the years from this asset.","As many of you are aware, the International Maritime Organization is reducing the limit for sulfur in marine fuel oil from 3.5% to 0.5% effective January 1, 2020. Forward curves are already indicating that the distillate spread over Brent crude oil will improve by more than $2 per barrel by mid-2019 and more than $5 per barrel by mid-2020. When combined with improvements projected for light heavy crude oil differentials, this could result in a significant increase to the Maya 2-1-1 refining spread and substantial profitability improvements for our refinery.","We will continue to monitor the implementation of these regulations over the coming months. But we believe the high coking, hydro treating and distillate capacities at our refinery leave us well positioned to benefit from these market developments.","Please turn to Slide 15 for an update on the A. Schulman acquisition. With the combination of LyondellBasell's vertically integrated polypropylene compounding business and A. Schulman's agile customer focus across broad and growing markets, we are well positioned to deliver significant value for customers and our shareholders.","Within one week of announcing the acquisition, we staffed our integration management officer and began work on detailed synergy and implementation planning for day one activities. I'm very pleased with the progress these teams have made. On March 16, we received United States antitrust clearance. We continue to anticipate that the transaction will close in the second half of 2018, subject to the remaining regulatory clearances and the A. Schulman shareholder vote scheduled for June 14. We look forward to updating you on the continued progress of this acquisition as we reach key milestones","Turning to Slide 16, allow me to recap some highlights. LyondellBasell delivered strong Q1 results in a time when new capacity is coming to market in the U.S. Our global portfolio of businesses continues to generate resilient returns in a dynamic range of market conditions. In the first quarter, we achieved record quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivative segment. We increased our quarterly dividend by 11% and continued to deliver strong cash generation. We continued to see strong demand for our polyolefin products across all regions. That supported solid chain margins for our O&P businesses. The I&D segment benefited from strong margins across multiple business lines and our refinery ran near nameplate capacity.","Looking forward, we are seeing typical seasonal spread improvements for transportation fuels that support both our oxyfuels and refining business. As downstream derivative units in the industry ramp up to full capacity, we anticipate ethylene and polyethylene will move to more balanced position. The recent increase in oil prices and strong global demand should continue to provide support for polyolefin pricing.","Our organic growth program is progressing very well with construction of our Hyperzone HDPE plant on track for startup in 2019 and formal groundbreaking for our PO\/TBA plant scheduled this summer.","Preliminary engineering work is underway to support a final investment decision for our North American PDH and PP plants by early 2019.","With that said, we're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Steve Byrne","Yes. Thank you. They polyethylene pricing in Europe just remains at a substantial premium to the rest of the world. What are the factors that enable that, and do you see that as being sustainable?","Bob Patel","Good morning, Steve. First of all the operating rates have continued to increase in Europe as there is no new capacity and demand is growing at a modest rate. So, the units over there for the industry are running at much, much higher rates. It's also a relatively more complex market than what you might find in China or in Asia generally speaking. So, in some ways it's a little bit harder market to serve. So, we do continue to believe that there will be some resilience in this premium as time goes on.","Steve Byrne","And the other factor I wanted your view on Bob was just U.S. polyethylene producer inventory level seem to be high in March and it just doesn't seem to square with this dynamic about low ethylene pricing because of the delay in startup of downstream derivatives, unless the downstream derivatives are other ethylene derivatives and not polyethylene is there logic in all of it to you?","Bob Patel","The inventories in polyethylene, they may be higher than average but remember there is going to be more production as well. So, I do think that some of the derivative \u2013 the polyethylene units have not been steady in terms of their operation. It's been more up and down or not producing the targeted grades. I think we'll know a lot more here in Q2 as we reach kind of a newer normal with these new units.","Steve Byrne","Very good. Thank you.","Bob Patel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question. Arun, your line is open. Please check your mute feature. Arun, your line is open. You may ask your question.","And we'll go on to the next question. That comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Good morning.","Bob Patel","Good morning P.J.","P.J. Juvekar","Bob, on polyethylene, several cities have been tracking down on single-use plastic bags. What's your view on that and how does it impact polyethylene demand. And then related to that, you bought a stake in recycling company recently, was that in anticipation of this trend?","Bob Patel","On the single-use PE bags, that's been around for a while in different parts of the U.S. as well as globally. And some of that impact has already been felt. It's a combination of LL and HD that see the impact. I think it remains to be seen as the impact is greater than what we know today. With respect to our acquisition and the joint venture of with SUEZ in this QCP venture, that's really anticipating a broader move towards brand owners like Procter & Gamble and IKEA and Unilever looking for more recycled content in their products. And as you think, circularity is going to be a very, very important feature of going forward. So, you know with SUEZ, I think what's unique is that we've partnered with a waste handling company who brings to the venture clean and segregated waste which is very good feedstock for recycling. In the past, the challenge was the recycling has been that what comes into a recycling plant is mixed waste and so you know the end-use of that is more limited. I think we have a very unique opportunity with QCP to really impact in terms of circular economy.","P.J. Juvekar","Yeah. And secondly on, you know in the past, you've always given your views on ethane and NGLs. Ethane prices have gone up slightly, not running up, but maybe inching up. So, can you give us your outlook on ethane with these new crackers, but also more drilling in the Permian and takeaway capacity there? Thank you.","Bob Patel","Yeah. There have been P.J. a lot of announcements from the midstream about more pipelines coming from the Permian to Mont Belvieu or to the Gulf Coast. And so, we continue to believe that there is ample ethane to supply the new capacity closer to the Gulf Coast. So, from the Permian, from the Rockies, Eagle Ford and so on, and while yes there is a bit more of a premium, you'll recall that we've been saying for a couple of years that we're inspecting the frac spread to be $0.07 to $0.10 and we're kind of in that range. So, there is lots of ethane available in my opinion.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you and good morning everyone. Bob, could you just talked about you know over the next six months or so as we get 2, maybe 2.5 cracker startups, as a lot of that product destined for the Asian market. What \u2013 how do you think about the spread between the U.S. P price and the Asian P price? And do you think that needs to compress, and do you think different grades will see different price trends, as that capacity comes online?","Bob Patel","Good morning Vincent. Well there is a lot there. So, let me see if I can address it in pieces. First of all, if you step back and look at operating rates globally, it's still pretty high operating rates. I think the unique feature about this cycle if you will or this phase of build out on capacity, we're coming off of full operating rates essentially. And this year it seems to me that supply growth may exceed demand growth by 1% or 2%, still leaving us with operating rates that are greater than 90%. With higher oil prices, prices have come up in Asia. And when you look at the differential between the U.S. and Asia on like-for-like grades, it's about $0.05. It's not as great as what we may have had last year or the year before.","For the remainder, for other product grades that are more U.S. centric, I would expect there to be \u2013 still be some delta as we've historically had. So, you really kind of have to look at the price and separate it into the grades that are exported and like-for-like, and that spread of $0.05 is not a lot in my opinion.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thank you. And Thomas, if I could just ask you, you know, you generated $1.9 billion of EBITDA and I believe there is only about $1 billion of cash flow from operations. So, could you just walk us from one to the other? Anything usual?","Thomas Aebischer","Right. Yes. So, obviously you have seen the net working capital development during \u2013 you'll see obviously all the detail in the 10-Q. We have net working capital slide, the net working capital buildup sort of variance, and that explains the most significant piece of it. So, it's you know compared to first quarter of 2017, when you look at it on a free cash flow basis, actually a significant increase on free cash flow.","Vincent Andrews","But was it inventory, what part of the working capital is driving it?","Thomas Aebischer","It's basically inventory, yes.","Vincent Andrews","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Jeff Zekauskas","Bob. Can you talk about how different policy changes regarding ethanol in China may affect the MTBE market over time?","Bob Patel","I think you know Jeff, I think you're referring to E10, and so we'll have to see how that develops. But we still see a good MTBE market globally and even if there is more ethanol, MTBE is still going to be an important oxygenates going forward. And given our PO\/TBA investment being here in the U.S., we're capitalizing on cheaper butane and we see good prospects for that project.","Jeff Zekauskas","And then for Thomas, how much did you spend to buy back 1.3 million shares in the first quarter?","Thomas Aebischer","Right. So, we spent \u2013 and you look at the cash flow statement, you will see it. We spent for the 1.3 million or shares, $190 million. However as we disclosed in the 10-Q, we have a time lag between you know the share count and the actual cash outflow of about two days. So, when you take the 1.3 million shares, you will see all these details in the Q. The actual spend including that two day time lag is $139 million.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer","Yeah. Good morning fellows.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Duffy Fischer","A question just, we had the announcement from CDI a couple of days ago that China is going to go ahead with its first ethane cracker and ship the ethane from the U.S. So, two question there; one, roughly how many announcements like that do you think we'll get over the next couple of years? And two, what's the differential in cost between using ethane producing pellets here, shipping the pellets to China versus shipping the ethane and producing the pellets there, which obviously condensing ethane is going to be more expensive. But what's your best guess with that relative difference is in cost structure?","Bob Patel","So, Duffy, first of all, you know it's difficult to predict or forecast what other announcements may come. But if you step back and think about development of the Middle East petrochemical industry, it is essentially premised on cheaper ethane, but the producers there chose to solidify the ethane and move it in the form of polyethylene or produce liquid chemicals which are much more inexpensive to ship.","And I would think that, that will still be sort of the prevailing sentiment as we think through how this ethane will come to market. In terms of cost differentials, just kind of as a rule of thumb, you know I think about the cost of shipping ethane in terms of cost of ethylene as being $450 a ton or something in that range as opposed to \u2013 so you know north of $0.20 a pound as opposed to polyethylene which including sort of putting it in bags is $0.08 or something like that. So, there is a significant delta in terms of shipping gas versus polyethylene.","Duffy Fischer","Fair enough. Then just one follow-up, on your I&D segment, couple of smaller businesses have done pretty well lately with the methanol, acetic acid moving better and styrene obviously is been doing well. Is there any thought internally to maybe moving towards organic growth in those and trying to make those a bigger part of the portfolio?","Bob Patel","Duffy, you know we've been over the last year or so, or two years in thinking through our strategy in I&D and we have you know a range of options in front of us that we will consider. Nothing I'm prepared to discuss today.","Duffy Fischer","Fair enough. Thank you, guys.","Bob Patel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. You may ask your question.","Aleksey Yefremov","Q1 derivatives results were $55 million year-over-year. What was the driver behind this and could you talk broadly about you know supply demand and what are your expectations for earnings in PO this year compared to 2017?","Bob Patel","So, the driver was really in styrene monomer as a co-product in the production of PO. If PO margins have been fairly stable and up some, we expect that to be \u2013 to continue. Volumes should increase as we go into the second quarter, so we're quite \u2013 continue to be quite constructive about our PO business. I think Alex, when you think about our I&D business, and step back from the various products, the key feature, as we transit from Q1 to Q2 is really going to be about moving into driving season and how oxyfuels will contribute to an improving earnings in I&D. We see the ethylene crack spreads have come up, which benefits our oxyfuel business. Butane typically gets cheaper in the summer months. We saw that actually early this year, indicating that there is plenty of butane supply and volumes typically go up because of driving season. So, I think all of that ultimately as we move in Q2, as we do in prior years, oxyfuel result should be an important feature.","Aleksey Yefremov","Understood. Thank you. And if I can follow-up on merchant ethylene in your view of strengthening ethylene prices going forward. I guess if PE units will ramp that make sense, but would ethylene crackers, new ethylene cracker also ramp productions and maybe it sounds as it's going to be integrated the increase. How would that's strengthened supply demand for merchant ethylene?","Bob Patel","So in Q1, we had operating rates for crackers very high, while the derivatives didn't run as well in the industry, and some of the new units were more up and down in polymers as opposed to in the cracker business. Recent ethylene prices \u2013 spot ethylene prices have been pretty close to the ethane cash cost. So, I know this is on investors' mind, so let me just address sort of the impact to our company. First of all, we sell about 25% of our ethylene into the merchant market, and to size sort of the impact for you. About a 5% change in the spot margin translates to about $80 million per year impact in profitability. So, it's very modest when you think in those terms. And I do think as we move through the year and as the new polyethylene units start to run more fully, we should expect that ethylene will come more into balance. If it doesn't, then upsize the impact for you, about a 5% change in spot margin, translate for a full year to $80 million impact on earnings.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you. Bob.","Bob Patel","Okay.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good Morning. Bob, if China were to proceed with tariffs on certain resins including low density and linear low density polyethylene. Does it matter or not matter for U.S. Gulf Coast producers? And if it does matter, maybe you could share your thoughts on what might happen with trade flows pricing potential for resin substitution and those sorts of issues?","Bob Patel","I think, first of all, Kevin, yes, they're sort of around us. Our company is more focused on high density and followed by low density, and then we have very little linear low. And I think they'll be a combination of those things that you mentioned. You could see some trade flow shift, but the near term impact will be higher prices in Asia. And substitution from LL to HD and used applications, some of that can be done, but I don't think it's substantial. So it really is \u2013 when I think about tariffs and the trade topics, we are assessing longer term impacts. I think the near term impacts are higher prices frankly.","David Kinney","Kevin, this is Dave. If you go back to the chart that Bob showed on slide 6, the 38 billion pounds trade deficit for polyethylene in China, I think that's really the driving force behind us. China does need this polyethylene one way or another, and whether the trade lane shift or not, you know is more of a final question on that.","Kevin McCarthy","Thank you. And then as a follow-up if I may. Your O&P America's earnings held pretty close to flat in 1Q sequentially, perhaps better than some of the benchmark levels might suggest. I was wondering if you could speak to that for example or are you making more money in the deficits these days with the disparity between ethylene monomer in the value of propylene or perhaps your other factors helping to support the earnings there.","Bob Patel","But we have a very good polypropylene market and that helps the segment. And I think it also speaks to the mix in terms of our participation in polyethylene. So, Kevin again, we've talked about the resilience of our portfolio and about our O&P business, and I think another Q1 demonstrates that.","David Kinney","And Kevin, I think if you look at the polyethylene price realization that we had relative to some of the non-market adjustments that you saw out there by some of the consultants that I think the real market really wasn't as bad as was portrayed in some of those non-market adjustments. I don't think that occurred in every market and every product line that's out there for polyethylene.","Kevin McCarthy","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global Partners. You may ask your question.","Hassan Ahmed","Good morning, Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Hassan Ahmed","Bob, I wanted to revisit the China trade question, but not from a product pricing perspective, more from a feedstock perspective. Interestingly, obviously propylene seems to be a part of the tariffs, while polypropylene does not. And if I have my numbers right, it seems that around 15% of all U.S. propane exports are China done. So I mean, is it fair to assume that if this tariff regime were to kick in, I mean you'd start seeing a bit of a glut of propylene in the domestic market, which I guess would depressed propylene pricing may even provide a ceiling for ethylene rising and would probably be extremely favorable for the polypropylene type of things. Is that the right way of thinking about them?","Bob Patel","Yeah. Look, I think that there is a potential outcome. And when you think about propane, first of all, there is not a lot of new export terminals that are being built. On the other hand, there is more propane supply coming from new NGLs. So, if China were to pull back, then yes, I agree with you. I think the propane mines would increase, and therefore propane would be much more competitive with ethane than it is today. So, for the scenario you've outlined is a very big possibility that that how it plays out.","Hassan Ahmed","Understood, understood. Changing gears a bit, you know obviously a strong results on the I&D side. And as I looked at certain volumes within individual products, it seems both on a year-over-year as well as sequential basis, the asset yield volumes were down significantly. I mean down 28% quarter-on-quarter, 35% year-on-year. What was going on over there? Was this sort of maybe a strategy on your part to this sort of reduce volumes to get better pricing or was there may be an outage there and those sort of things?","David Kinney","Yeah. Hassan, this is Dave. We did have some operational issues with our acetyl segment during the first quarter of this year, but you are absolutely right the margin improvements have been substantial.","Hassan Ahmed","I mean would you be able to break out what sort of impact EBITDA impact that outage resulted in?","Bob Patel","It wasn't really material for the whole segment.","Hassan Ahmed","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thanks. The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","David Begleiter","Thanks. Good morning. Bob, just on PE in the very near term, would you expect some polyethylene price erosion in this April May \u2013 in this May June timeframe perhaps?","Bob Patel","We are in a seasonally strong period for polyethylene. So, as I had mentioned in couple of the prior calls, typically for polyethylene and polyolefin is generally the annual growth we see in the first three quarters of the year, so \u2013 and this year is shaping up very similarly. And with higher oil prices and higher prices in Asia, demand is going very well. I see a very constructive market for the next quarter or two, and we'll have to see how Q4 develops, but until then seems to me that this supply is coming just in time to meet the demand growth globally.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just on styrene Bob, there is been a recent announcement by a U.S. player to add new capacity. Were you surprised by that announcement?","Bob Patel","Well, now a days, a very little surprises me David. But our focus has been more on POSM, and as we think about styrene production. And I think that in Asia, we're going to see fuel SM as a more prevalent way of producing propylene oxide and therefore styrene monomer are happen to think that that's still the most economical at least for our company. So we can't speak for others.","David Begleiter","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Bob Koort","Thanks. Good morning. Question maybe around the capital deployment, a couple of items. One, obviously you guys started buying back stock, it was like maybe this bearish stock price wasn't dissimilar from the fourth quarter. Did you guys raise your threshold bar of what price you are willing to pay or what sort of change the dynamic there? And then, secondly Bob, can you talk a little bit about further inorganic opportunities. How you see that market developing? Are you guys active in looking or is it quite a down? Give us some sense there? Thanks.","Bob Patel","So, first of all, on share repurchases. You know every quarter, as I mentioned in prior calls, we really review intrinsic value and we think through what's ahead in the quarter where are we trading. And we update our grid that I've talked about in the past, and so this quarter was no different. I think what's important for investors to recognize is that company like ours from time to time had material non-public information. We are not able to get into the market immediately after we release earnings and with the new 10b5 plan. In the case of Q1, we hadn't announced. Well we announced the A. Schulman acquisition in mid-February. We also moved up our dividend announcement to the end of February. We believe both of those to be material on public information.","And so, we really can't get in the market to buy back shares until very end of February. So you know these things, these are normal practices and we keep our value of our firm updated very regularly as we think through buybacks. And we said before that we want to be opportunistic, so we can maximize the bang for our bucket if you will and you'll continue to see us doing that.","On the inorganic side, we've said in the past that what we look for our businesses that fit from a strategic standpoint and businesses where we know we can apply our strengths clean values. We are very value-minded company in everything we do and I think that you should expect that to continue as we consider a range of growth options, whether they're inorganic or organic.","Bob Koort","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. You may ask your question.","Jim Sheehan","Bob, with the changes in the International Maritime Organization helping your business, how do you think that refining in your strategic options for that business going forward?","Bob Patel","Yeah. So Jim, that's been consistent in my message on this, is that our focus right now is to have strong and reliable operations at the refinery. And I think we're on a good track there and I want to make sure our team continues to focus on that. I think we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us. It's indeed the forward curves turned out to be true. As we get closer, it seems to me that this is a real opportunity, especially for any refinery like ours that has so much coking capacity and its ability to process large volumes of sour crude oil. So, we're again value-minded, building up my last comment, we are very value minded when we think about these things. And today our focus is to run well and I think there is great potential in our refinery that we own.","Jim Sheehan","Great. And then your polyethylene business, you've highlighted the company's strong presence in a variety of end markets. I am curious about what's been happening in the wire and cable market? Recently I think there is been some softening of demand there. Do you think that's temporary or do you think there are more extensive issues in that end market to contend with?","Bob Patel","I think that's probably temporary because if you just step back and think about infrastructure spending in developing markets. And potentially, here at home, if there is more infrastructures' spending that stimulated by the government, I think that should be a good market and one that we quite like.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] One next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. You may ask your question.","Frank Mitsch","Yes. Hi. Good morning. And congratulations on a nice quarter and even further congratulations on the improvement in the sound quality of the conference call.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you for your recognition, Frank.","Frank Mitsch","Absolutely, it no longer sounds like you're in an underground bunker. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, based on your obviously record in I&D, it sounds like oxyfuels is doing better, you know styrene has the sustainability, you're going have more pounds of acetyls. Is there any reason that we would not expect to see another record in I&D in Q2?","Bob Patel","Well, Frank, let's see how markets develop. I think the more volatile parts of our I&D portfolio are styrene and methanol, difficult to predict were those will go. Directionally, oxyfuel should be better in Q2 compared to Q1. So, let's see where we end up about a quarter from now.","Frank Mitsch","I take that as yes. And then Thomas, you mention that you paid $119 million, however there is a two day lag and you will see that it was actually $139. So, it says that you guys bought back $20 million of stock in two days. Can you clarify that for me? And is that kind of the run rate now that you're out of the quiet periods of the Schulman deal and the dividend hike.","Thomas Aebischer","No. This is you know you have this [indiscernible] actually on share buybacks every quarter. So, when you look at the Q and you look at the amount of shares is closed and the cash outflow, you see that two day lag. And I cannot clarify obviously that we are buying at a certain pace. That obviously depends very much on any given day and the underlying share price. But I think what's important to know, is I think it was an earlier question ask about the fourth quarter, and we pullback shares again. So as we stated before, we find our share very attractive and that's why we continued buying back shares also at the level of wherever it was, under $110, under $111 or $107 a share. So that's what we continue to do so.","Frank Mitsch","But just to clarify, so that's $20 million change in two days meant that you were very aggressive at the end of March. Is that how I should be thinking about that?","Thomas Aebischer","No. I think when you just look at the share count, you will virtually see in March how much shares we pulled back, obviously, what's the corresponding share price is. And you can easily figure also, we'll see average share prices we have paid for as 1.3 million shares.","Frank Mitsch","All right. Thank You.","Bob Patel","Thank you, Frank.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. You may ask your question.","John Roberts","Thank you, Bob. On IMO 2020, the fleet ownership period to be delaying their decision between onboard scrubbers for lower sulfur fuel, so there could be a wide range of scenarios. I suspect in terms of what happens. Is there any capital required few at any of the extremes of kind of the scenarios that can happen or it's really just an operating change. And the lead time that they'll have to make decisions on the scrubbers will give you plenty of lead time for you to make any changes in the refinery.","Bob Patel","I don't. We don't have any capital that's earmarked for capitalizing on this IMO 2020. Again more broadly, I've been asking the team that's refinery, it really just focus on consistent reliable operations at nameplate capacity and we've been really, really focused on that. I think that is the biggest driver and positioning ourselves for what IMO 2020 could turn out to be.","Thomas Aebischer","Yes, John. We actually completed our Tier 3 investment last year, so there is no further investment needed. We just need to run it well as Bob said.","John Roberts","And then, in reading the Schulman proxy, it looks like one of the bidders wanted to split off the distribution and composites business. Do you view those parts of Schulman strategic to the deal or they something that maybe after the deal later on, you might separate out as well?","Thomas Aebischer","So, we have not made any decisions on these businesses. Those are obviously smaller compared to the whole of Schulman, but we are going to look at all of that very carefully. And I'll just remind you that as we thought about this acquisition, it was about creating a new platform in our company in compounding and I am convinced that I think we have all of the ingredients to build a world class compounding business that will reach a multitude of markets. So we're going to all of that with an open mind and solving for value creation.","John Roberts","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. You may ask your question.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning, guys.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Jonas Oxgaard","I want to ask whether there is a TRADE war with China or not. We're going to have to place a bunch of that polyethylene somewhere. We now have talked about it a little. I was curious about how are you thinking about Europe in all of this? Are you making preparations to send some more into Europe and I mean so what you think the impact of that is in the European market?","Bob Patel","First of Jonas, I think the \u2013 given that European market is growing, albeit modestly at maybe 1% or 2% a year, eventually the need for imports into that market are then going to grow. And the needs for European market are very different than the Asian markets in terms of the types of products. So, as we think about our new investment in the Hyperzone technology, I think that plays very well to targeted exports from the U.S. to Europe to supplement what we already do over there.","You know in my view, I think it's a better way to meet a modestly growing European business in polyethylene rather than build locally. So, trade war or not, I mean I think we really have to look at the kind of grades that are needed, and I do think there is a meaningful difference between the higher volume, more commodity grades that an Asian market might need compared to types that are needed in Europe.","Jonas Oxgaard","And how does your export compete with the Middle Eastern ones which are going to Europe right now?","Bob Patel","So, ethane costs here are pretty competitive with the new ethane cost in the Middle East. So, again, I think it's really \u2013 we look at asset by asset. We look at netbacks through various regions and we're optimizing for value. So, I think we could if we needed to export more product to Europe, we could do it very competitively from the U.S. And what benefits us is that, we already have a very large presence in Europe locally and so when I think about exports from the U.S., it's about supplementing production authority there.","Jonas Oxgaard","Well. Okay. I was more thinking about the quality of the product coming out in the Middle East versus yours than the cost position?","Bob Patel","I see. I think it depends on the type of technology that are deployed, but I really do believe this new Hyperzone polyethylene technology, it's going to be really unique in the high density space. And it will be the type of product that many, many European customers will want. And so, as we think about this one and the potential one you know in the next decade, we will certainly think about Europe as being part of the marketing plan on the new assets.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may ask your question.","Matthew Blair","Good morning Bob. Coming back to the trade theme here, you know earlier this year we had China duties on styrene. Lyondell is the merchant and styrene seller. Could you talk about what kind of impact did you see on your styrene flows and perhaps pricing? And does that give you more or less comfort on potential tariffs from China on PE?","Bob Patel","So, on styrene, you know so far we didn't see a lot of impact in terms of volumes. And as you can see from posted price is from different publication, here the price is held up quite well. I do think this is to be realistic to you Matthew. You know, I think this is something we have to watch with styrene. Here my moderate view about future in terms of styrene prices, so I think we'll just have to watch how all that develops. Part of the reason styrene prices also moved was because there were some unplanned outages and some of that production has returned to market. So, really difficult to predict or forecast how all of these tariffs and anti-dumping duties, how rebellion, how stinky are they going to be and how they impact. I think we'll know more as the year progresses.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","Nicholas Cecero","This is Nick Cecero on for Laurence. Quick question on styrene, I was wondering if you can walk me through integrated versus non-integrated economics you know in terms of what we're seeing and how you see supply demand play off for styrene through the end of the decade?","David Kinney","Nick, this is Dave. We haven't revealed really our co-producer economics. It's really tied up in the production of the propylene oxide as well. And so, we haven't broken that out \u2013 historic.","Nicholas Cecero","Yeah. Thank you.","Bob Patel","Alright. So, with that being the last question let me close with some remarks. So, first of all, you know there remains a potential for choppier U.S. polyethylene market later this year. We continue to believe that this cycle is short and shallow. Whatever takes place later in the year, think about operating rates. We're coming into this year with very, very high operating rates. If supply growth exceeds demand growth by a 1% or 2%, we're still left with very high operating rates. In terms of our own business, we expect I&D and Refining segment performance to offset declines in U.S. P profitability should they materialize later in the year. I think this is again, the strength and balance of the overall LyondellBasell portfolio.","On the meantime, you know our focus continues to be on operational or commercial excellence and how we run the company day-to-day. And we're really starting to get traction now on our growth program as we advance polyethylene PO\/TBA and move towards closing the Schulman deal so that we can integrate and create what we believe will be a world leader in terms of compounding. So, lot going on here and we'll forward to giving you an update at the next quarterly meeting.","So, thank you for your interest and wish you all a great weekend.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. At this time you may disconnect your lines."],"13786":["LyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 29, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Douglas J.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas J. Pike","Thank you. Well, hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's Third Quarter 2013 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.","But before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. Now, for more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com\/investorrelations.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.","Now finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 29 by calling (866) 667-5779 in the United States and (402) 220-6423 outside the United States, and the passcode for both numbers is 5421.","Now during today's call, we're going to focus on third quarter 2013 performance, current environment and brief review of active projects in the near-term outlook.","With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our website.","Let's take a look at Slide #4 and review a few financial highlights. The third quarter continued the trends of the first half of the year. We generated $1.53 billion of EBITDA. This led to income from continuing operations of $854 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.51.","I would like to highlight the bar charts on this page and the steady performance that we have realized. Industry conditions, particularly around oil and natural gas pricing, coupled with our strong operations of business portfolio, have led to consistent quarterly results. This type of performance is seldom associated with cyclical businesses like chemicals and refining.","While we have had some volatility among our product groups and normal seasonality across the year, we achieved quite steady results overall. We will look at the details of individual businesses later in the call.","During the quarter, we declared a regular interim dividend of $0.50 per share and repurchased 13.5 million shares.","If you would turn to Slide #5, you will see our year-to-date safety results. Overall, our safety statistics continued to be among the very best in the industry, but we have not improved year-on-year.","We believe that the safety perfection is achievable, and to get there, we must have continuous improvement. We want no one hurt on the job, not even the minor injuries we have experienced. We'll press even harder in the coming days.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Slide #6, which shows third quarter EBITDA by segment. As Jim said, the quarter generally reflected conditions that prevailed throughout 2012 and the first half of 2013.","This consistency is repeated in our segment earnings. As you can see, the third quarter earnings profile is very similar to the pattern of the last 12 months.","During the third quarter, O&P-Americas generated EBITDA of $841 million. Exclusive of planned maintenance at our Clinton site, our ethylene assets continue to operate near 100% of capacity.","O&P-EAI EBITDA was $204 million, a third consecutive quarter of $200 million or better performance. Intermediates & Derivatives segment EBITDA was $427 million. Strong results in the oxyfuels and styrene added to steady performance in propylene oxide following second quarter turnarounds.","Refining segment EBITDA was slightly above breakeven. Poor gasoline spreads, coupled with marine costs and facility maintenance, more than offset an improved heavy light spread.","In the right side of the slide, you see a similar pattern across the last 12 months segment EBITDA. O&P-Americas and Intermediates & Derivatives segments have stood out throughout the period.","Before discussing our cash flow, I want to mention 2 other items. First, regarding our cash fixed costs. Our annual underlying cash fixed costs continue to run at a level consistent with prior year as cost reductions offset inflation. However, due to timing factors, our second half costs are expected to run a few percentage points above the first half rate. We experienced a similar trend last year.","Second, the third quarter effective tax rate is somewhat below the annual run rate. The quarter was impacted by certain discrete items, which reduced tax expense by approximately $25 million net. These items include changes in valuation allowances and the closing of certain prior year tax audits.","We'll now turn to Slide #7 and 8. I'd like to discuss cash generation and deployment. During the quarter, cash from operating activities continued to be very strong at $1.3 billion, exclusive of working capital changes. Capital spending was $423 million, consistent with our plan. We spent $981 million towards our share repurchase program and declared $280 million in dividends, which were paid in October.","As I mentioned on the second quarter call, during July, we took advantage of available interest rates and issued 10- and 30-year bonds totaling $1.5 billion in principal at an average coupon rate of 4.6%. As a result, our cash balance increased to $4.4 billion and we closed the quarter with an outstanding share count of 557 million shares.","In the right side of the slide, you see the similar metrics for the last 12 months. I want to highlight a few items. First, operations, including the impact of working capital changes, generated $4.6 billion. From this cash flow, we invested $1.5 billion in our capital program and returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","On Slide #8, we provide further details of the past 3 years of cash generation and deployment. Since becoming a public company during May of 2010, we have generated $13.8 billion of cash from operations. Approximately $3.8 billion has been reinvested in our assets, while $7.1 billion has been returned to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance, beginning on a Slide #9, with Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas. Third quarter EBITDA was $841 million, approximately $110 million less than the record second quarter results. Approximately $65 million of the decline can be attributed to our scheduled maintenance turnaround at our Clinton ethylene\/polyethylene site. Joint venture equity income was $7 million, and we received dividends of $15 million. Versus the second quarter, the ethylene contract price declined by approximately $0.01 per pound. The cost of both naphtha and propane feedstock increased during the quarter, both cost -- ethane costs decreased by approximately $0.03 per gallon.","Increased propylene prices caused us to restart our metathesis unit, which produces propylene from ethylene. During the quarter, the unit produced approximately 100 million pounds of propylene, contributing approximately $25 million to EBITDA.","Exclusive of the turnaround and the metathesis unit operation, our ethylene production averaged 98% of nameplate capacity. Our olefin operations continued to outperform the industry.","Approximately 87% of our ethylene production was from NGLs. Ethane accounted for 70% and propane, 15%. Combined, polyolefin results improved versus the second quarter. Our average third quarter polyethylene price increased slightly less than $0.02 per pound. Sales volumes were relatively unchanged.","Polypropylene volume increased by approximately 5%. The price spread over propylene decreased by $0.01 per pound.","Entering the fourth quarter, we have benefited from the restart of our Clinton facility. During the winter months it's not uncommon to experience seasonally higher raw material costs but, thus far, this has not been a significant factor.","Let's turn to Slide #10 and review our performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $204 million, a decline of $91 million versus the second quarter. Joint venture equity income was $48 million, and we received dividends of $77 million.","Olefin results declined by approximately $75 million. Increased naphtha raw material cost, coupled with a reduced benefit from cracking LPGs, were primarily responsible for the decline.","During the quarter, our olefin plant operating rates were greater than 90%, well above industry averages. We produced approximately 40% of our ethylene from advantage feedstocks but the incentive over naphtha cracking declined. Overall, the feedstock advantage benefited results by approximately $40 million versus naphtha.","During the quarter, we started production at our Wesseling butadiene expansion and finished the quarter demonstrating design capacities. Margins on the incremental production are protected by contract floor pricing. However, this is not the case for the base production volumes. The third quarter average butadiene price declined by approximately $0.30 per pound, contributing to decreased EBITDA.","Underlying polyolefin results were relatively unchanged. Margin improvements in both polyethylene and polypropylene offset volume declines of 8% and 11%, respectively. Second quarter volumes were particularly strong, while third quarter volumes were consistent with recent history.","Combined polypropylene compounds and polybutene-1 EBITDA declined by approximately $15 million. Increased propylene costs were not immediately passed through to the customer base, leading to a margin decline in our compounding business. Volumes declined following typical seasonal patterns and auto industry vacation schedules. Year-to-date EBITDA is relatively unchanged versus 2012.","October business fundamentals have been relatively consistent with third quarter conditions. However, it is difficult to experience a holiday-related slowdown later in the fourth quarter.","Before I move into the next segment, I wanted to make a few comments about our restructuring efforts in EAI. We're often asked whether we are realizing the benefits of this effort. Appreciate that visibility can be difficult given the volatility of key business drivers, so I want to review some details.","Since 2011, our annual cash fixed costs have declined moderately, while offsetting inflation. This has been achieved both through shuttering polyolefin capacity and reducing manpower. For example, we have reduced our business and sales staff by approximately 30%. We have also announced restructuring efforts at our Wesseling site and within global R&D. While these latest programs are currently underway, you won't see the impact of these actions in our financial results until next year.","Over the past 3 years, we have closed and consolidated approximately 500 million pounds of European polyolefin production capacity. We have also aggressively pursued raw material savings and flexibility. This was quite evident during recent quarters when we produced approximately 40% of our European ethylene from advantage feedstocks or running our plants at greater than industry operating rates.","As a consequence, we believe that our results have outperformed the European industry. Although we won't have these opportunities every quarter, we are now well prepared to act when market opportunities arise.","Next, please turn to Slide #11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $427 million, an $89 million increase versus the prior quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results increased by approximately $20 million. Increase was primarily due to improved volumes following second quarter turnarounds. Results for the other chemicals in the segment increased approximately $65 million. Approximately 1\/3 of the increase was due to increased styrene and C4 chemical volumes following the turnarounds.","The balance was primarily related to improved styrene margins. Industry consultants report that styrene raw material margins increased by approximately $0.03 per pound.","The final area of improvement was in oxyfuels, as margin improvements contributed an estimated $15 million of additional EBITDA. Thus far, in the fourth quarter, propylene oxide and derivative business conditions have been relatively steady. Oxyfuel margins have declined following the typical seasonal trend. Styrene margins have also declined, but remain above historic norms.","Let's move to Slide #12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter was disappointing as we generated only $8 million of EBITDA. Crude throughput was 250,000 barrels per day. Reduced rates were a portion of the quarter to correct constraints at our vacuum tower. This impacted results by an estimated $30 million, but going forward, yields an approximate $5 million monthly improvement.","The industry benchmark, Maya 2-1-1 spread, increased by approximately $1.64 per barrel. A portion of our crude is purchased based on Brent or WTI benchmark pricing plus a discount for crude quality. Versus the second quarter, Brent and WTI benchmarks increased by approximately $7 and $12, respectively. The Maya benchmark crude price increased by approximately $1.66 per barrel and our average crude price increased by approximately $4 per barrel.","Since our average crude price increased more than Maya, we did not benefit from the increased crack spreads.","Third quarter RIN costs were approximately $35 million. The costs spiked early in the quarter before declining following the remarks from the EPA. RIN prices at the end of the quarter were approximately $0.50 per gallon. Recently, they have traded at $0.25 to $0.40 per gallon.","To help reduce the cost of meeting the renewable fuel requirements, we have developed a renewable diesel project, upgrading vegetable oil to diesel quality. This is a small project with start of production this month. At full capacity, it can reduce RIN purchases by approximately 15%.","Looking forward, negative pricing trends have continued into October. Ethylene spreads are very weak, facing significant pressure on industry benchmark spreads. The chart on the lower left provides some perspective of the decline. Given an oversupplied gasoline market, we expect the fourth quarter to be another difficult quarter.","Given this challenging environment, we are taking actions to improve profitability. Among these actions have been the diversification of our crude supply and broadening of the refinery operating window. We currently have access to some discounted Canadian crudes and during the second half of 2014, we should see a significant increase in availability.","In addition, we have enhanced our sulfur light ends [ph] and aromatics' operational capabilities. We have also reduced our fixed cost by approximately $30 million and our working capital by $200 million during the past 3 years. We have taken actions to reduce the impact of increased renewable fuels costs, both through the export of finished fuels and implementing the renewable diesel project.","We believe that we're taking the right steps and in the future, the benefits of our action should become more visible.","Before I wrap up my prepared remarks, I'd like to spend a few minutes updating you on the status of our expansion projects. We're in an exciting period during which we will bring several growth projects to fruition. In fact, over a 30-month period, we will complete a major project on average every 6 months. Slides 13 through 16 provide an update on the program and the individual projects. These figures represent our current thinking on timing, cost and benefit. The projected benefits are based on the last 12 months' average industry benchmark margins, which, of course, are not always indicative of future margins.","Collectively, these projects represent an increase of approximately $1 billion of annual EBITDA at these conditions.","Since first discussion of these projects at Investor Day, we have advanced project definitions and cost estimates. We currently estimate that the cumulative cost of these projects has increased by an estimated 10% to 15%. There's been a similar 10% to 15% increase in benefits, as both ethylene and methanol margins have increased. The projects remain on schedule.","I'd like to provide a quick update on each project. The Wesseling butadiene expansion is complete and operating. Project economics were protected by our contracting strategy and the inclusion of minimum margins.","Methanol restart is 90% complete. We expect to mechanically complete the project this quarter. We expect that we will reach full operating capacity during the first quarter of 2014.","The La Porte ethylene expansion is well underway. All major equipment is expected to be on-site by year end. We will complete the project during the second quarter 2014 turnaround.","At Channelview, the furnaces have been ordered, the foundations poured and we'll soon begin erecting steel. We plan to mechanically complete the project at the end of 2014 with the startup the first quarter of 2015.","The third ethylene expansion at Corpus Christi is in the permitting process. Long lead equipment will be ordered this quarter and construction will begin as soon as we receive our permits. Timing for completion is estimated to be late 2015.","The TexStar ethane fractionator project at Corpus Christi is also proceeding. This is not our asset, but we will be a beneficiary of the project through more flexible ethane supply and pricing. As you can see from the picture, this project is nearing completion and TexStar plans a startup before year-end.","Our 220 million pound polyethylene debottleneck project is also proceeding with plans for completion during the first quarter of 2014. In 2014, we'll also be adding 2 lines of polypropylene compounding in Asia.","Overall, all of the projects are progressing well. We're facing some cost inflation, but a significant percentage of this exposure has been removed by our schedule and contracting strategies. We are well ahead of most competitors' projects, reducing the potential for construction delays and overruns.","There's a tremendous amount of activity underway. To put it in perspective, we're currently working with [indiscernible] firms and 7 construction firms. On a typical day, we have approximately 750 contractors on our sites working multiple shifts.","Let's turn to Slide #17, and I'll wrap up. The third quarter continued a trend of strong earnings. O&P-Americas and I&D businesses continue to benefit from cheap natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Refining segment has been difficult. We have taken actions to increase our operating flexibility and during the second quarter of 2014, we expect to have increased access to heavy Canadian crude.","During the October, business conditions have been similar to those experienced during the third quarter. The charts included in the presentation provide some perspective on benchmark margins. We expect the key trends that have driven our success to continue throughout the quarter, but I want to remind you that we will likely be subject to normal seasonality in some businesses.","This typically manifests itself in somewhat lower oxyfuel and C4 chemicals spreads, slower polyolefin sales during the holidays and potentially increased propylene glycol sales for the aircraft de-icing industry. Our team is on top of all the details, and we're excited about our growth projects.","But we haven't lost our perspective. Safety remains our top priority followed by reliable operations and cost management. We also recognize that, while our past results have been impressive, our future results are what really matter.","Thank you for your interest in LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take questions, Mary Ann.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, in your project chart, you mentioned the refining opportunity given Canadian -- discounted Canadian crudes. Is that still in that $200 to $300 range? And you mentioned you got some of those discounted crudes this quarter and for next year. What's the impact do you think nearer term and longer-term from discounted Canadian crudes?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, David, we don't have new capital per se that will be required to bring that Canadian crude on. Basically, we have reserve capacity in certain pipeline projects that are expected to start up midyear next year. Maybe something in the neighborhood of 75,000 plus barrels of additional Canadian crude will come down and we'll see what the crack spreads are at that point in time but it should be a nice positive for our refining results.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","[indiscernible] is the PO JV in China still on track for 2016?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, we're still working there pretty hard. We're in the process of negotiating final agreements and so that's tracking along.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Nocella of RBC Capital Markets.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions on cash. You have $4.4 billion of cash in the balance sheet, which is the highest in 2 years and you generate over $1 billion a quarter. So is it reasonable to assume here maybe a little bit higher regular dividend and maybe special dividend at some point? And then second, the total debt to LTM EBITDA is 1x, which is below your peers. What do you view there as a good normalized leverage target maybe a little bit longer-term?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Let's see, we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion. However, you do need to take into consideration that $1.5 billion of that balance is a result of the bond offering that we've done -- that we did this quarter. So therefore, from a timing perspective, we do have higher cash balances than we historically carry. So the bond proceeds are a big part of the source of that cash and that's really purely timing related. However, you do need to consider the potential use of this cash over the next few quarters. So if you extrapolate the rate at which we're funding our buybacks today, not to infer that, that is what we're planning, but if you look at it in that context, coupled with funding of our growth projects, there's a real quantifiable potential use of that cash over the next few quarters. But in terms of targets, in terms of our overall leverage or cash targets, there's absolutely no targets. That will depend on the cash needs coupled with future cash flow generation profile. We're generating a significant amount of free cash flow, as you've indicated, but we're also returning a significant amount of cash directly to our shareholders. And if you look at our current run rate, it's $1 billion to $1.25 billion a quarter, which, obviously, is a significant use of that cash as well. In terms of overall leverage, we'll continue to look at our balance sheet. We're going to be prudent, methodical and opportunistic, just as we have been in this third quarter whereby we've significantly increased our leverage around 35%.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And Jim, you mentioned that capital costs have crept a little higher for some of your projects in the Gulf Coast. Where are you seeing the inflation in this? And is this something that is company specific? Or is this a bigger industry issue you think?","James L. Gallogly","This is a bigger industry issue. You see wage inflation that's fairly significant on the Gulf Coast right now due to a variety of projects that are starting to go into engineering. Our projects are actually in construction. And in a number of instances, we've done lump sum type bids on particular pieces of equipment. So we have very good visibility into where we think our project costs will end up. As I said, there's always some risk of productivity slowdown, we're on-site, or a little bit more wage inflation. But we've added that into our latest estimates, and we're feeling good about our projects. I think the key is that we're so early compared to our competition and that should give us a substantial benefit. I personally think if it's starting to get tight today with the few number of projects that are actually in construction, you should expect that to really ramp up a few years from now. So we're feeling good about being early movers.","Operator","Our next question is from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, a couple of questions. One, you've got a very nice cadence of CapEx projects coming in that you laid out on Slide 13. When you think forward and let's just say that oil and gas stay where they're at today, what would that cadence look like if we looked out, say, 2016 to '19, will there be another slug of similar size over that 4-year period that could deliver maybe another incremental $1 billion or so of EBITDA?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we haven't announced anything yet, Duffy. As you may know, we start working on projects that would be announced in that time frame, about now, start talking to third parties, negotiating deals, that kind of thing. And so we're not ready to discuss those future projects. But as you would expect, we're working on our future growth opportunities today. Nothing to announce yet.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then we've had INEOS talk about potentially keeping Grangemouth open now with what would be a second deal around exporting ethane from the U.S. to Europe. What are your general thoughts about that becoming a bigger trend? Others, other than INEOS, maybe some of the Asians getting involved, is that a risk or a serious risk, I guess, us to our ethane pricing here the U.S.?","James L. Gallogly","No, I think, Duffy, that you're going to see a limited amount of ethane exported like that. In fact, if you read those headlines closely, I think they've asked for some subsidy to help bring ethane into the site to make it more competitive. There's been negotiations going on in the press in that site, so I don't particularly want to comment about its future. But, obviously, there's a fair amount of margin pressure on certain sites in Europe and that's why we continue to work the cost so hard. And I think if you look at our European Olefins & Polyolefins performance compared to our peer group, we're leading the pack. So we work the costs. We try to run differentially and try to make a bit of money opportunistically. I don't think there's going to be a lot of ethane pressure, although I have historically said that propane costs should come up as more export facilities are available. Propane inventories are still pretty high at the moment, but you have seen exports increase. And I think over time, the percentage of propane as a heating value to crude oil will continue to march up.","Operator","Our next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe, Jim, you can expand on those comments and just speak specifically to your sort of outlook on ethane S&D going into 2014 and I guess, my particular question is just what the probability is, you think, of breaking natural gas parity in 1Q maybe as some of the new pipes make more product available in Mont Belvieu?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Well, right now, things look very good for ethane. Inventories are still high and everybody is running and the prices haven't increased. So that feels very good. There is always a possibility that ethane could trade below its heating value with natural gas and I've seen various studies on that. At particular moments, I think that's probable. But longer-term, based on what we're seeing today, it seems that will trade around parity with natural gas. We'll just have to see. I don't want to predict that it will stay under for a long period of time, but when people are in turnarounds and all, there will be a lot of pricing pressure. Well, you can see that in the first quarter, sometimes in the fourth quarter over the years.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up, how are you thinking about the refinery strategically? I mean, maybe now is not the best time given where it is in the cycle. But as part of the overall portfolio, how should we be thinking about that over the next several years?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Well, as I said, our refinery results this quarter are disappointing. We had lost profit opportunities that would have improved our results by about $30 million. That should not be a continuous trend. As you've seen over the last couple of years, we have improved our operations, our run rates. So that's a bit of a blip. But we still don't like it. Refining margins are very pressured and as a result, the assets out of sold have traded for very, very low values. We'll always continue to look at our strategy and our portfolio and if at a later point in time, it makes sense, somebody offers us more money than that asset is worth in our mind, we always -- that's true of any asset we have, we would consider a strategic transaction. But for now, our focus is let's get it running right, let's improve the profitability and there will be a better day.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Neal Sangani on for Bob. There's been a sizable differential open up between Texas and Louisiana spot ethylene, can you explain how that flows through the business and the downstream margins?","James L. Gallogly","Sure. Well, you're absolutely right that there has been quite a change in spot. Today, NTP, the last settlement, around $0.46 and spot is just slightly above that at Belvieu. On the other hand, Louisiana, it's closer to mid-$0.60 range. And so there is a very, very big difference. That's driven by a couple of significant factors. One, Williams being out; and second, the Evangeline pipeline repairs that are taking months. And so that's kind of upset the normal conditions and so there is a significant short on the Louisiana side and, unfortunately, we can't get ethane -- or ethylene to them from Belvieu. So that's had a near-term impact. Now having said that, we have sold less spot volumes for a couple of different reasons. One, as I mentioned, we're running our metathesis unit, my making nice margins in that, so less need to move spot. And secondarily, we have a big turnaround coming next year and we'll opportunistically put some ethylene into inventory and prepare for that.","Neal Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then your efforts to lighten the feed slate in Europe, are those mostly complete or is there still more you can squeeze out to crack more LPGs?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think there's more we can do, a couple of very small capital projects to increase some flexibility. As I mentioned, the opportunity in the third quarter was less than in the second quarter. As you know, butane in the winter months doesn't trade to the advantage that it does sometimes in the summer. And propane moved up a bit. So with those 2 factors, we weren't able to make the same margin. We'll watch it very closely. We could improve it a bit. I think you saw in the second quarter we did have higher rates than 40%. And particularly at Berre, France, we've opened up that operating window quite a bit and we'll continue to look at Wesseling. We're renegotiating some feedstock supply agreements that will give us more flexibility. So more to come in Europe.","Operator","Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, you've been rightly concerned about propane prices going up and I think you mentioned propane to be about 15% of your feedstocks. Can you tell us how low can you go on propane? And then, secondly, do you plan to keep running your metathesis unit going forward?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we could go materially lower on propane if we needed to. There's other things we can do to fix the back end on that, some of that around condensates. So we watch that pretty closely. We could go lower. We prefer to crack as much ethane as possible. Now we need to recognize in this quarter that we had Clinton down and that's why it looked like we cracked less ethane. So that's almost a purity ethane cracker and so the ratios went down a little bit. Propane is not as preferred as it was. So we can go a bit lower on that. The second part of your question, again, P.J.?","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was talking about the metathesis unit and do you plan to keep that running?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, we campaign the metathesis unit based on where the propylene values are. And when propylene prices are high and given the ratio of ethylene to propylene, we'll run that in double dimer mod and have a pretty nice return off of it. And that makes sense to do that right now and especially given where spot ethylene is. It just gives us another dial that we can use to increase our profitability. So we'll campaign it.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just secondly, on your Intermediate business, can you talk about your MTBE contribution? And then I think for the first time, Jim, you talked positively on styrene. Is that something -- is that a trend that we should expect going forward?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I'd like to talk about styrene first because it's such a nice thing to talk about. It's very seldom that we have a couple of quarters in a row of nice styrene earnings. And what some of the people are actually beginning to say that supply and demand are pretty balanced and with a little bit of operating upset here or there or somebody in turnaround, that profitability is there. So we think styrene could be a reasonable contributor going forward. And you don't see a lot of new capacity coming on. So overall, we think that's a commodity that's -- we're going to see more profitability from. Is it a long-term trend? I don't know, but we have a couple of quarters of nice results and it's feeling better. In terms of MTBE, well, last year, we had some very remarkable numbers. This year is more typical. Gasoline values are low right now so you see some pressure on MTBE prices but we've had another really solid year of oxyfuels results. And of course, we're the industry leader in oxyfuels, #1 in competitive position. So it's been a good business. We'll see some seasonality, but we expect that to continue to be a nice contributor going forward.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, just a follow-up on propane. It seems there are quite a few moving parts. You have rising costs, your feedstock flex capability and then you have your metathesis flywheel. So if you boil all that down, what impact, if any, did you experience from rising propane costs in the third quarter versus the second quarter?","James L. Gallogly","Kevin, I don't think it was a very big story. It was -- the bigger story in our O&P margins was simply Clinton being down. And we finished that turnaround basically on time and on budget. It was as we expected. And so -- and propane pricing increased a bit. It just didn't have a significant impact, again, because we have different dials we can turn and we worked around it very neatly and made some money in metathesis.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow-up on the spot ethylene market. It's such a thin market versus the contract market. But I think it can often be a component or a starting point for some of the contract ethylene negotiations. So given the dislocations out of Evangeline and so forth, how do you see the ethylene contract playing out as the quarter progresses? Is it going to be a big factor in terms of the spot market action or will people look past it more so than normal?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think I always try not to publicly state where I think NTP is going to turn out. So I won't do that. But I'll just tell you that we're running hard right now and at full capacity and everything is moving. So there's still plenty of pressure. You've got to watch and see what's happening in PVC and a few others things when you start talking NTP. But in terms of volumes and all, we're doing great. And I think there's going to be some people trying to build inventories for turnarounds next year. There's going to be quite a few of them. I think there'll be some people trying to not sell the spot, to build some inventories, which should keep things pretty tight.","Operator","The next question is from Nils Wallin of CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","One thing that's been interesting in the last 2 quarters is that the polyethylene margin over ethylene has started to go positive. Just curious as to what your view would be on that going forward, if this was just a couple of quarter anomaly, or do you expect polyethylene margins over ethylene to be positive in the next year or 2?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we're seeing really tight supply dynamics and most of the types of polyethylene here in the Americas right now, particularly high density. There've been some outages that have really put people in short positions and we're seeing really strong demand from our customers. And so that's been a plus. And then you have Louisiana out -- or I shouldn't say out, but short of ethylene, which puts a little more pressure on it going forward. So on the polymer side, it looks pretty good near-term.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And then just on the NGL portion, you only had about, based on my numbers, about 2% of your feed slate based on butane and during the quarter, at some point, butane costs were actually below propane. So I was curious as to what you thought of the relative cost differentials between butane and propane going forward? And how Lyondell can perhaps take advantage of those?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we watch our crack daily, I'd say, almost hourly. And so as things come in favor, we make quick, quick transitions. We've got a nice pipeline network where people manage that on an ongoing modeling basis, and they're looking at everything from the co-product values to what they can do in the spot market. So I would say that as those opportunities present themselves, we'll be all over it and have been.","Operator","Next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I'm curious if the Clinton shutdown affected local ethane prices for Morris? Was there a way to measure that sort of local elasticity from changes in demand?","James L. Gallogly","That gets pretty tricky to do, because one of the things that happens is sometimes other people know we're turning around, doing turnaround and so they're doing the same thing. And so it reduces the supply. So it wasn't a one-to-one translation. There was some benefit to Morris, but it was pretty modest.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that make sense. And then on that renewable diesel project that you've mentioned and its effect on RIN prices, was there any CapEx that's associated with that? And does that project make sense and I guess, how easy would it be to walk away from that if RINs come down materially in 2014 to the levels that maybe they were at in 2012? Or is that something that's going to be part of the portfolio long term?","James L. Gallogly","That was a very, very modest investment basically around a tank and being able to take vegetable oil in, so very, very, very modest and then we run it through a hydrotreater and -- it's simple. We could come in and out of it. It had almost an immediate payback at the prize of RINs at the moment. So it was a very easy decision to do, and we can run it or not run it based on where the RINs are.","Operator","Our next question is from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I apologize, you were talking before about running your refinery at a lower level to make a change that would benefit $5 million a month. Did I hear that correctly?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Basically, what I was saying is we were having difficulty with our vacuum unit. We had some trays that were fouled and we needed to get in. We had that condition for a while, and it got to the point we had to go in and do something about it, and so we did. Coming out with that condition eliminated, it should allow us benefit of about $5 million.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A month, correct?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, yes, and that's -- but again, that's just getting back to normal operations. It was a -- the vacuum unit has been fouled for a while and it just got worse.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. So if I look back over the past couple of quarters, that's probably one of the reasons why the Refining segment didn't do as well but going forward, we're going to see the benefit of that, correct?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, that's right. But I'll make the point that we've been disappointed over the last couple of quarters in our results. We had a lot of turnaround work at the beginning of the year. But we're better than that in Refining. And I've explained that to our team. We pride ourselves in being the top operators, not only in the chemical industry, but in refining. And we haven't lived up to our personal expectation of ourselves lately. So I've challenged our team to get on the ball again and let's get the numbers better. We're performing as an average Gulf Coast refinery but we don't like average.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's -- if I could have you to give a pep talk to my children, that would be awesome. Karyn, I noticed that the accrued liability's ticked up $500 million sequentially. I'm not sure, what's beyond that? What's behind that?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes, the primary reason for that is the dividend. So the dividend that we declared here in the third quarter was paid in October of this quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from has Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","One of the reasons cited for your sequential decline in EAI EBITDA was compressing core product values. Now, I just wanted to sort of hear your views about how you think core product value contribution to margins in, call it, Europe, Asia, would look like going forward? Obviously, a bunch of moving parts with regards to shift towards lighter feeds and implications on, call it, propylene and butadiene prices and the like. I mean, should we, relative to history, see the higher core product contributions to margins lower? I mean, how does that stack up in the near to medium term?","James L. Gallogly","I think propylene kind of has a world settling price. And while there's some dislocations from moment to moment based on incidents, or this or that, we've seen some of that in the United States recently, I think Europe has been more stable there. And, of course, we're monomer short in Europe, significantly monomer short. I think the bigger story will be butadiene and we've seen some incredibly low butadiene prices. It happened to be coincidental at the time we started up our unit but that didn't add enough capacity to cause that. It was just more of what was going on downstream. And we've seen some firming. We've seen some people talk about maybe some more orders being filled and as a result of that, we've see some price increases in butadiene and I think most people expect that to start firming again. A couple of years ago, the crack in Europe was almost carried by butadiene. And it since has become almost a negative in the crack. So some firming of butadiene will be good for us and I think it's a plus going forward. And we expect to see that.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","Fair enough. And a follow-up, if I may. I was just taking a look at Slide 13 with your growth projects, and comparing that with a presentation from, probably, a month ago or so, and one of the things missing was the sort of in-development row, where you had a possible new polyethylene line and olefins, NGL recoveries sort of line as well contributing, I'm going to say, $160 million to $230 million incremental EBITDA, so is that still sort of valid?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, those things are still working. We're just not in construction per se. Like, this list are things that you can see, steel and concrete, on the ground now. So that's why it was not in the list. But we're still working those things just like we were before.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","And your estimate of sort of EBITDA contribution is similar to that presentation I referred to?","James L. Gallogly","That's right.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, I had a question on RINs. Just looks like RINs were, I think, $0.25 in the first quarter, $0.50 in the second and I think you mentioned $0.35 in the third. So if the EPA proposal to cut the RFS to 13 billion or 13.2 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol next year, if that holds and RIN prices continue to trade lower, what would you see is the year-over-year tailwind in RIN costs going into 2014?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, well, they've -- RIN costs at the moment have come down on a lot. It's closer to that low end of the number I quoted, around $0.25. So that's significant. We were saying last quarter that it could be, at the high price, as much as a couple of hundred million dollar headwind to us and obviously, the prices have come down drastically since then. So it's a plus. It's hard to predict what the government's going to do, but the EPA has been saying the right things and hopefully, it will be less of a factor.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then, also a question on your methanol start up later this year. You'll be buying a lot more natural gas than you do currently. Is it your plan to just be a spot buyer in the markets? Or will you be hedging forward to try and lock in spreads on the methanol business? What's the whole approach to natural gas hedging?","James L. Gallogly","Right now, given where natural gas prices are, we like the position that we're in. And so we're not planning to do any hedging. We're coming into November and gas prices are still incredibly low, Henry Hub around $3.60, something like that. So we're fine with the gas prices, not planning to hedge. We're just anxious to get the unit running. We're on the cusp of being ready to mechanically compete -- complete it and hopefully, ramp it up pretty quickly. It's a 10-year-old unit; we recognize that. But we've been working it extremely hard and we're literally getting ready to start the thing up soon.","Operator","Our next question is from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is actually Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess just to -- first, to follow-up on your comments around methanol. Not to jump the gun and you haven't started up yet, but what kind of prospects would you have for either debottlenecks over time or kind of your inclination or interest in more methanol capacity?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, I was out there visiting with the team just a couple of weeks ago getting ready for the startup and making sure everything was ready to go, operators ready to run the unit and they were already talking to me about the possibilities they were seeing to debottleneck the unit. That's typical. We'll have to see the operating constraints but they're telling me that there's some [indiscernible] debottleneck opportunities once we get the thing running. Now, first and foremost, our priority was to get it running, not add capital to it and complicate the startup. But they said there's probably some pretty simple things we can do to ramp it up. Going forward, we'll keep an open mind toward additional methanol. The gas prices have been staying very, very low and other people have been talking about it. But, I think, the key thing about this unit was when you look at the capital cost of this compared to a newbuild, just remarkably low. And so that's why it's such a powerful investment for us.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just wondering why is JV income growing so fast? And can that continue?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think we've been running the Saudi operations a little better than we had before. There's still opportunities to run those assets better, frankly, and we're going to pay more attention to it. We are not the operators, but we don't run our joint venture units as well as we run our own units. We pride ourselves on operational excellence. But if we can move up those rates to something closer to what we do, there's still more potential there.","Operator","The final question comes from John Roberts of UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jim, would you hazard a guess at how high propane might go or how small its discount to its oil-based equivalent value might get?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I can kind of range it for you based on some history. I think, currently, it's about 44%, something in that neighborhood, I think. And if you go back to the 2000, I think it was about 80%. And 2004, 2008, maybe closer to 70%. So there's a possibility for it to move a fair amount. But there's got to be more export facilities that are coming online. There's quite a bit that's announced. There's people -- you've already seen significant more exports in this year compared to last year. But on the positive side, inventories are still high because there's been a lot of drilling success. So overall, it's a good story. Remember that it's $0.30, $0.40 per gallon shipping costs and then kind of do the math from there. And there's -- it's always going to trade at some discount because the transportation costs and all, depending upon where it's produced. But there's room for it to come up some more against crude oil.","Douglas J. Pike","I think that's the last question today and we're just about out of time. So I'm going to ask Jim to make a few comments and close the call off.","James L. Gallogly","Okay. Thanks, Doug. Just a few final thoughts. First, as I mentioned at the very beginning, we've had consistent quarter-over-quarter results and that's not representative of commodity businesses. We have strong operational results, still top decile in safety performance, very reliable operations. We did have 4 quarters in a row of above nameplate operations in U.S. olefins. We weren't able to achieve that again this quarter because we had the Clinton turnaround. We knew going into the quarter, we couldn't string 5 together. We got very, very close, if you take Clinton out, it was 98%. And so well above industry rates.","We're also very mindful of our costs. We're in the budget season at this moment in time, and my mantra is always flat to falling. We work these fixed costs hard, we're a margin business, we're very, very disciplined on costs and don't intend to give up any of the ground that we've gained so far. And in certain areas, we'll work those costs extremely hard given competitive pressures in Europe in refining.","We tried to emphasize on this call our significant growth profile. Basically, we have a new project coming online every 6 months for the next couple of years. And that's an exciting growth profile, nice earnings potential. Part of that is it's faster and cheaper than our competition. And we hope to have our projects paid for before the other people bring their assets online.","We have a very exciting future. We're generating a lot of cash. We've been providing that cash to our shareholders, both in regular dividends, historically special dividends and now, share repurchases. And we expect that we'll continue to perform very, very well quarter to quarter.","Thanks for your interest.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Kinney","Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's fourth quarter 2017 teleconference. I am joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO and Thomas Aebischer, our CFO.","Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I would also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com\/investorrelations.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com.","Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2:00 P.M. Eastern Time today until March 5, by calling 866-677-5199 in the United States and 203-369-3133 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 6549.","During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance, the current environment, our near-term outlook and then we will take a little time to provide you with an update on LyondellBasell's strategic progress.","Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market adjustments or LCM which we have discussed on past calls. As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and declines in prices of raw materials and finished goods inventories. While no LCM adjustments were recorded during 2017, LCM did affect results for prior years. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges.","With that being said, I would now like to turn the call all over to Bob.","Bob Patel","Thanks Dave. Good morning to all and thank you for taking the time to join our fourth quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide four and review the results we delivered during the 2017 and our progress in advancing our growth strategy. During last year's fourth quarter teleconference, we described how our work in 2016 to complete both an unusually heavy maintenance schedule and 20% expansion program for our U.S. ethylene capacity would lead to higher volume in 2017.","Our team overcame challenges from capacity additions in our industry and obstacles from Hurricane Harvey to deliver significant volume improvements and an 8% increase in EBITDA. Our profitability resulted in an 8.4% free cash flow yield and capital returns that exceeded the company's cost of capital by more than three times. LyondellBasell's shareholder returns in 2017 continue to surpass the strong growth of the S&P 500 and the S&P chemical index benchmarks.","During our Investor Day in April of 2017, we outlined our ambitions to build on our strengths and skills by adding value through organic growth and a disciplined pursuit of inorganic opportunities. Last year, we advanced organic growth by moving forward on two major greenfield capacity additions by expanding our global reach with a third compounding plant in China and by partnering with SUEZ on a venture for plastic recycling in Europe.","We improved our capabilities in readiness for growth with targeted investments in people to support increased activity for both organic project development and inorganic growth. We also applied our strengths in operational excellence to drive improved reliability at our refinery while extending our legacy technical innovation within our polymer businesses. Our strong 2017 results have a foundation in our core values which include a fundamental commitment to top-tier safety performance.","Turning to slide five. Our safety performance during 2017 continued to be among the best in our industry. Our employees had fewer injuries than any prior year in the company's history. In addition to a lower number of injuries, we saw significant reductions in the severity of environmental and safety incidents across our company. While I am pleased to see the improvements, we remain focused in our drive to capture the lessons learned from our experiences and work towards safety perfection. In addition to the obvious benefits for our employees, contractors and communities, we continue to believe that a consistent focus on safety cascade benefits throughout the company's operations, reliability and ultimately our financial results.","Slide six summarizes the improvements in our quarterly and annual results relative to 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 income and earnings per share increased primarily due to an $819 million one-time, non-cash benefit from U.S. tax reform that increased earnings by $2.07 per share. The quarterly EBITDA profile in the bottom of the slide reflects typical seasonal trends for our industry, with stronger results in the second and third quarters. Fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA benefited from volume and margin strength following third quarter inventory declines in the U.S. driven by Hurricane Harvey.","During our third quarter call, I mentioned that we would incur October impacts, primarily in our La Porte cracker from the effects of Hurricane Harvey and also that one of our German crackers incurred downtime during October. These events impacted fourth quarter results by approximately $100 million and $40 million respectively. EBITDA increased by 23% for the fourth quarter relative to the same quarter last year and 8% for the year relative to 2016. Year-over-year EBITDA improvements were driven by improved margins and increased volumes following our investments in maintenance and growth during 2016.","Slide seven shows how our team delivered on volume improvements during 2017 with 23 of our plans around the world setting annual production records. With a lighter maintenance schedule than 2016 and the completion of our U.S. ethylene expansion program, our global fleet of crackers produced 13% more ethylene in 2017. The improved monomer availability allowed us to run our equity derivatives at higher rates and increase polyethylene and ethylene upside volumes by 4%. Volumes could have been even higher if not for the disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey. Our focused maintenance and reliability efforts at the refinery increased 2017 throughput by 35,000 barrels per day, a 17% year-over-year improvement. I sincerely thank all of our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in delivering these impressive results.","And now Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights.","Thomas Aebischer","Thank you Bob and good morning to all of you. Please turn to slide eight which shows our fourth quarter and full year segment results. I am pleased to report that our Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment achieved the fourth consecutive year of record EBITDA. In 2017, we show an EBITDA improvement in four of our five segments. These results will be reviewed in detail during the segment discussion.","As mentioned by Bob, fourth quarter results include an $819 million one-time, non-cash tax benefit related to the passage of U.S. tax reform in December. This benefited fourth quarter results by $2.07 per share and full year results by $2.05 per share. Full year 2017 results also include a $106 million after-tax charge due to bond refinancing and the $103 million after-tax gain from the sale of our interest in the Geosel pipeline and storage system in France.","Please turn to slide nine which provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2017, we continued strong cash generation with $5.2 billion of cash from operating activities. Our capital spending was lower than anticipated for the year due to later timing for the final investment decision for our PO\/TBA plant and the classification of certain project related spending as intangible. During the first quarter of 2017, we took advantage of favorable markets and refinanced $1 billion of 5% notes due in 2019 with an equivalent amount of 3.5% bonds due in 2027. With this transaction, we also derisked refinancing risks in 2019. In the third quarter, Standard & Poor's raised LyondellBasell's senior unsecured debt to BBB+ from BBB. Our strong cash flow allows us to finish 2017 with a cash and liquid investment balance of approximately $3.4 billion, approximately $1 billion higher than the year.","Turning to slide 10, let's look at the evolution of our cash deployment over time. Our strong cash generation has allowed us fund both value creating growth project and returns to shareholders. Over the past five years, we have funded $8.3 billion of capital investments. Approximately 45% of this investment was allocated to profit generating growth projects. We have returned $22.9 billion through dividends and share repurchases over the past five years. We implemented our ninth dividend increase to $0.90 per share in the second quarter. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 189 million shares or approximately 33% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of 2017, we had repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares or 16% of the current 18 months share repurchase authorization that started in May 2017.","On slide 11, I would like to describe our current understanding of how U.S. tax reform will benefit LyondellBasell. We have already mentioned the $819 million non-cash benefit for 2017. This benefit arises from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities after new lower corporate tax rate. While this is a provisional estimate based on our current best understanding of the legislation, we do not anticipate any material adjustments over the coming year. In the middle chart, you will note that a substantial portion of our global income is earned in the U.S. As a result, in 2018 we expect our global effective tax rate will be approximately 21%. We do not expect any material impact from deemed repatriation, interest deductibility limit or the base erosion provision.","As we do every year, I would like to address some of your 2018 modeling questions. Regarding capital, we are currently planning to spend approximately $2.4 billion during 2018. This spending level advances both our base maintenance and growth program. Approximately 55% is targeted toward profit generating growth. The majority of this growth investment in 2018 will be dedicated to the new Hyperzone polyethylene plant and the PO\/TBA plant.","Although not all plants are finalized, we estimate capital spending to average $3 billion annually through 2022. Approximately 65% is targeted towards profit generating growth. The largest individual growth project in this period is, as we have talked about, PO\/TBA plant for which we obtained final investment decision in the first-half of 2017.","Our net cash interest expense for 2018 is expected to be approximately $375 million. 2018 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.2 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2018 that total approximately $110 million and we estimate the pension expense of approximately $65 million. As I a mentioned before, we currently expect the 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 21%., the cash tax rate is expected to be higher for 2018 due to payments covering higher non-U.S. income in prior years.","With this, I will now turn the call back to Bob for a discussion of our segment results in more detail. Thank you very much.","Bob Patel","Thank you Thomas. Let's turn to slide 12. In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, fourth quarter and full year results were supported by Hurricane Harvey supply constraints and strong global markets. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $784 million, $168 million more than third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $3 billion.","Relative to the third quarter, ethylene margins increased by $0.05 per pound. Despite some lingering disruption from Hurricane Harvey at our La Porte facility, our ethylene cracker operating rates remained strong during the quarter averaging 92%. 79% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 87% came from NGLs.","In polyolefins, combined results improved by approximately $40 million. During the quarter, our polyethylene price spread over ethylene improved by approximately 40.02 per pound. For the full year, results increased by $105 million primarily due to ethylene production volumes improving by 17% as we captured the benefits of our expanded capacity at Corpus Christi and the absence of planned maintenance.","Polyolefins results declined by approximately $70 million from the prior year as polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.05 per pound, partially offset by an increase in polyethylene spreads by approximately $0.02 per pound. During January, IHS is forecasting a decrease in polyethylene margin with some improvement by the end of the first quarter.","The U.S. Gulf Coast experienced unusually cold weather during the third week of January that caused disruptions across the industry. Our assets were also affected and we currently estimate that these disruptions will reduce LyondellBasell's first quarter results by approximately $45 million, with approximately two-thirds in O&P Americas and most of the remainder in intermediates and derivatives. In addition, we have planned maintenance on one of our two crackers at Channelview during the first and second quarter that is estimated to have a $100 million impact on results with approximately 50% of that occurring during the first quarter.","Turning to slide 13. Let's look at the forecast for the global ethylene industry. 2017 results support our view of a relatively modest reduction in operating rates over 2018 and 2019. Industry project delays coupled with supply constraints from Hurricane Harvey and Chinese reforms have improved the outlook for the next couple of years. Demand growth over the past six years has outpaced capacity growth resulting in extremely high operating rates, near 95% over the past two years. As new capacity comes online, operating rates will decline, however they are forecasted to remain in the mid low 90s.","Let's turn to slide 14 and review performance outside the Americas in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $356 million or $342 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, EBITDA was our fourth consecutive record, $2.3 billion, a $215 million increase versus 2016. Olefins results decreased versus the third quarter by approximately $100 million primarily due to lower margins resulting from increasing costs of raw materials.","As I mentioned in our third quarter call, we had an unplanned outage at one of our crackers investment in Germany in October. The value of lost production due to the upset impacted the fourth quarter by $40 million. Combined polyolefin results declined by $75 million as we experienced seasonal sales volume declines for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Olefins results for the full year increased by approximately $190 million over 2016. Margins improved with increased ethylene price.","With no planned maintenance in 2017, volumes increased following the completion of planned maintenance at two crackers in Europe in 2016. Our polyolefins results decreased approximately $50 million year-on-year, primarily due to decreased polyethylene spread over ethylene. During January, markets were relatively consistent with demand improving after the holidays. Within the industry, five European crackers are scheduled to be in turnaround during the first half of 2018. Consultants are forecasting approximately 9% of regional capacity will be unavailable during the second quarter. We will have planned maintenance on one of our European crackers in the second half of the year.","Now please turn to slide 15 for a look at the improvement in our intermediates and derivatives segment. Quarterly EBITDA has been steadily increasing with fourth quarter EBITDA At $410 million or an $8 million improvement over the third quarter. For the full-year, the segment generated EBITDA of $1.5 billion, a $157 million increase over 2016. 2017 marked a return to the historic levels we have typically seen for this business. The fourth quarter reflected a net result of seasonal declines in oxyfuel margins and volume improvements in PO and derivatives and oxyfuels as production returned to normal levels post Hurricane Harvey.","During 2017, the $157 million increase in EBITDA was largely due to margin improvement in PO and derivatives and intermediate chemicals relative to 2016. Oxyfuels and related products declined by approximately $60 million as volumes were restricted due to planned maintenance in the first half of 2017 and margins declined due to increased butane pricing. We expect to see continued strength in the market pulling into the first quarter of 2018. The strength in styrene and methanol margins will help offset these low volume declines.","Let's move to slide 16 for a discussion of our refining results. We have seen a positive trajectory in our operational improvement and margin capture in 2017. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $104 million, an improvement of $46 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $157 million of EBITDA, an improvement of $85 million versus 2016. During the fourth quarter, the majority of the increased profitability was provided by a benefit from last in, first out or LIFO inventory.","Relative to the third quarter, crude throughput improved by 5,000 barrels per day to 245,000 barrels per day. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark declined by $1.55 per barrel. However, we are able to capture margin improvement due to favorable heavy to light differentials in the crude oil markets. The cost of RINs increased by approximately $20 million.","During 2017, crude throughput averaged 236,000 barrels per day, up 35,000 barrels per day from 2016. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark increased by $1.32 per barrel and averaged $20.56 per barrel. The consistent improvement quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year in refining demonstrates our commitment to improve this asset's reliability and performance going forward. We look forward to stronger contributions from our refinery in 2018.","Slide 17 might be familiar to some of you from our April Investor Day presentation. In the time since our listing as a public company in 2010, we have established the culture, skills and systems required to build the next phase of value generation at LyondellBasell. We continue to focus on the foundational elements of operational excellence, cost discipline and prudent financial stewardship that created significant shareholder value over the past seven years. We aim to extend our reach and apply these capability and strengths across a larger set of assets.","Let's turn to slide 18 and review the plans for our organic growth pipeline. Over the past year, we have described the progress of our new Hyperzone high-density polyethylene plant and our next PO\/TBA plant. We also talked about two additional ethylene debottlenecks at Channelview, the first of which will start up in 2020.","Over the past year, we have also made selective investments in people to support additional project management and engineering teams to increase the cadence of these growth investments. Our pipeline of attractive projects is strong. It targets multiple value chains and our goal is to bring on new capacity that will grow EBITDA nearly every year. Our teams are moving forward with preliminary engineering, planning and analysis for these potential projects to reach final investment decisions. The initial projects to emerge from our pipeline include polypropylene plants in North America and Europe, build-or-buy scenarios for propylene monomer to support these expansions and an additional PE plant after our second Channelview ethylene debottleneck.","On slide 19, we have an update on the first project, our Hyperzone HDPE plant, which is under construction at our La Porte site which is near the Houston Ship Channel. As you can see in the photo, major components of the multi-zone reactor are already onsite and construction is proceeding on schedule. The charts on the left provide more insight regarding our selection of high-density polyethylene for this project over other types of PE.","With global demand growing at an annual rate of about 4%, the world needs approximately 12 new world scale, high-density plants over the three years from 2018 to 2020. Linear low and low density PE serve smaller markets with demand growth to support only 10 and four plants, respectively over the same time period. In addition, IHS is forecasting HDPE capacity additions equivalent to only seven new plants over the next three years, while linear low and low density appear to have some excess capacity in the short term. We believe that our new Hyperzone HDPE capacity is well timed to capture growing market demand with a projected startup date in mid-2019.","Slide 20 provides some perspective on the drivers for expanding our global polypropylene business. In 2017, global demand for polypropylene was approximately 150 billion pounds and growing at an annual rate of approximately 5%. Unlike the ethylene chain, no region has a clear feedstock advantage across propylene derivatives. After many years of industry capacity rationalizations and very little expansion, we are confident that new capacity is needed in both North America and Europe.","With approximately 17 billion pounds of global polypropylene capacity across our JVs and wholly owned plants, our leading position in PP technology and catalysts and almost three billion pounds of downstream polypropylene compounding capacity, we believe our company is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity across the value chain. In addition to building new assets, we continue to drive improvement on our existing asset base.","Turning to slide 21, I would like to highlight the great work by our team at the Houston refinery in improving the reliability and profitability of this asset over the past year. 2016 and the first quarter of 2017 were difficult times for our refinery due to high levels of both planned and unplanned maintenance downtime. I am pleased to say by rededicating ourselves and applying our deep institutional knowledge of operational excellence, the team achieved great improvements in our refinery performance in 2017.","The refinery achieved near nameplate crude throughput to capacity during the second quarter of 2017 and maintained strong operations for the remainder of the year despite challenges of Hurricane Harvey. Widening light-heavy crude differentials, coupled with strong diesel demand, has improved the market outlook for 2018. In early 2017, our refinery completed the investments needed to meet the new Tier 3 gasoline sulfur specifications.","As one of the largest heavy sour coking refineries in the U.S., LyondellBasell's refinery is well positioned to benefit from the new International Maritime Organization regulations that reduce the amount of sulfur in marine fuel oil. Refining consultants believe that these regulations could add several dollars to the Maya 2-1-1 refining benchmark, which could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars in additional profitability at our refinery. While we await implementation of the IMO regulations at the start of 2020, our refinery continues their trajectory to improve reliability and capture increased profitability. LyondellBasell's portfolio of refining and commodity chemical businesses have demonstrated resiliency across a dynamic environment, changing feedstocks, feedstock cost and economic conditions.","Slide 22 provides a perspective on the elements behind our results. LyondellBasell's two global O&P segments generated somewhat complementary results over the past five years. When Europe, Asia and International experienced higher naphtha feedstock cost during the periods of elevated crude oil from 2013 to 2014, the Americas segment continued to benefit from low-cost, shale-based NGL feedstocks and realized higher margins due to the upward global pressure on polymer pricing.","Conversely, the naphtha-based EAI segment improved margins under relatively low crude oil prices since late 2014 while American margins compressed. The complementary results provide a relatively stable earnings profile in the upper left chart, generating an average EBITDA of about $5.2 billion across our global O&P segments.","The more diverse portfolio of businesses within I&D, refining and technology, depicted in the upper right chart, also produced a stable earnings profile with an average EBITDA of approximately $2 billion. Our strategy aims to build upon the consistent overall results depicted on the bottom chart by continued growth and optimization of this business portfolio.","LyondellBasell continues to generate substantial cash flow and on slide 23, an illustrative chart describes our strategy for allocating these resources towards value-driven growth. The foundational priority of our strategy is ensuring that our existing assets continue to operate safely, reliably and profitably through investment in maintenance capital.","Next, we gradually increased our dividend yield since 2011 to achieve a top quartile level among our peers. We have committed to a progressive dividend that is sustainable through business cycles. As we built our project execution capabilities over the past five years, we have increased our investment in profit generating growth projects. As I discussed, we are increasing the cadence of this investment toward a more consistent growth profile targeting multiple value chains.","Since 2013, we have allocated the remainder of our cash flow and some incremental borrowing toward our $16 billion of share repurchases. The incremental borrowing was part of our debt recapitalization and optimization that ultimately reduced our cost of debt. We do not intend to borrow further to support repurchases, but continue to believe that our shares are undervalued relative to our peers. As such, repurchases will continue to play a role in our capital deployment strategy.","Finally, we maintain a strong balance sheet to preserve our capability to pursue any compelling and accretive inorganic growth opportunity that may arise at various points within business cycles. At the same time, we remain committed to maintaining the flexibility afforded by our investment grade credit rating.","As shown on slide 24, our thinking around inorganic growth continues to be focused on targets where the application of our strengths and skills can add value. As we outlined during Investor Day in April of last year, these opportunities typically overlap, extend or stood adjacent to our existing footprint in petrochemical process industries.","Let's turn to slide 25 and briefly consider the opportunities afforded by our rich history of innovation. LyondellBasell is the global leader in polypropylene compounding with almost three billion pounds of capacity at our JV and wholly owned plants in 18 locations around the world. This business develops innovative materials for interior, exterior and underhood applications that enable manufacturers to reduce vehicle weight by substituting polyolefin compounds for heavier and higher cost metals and engineering resins.","Our group works closely with both manufacturers of internal combustion engine vehicles and new electric platforms to pursue improved performance, fuel efficiency for EV range. LyondellBasell's compounds have a leading position with many vehicle platforms, including the Tesla Model 3. Compounding is a natural extension of our polypropylene value chain from technology to catalyst to polymer to colored compound.","Another example of our innovation capability is our new HDPE plant which will be the first facility to deploy our new Hyperzone technology. This represents a new application of a technology originally developed for polypropylene that differentiates and improves the properties and capabilities of polyethylene. Our Hyperzone technology improves the value proposition for our customers by offering the potential for improvements in processing efficiency and weight reduction while maintaining strength and durability.","I would also like to highlight our recent announcement to partner with SUEZ to manufacture premium recycled polyolefins. While small in scale, the venture answers an increasing call from many brand owners to source a portion of their polymer demand from recycled materials. We look forward to clearing regulatory approvals and closing the acquisition in the coming weeks.","In summary, let me distill our strategy to a few guiding principles depicted on slide 26. We understand what drives our core advantages and we will continue the benchmarking and continuous improvement that extends these leading positions. Our company has a resilient portfolio of businesses that can leverage geographic, feedstock and market diversity to achieve superior results.","Our increasing focus on growth will be guided by advantaged positions and where LyondellBasell's strengths create tangible value. The financial strategy is underpinned by assigning strong value and commitment to our investment grade credit rating. The aim of all of this is aligned with you, our owners, towards the delivery of consistent, top quartile shareholder returns.","Finally on slide 27, let me summarize our 2017 results and outlook. The hard work of LyondellBasell's employees drove volume improvement that captured opportunity in a strong global market. U.S. tax reform increased 2017 [ph] earnings and will continue to provide benefits for the company in the coming years. In 2018, we look forward to continuing the trajectory of improving reliability and profitability at our refinery while pursuing our strategy of value driven growth.","Before we open the line for your questions, please turn to slide 30. In March, we will again be holding a reception here in Houston for those of you who will be in town attending conferences that week. We will begin late in the afternoon on Wednesday, March 21 at our usual location, near our offices and the IHS conference venue. The reception will allow you time to interact with members of our executive leadership team. Please watch your e-mail for invitations or contact Dave Kinney for further details.","With that, we are now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets, you may go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Bob Patel","Good morning Arun.","Arun Viswanathan","First, on your ethylene and polyethylene outlook. On slide 13, you show an excess of seven billion pounds over the next couple of years for a 2% drop in operating rates. And you also mentioned that IHS has margin declines forecasted for January. But other consultants have actually settled January flat. The industry has a $0.04 per pound increase for February. So how do you expect these declines to play out? Is it more second half of 2018 phenomenon? And is there a possibility that delays in demand upside would result in limited price to margin compression over the next couple of years?","Bob Patel","Yes. So Arun, as we finished last year, the market still were quite balanced or tight as there was some recovery from the Harvey effort. Incrementally, the weather here in Houston in January did impact production, including ours, as I mentioned. So our sense is that the backdrop is perhaps even a little bit tighter than what folks had depicted when some of those publications came out.","And if you will recall, in our third quarter earnings release, I had described that typically in a given year, given seasonality in our business, most of the growth in a year happens in the first week orders of the year. So I suspect that we are going to have pretty firm market conditions through most of this year. And we will look for perhaps some weakness in Q4 when demand seasonally declines.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up, maybe you can just discuss your strategic priorities a little bit. There was limited buyback activity, it appears, in Q4 and Thomas mentioned M&A. So what are you thinking there? What are you seeing there? Is there any kind of time frame as to what you would want to get something done? Or how is that playing out? Thanks.","Bob Patel","Yes. So first, I would say, Arun, I wouldn't tie the two together. As I mentioned during my prepared remarks, when we think of our cash deployment priorities and our hierarchy, share repurchases continue to be firmly a part of that plan. So maybe I will turn over to Thomas to describe some of the tactics around how we engage in our share repurchase program to better explain how we go about things.","So Thomas?","Thomas Aebischer","Thank you, Bob. So we finished the year, obviously, very strong. We had a strong quarter. We had real strong cash generation in the fourth quarter. And as I have mentioned, the balance is $3.4 billion of cash, which actually is also very well balanced when you look at it from a business perspective. We have about 44% of our cash in Euro and 49% in U.S. dollars and very equivalent of how we are actually running the business. So we are very deliberate how we manage that position.","In terms of your question on share buybacks, as Bob has mentioned it, that we have an existing program. In May 2017, we approved another 10% of share buybacks. Out of that program in 2017, we have bought back about 16% of that particular program. The intention clearly is in our next AGM to get an approval of an additional 10%.","So having said all this, you also saw that in the fourth quarter, we have not had any shares purchased. But that's mainly related to the strategy. We have 10b5-1. You know how the process works. We are opportunistic and buy back opportunistically our shares. We commit on that 10b5-1 to a grid. The share price traded throughout the fourth quarter outside of that grid. That's virtually, in a nutshell, the explanation. But we are committed that this is one of the cash allocation strategic positions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Steve Byrne from Bank of America, you may go ahead.","Steve Byrne","Yes. Thank you. Just wanted to drill into your views on these Chinese reforms. How much polyolefin capacity in China do you believe has been curtailed in recent months due to some of the government initiatives there?","Bob Patel","Yes. Good morning Steve. I don't have a firm number on that. But I think there's been some impact in addition to the reduction in some of the recycling. So if you step back and look at polyethylene supply\/demand growth and kind of look globally, from 2017 to 2018, we are expecting that PE capacity is probably going to grow about 5.6% on a nameplate basis and HDPE is going to grow 4.1%, which is about equivalent to its growth rate annually.","So whether it's Chinese reforms, weather related issues here, I think all of it kind of nets out to very balanced market conditions for the foreseeable quarters and that we don't see this supply excess as being significant. And we are starting at very high operating rates. So I think all these things you mentioned, they all have incremental impact on that supply\/demand balance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","Vincent Andrews","Sorry. I was on mute. Thank you. Bob, I haven't heard you talk about feedstock prices, ethane, in particular and sort of what the outlook is for that as we move through 2017, maybe particularly given now that we have a nice high oil price and maybe some more associated gas production. So not to lead the witness, but what's your outlook for ethane for the year? Or maybe for next year?","Bob Patel","Good morning Vincent. So ethane kind of followed gas prices here recently. When you step back and look at the numbers, the last number that we have they had been published in November and it had the production of ethane was kind of the order of 1.6 million barrels per day, consumption was about 1.3 million barrels per day. So we still have more ethane production than demand.","And this is in a backdrop where propane and butane weren't really in the mix because they were quite expensive. So as we move through this year and as propane and butane prices moderate, I think that, combined with more ethane coming to market with new fracs and new pipelines from the Permian, we continue to believe that there's enough ethane nearby the Gulf Coast to supply the new crackers that will come online.","And if anything, as you mentioned, higher oil prices will likely increase the output of ethane, especially from the Permian. So we are watching it, but we continue to believe that ethane supply will be sufficient, if not in excess, as we move through the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. You may go ahead.","DonCarson","Yes. Thank you. Bob, a question on some of your growth plans. You mentioned that you are looking to secure more propylene. Can you sort of define how much you are looking to secure? And what would be the format? I notice you put a PDH plant on there. And while you have some experience running those in your joint ventures, PDH certainly hasn't been the most reliable way to source propylene lately. Would you look at another metathesis unit? Or what other options do you have on the table?","Bob Patel","Well, I think, for us, very frankly, PDH would be the leading case because with the metathesis it's sort of an optimization tool that we have. And it doesn't always run full. It depends on propylene relative to ethylene price. And I think some of the challenges that you mentioned on PDH is a couple of things.","One is, some of the most recent PDHs are the largest of their kind that have ever been built. So that brings complexity by itself. And much like ethylene crackers, that could take a bit of time to kind of iron out some of the bugs and work through on some of the startup issues. But the way we are kind of thinking about this is that we are a fairly significant buyer of propylene and if it's really kind of a make versus buy decision.","But I see us as continuing to be a merchant buyer of propylene even if we were to build a world-scale PDH plant. And in terms of operability, that wouldn't hold us back from considering PDH. I think it's just uniqueness because of the first and second of this kind in terms of scale that are being built today.","Operator","Thank you. David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank, you may go ahead.","David Begleiter","Thank you. Good morning. Bob, on your slide 18, detailing your cadence of new investments, I am struck by the lack of a new ethylene cracker. You only have a small expansion over the next eight years. And given your positive view of U.S. ethylene, why isn't there a greenfield ethylene cracker in the longer term horizon? Thank you.","Bob Patel","Yes. So David, we run early with our debottlenecks and so we focused quite a bit on ethylene over the last four, five years and so really now our focus is to consume more of that ethylene internally and convert it to polyethylene. I think we are still going to be a merchant seller of ethylene, but likely less so than we are today.","So when I think about sort of the opportunity set in front of us with more polyethylene potential given the amount of ethylene we have, a PDH polypropylene here, perhaps PP in Europe, continuing to execute our PO\/TBA, I think we have many other high return opportunities before we would consider a new cracker. I do think at some point we will undertake the analysis on that and it's just more a matter of phasing.","And also I like the fact that our organic growth program is targeting multiple value chains. So we have ethylene, polyethylene, propylene, polypropylene and propylene, PO\/TBA. So it gives us some diversity, if you will, as well in terms of our growth program.","Operator","Thank you. Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners, you may go ahead.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes. Good morning. Bob, with regard to the refinery, each quarter improved as 2017 progressed. Meanwhile, with the reduction in tax rate, one would think that separation could result in a lower tax bill than you might have thought last time around. So in that context, can you update us on your strategic thinking as it relates to the refinery?","Bob Patel","Yes. Good morning Kevin. Our focus has really been on improving the operation. We know we can run better and we demonstrated that last year. In fact, it was one of the few assets that ran through the hurricane even if at reduced rates. So we are firmly focused on that. We see the IMO opportunity getting closer. There's a wide-ranging set of views around how it will impact light-heavy differentials, but this is a really premier asset with significant scale and in the amount of sour crude processing capability and coking capacity we have.","So we are just going to focus on running it reliably and let's see what this IMO opportunity brings. We think there's some upside. And as the year progresses and we get towards the end of the year, I think we will have even more visibility about the magnitude of that upside. So frankly, that's our focus today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Just have a two-part question. The first is, how much does your cash tax rate go up in 2018? And what happens to the cash tax rate in 2019? And secondly, in table 11, you isolate your pension settlement charge for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $58 million, but I think you took a charge of $20 million this quarter but you haven't isolated that as an item. Why is that?","Thomas Aebischer","Thanks for the question on the tax rate. So the cash tax rate, as I have said in my prepared remarks, for 2018, we expect, if you start with an ETR of 21%, the guidance we have given, the rate from that guidance of 21% will be effective tax rate on the cash tax rate we are expecting somewhere in the area of three to five percentage points higher cash tax rate. The reason why this has mainly to do with taxes into some of the European countries, especially Germany, now where we pay actual taxes now in 2018 taxes for years of 2015, 2016 and also 2017. So that's the main driver for the higher tax rate.","Obviously, your question is absolutely correct. Now looking to future years, 2019 and the years beyond that, we expect the cash tax rate to be clearly below the 21%. So 2018 is an exceptional year due to the reasons I have explained and in 2019 and years thereafter, cash tax rate below the 21% of ETR.","And on the pension charge, yes, that's correct. So we had a pension charge in December of 2017, also related to Germany, the reason for that charge was it's a multi-employer pension plan. And we had some of it is due to reduction of the discount rate that impacted it. And we also had pension settlement charges where we took advantage from lump-sum payments in 2016 and you have mentioned that correct amount too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. You may go ahead.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you. Moving to EAI, can you talk about how MTO dynamics are impacting you in China and I guess also in intermediates and derivatives? And related to that, could you talk about the naphtha price outlook and your use of advantaged feedstocks in Europe going forward?","Bob Patel","Yes. So good morning Jim. On MTO, certainly, given where global operating rates have been in ethylene, MTO continues to be the last increment of supply for Asia and therefore for the rest of the world. And you can see that evidenced in ethylene prices over in Asia. And to the extent that there's a delta between that and naphtha based cost, it certainly affords EAI a reasonable margin in terms of ethylene.","And you rightly point out the tie to our intermediates business. As there's a call on the methanol, we see methanol values rise and margins rise. So there's a dual benefit for the MTO being in the money. As we look into 2018, our sense is, given that operating rates are so high that during seasonally strong periods, likely MTO is still going to be needed in a very meaningful way. And so I would expect that continue.","Operator","Thank you. P.J. Juvekar from Citi, you may go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Bob Patel","Good morning P.J.","P.J. Juvekar","Bob, on slide 13, you show your effective operating rates remaining close to 95% through 2020. My question is, can the global system run at 95% effective rate day-in and day-out, given the age of the plants, et cetera when we just saw that temperatures dropped in the Gulf Coast and the six plants went down? So where do you think global system can run sustainably? Thank you.","Bob Patel","Yes. Thank you, P.J. I think at these levels, it's been difficult to sustain. And as you think about new, very large crackers starting up, much like I described with PDH, there's a lot of challenge in the ramp-up. They are very, very capable companies who have undertaken these expansions, but they are very complex process units. And so I suspect, as we have seen in the past when operating rates have been this high or stayed this high, markets are very sensitive to small unplanned outages as there's not enough margin.","So I think the consequence is, first of all, MTO will be needed more consistently. Secondly, you could see a propensity for ethylene prices to rise when there's some unplanned downtime. And so we will just kind of have to watch that. But that's been our point the last couple of years that we don't really see a large drop in the operating rates. And when you are in the mid-90s like we are today, even if you are at 93% for a year, during seasonal peak periods, you are actually running in the upper 90s. So we consider that to be a very tight market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. You may go ahead.","Frank Mitsch","Good morning gentlemen.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Frank Mitsch","I wanted to follow-up on the share buyback. I just wanted to make sure that I was understanding this correctly. So you set up a 10b5-1 plan so that you can buy back stock regardless if you were in possession of material nonpublic information. And it was predicated on where the share prices were trading. And you set that price at a level where you were interested in buying the stock was lower than where the shares were trading throughout Q4. And so that's why there was no shares bought back during the quarter?","Bob Patel","Well, so Frank, what we do is we, Thomas and I, sit together and we kind of look at where the current share price is, what's our expectation for cash flow and we set up a grid that, again, allows us to accomplish our objective of being opportunistic. And then we let that run its course. And then again, as we are doing currently, we are evaluating the next 10b5 plan. So yes, generally, you are correct.","Operator","And our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Bob, you mentioned that CapEx would have about $3 billion through 2022 per year. So you are starting with $2.4 billion this year. How do you imagine the ramp? And as a second part of this question, does this $3 billion average assume that most or all of the projects on the slide 18 actually get executed?","Bob Patel","Yes. So the ramp will be in 2019 will be pretty close to $3 billion and in 2020 will be at $3 billion or a little above. It assumes most of those projects go forward, yes. And what drives that number today is our PO\/TBA project is a fairly significant investment. So as we get into the construction and sort of the peak of the spending for that project, which will be 2019 and 2020, that drives those numbers. And then you will see those come off in 2021 even though we are going to continue with these other projects. The PO\/TBA project by itself is pretty significant.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. You may go ahead.","Hassan Ahmed","Good morning Bob.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Hassan Ahmed","Obviously, we have seen propane prices going up recently. And obviously, they have taken up propylene prices as well. So my question to you is, on the naphtha-based ethylene margin side of it, do you see this being a sustainable sort of boost for naphtha-based ethylene margins, number one? And number two, how should we also think about this as an input for you guys on the polypropylene side of things?","Bob Patel","So first of all, Hassan, I think part of the driver for the polypropylene price increase has been some of the challenges on startup of a couple of very large PDH units here and one of those companies is a merchant seller of propylene. So I think that's been a pretty significant driver of propylene prices in the very near term.","Propane prices coming up certainly contributed to some of that. I think propylene, as it has been recently, will continue to be somewhat dynamic in terms of price. And it doesn't really affect our thinking in terms of our new polypropylene plant because if you think about if we do build PDH and we are thinking about propane to polypropylene essentially and if I think around the propane side of that equation with the Permian ramping up, more ethane, more NGLs, we think there's going to be lots of propane. And we think that the PDH-based polypropylene can be economical here in the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. You may go ahead.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning. A question just around the M&A opportunity. The projects you show come in somewhere around four to five times EBITDA. You guys trade a little bit over seven. It doesn't look like there's anything in the market that would kind of sell in the private market anywhere close to that. So if you do a deal, what should we expect to see from an EBITDA multiple? And then would it be higher than where you trade then with synergies you get lower? Or do you think you can actually buy stuff that's cheaper than your multiple currently?","Bob Patel","Duffy, the ultimate goal is about value creation for the long term. And I know those words are easily said. But look, I will tell you, we are focused on that. When we think about whatever it might be and we think about synergies, we think about cost, operational synergies. And I will tell you very frankly, we are well positioned today with our cash position, with the balance sheet and so on. I don't feel that we have to go do something right now.","You are going to see us continue to be patient, be value minded and think about how do we apply our strengths to create value. And the kind of position we have today, it affords us a lot of flexibility going into whatever sort of market environment exists. So I don't feel the urge that we have got to go out and do something because we have all this flexibility. And I don't think you should expect that that is going to change anytime soon. We will again be very value-minded.","Operator","Thank you. Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein, you may go ahead.","Jonas Oxgaard","Hi. Good morning guys.","Bob Patel","Good morning.","Jonas Oxgaard","Bob, you were talking about the supply, but can you talk a little bit on the demand side? It looked like demand was surprisingly strong last year and now with the impact of Chinese recycling, it looks even stronger. What are you seeing in the marketplace? And how are you thinking about it for the next year or two?","Bob Patel","Jonas, we are seeing very good demand at the moment. And if you think about last year, especially in the U.S. with first of all, in polyethylene in a tight market had a very, very strong year because of more onshore oil and gas drilling and so on. Industry exports actually declined significantly in 2017 from the U.S. And certainly for our company, they declined dramatically.","So if you assume that global demand for high-density polyethylene, for example, grows at 4%. Typically, given that there's a lot of packaging and things that are more nondurable in nature, I actually think that there's a potential for even higher growth catching up from last year's constrained environment from a supply standpoint. And from the U.S., because we had to cut back so much on exports, I think getting back to more traditional or more recent averages on exports in the U.S., that creates demand for U.S. based production.","So I am quite constructive. And as I cited some of those statistics, supply growth for high-density polyethylene is about 4%, 2017 to 2018 and demand growth, I think, should be at least that. So I think we are going to see pretty good conditions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. You may go ahead, sir.","John Roberts","Thanks. Bob, the next wave of shale-based chemical investments, whether in the olefin or methanol chains has a number of projects that have been sitting on the shelves. Do you think the current expensing of CapEx that begins next year will cause some acceleration in the groundbreaking of the projects industry-wide? Or do the lead times required and engineering constraints just make that unlikely?","Bob Patel","Yes. So John, it's a great question and one that I have been asked in different forums. I can't speculate what others will do, but I will tell you how we are thinking about it. I continue to encourage my team to think about the investment logic and sort of why we would build something. And I think tax reform, it might add to returns. It's not the reason to undertake organic growth because it could change frankly. And as you rightly point out, the cycle is somewhat long in terms of building.","So from LyondellBasell standpoint and from my standpoint, there's got to be solid investment logic and we would think about undertaking this investment in the prior tax regime or in the new one. And so we will have to see how that plays out. But even if some of the capital spending increases, we are probably looking at five years from now or so before we see capacity hit the market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead, sir.","Bob Koort","Thanks very much. I appreciate you guys going long to get the questions in. Bob, your large North American peer opined yesterday that maybe this Chinese recycling ban wasn't really going to affect virgin PE growth rates and that scrap might end up somewhere else and get reprocessed. Have you seen any impact from that at all or do you think it's not really that relevant in the grand scheme of things?","Bob Patel","Well, I think, Bob, in the near term, we haven't seen anything, but I do think that some of it will get dislocated and move to other countries. But that takes time and there's a bit of a space or a lag in between what's happened in terms of regulations in China and where that product shows up.","The other thing I would mention is that, I think globally there's more scrutiny on the quality of recycled resins. So I think it probably provides some tailwind here in the next 12 to 18 months until that ends up somewhere else or a part of it does. And that's the period where we are seeing more capacity. So I think directionally, it probably still helps us.","Thomas Aebischer","Yes. Bob, I think you have to consider that the recycling industry in China took nearly a decade to build up. And so that won't happen overnight somewhere else. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. You may go ahead.","Matthew Blair","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to gauge your interest in the idea of ethylene exports out of the U.S. Your long ethylene and U.S. ethylene trades at a discount to other regions. So I guess, how do you weigh the advantages of a long-term shipping commitment for ethylene versus the option of building out more ethylene derivative capacity?","Bob Patel","Yes. Good morning Matthew. And I am sure you are referencing the announcement that came out earlier in the week. I think generally, from an industry standpoint, I kind of look at it as, it's another derivative that's being built for ethylene. So I think that's directionally good. For our company, we would see a terminal like that as being opportunistic. And we might engage through the stock market to do some of that.","Today, I don't know that we would participate on a structural basis in something like that. Our focus is on supplying some of our strategic ethylene customers here in the U.S. and directionally building out more polyethylene capacity.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may go ahead, sir.","DanRizzo","This is Dan Rizzo, on for Laurence. The opportunity you guys mentioned in compounding, are you planning solutions for specific models? And can these compounds be applied to other end-markets?","Bob Patel","Yes. So on the compounding, our focus has been in auto, in polypropylene compounding and generally, the direction is for lightweighting of vehicles. And we sit with OEMs and we discuss what's possible. And that's been our focus. And if you think about it, we are able to then develop polypropylene and catalysts that enable the compounds which lightweight vehicles. So that's our focus. I do think, to your point, that that methodology can translate to other segments and our capability is certainly there.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. It would be my pleasure to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bob Patel for any closing comments. Thank you, sir.","Bob Patel","All right. Well, thank you, again, for all the great questions. Let me offer a few closing remarks. I hope what you see today is that our strategy and approach remains focused and consistent. Markets are tighter than we anticipated as we enter 2018 in a good position to accommodate the capacity additions across our industry. At LyondellBasell, our focus is, first and foremost, on safe, reliable, cost efficient operations. That earns our position as a supplier of choice for our customers for today and tomorrow. We are building out our organic growth pipeline, as I described. We are targeting multiple value chains. And our next investment will start up in the middle of next year in 2018. We are working diligently to pursue value driven growth for you, our owners. So thank you very much for your interest and we look forward talking to you again soon.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.

Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide 4, and review the highlights from the third quarter. Our third quarter diluted earnings were $2.31 per share with EBITDA of $1.6 billion.","Overall, third quarter business trends developed as we expected. During the quarter, olefin chain margins continue to be healthy, most notably, excellent results in our European Olefins & Polyolefins business, demonstrated the strength of our global portfolio. Despite the significant planned maintenance and the Americas, the combined Olefins & Polyolefins results were $1.3 billion, relatively unchanged versus second quarter.","While our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well, there was planned downtime in these operations and unplanned downtime in our Refining segment. Based upon industry benchmark margins, the value of third quarter loss production due to planned and unplanned outages across the company is estimated to have been approximately $285 million.","Slide 5 reflects our continued outstanding safety performance. Our results here today have remained steady despite performing an unusually high amount of maintenance.","Thomas, will discuss our financial highlights for the third quarter.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you both, and good morning from Rotterdam. On slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. Combined Olefins & Polyolefins continue to generate good quarter results with $1.3 billion of EBITDA and $5.3 billion during the last 12 months.","The Intermediates & Derivatives segment third quarter EBITDA was approximately $300 million, and $1.3 billion over the last 12 months. Utility supply and other operational upsets resulted in a loss at the refinery. Technology continued to perform well at last 12 month's pace of approximately $270 million. Overall, despite ongoing maintenance and refinery upsets, year-to-date earnings are near a $7 billion annual pace.","Please return to slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the third quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations. We utilized $1.2 billion for dividends and share repurchases. Our maintenance and growth capital investments were approximately $590 million during the third quarter with a significant portion of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion, and the turnaround at our Morris, Illinois facility.","During the third quarter, cash and liquid investments decreased by approximately $420 million to end with a balance of $2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, quarterly cash generation and spending trends were relatively similar to the third quarter pace.","The $2.1 billion ending cash and liquid investments balance remains above our minimum requirement. Slide 8 provides a longer perspective of cash flow as well as some current financial metrics.","I will just mention a couple. First, our last 12 month's cash flow was approximately $5 billion with free cash flow off the CapEx of approximately $3 billion. With respect to share repurchases during the third quarter, we purchased 10.3 million shares, bringing the year-to-date purchases to 7%. 2016 CapEx spending is trending above our forecast of $2.1 billion.","With that, thank you for your attention, I will turn the call back to Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 9, and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will exclude the impact of the LCM inventory charges.","In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, third quarter EBITDA was $682 million, a decline of $72 million versus the second quarter. Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results increased by approximately $15 million. Ethylene prices and margins increased, while scheduled plant maintenance at our Corpus Christi and Morris sites negatively impacted the quarter.","Olefin operating rates averaged approximately 70%. Excluding the scheduled maintenance, quarterly operating rates were approximately 95%. Ethylene production from ethane was approximately 70%, and about 87% came from NGLs.","In polyolefins, results declined by $70 million. Results were driven by lower margins, partially offset by increased sales volumes. Polyethylene price spreads declined approximately $0.04 per pound, while polypropylene spreads declined by approximately $0.09 per pound. Polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes increased by approximately 6% and 13%, respectively.","At third quarter industry benchmark margins, the net value of lost production related to our planned turnarounds is estimated to be about $205 million. Thus far during the fourth quarter, Olefins & Polyolefins Americas industry trends are relatively unchanged. The Corpus Christi ethylene facility is currently being commissioned after the turnaround and expansion. We expect the plant to be operating at the expanded capacity during the month of November.","Let's turn to slide 10, and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, underlying EBITDA was $584 million, a $48 million increase over the second quarter. Despite a decline in polyolefins and equity income, overall results represent a record quarter.","The quarter benefited by $11 million from the restructuring of Asian polypropylene joint ventures and the sale of Australian polypropylene assets. Olefins' results improved by approximately $95 million as feedstock costs decreased coupled with olefin price increases.","Additionally, volumes for the third quarter increased in the absence of second quarter planned maintenance. Advantaged feedstock accounted for 52% of ethylene production, contributing approximately $40 million over naphtha. Polyolefins' results declined $25 million, driven by reduced polyethylene margins. Equity income declined by $29 million due to scheduled maintenance at joint venture facilities.","During the early weeks of the fourth quarter, naphtha feedstock prices have increased, while underlying industry conditions remain relatively unchanged. Planned maintenance is underway at one of our ethylene crackers in Wesseling, Germany. The value of lost production is estimated to be approximately $25 million.","Now, please turn to slide 11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $304 million, a decline of $65 million versus the second quarter. Planned maintenance impacted the quarter by approximately $15 million. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives declined by approximately $15 million as a result of lower derivative margins following propylene price increases.","Intermediate chemicals declined approximately $60 million versus the second quarter. Styrene margins were the primary factor with a decrease of approximately $0.03 per pound. Oxyfuels' results were relatively unchanged with increased volume offsetting lower margins. Thus far in the fourth quarter, I&D industry conditions are relatively unchanged from the third quarter. However, it is typical for oxyfuel margins to weaken during the fall and winter months.","Let's move to slide 12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was a loss of $10 million. Crude throughput averaged 209,000 barrels per day as throughput and yields were impacted by operating disruptions. The industry Maya 2-1-1 spread decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $19 per barrel in the quarter. Based on the third quarter industry benchmark spreads, the lost profit opportunity due to operational issues is estimated to be approximately $65 million. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with third quarter EBITDA of $45 million.","Let me summarize our results with slide 13. Overall earnings and cash generation continued to be satisfactory, and industry trends generally developed as we anticipated. Olefins & Polyolefins conditions remained quite tight as evidenced by increased prices in U.S. ethylene and polypropylene chains. Although our O&P results were impacted by a heavy planned maintenance schedule, they remain consistent with the prior quarter.","In the I&D segment, increased raw material prices impacted PO derivative and styrene results, while planned maintenance impacted the ethylene derivatives. These events are temporary and within the normal quarter-to-quarter variability.","During the fourth quarter, we anticipate some typical seasonal slowing in the ethylene chain in oxyfuels and Refining. However, reduced scheduled maintenance, completion of the ethylene expansion at Corpus Christi and improved Refining operations should provide a positive counterbalance.","While there will be some planned maintenance within the system, the current testament of the lost production value is approximately $75 million to $100 million, well-below the maintenance impact of second and third quarters.","I expect that there are some questions regarding the refinery status within our portfolio. Let me address that now. The company currently is exploring its options relating to our Houston Refinery, which is the core asset of the Refining operating segment. As the company has stated in the past, we believe the Houston Refinery may be more valuable to others. We've engaged an investment bank to assist us in a process to explore our alternatives.","We believe this refinery is a very unique asset, and to that end will only consider a sale if it is in the best interest of all stakeholders. Any sale of the Houston Refinery would be subject to the approval of our Supervisory Board, and assuming such approval is obtained, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions would also apply. No decisions by our Supervisory Board with respect to the sale have been made at this time, and any further comments on a potential transaction would be speculative in nature.","Before I finish with closing remarks, I'd like to spend a few minutes looking at the near to medium-term outlook for supply and demand, particularly within the ethylene chain for both LyondellBasell and the global industry.","Turning to slide 14, I'd like to outline how LyondellBasell's heavy maintenance schedule for 2016 compares to our relatively light plans for 2017. We typically have turnarounds at only two crackers in a given year. However, during 2016, we had four major cracker turnarounds and significant derivative turnaround activity. We also expanded the capacity of our Corpus Christi cracker by 800 million pounds. With this hard work completed during 2016, we have no cracker turnarounds scheduled during 2017.","At the refinery, planned and unplanned maintenance helped crude runs to a level that is projected to be 40,000 barrels per day below our 2017 planned throughput availability. And that behind the increased earnings power associated with these volumes is pretty straightforward, and we have provided 2016 benchmark margins for each of these businesses.","The additional throughput has the potential to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the LyondellBasell bottom line during 2017. As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, the combination of delayed and capacity additions and continuing growth in global demand is improving our views on the market.","Let's turn the slide 15, and view the drivers of O&P demand. Within our polyethylene and polypropylene businesses, approximately two-thirds of the demand for our polyolefins comes from non-durable end users that are largely driven by population growth and a rising standard of living around the world. The large population's GDP growth and consumption trends seen in China, India and other emerging economies will continue to drive these markets towards higher consumption. We believe that polyethylene and polypropylene can maintain the 4% to 5% demand growth that we have seen for these products over the past 25 years.","Given this demand growth, the operating rate question turns to the capacity additions that we have outlined on slide 16. Crackers require billions of dollars of investments with long engineering and construction lead times. This enables good visibility of olefin capacity additions for the coming five years.","Earlier this year, we combined the IHS supply and demand outlook with a 4% forecast for planned and unplanned maintenance downtime to arrive at the effective operating rate illustrated by the green dotted line on the right side of slide 16.","Operating rates were forecast to remain strong with only a brief decline in 2018, below the 90% to 94% range shaded in blue. This is a range where we would consider markets to be in a transition between loose and tight conditions.","Over the past several months, consultants have upgraded their views on capacity additions to reflect their increasing likelihood of project delays and cancellations. The result is a 6 billion pound reduction in an available capacity for 2018 that elevates global operating rates by about 1.5%.","We also reviewed recent operating history on the left side of the slide 16, which shows that downtime from planned and unplanned maintenance averaged 6%, 2% higher than our previous 4% estimate. The net result of these updates is shown as the black line on the right.","A historical shape for this operating rate curve shows good correlation with profitability that the global industry has seen since late 2014, when prices and margins began to surpass the cost of the marginal producer. While we likely see reductions from current operating rates as new capacity comes online, it appears that these reductions in operating rates will be shorter and less severe than previous estimates.","On slide 17, global balances are quantified in terms of the annual capacity of a world-scale cracker using ethane feedstocks to produce 3 billion pounds of ethylene. The three time periods provide perspective of the oncoming shale-based capacity additions relative to global demand growth, and earlier capacity additions in other parts of the world.","As seen in the left chart from 2007 to 2011, global capacity additions exceeded demand by approximately eight crackers. Most of these new crackers were built in the Middle East to leverage advantaged feedstocks, and these crackers ran at maximum rates, even through the 2009 recession.","Over the past five years, world demand has outpaced capacity additions by an amount equivalent to three crackers, primarily due to growing demand in China. As a result, global markets have tightened. Even with the eight cracker equivalents forecast to come online in the United States by 2021, the forecast is relatively balanced over the next five years.","In summary, delays and cancellations coupled with continued population-driven demand create a positive outlook for the coming years. Our team has completed several major turnarounds and we head into 2017 very well-positioned. The view of the next several years is indicating better operating rates and conditions than we forecasted earlier this year.","Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day on April 5 in New York. Please hold that date on your calendars, and we look forward to seeing you there.","Thank you, and now we're pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our first question is from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I was hoping you could provide, maybe your view on \u2013 your expectations for ethylene price discussions ahead of what sounds like there's going to be three or maybe even four new crackers next year. In the past when you've seen supply come into market, maybe in some your other regions; how does that impacts kind of your contract discussion with your customers?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Good morning, Ryan. In the case of ethylene, generally price discussions are not quarterly or annual; they're more longer-term sort of contracts. So it's really, the discussions have been about how our customers might bridge supplies. They're adding derivative capacity that has a different timing than crackers, and some are pure merchant buyers, who need to continue to buy. So our pricing discussions tend to be more longer-term rather than quarter-to-quarter in nature.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then do you think that there'll be any additional \u2013 or do you think the lag between when the derivatives and the crackers come up this cycle will be materially different from kind of a normal six-month period?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, I think next year, it seems that some derivatives may come earlier than the cracker start-ups, but ultimately that'll catch up in 2018. So if there is a lag, it's a six to nine month sort of lag.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. In propylene oxide business, would you describe the decline in margins as temporary, and do you expect to pass through higher costs of propylene in the near-term?","Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Hi, Aleks, this is Doug. Yeah, I think what you're seeing in propylene oxide is you saw propylene price movements; and it takes a little bit of time to move that through particularly the derivatives. So we'll see how propylene responds this quarter. But I think it's temporary, and as we've said in the past, propylene oxide business tends to be a very stable business, overall. But you are going to see quarter-on-quarter movements, particularly with raw material changes like that.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, Doug. And in O&P your year-over-year, the benchmark integrated margin for polyethylene is quite a bit lower, and yet your EBITDA is higher. How will you explain this?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So first of all, I think our results, Aleksey, in Europe are reflective of strong global operating rates. We talked about that earlier. That markets are pretty well-balanced, and for us, our sense is that, the operating rates in the region have increased significantly, demand is growing at 1% to 2% per annum, there's really not a lot of capacity growth. In our case we have \u2013 we're running at pretty high utilization rates. So that in part could explain the difference versus benchmarks as just \u2013 with the exception of planned maintenance, we've been running pretty full in Europe.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you so much. Our next question is from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Bob, just looking at polyethylene margins into 2017, as you know they're bringing on capacity either new or previously shutdown. Do you expect and how do you expect ethylene markets to trend, I guess likely down over the course of the year?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Of ethylene or polyethylene, David?","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Of polyethylene. Polyethylene.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. Well, I think we'll have to kind of see how demand develops and how oil prices develop, and so on. But certainly, Asian demand is growing to the extent that new capacity likely will be exported. So our sense is that, certainly through the first half of the year there's not a lot of new capacity, more of the new capacity which is in the second half of next year. So we'll just have to see how that develops. But our sense is that Asian demand is growing at a pace where that production will be needed overseas.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And Bob, just on M&A and buybacks going forward, how is the M&A pipeline, and how are you thinking about \u2013 I think you said you've purchased about $15 billion of stock since 2013. Is the focus weight now a little more towards M&A going forward?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, no. Our cash deployment hierarchy that we've shown you in our prior IR materials is relatively unchanged. What I would say is that, in terms of M&A, I think we're very clear about who we are. We know what we do well. We understand, I think what it takes to safely, reliably and cost-effectively run large-scale assets that are kind of in our core businesses.","So I think we deploy capital pretty well. So our intention is to patiently look for opportunities to apply these strengths and create more shareholder value. So to the extent that those opportunities present themselves, and we can create meaningful value applying those strengths, then we would certainly consider those.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Thank you. You know, polypropylene spreads declined in the quarter. Is that related to supply\/demand? Or is there any substitution going on among different plastics?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, I think part of that was propylene movements during the quarter. The other part of that, P.J., was that there were some imports early in the quarter that came in, but I think those were somewhat sporadic. It's more about propylene movements in the month. We still see pretty high operating rates in PP, here in the U.S. with really not a lot of new incremental supply in the near-term.","Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV","And P.J., when you look across multiple quarters, you'll see that our results differ a little bit from the benchmarks. For example, in the second quarter, while the benchmark was off by, I think $0.05 to $0.07, we were down at $0.02. So a little bit of it's probably catch-up from that type of movement too. But I think when you look across year-to-year, we're actually well ahead of the benchmark.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then in polyethylene, polyethylene margins declined while ethylene margins went up. So do you think there is any rebalancing of margins between the Olefins & Polyolefins meaning that margin is going back to olefins now?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I think, P.J., what you're seeing is, you saw the tightness in ethylene price moved up, while polyethylene was sort of moving sideways at that point in time. As turnarounds complete, we may see a little bit of loosening on the ethylene side. So I think it'll just balance across, I think you're looking at kind of noise quarter-to-quarter, and of course, the goal is, we want to capture the chain margin.","Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Exactly. And, P.J., if you remember that the ethylene prices are much more regional, while polyethylene prices are more global in terms of how they're set. So spot price movements and the spot market is very thin in ethylene, so that has some influence.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you for that.","Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is now open. You may ask a question.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, fellows.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The chart, the updated forecast on page 16, pretty meaningful change. Is your confidence in that great enough that that would change some of the ways you'd think about investing in the business, either building new capacity ahead of with a tighter outlook, maybe buying back more shares or increasing the dividend?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, our investment plans haven't significantly changed. We've tilted to a bit more growth capital, and as you know, we announced at the last call that we would build a new polyethylene plant. So that project is now underway, and so we're systematically evaluating other opportunities as we look further out into the cycle. But no, no material change. I think it's just a reflection of the reality of some of the delays that have been announced, and frankly ramp up schedules of these very large plants.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then a follow-on question kind of on that same topic with the change in outlook there. Does that materially impact your outlook for NGL pricing in North America?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I think it certainly provides for more ethane in the near-term and maybe even more rejection until some of these crackers come up. In the meantime, if oil prices incrementally rise, that should provide more ethane supply. Our view, Duffy, on ethane is relatively unchanged over the medium and long-term. We think that there's enough resource here. Ultimately ethane has traded recently and will trade above its fuel value.","Historical average has been somewhere around $0.07 per gallon. We think that's reasonable and that still affords the U.S., a reasonable advantage, vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world. So relatively unchanged. I think as some of these crackers start up, there could be a bit more volatility, but over the long-term, we think there's enough ethane here.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. Could you discuss the impact of coal-to-olefins projects in China in terms of your global supply\/demand view of ethylene?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes, James. Some of those projects have already been canceled, and I think that's partly what's reflected in the IHS numbers. Because of the availability of water, environmental impacts, capital costs; so we continue to watch that. Our sense is that more could be delayed, and that the capital costs could be prohibitive as well. So that certainly adds to the operating rate increase in the latter years that we show in our materials.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And looking at Europe, the spreads of polypropylene over propylene have narrowed considerably of late. Do you think that's a trend that continues in 2017?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No. I think that's just kind of in-quarter market volatility. If you kind of step back and look at operating rates in Europe, they are increasing. As I mentioned earlier, there's really no new capacity coming. And if you think about in an environment where we have a relatively weaker euro compared to a couple of years ago, our customers are finding it more \u2013 they're more able to export competitively as well. So we see a pretty balanced market in Europe with a global strong operating rate overlay.","James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line now open. You may ask your question.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Bob, if we made the assumption that you were successful in selling the refinery, could you help us a bit on what the tax leakage would be? And then what the use of proceeds would be? And how fast you would look to use the proceeds?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. Well, good morning, Vincent. I think it's little early to speak to the tax leakage, but I think, the operative word is if. And let's say if we were to sell the refinery, I think our aim is to replace the earnings over time. First of all, you know that would have a increasing capital program where we're looking to grow organically; where we'll also thoughtfully and patiently evaluate other growth opportunities.","Our aim over time, if you think about cash deployment and some balance sheet is to have a strong, stable dividend, a strong rating through the cycle. And so we'll kind of balance all of that, but our aim is to replace those earnings.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And it doesn't sound like the means to do that would be by reducing the share count? Or did I misread you?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","That wouldn't be the highest priority.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Bob, you talked about the delays you've seen in crackers, and I guess associated derivative plants, which is obviously positive for margins next year. But is there impact on you? I mean, is your polyethylene plants going to be affected by equipment and labor tightness that's leading to the delay in cracker construction?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No. I think our polyethylene plant that we're just starting now on construction, it's phased such that the things that we need are \u2013 those things are already completed in many of these plants. So I think, we're well-positioned, we're still aiming for the middle of 2019 for start-up of that polyethylene plant. And I think, we've really planned well for it. So we should be on schedule.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And then you said, you had about $205 million in outages in O&P Americas. I think your original estimate was $135 million. Was it primarily volume that accounted for that difference? Or was it that, when you do have to go in the marketed and buy spot ethylene that have surged much more than you expected? Just wondering if you could kind of give a variance versus your original expectations?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. That's a increase in the delay in the Corpus Christi expansion, and then frankly, just higher margins during the quarter.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Hassan.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Bob, one of the things that we saw over the last couple of months was a big spike up in Asian coal pricing, Chinese coal pricing. Now, obviously you guys produce ethylene, methanol, acetate, a bunch of these products that in some production degree rely on coal as the feedstock. So could you give us a sense, looking at a variety of these products, where coal may potentially have an impact on pricing? Where it may not?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think coal pricing is still, if you think about marginal cost of production of ethylene or olefins in China, coal pricing is still relatively low. I still, think MTO is probably more of the price header than CTO, at these oil price levels. As oil price rises, if it were to rise materially, then maybe naphtha would kind of crossover in a lower gas price environment. But I think coal, it's really more, as I said earlier, about the capital costs and the environmental impacts of coal-based chemical production that I think will continue to pressure new additions.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Understood. Understood. Now, as a separate sort of topic. On the styrene side of things. Obviously, we saw some slippage in pricing, margins seem to have been holding up quite well over the last couple of quarters. And recently, there was some price slippage, some margin slippage. Should we extrapolate that trend? Or is it just a one-off and you see things sort of decently balanced in the styrene market going forward?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, this time we've come off of pretty high levels. So if you look back historically, still where we are today, styrene margins are relatively healthy. If we can say that with styrene. So I still think that in the near term markets look to be reasonably balanced. There will be some new capacity coming next year and the year after, which will incrementally add a bit more styrene into the market. But we're relatively constructive about styrene in the coming, let's say 6 to 9 months; difficult to see beyond that, frankly.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Fantastic. Thank you, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from (39:00). Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, there. I wanted to ask both advantaged cracking in Europe. I see that in Q3 last year, it was about 65%, and it's dropped to 52% in this quarter. Is that a trend that you expect to continue that naphtha cracking actually has become more profitable?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No. I think, it's just reflective of butane prices over there, this summer compared to last summer. So it's more about sort of individual feedstock prices. We still think that there's \u2013 LPG market should be pretty favorable for us and we also cracked some heavy condensates over there. So not a trend, I don't think.","Douglas J. Pike - LyondellBasell Industries NV","And around 50% has been our typical advantaged feed level. So I'd say, it was just a typical quarter from that standpoint.","Unknown Speaker","And the second question, when does your cracker in Wesseling start up in Europe?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","It will start up later this month.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning, guys.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good Morning.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I have a two-parter if you don't mind related, but \u2013 so returning to the coal prices in China, it makes carbide PVC less competitive. So my first part here is, what kind of impact do you think that could have for global utilization?","And then the follow-up to that is, it also makes Chinese chlorine less competitive, and thus U.S. caustic prices are rising. That in turn leading to the higher ethylene prices we're seeing in the U.S. So do you think that trend will continue or do you have an opinion about this at all?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. No. I think that's a very astute observation, certainly that will allow the U.S. PVC producers to export more competitively. And frankly, I think that bodes well for the ethylene market here, because generally when you think about incremental sales of ethylene and then the stock market, that's kind of the incremental decision that gets made in our market here is incremental exports of EDC or PDC. And I think that should be net positive for U.S. ethylene going into Q4 and Q1.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. And on the global utilization, do you think ethylene is helped by this coal price in China? Or is that just a blip?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No, I think it's helped. I think it's helped, and I think it'll have an impact longer term on new capacity, and what's being considered.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That makes sense. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you so much. Our next question is from John Roberts of UBS. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. I think the refinery has been non-core for a long time. Why would now be the right time to be having divestment discussions on the refinery?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","John, it's also \u2013 it's kind of a factor of opportunities and interest in the market. So I think, it's as simple as that. But again, I want to emphasize that, we see this as being, while it may be non-core, it's still a very high-quality asset in a great location. Very complex in terms of the crude slate it can process. So we're very value minded in our consideration here.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just following up on your comments a little earlier there, Bob, on your outlook for ethane supply, and pricing versus fuel value. Can you provide your outlook for propane in a similar context? And do you expect any meaningful shifting in your U.S. cracker feedstock mix over the next one to two years?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, I think first of all, propane and ethane will continue to compete for the feed slate in the U.S. We're continuing to invest in flexibility incrementally, but it's something that I have the team focused on, but I do think longer-term difficult to predict how these various feedstocks will develop and flexibility will be important. So we view that as very strategically important to us.","I think, propane is going to be abundant here, as wet gaskets develop, there's a lot of export capacity. When you think about export costs, local consumption will still be favored, so there will be a good, healthy interplay between ethane and propane and the industry in terms of the existing cracker fleet, has a reasonable amount of flexibility, which should help to balance any kind of run up in ethane prices.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just briefly on that, what would you \u2013 how would you characterize that feedstock mix right now?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","For us, or the industry?","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","For you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","For us, I think, we mentioned earlier that about 87% or so of our ethylene was from NGLs, and about 70% was from ethane. So we're generally in the same ballpark today.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners","Yes, good morning, gentleman. Bob, many years ago when Lyondell gained control of the refinery and integrated the asset; one of the benefits that was touted was increased flexibility to move products across the fence or over the fence. If you were to pull the trigger and divest the asset at some point; can you talk about your ability to preserve that flexibility? And maybe update us on what you're doing typically between the refinery and petrochemicals?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Sure. Well, good morning, Kevin, and welcome back. We have connectivity between our Channelview site and the refinery, and then modestly with a couple of the other sites, but mainly between Channelview.","First of all, we transfer various products at market, so to the extent that there's pipeline connectivity and the Channelview site is the most logical sort of partner, then I think sort of the economic impact is really negligible. And that connectivity and the benefits of that connectivity should continue whether we own it or somebody else owns it. So we review that very carefully, and we don't see any impact.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners","That's good to know. And then as a brief follow-up, sticking with the refinery. Were you running at full rates in October? And do you have any thoughts on the explosion of the Colonial gasoline pipeline overnight that seems to be impacting gasoline markets at least here in the Northeast?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So in terms of rates at the refinery in October, we were not really at full rates. In Q3, we had a sudden power disruption, which was sort of an external impact. And generally, what happens with those is, you see kind of a knock-on effect. When you suddenly lose power, it creates a dislocation. It's similar to crackers as well. And so, we've kind of discovered some of that after we recovered from the power outage. And I think we're just about there now. In fact today, the refinery is running at 250-plus thousand barrels a day. So \u2013 but we've been sort of ramping up, and we expect to stay there, frankly.","In terms of the Colonial Pipeline, it's still pretty fresh news. As of this morning we don't expect any material impact to our refinery or the operations there.","Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners","Thank you very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from just Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. There's of course the first wave of new ethylene crackers, Dow, ExxonMobil, Phillips and Occidental. And they should all be on stream by the middle of 2018. But then there's a second wave, and the second wave is Formosa and Shintech and Sasol and Indorama. Do you think a meaningful part of the second-wave capacity comes on in 2018? Do you think it's at least 50%? Or do you think it's really deferred into 2019?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think some of those producers have announced new timelines. Difficult to say whether the others would be delayed or not, but I can tell you from our own experience of some of these debottlenecks, that we've done these projects in a very congested window, and they're very large, complex plants. So it wouldn't surprise me, but I don't have any other information beyond what's in the press.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then secondly, from the tenor of your comments earlier in the call, is it the case that your capital expenditures from say 2017 through 2020 may be more in a $2 billion to $2.5 billion band, rather than closer to $2 billion?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. I think we've indicated that in past calls as well. But Jeff, that's right. And we're with our polyethylene plant, that's already underway, and then, if we decide to go ahead sometime mid of next year on the PO\/TBA project, those two are pretty large projects that will meaningfully add to our earnings power in the future. So we would step up to above the $2 billion range.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Hi, good morning. Bob, I appreciated the slide on the maintenance impact in 2016, and the much lesser impact in 2017. And you went through ethylene, and ethylene derivatives and Refining. I'm just curious in terms of I&D, I&D had been a really good segment for the company, very consistently above $1.5 billion EBITDA since 2012. Obviously, 2016 slipping somewhat on a margin side. Well, how should we think about the outlook for the I&D segment? And to get back to that $1.5 billion plus EBITDA?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I&D is still a very strong and somewhat stable contributor to our earnings. Frank, I think, we compare and contrast last year and this year, there's a few big drivers. First of all, in the oxyfuels area, our earnings are lower, long gasoline market, and then you see that in Refining as well. So that impacts oxyfuels. Octane was a little more balanced rather than tight, so ramping-ins (51:12) were lower. And butane in the U.S. was higher priced compared to fuel value or oil price. So those all kind of contributed to lower margins in oxyfuels.","We do think that, those certainly can reverse themselves next year. I would say last year, butane trading at 35% of oil price in the summer, that was probably unusually low. And this year we've been on the high side. So I think that's one contributor.","The other is methanol has come off some. Methanol was very different last year, new capacity coming. We've already paid for our restart. So for us, our methanol asset is much more opportunistic, and a play on still cheap natural gas in the U.S.","And then lastly, styrene margins are good, but they've come off of a really great year last year. So that's how I would kind of compare and contrast 2015 and 2016. Oxyfuels, methanol, and styrene, and the oxyfuels being probably the most dominant of the three in terms of the change.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. That's very helpful. And then, not really much in the way, a delta, in the way of plant turnarounds or anything like that 2017 versus 2016 in the segment. Is that correct?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No, not really. No. Most of that is in the ethylene, in the O&P segments.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Terrific. Thanks so much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to understand, I guess, some of the impacts in Q3 in O&P Americas, the $680 million or so in EBITDA. It looks like you were impacted on the maintenance line around $180 million or so. So if we take that out, we would be closer up to $860 million. So if we kept margins kind of where they were, is that a fair run rate going forward? And what would be kind of offsets to that?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I think, first of all, Arun, the \u2013 if you think about the impacts in the Olefins & Polyolefins in the Americas, we have two big crackers down. Right, we had Corpus still down through the quarter as we're completing our de-bottleneck, and we had our Morris site, which includes derivatives, because we don't have ethylene connectivity or the ability the store ethylene up there.","So when we do a cracker turnaround, we basically shut down that equivalent amount of polyethylene. So that has kind of an integrated impact. The two together in the high $100 million, about $200 million, let's call it, range. So yeah, I think, you could add that back.","On your question about run rate, I think you got to go back and look at, as you go forward, adjust that for whatever the market does in terms of margin evolution. But certainly, that's all planned maintenance, that was not unplanned.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then just looking at Europe, similar question, I guess. You really reached a new level of earnings power in that business. Maybe, you can just give us your view on how you'd characterize your outlook there. If oils kind of stays in this similar kind of $55 to $60 level, do you expect naphtha margins to get compressed? Or can you offset with increased condensate and other advantaged fuels? And so do you expect to still keep earning in a similar range? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think, Arun, in Europe, the earnings power is really related to, first of all, global operating rates being relatively strong, and regional operating rates have been ramping up in the last two, three years. We've been running full since about 2013, late-2013, early 2014.","So my sense is that, with demand still growing 1%, 2% a year, no new capacity and euro is now below $1.10. So our customers can export a little more competitively, and imports probably don't look as attractive to people from outside of Europe. So all of that seems to me creates a very balanced market, and what's going to be important is for us to operate really well. And this year we have. Other than one turnaround in France early in the year that went a bit long, we've operated well, which has contributed to a really strong third quarter. We had strong volumes in Q3. So I think Europe is going to continue to be pretty strong.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is through Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on your near-term PE outlook for the U.S., I think there's been some reports of potential contract price drops for November. What are your thoughts in that area?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, there's always seasonality in these businesses, and it is contract season in November\/December for the next year. So we'll kind of have to watch and see how things develop. Our sense is that \u2013 and I think the publications have reflected, the prior $0.05 increase in Q3. And so, I think, we'll have to see how that develops. But typically we see volumes come down a little bit seasonally in Q4, and there's a bit of competitive activity around contracts. So that's kind of normal.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Great. Thanks. And then, given your improving view on ethylene going forward, would you look to maybe ramp up the potential Channelview expansion? Or are you looking more to balance your Olefins & Polyolefin exposure in the Americas?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, so implementation of those de-bottlenecks is also dependent on shutdown timing, and kind of how we layer in those capital projects. But for now, I want us to stay focused on executing these polyethylene projects that we've started, flawlessly get it on, on time.","And I think in due course, we will do those the de-bottlenecks at Channelview. And we may have the ability to bring those forward, but for now, we're going to stay with our plan through 2019 certainly to get this polyethylene project moving.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nils Wallin at CLSA. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I think that there is a fair amount of visibility on the capacity adds in 2017 through 2019 timeframe. But after that, there is limited capacity coming out in 2020 and 2021 as far as the consultants are concerned.","So it would seem like this is the time now to start thinking about the capacity additions. How are you guys thinking about potential capital projects in the next decade? And are you hearing anything outside of the U.S., perhaps in Asia, where margins are now sort of at reinvestment economics?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'll speak for ourselves; can't speak for others. But what I think about, Nils is, in terms of U.S., we need to first take a view on oil-to-gas. And again, as I said earlier in the call, I think the U.S. will have advantage, given the abundance of the resource we have here in natural gas, and fracking and so on. But in a lower oil price environment and incrementally higher capital costs, to me it's not obvious that we would invest in a new cracker facility here in the U.S. in post 2020.","So first and foremost, we've got to take a view on oil-to-gas ratio, and even if capital costs come up some compared to this really sort of heightened period we've just been through, we're still at a level where returns, to me, they look marginal when you look at a $50 oil price, and let's say $3 gas, and in fact paying some premium over a fuel value, which I think it's reasonable to assume. So I think all that still needs to be better understood before we as the company would take a view on the new project in the next decade.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","That's very helpful. And just on your, the revision to your operating rate outlook, does that materially change your view on profitability? I mean, we know that there's pretty good rules of thumb around oil, but if your operating rates go up 300 basis points, 400 basis points globally, do you have a view of what that could do to global profitability on a cent per pound basis?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I think \u2013 what we're trying to indicate is that, the cycle that's been talked about for the past year or two may be more muted than was expected, as we learn more about the timing of expansions and the actual operability of assets around the world. And so with higher operating rates, Nils, we would expect that there is potential for higher margins. I won't give you a specific number today, but I would say that directionally, we expect markets to be firmer than we did a year ago. And the cycles to not be as deep or as broad as we might have thought a year ago.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. At this time we don't have any questions on the phone.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. So I'd like to just close with a few comments before we conclude our call. First of all, I think we had a solid quarter despite two cracker turnarounds in the U.S. and some I&D planned maintenance. I think we're really well positioned to finish the year strong.","Our focus is to get the Corpus Christi cracker started up here in November, and realize the benefit of 800 million pounds of more capacity and to have that cracker back online. With a very large planned maintenance here this year, next year, as we've outlined in our materials, we're going to meaningfully add to our volume, and I think we're really well-positioned for what we think will be very good markets next year as project timing has been pushed out. And longer-term as we outline, we think that operating rates for ethylene globally probably shifted up a bit from our prior estimates, given ramp up time and start-up of new projects.","So I think we'll continue to be well-positioned both near-term and long-term. So we look forward to updating you on our full earnings in February. And thanks as always for your interest in our company. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas J. Pike","Thank you, Cory. Welcome to LyondellBasell's First Quarter 2013 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.","Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.

And with that being said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our website.","Let's take a look at Slide #4 and review a few financial highlights. Overall, the first quarter of 2013 was a good start to the year, as we generated nearly $1.6 billion of EBITDA. This led to income from continuing operations of $906 million and record diluted earnings per share of $1.56. The fundamentals that benefited us over the past several years continued to drive our success. Carriers of strength were North American ethylene margins and production, and continued steady performance from the Intermediates & Derivatives segment.","Along with strong earnings, we passed several important milestones during the quarter. Our credit rating was raised to investment grade. We received environmental permits and began construction of our methanol plant restart at Channelview and the ethylene expansion project at La Porte. We also completed a major turnaround at the Houston refinery.","If you turn to Slide #5, you will see that our safety results for the first quarter were best ever. Performance in this area continued our positive trend. Our recordable injury rate declined to 0.12, perhaps the best in our industry. Environmental and process safety results were also very good during the quarter. We understand that great safety performance is not realized on a quarterly basis. It must be top-of-mind for all our employees and contractors everyday. We will continue to stay focused on improving our safety and environmental performance.","I'd like to now turn the call over to Karyn to discuss our financial performance.","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Thanks, Jim. Before I begin my discussion of results, I want to remind you that we have modified our presentation of EBITDA and we have issued reconciliations of historic results to help your modeling. These can be found on our website.","Please turn to Slide 6, which shows our first quarter EBITDA by segment. The quarter generally reflected the trends and conditions that prevailed throughout 2012. O&P-Americas generated record EBITDA of $898 million. The combination of continued strong ethylene margins and production drove these results. O&P-EAI EBITDA was $225 million. This was a significant improvement versus late 2012. However, the improvement was predominantly driven by raw material cost variability rather than underlying fundamentals. The Intermediates & Derivatives segment generated EBITDA of $373 million, reflecting steady chemical and Oxyfuel results.","Refining segment EBITDA, $20 million, was negatively impacted by the turnaround of the coker and our crude unit. This significant planned maintenance efforts spanned almost 2 months and reduced the average quarterly crude oil throughput by approximately 85,000 barrels per day. While this impacted the first quarter, it positions the refinery well for the future.","On the right side of the slide, we have plotted segment EBITDA for the last 12 months. Generally, trends were quite consistent across the period. O&P-Americas and Intermediates & Derivatives were areas of strength. Both areas benefit from U.S. shale gas development and its effect on advantaged natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. Our O&P-EIA results experienced some volatility across the period, but in general, were depressed by the European economic environment, coupled with high naphtha raw material costs.","In Refining, margins were negatively impacted by the value of co-products, while volumes were impacted by the recent turnaround.","Now let's turn to Slide 7 and see how we deployed the cash. First quarter operations generated $1.1 billion in cash, exclusive of working capital changes. Use of the funds, including a temporary $280 million increase in working capital, primarily due to an inventory increase, we anticipate that working capital will decline over the next quarter.","Capital spending increased to approximately $390 million, as we invested in our growth projects and the refinery turnaround. During the quarter, we paid our normal interim dividend of $229 million. Our cash balance increased by $147 million. This is consistent with our expectations, as the quarter included several annual payments such as property taxes, customer rebates and employee bonuses, which together, totaled approximately $460 million. On the right side of the slide, you see similar metrics for the last 12 months.","I want to highlight a few items. First, operations generated $4.8 billion exclusive of minor working capital changes. We paid dividends of $2.5 billion, invested $1.2 billion in capital projects and our cash balance increased by $1.2 billion.","On Slide 8, we provide some further detail of working capital and metrics that we track. I've covered most of these, so I'll now turn the call back to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance, beginning on Slide #9 with Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas. First quarter EBITDA was $898 million, a $121 million increase versus the fourth quarter of 2012. This was a record performance for the segment.","The Olefins business provided a quarterly improvement, as ethylene margins expanded significantly. Our average ethylene price increased by approximately $0.04 per pound, while our cost of ethylene production metric declined. Ethylene co-products such as propylene contributed to the lower production cost.","During the quarter, approximately 87% of our ethylene production was from natural gas liquid feedstocks. For the third consecutive quarter, ethylene production exceeded nameplate capacity. This may not be apparent to you in our reported metrics, as we report net ethylene after taking into account the operation of our metathesis unit. For a portion of the first quarter, propylene prices justified operation of this unit. At other times, we sold spot ethylene to competitors who had operating issues or made polyethylene. We used our flexibility to maximize value.","Polyolefin results declined by approximately $25 million versus the fourth quarter, mostly due to lower polypropylene margins. We attribute this primarily to the volatility of propylene pricing and the timing of price increases. One of our polypropylene plants also experienced unscheduled downtime during the quarter. Joint venture equity income was $4 million. We received $10 million of dividends in the first quarter. During April, raw materials costs have been relatively consistent with the first quarter. The propylene benchmark price has declined significantly. We have also seen some weakness in polyolefin export markets. We have no planned ethylene maintenance until the third quarter, but there continues to be significant ongoing industry plant maintenance through the second quarter.","Let's turn to Slide #10 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. First quarter EBITDA was $225 million, an improvement of $198 million versus the fourth quarter. Joint venture equity income was $54 million, but there were no joint venture dividends. The improved quarterly results were, in part, due to the absence of fourth quarter charges, which included items such as restructuring charges, compensation accruals, a feedstock contract renegotiation and the impact of the plant turnaround. Exclusive of these fourth quarter charges, our underlying ethylene margin improved several cents per pound. We believe this was largely attributable to naphtha raw material cost volatility and timing of polyolefin price changes rather than improved industry fundamentals. Excluding the impact of the fourth quarter feedstock contract renegotiation, polyolefin results improved by approximately $30 million, driven by improved margins.","Combined polypropylene compounds and Polybutene-1 EBITDA improved by approximately $20 million. Results returned to a more typical pattern following the normal end of the year holiday slowdown. Despite the improved first quarter results, conditions in this segment continue to be difficult. Ethylene plant operating rates in April have been in the mid-80% range. Margins continue to be impacted by weak economic conditions and raw material volatility. During April, performance from our joint ventures in differentiated polyolefins is relatively unchanged.","Now please turn to Slide #11 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $373 million, a $76 million increase from the prior quarter. Propylene oxide and derivative results improved, primarily due to stronger volumes. Sales improved following the typical year-end slowdown. Sales in the aircraft de-icers increased. Results in acetyls and ethylene oxide were relatively unchanged. C4, chemical and styrene results benefited by approximately $25 million from increased margins. Oxyfuel margins increased, in part due to lower butane costs. During April, trends and conditions within Intermediates & Derivatives have remained relatively consistent with the first quarter.","Let's move to Slide #12 for a discussion of the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $20 million, a $103 million decline from the fourth quarter. First quarter results were significantly impacted by the turnaround of the crude unit and the coker. This scheduled maintenance took place during February and March. Versus the fourth quarter, we estimate the turnaround impact to be approximately $80 million.","First quarter crude throughput averaged 173,000 barrels per day, approximately 95,000 barrels per day less than our stated capacity. Relative to the fourth quarter, the industry benchmark, Maya 2-1-1 spread, declined by approximately $3.40 per barrel. As you can see from this slide, most of the decline was in the heavy-light differential, while the gasoline spread improved. Our overall spread declined less than the decline in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark. During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the cost of RINS, or Renewable Identification Numbers, for renewable fuels. This was driven by a growing imbalance between renewable fuel regulations and the realities of fuel markets. Our cost of RINS increased from less than $10 million in the fourth quarter to $25 million in the first quarter. We expect that increased costs associated with RINS will ultimately be passed through to the market, but is difficult to predict exactly when. Thus far during April, we have run the refinery near its full stated capacity. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark spread has averaged approximately $18 per barrel. Since completion of our turnaround, we have adjusted our crude mix to a lighter slate.","Let's move to Slide #13 for a quick summary. 2013 started with record diluted earnings per share. The businesses that performed well during 2012 have continued to be strong year-to-date. Conditions within the European olefins and polyolefins markets are difficult, but during the quarter, raw material volatility worked in our favor. Our refinery turnaround is complete. We're now better positioned to adjust to changes within the U.S. crude oil market. In general, early April brought a continuation of industry conditions experienced during the first quarter. More recently, we have seen a decline in crude oil prices and a slowing in international polyolefin markets. We often see customers slow buying matters when feedstock prices decline. Time will tell if we are again seeing this trend or a more fundamental change. Regardless, under current conditions, we continue to benefit from a significant cost advantage derived from U.S. shale gas production. We are advancing our cost-reduction efforts in Europe, and have demonstrated we can have differential earnings in this geography even during challenging market conditions. As always, we remain focused everywhere on operational excellence, safe, reliable, low-cost operations everyday. A number of our growth projects are now in construction, and our future is bright.","I want to remind shareholders that our proxy has been filed and our Annual Shareholder Meeting will be held on May 22 in Rotterdam. Thank you for your interest in LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take questions. Cory?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Jeff Zekauskas of JPMC, you may ask your question.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sort of a 2-part question. You've been running your North American ethylene units close to 100% for 3 quarters now. Does that place undue stress on your assets or is that a new normal? And then the second question is, you mentioned in your prepared comments that you would lighten your crude slate at your Houston refinery. Can you be a little bit more explicit as to how much you've lightened it?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, Jeff. First, on the question of ethylene production in our U.S. Operations, we've actually operated above nameplate the last 3 quarters. We are cracking a lighter slate. That improves our ethylene yield. It's a little higher furnace temperatures in all, but we don't expect that to have a long-term impact. We already normally do our decoking operations and things are pretty typical. So that's very, very unusual. I think exemplary performance by our people and I couldn't be prouder of that kind of a record. I haven't seen that for a long time in our industry, and I personally think we are showing very differential performance in our ethylene operation, our time and margins are great. And in terms of our crude slate at the Houston refinery, we just came out of that turnaround. One of the reasons we are working on that crude unit for a couple of months is we basically replumbed it so that we could take some of the lighter crudes. I think, depending upon how we blend and all, we could probably run about 20% light-type crudes, but there's a lot of factors that go into how we operate blending rates and all of that, but I think that's a reasonable rule of thumb.","Operator","Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs, you may ask your question.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, I was just curious, I'm sensing from some investors some angst about the cadence of operating rates globally for ethylene. I think in your guys' model you used something like 3.5% to 4% over the next several years. You think there's any need to revise that given the lethargic global economy at the moment?","James L. Gallogly","Well, right now, we're running, obviously, better than 100% in the United States. And every pound we've make, we've been able to sell, so we see no reason to think differently about that. In terms of our global operating rates, we've been operating in the mid-80% range. Remember that we're structurally a bit short in Europe, and so we can differentially run our assets a bit harder, depending upon which one of the pods we're in, so to speak, within the geographies there in Europe. But I don't see a reason to change anything at this point in time. Market conditions in Europe are reasonably stressed, as we indicated, and Asia has been reasonably flat for a bit. So we hope that there's some upside at some point in time, but that will depend on the economy.","Operator","Chris Nocella of RBC Capital Markets, you may ask your question.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just on the European side, can you split the earnings improvement in the first quarter between naphtha being lower and the benefits of your restructuring there? And one of your competitors in Europe announced a shutdown of their polypropylene assets. So is that an enough to fill in the market or is there some additional actions you need to take?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think we had differential performance in Europe. I haven't had a chance to review everybody's numbers yet because not all of those are out. But if I look at where we stand versus some of our competitors, I think we ran reasonably well. And we pride ourselves on chasing value, not volume. And I think our results look pretty good. We did benefit from some of the timing issues during the quarter, but hopefully, we surprised everybody with better-than-expected numbers in Europe. We do have continued restructuring efforts underway. We're in discussions with the works councils, and we're going to be pressing very, very hard to get that cost structure even further improved in Europe.","Douglas J. Pike","Chris, I'll just add, I think, to that. I think as you see the quarter, we saw the volatility in naphtha, we saw some pricing improvements and moves. But during the Investor Day, I think Bob Patel brought forward some of the cost restructuring items and some of the items on the efficiencies that the group over there has been working on. So I might refer you back to that for some of those efficiencies that we're building over in that area.","Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just as a follow-up, resin prices in Asia have come off pretty hard recently. I know you don't export directly to Asia, but can you help us understand the impact of this on some of the global trade close?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. First, we do sell product into Asia, but primarily from the Middle East. We sell a few specialized products from Europe into Asia that are extremely high value. But generally, the product we move into Asia comes from the Middle East, with significantly advantaged cost structure. We haven't been able to consistently move the product. In the United States, the last period, we've been selling more 12% to 13% exports primarily into South America, so we've actually decreased our exports and sold more domestically. When will Asia improve? As I mentioned in my previous remarks, generally, we see buying patterns, when naphtha prices are falling, customers will wait to see what's going on and withhold full volumes and work off of inventories a bit. We expect some of that's going on, but it's just a bit early to predict how the rest of the year will go.","Operator","David Begleiter, Deutsche Bank, you may ask your question.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, there's been some discussion of ethylene multipliers the last few weeks, some as high as 1.4x GDP, some as low as 1.1x GDP. What's your view of ethylene growth as a multiple of GDP?","James L. Gallogly","Well, you have to think really, really back in history to get to 1.4x. I haven't seen that number for awhile, but a lot of people just say it's GDP plus or minus a bit, depending upon what the geography and what the economy is. I don't think much has changed on that recently.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, you announced some new fractionation capacity at Corpus Christi. Could there be additional type arrangements at other cracker sites you have in the U.S. for these types of on-site fractionation?","James L. Gallogly","Well, generally, no. A lot of our facilities are close to Bellevue, and so it really isn't necessary. There's been a lot of capacity added there. Down at Corpus, this was a unique opportunity for us to work with a third-party to diversify our supply. But the plant, actually on our facilities, operated for them and we think we're seeing a nice feedstock advantage as a result of that. We're not at liberty to tell the pricing because that's a confidential contractual matter, but obviously, we consider it quite favorable to us.","Operator","Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley, you may ask your question.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","As you talk to customers now, same dynamic played out last year with declining naphtha at this time of year. Is the dialogue any different today about order trends and order patterns than it was a year ago?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I don't think so. I think, again, we've been able to move our volumes effectively from the Middle East into Asia. And in the United States, we've actually kind of increased our domestic volumes and exported a little less. We just have to see how the rest of the year plays out. It's a bit early yet. We're certainly not in peak-type conditions in the summertime.","Operator","P.J. Juvekar of Citi, you may ask your question.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, you had a nice increase in European profitability. Can you sort of break it down for us into how much of that came from restructuring versus how much of it came from sort of lighter feeds like propane that you're using?","Douglas J. Pike","P.J., I'm sorry, you're a little bit hard to hear, but I believe what you're asking is, in the increase in European profitability, how much would we relate to [indiscernible] in naphtha and pricing movements, so the volatility within the markets, and how much would we say is driven from the restructuring and the work that we're doing there. Is that, correct?","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, that is correct.","Douglas J. Pike","Okay, thank you.","James L. Gallogly","Yes, I don't have that number broken down that way to say what percentage is what. There was a lot of movement, obviously, in naphtha pricing across the quarter and our timing was pretty effective. But generally, we work all of our costs across the period. There's no new single large item that I could report, and our cost-reduction effort is just continuing relentless pursuit of a better cost structure there. So I can't say that there is a unique item on cost to differentiate it. It's more how we perform against the general market.","Operator","Nils Wallin of CLSA, you may ask your question.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Curious as to what your outlook is for volumes in the olefins business in the U.S. in the second quarter with all of these turnarounds. And obviously, you mentioned that you're running at full rates. Is there any way to get incremental volumes out there, or what type of flexibility might you be able to employ to put higher-value products into the market where it's tight?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, well, you're tough on us because we have above nameplates for 3 quarters in a row and you're wondering will we have more. I don't if we can do that much more than we've already been able to accomplish. So the volume side, we've operated really well, and we've been able to move the product. We have a very flexible system. You can see that we've got our NGL rates up to 87%, which is outstanding. We've got more ethane coming in to Channelview, about another 10,000 barrels per day, as a result of a new pump we've put in, new line. So that's moving Channelview's feedstock even lighter. We feel good about that. In terms of the value adds, we'll go in and out of markets pretty quickly. For instance, if spot moves up, it fell almost $0.10 and then moved right back up with some operating issues, and so then we're in the spot markets and out of running metathesis. We'll watch the polyethylene trends. And generally, we'd rather sell to a competitor spot than make polyethylene these days. But those are decisions we make everyday.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just a follow-up. I mean, you certainly highlighted the volatility in raws in Europe. But on your slides, it looks like ethylene margins are up in April. So is there a reason to expect that not to flow through your numbers in the second quarter? Or is this just sort of some artifact from the way the consultants report the profitability?","James L. Gallogly","Well, the pricing is just settling in Europe, as we speak, and then we'll have to watch and see what happens with naphtha pricing for May. April numbers, you've seen the trend lines already, so we'll just have to see how the quarter develops. But there's still some continued volatility in the pricing. Naphtha has been reasonably inexpensive, but again, May should be settling very, very shortly if it hasn't settled overnight.","Operator","Donald Carson of Susquehanna Financial, you may ask your question.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A couple of questions on Europe. Jim, are you able to take advantage of any feedstock opportunities in Europe, like increased [indiscernible] condensate or propane? And then just a question on what your outlook is for equity income there. Is there an inflection point coming where, as they pay down debt, they can start dividending more money back to you or whether they'll have a significant improvement in your share of their income?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, on the feedstock in Europe, we are running more condensates than we did, particularly at Berre, and by the way, we're running Berre full out. As you know, our competitor had a plant incident in that region, and as a result, ethylene is extremely short. And we're running full rates, running some condensates. We've been moving butanes into our cracks and propanes. We're cracking a little lighter than we did before, but remember that we're buying NGLs there more at world prices versus the discounts that you see in the United States. So you have to be careful in terms of the expectations on that. But generally, lighter, improving the mix. A couple of our crackers already had some advantage from some of the heavier streams, hydro wax, things like that, that have always been a bit of a plus for us. Let's see, the second -- well, the JV dividends, there's not a new trend there per se. Obviously, we're reporting those differently in EBITDA, Karyn explained that. So you're seeing not just the dividend stream but the earnings from our joint ventures. But the dividends, I don't -- I expect those to continue to be fairly lumpy. We didn't have any of that cash in Europe in the first quarter. I also had mentioned, it's not just the Middle East, it's also some Asian JVs will give us dividends from time to time. But first quarter didn't have any of those.","Operator","Duffy Fischer of Barclays, you may ask your question.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One of the big things for the last couple of years has just been the changing outlook for the feedstocks in ethylene. And so there's some chatter that naphtha could become disconnected from Brent oil over time. I'm just wondering if you guys have had a chance to kind of look through that? Obviously, you've been in a lot of different places within the energy space, Jim. So if you had any insights on kind of -- is that something that could surprise us in the next 3 to 5 years?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I've seen some writeups on that and I'm a little skeptical. It's theoretically possible, but right now, it seems like ethane will continue to be advantaged. We're in rejection periods right now in certain geographies. In terms of naphtha coming down, differentially, we've got to get into the gasoline pool to figure that one out. Gasoline prices have been reasonably strong in the first quarter. I think octane is going to have more value going forward. So I just -- I've read a little bit about that, but I'm scratching my head. I'm not sure I agree with all the premises at this point.","Operator","Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you may ask your question.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Your shareholder vote regarding repurchases, I guess, is less than 4 weeks away now. Can you comment on whether or not you would see potential to accelerate the pace of execution relative to the 18-month timeframe that you put out there? And it looks like you came out of the quarter levered, I don't know, 0.2x to 0.3x EBITDA. If you look further out, maybe 1 to 2 years, do you see opportunity to recapitalize and return cash through that mechanism, in addition to the organic cash generation?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Sure. I'm sure you can appreciate that we are continuing to work with our board on this topic, in anticipation of that meeting that's coming up in May. But from a financial perspective, financial policy perspective, nothing's changed in terms of our policy to continue to distribute discretionary cash to our investors. As it relates to how we're looking at our balance sheet and overall leverage, with the investment-grade rating that we just recently received, it does provide for some increased optionality and flexibility in our balance sheet as we continue to optimize our capital structure. So as we discussed at Investor Day, we do have some flexibility here to potentially evolve and optimize the structure in line with our ratings and our outlook and our very solid, strong investment-grade metrics that we're committed to maintaining.","James L. Gallogly","Per the discussions with our board, Kevin, we don't want to get out in front of ourselves.","Operator","Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global, you may ask your question.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","I wanted to revisit, broadly speaking, Europe. Of late, over the last couple of weeks and months, we've heard a few different announcements. On one side, maybe a week or so ago, Saudi came out and announced a fairly large rationalization or restructuring plan for Europe. On the other side, you have INEOS, which is talking about trying to import ethane from the U.S. So I mean, as you look a couple of years out, how do you see the European industry, i.e. is it skinnier, is it more feedstock-flexible? I would love to hear your views about that.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. I think there have been some recent closure announcements. We consider that a positive for the European industry. I wouldn't call it material at this point, but it's -- all these closures are helpful to us. I think that concept of ethane import into Europe is going to be something that will be small and unique, not a major trend. It just hasn't happened in other parts of the world on a large scale, and it's generally not cost-effective unless you have some unique assets and abilities that you've already paid for in past years. So I don't think that's a trend line to watch. Europe is going to be -- until the economy improves, it'll be a place we'll just have to operate very effectively, continue to reduce our costs, and that's exactly what we're doing.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","Fair enough. Now another quick question. Obviously, a lot of focus on capacity additions within the U.S. But on the other side of it, you have the Chinese making a lot of noise around MTO facilities. I mean, how real are those sort of capacity additions, in your view?","James L. Gallogly","Well, there are some capacity additions kind of in Central China. That product kind of stays in Central China versus on the coast. There are some additions there, but I think the bulk of the future growth is going to be here in the United States with a mind toward export.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray, you may ask your question.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A lot of the questions have been answered already, but I wanted to follow up on the JVs real quick. The operational issues that have been seen in Jubail and PDH in the past, have those been put in the rearview mirror and is there further expansion as we go into '13? And then is it -- or is it just lumpiness?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, the PDH unit originally had some issues with catalysts. It's one of the largest units ever built. And we generally have resolved that issue with the technology provider, so that's in much better shape. Our polypropylene unit is one of our advanced units, and it also runs extremely well. There have been some operational issues from time to time, with power blips, an occasional utility issue. But compared to where we started a couple of years ago, that plant has improved its operations, although as a company, we're pretty much into the expectation of perfect operations, and it doesn't yet meet that standard.","Operator","Laurence Alexander of Jefferies, you may ask your question.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is Rob Walker in for Laurence. I guess, first, Jim, what's your view on butane prices in the short and medium term, and how flexible are your crackers to butane, if prices continue to drift lower?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, butane prices have come down pretty hard, and they're starting to show up in the crack. Over the last days, they've been in there -- in the kind of same type economics as propane. And so we have been taking butane into the crack a bit more. Of course, discounted butane prices are also very good to our Oxyfuels business through MTBEs, so we consider that a very, very positive development. Now in all of this, I'll always remind everybody that certain of the heavier NGLs can be exported, and some of that is being exported. But at this moment in time, more of that has been propane than the butanes. And so it's something -- that's a trend, as I've mentioned a couple of times before publicly, has to be watched pretty carefully.","Robert Walker - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then, Karyn, you mentioned that getting to investment grade kind of gives you some more balance sheet flexibility. Can you update us on kind of your thoughts on acquisitions and your criteria for those, if you are considering those?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes, from an M&A perspective, yes, that's -- we've discussed this in the past in terms of looking at those. We're always looking at everything, but in terms of our capital deployment and our hierarchy, we've got these growth projects that we're currently working on with quick -- short-term, quick-return-type projects. We do look at M&A but from a capital deployment perspective, in terms of them being very strategic and meaningfully accretive, those are the criteria there. And then beyond that, it's really looking for direct returns to our shareholders via either dividends and\/or potentially share buybacks, if authorization is received. Management and the board will consider all of those options.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Simply put, we haven't seen anything of interest to us lately.","Operator","Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo, you may ask your question.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jim, in the past, when the topic of looking at the MLP structure for your olefin assets has come up, you've suggested that it was, \"under intense study.\" So how about an update on how those -- how your studying is going there?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Well, it continues to be intense. But a couple of insights on how we look at that. First, remember that we have assets that went through a bankruptcy process and were written down. And so we have unique tax issues on the front end of -- or at some point, we are a different taxpaying entity than some of our competitors because of the bankruptcy process. So that's one consideration that we have to look at very, very carefully with each individual asset. The second is, while we have a fair amount of infrastructure, that's the kind of assets that typically dropped into that kind of thing, most of our pipelines and all are very, very uniquely strategic to us and not common carrier lines. And so we have some of that, but probably not enough to be something that would fully flesh out an MLP. So we're considering various options. But at this point in time, we're still in the study mode. Taxes are a unique issue, though.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Terrific. And obviously, you spoke before about the shareholder vote coming up on the share buyback. But as you look at the returning cash to shareholders via regular dividend, a special dividend or share repurchase, what is your general take on the roles of all of those 3?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, Karyn, do you want to comment on that?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Okay. From a regular dividend perspective, we've set our overall total dollar amount of our regular dividend so that we can fund that comfortably through the cycle without having to raise debt, and giving us some bandwidth to continually grow that, so a sustainable forever-growing regular dividend. And as we outlined at Investor Day, there's also some potential for additional growth beyond that over the next few years in relation to the discretionary cash generation as a result of the materialization of the growth projects that we've outlined in the near term. So our growth plan is centered around those quick, high-return projects, which will result in additional discretionary cash that we'll look at in connection with our regular dividend as well. And then beyond that, it becomes the alternatives between special or supplemental dividends, as well as and\/or buybacks, which again, if shareholder authorization is received, the management and Supervisory Board will assess all those considerations.","James L. Gallogly","You'll hear more from us on that following the shareholder vote.","Operator","John Roberts of UBS, you may ask your question.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question for Jim or Karyn, just qualitatively on capital spending post 2014. I know you're up near $1.5 billion this year and next year, but one of your competitors was in town last week and we were talking about how crowded the engineering construction environment will be in the U.S. in the next few years. Do you think you'd actually be able to keep your U.S. spending up near these levels post the next couple of years or will you get crowded out? It will be very hard for you to get more projects underway in the U.S. in that environment.","James L. Gallogly","Well, we're all about capital efficiency and one of the reasons we were so early to file permit applications for our debottlenecks is because we assumed that construction resources wouldn't begin to get more stressed in the Gulf Coast following the announcements of a lot of big crackers. So our strategy has been get the permits early, do the debottlenecks, get the assets running, get the cash generated and have the assets paid for before anybody else starts up their new capacity. And so I would expect that domestic investment to trail off. We've announced the projects that we're intending to do and we've got a base amount of capital that's gone $600 million, $700 million, in the early days, up to $800 million. That's coming off as we've gotten a lot of our big turnarounds behind us. So we're very focused on the next couple of years getting these projects done before the wave of activity hits and the cost go up significantly.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you would tail down, you think, after?","James L. Gallogly","I would expect that our -- we haven't announced anything additional at this point. Maybe there's something in the second wave in terms of a combo cracker as we've said before, but we're building the equivalent of a full-size cracker in our debottlenecks, but we need to get it done early.","Operator","Gregg Goodnight of UBS, you may ask your question.","Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Now that your refinery turnaround is over, you mentioned that you're running a bit of a lighter feed slate. Could you comment on what your expectations are in terms of operating rates, in terms of design capacity? Or would running higher operating rates suboptimize your economics?","James L. Gallogly","Well, that all depends on where gasoline distillate prices are. But I can tell you, a couple of days ago when I talked to Kevin, we're at 290,000 barrels a day. When we're cracking a little lighter, you can run your rates up pretty hard, and so we're making quite a bit of gasoline at this moment in time. Lighter crude slates move that up, a little less on -- by co-products [ph]  on the back-end, but a little less coke today is probably a good thing. And given where some of the gas pricing is, it's better not to make as much of that. So a little lighter. Hopefully, that will improve our spreads, but it's -- everyday, we re-optimize.","Operator","Bill Young of ChemSpeak, you may ask your question.","William Young","Your new methanol restock, could you give us an idea of how you're structuring your natural gas purchase contracts for that? Is it spots, some kind of floor or an escalator or whatever happens to be? And also, Jim, what does your crystal ball say about natural gas prices in the next 2 to 3 years?","James L. Gallogly","Well, on where we're getting our gas for methanol, today, we're just -- we're buying it locally and at market prices versus trying to hedge it. Those prices, as you know, have been pretty low, a little over $4 recently. But when you look at world prices for natural gas and how our methanol plant would compete, we feel very, very good about it. Just had an update, literally this morning, on the progress of that restart, and everything is still marching along very nicely. Everything seems to be on track for later in the year, start up of that unit. We generally, as I said, don't hedge that product. I'm not sure, did I answer all of your questions on that or was there another component?","William Young","No, I think that's pretty good. It's a not complex formula, purchase contract with some on your -- or anything like that?","James L. Gallogly","No.","William Young","No. Okay. And what do you think natural gas might be, say, a couple -- 3 years out?","James L. Gallogly","Well, that one is a real tough question, but let me give you a bit of a twist on that. I know that most people would say, the lower the natural gas price, the better. And that's somewhat true when you look at our utility costs and all. Low natural gas prices, $1 in MMbtu is about $275 million of operating costs. But we like cheap ethanes, and I've said in various industry forums that a price in the $4.50 range is really pretty optimum for the chemical business, because that means that a lot of the fields that are dryer gas will be profitable for those E&P operators, that will bring on even more natural gas liquids. And so that's favorable to us. So these kind of gas prices, I'm just fine with. I think it helps us on our liquids. And overall, as we've done our own internal math, natural gas liquids prices being low is better for us than cheap methane.","Operator","Charles Neivert of Cowen securities, you may ask your question.","Charles N. Neivert - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Two quick ones. One, on getting back to the butane side, looking at a very low butane especially versus a year ago, how much of a benefit can we sort of attribute to MTBE? I mean, how much in terms of margin is that going to benefit you guys? And also, where you're running heavier feeds, the non-NGL feed slates, have you guys been able to take advantage of any of the condensate or some of the other stuff that's a little bit less expensive than, let's say, a naphtha run? And what's your advantage over naphtha with those products versus -- as opposed to ethane?","James L. Gallogly","Yes, do you want to say anything about butane, Doug?","Douglas J. Pike","Let me give you some thoughts on the MTBE and butane, Charlie. When you think about MTBE and the Oxyfuels, it's about a gallon of butane per gallon of Oxyfuels, so you're really looking at a simple formula between the costs -- the price of gasoline and the cost of butane. So that's going to be the core driver there. Some of our materials, when you look at our volumes, we're also in the market, buying and reselling as we balance the market, be sure we can optimize systems and have flexibility. We have contracts, of course, a big contract with Japan. So not everything floats everyday with the market volumetrically. But just look at it as a simple -- a gallon of butane to a gallon of MTBE for that.","James L. Gallogly","So the that's a pretty good formula. Obviously, cheaper butane helps us in that business and helps us in our crack. I don't have a specific number for you per se, because, again, as Doug indicated, it has to be against gasoline prices and octane values. In terms of other feedstocks besides naphtha, we're running South Texas condensates both at Corpus and up at Channelview, and we've had nice discounts. We're not able to describe those because of contractual terms. But as you know, they're long. And we've been able to bring up pretty significant volumes, to the point we're basically cracking domestic condensates and not any imports. So it's been a plus for us and we expect that to continue.","Charles N. Neivert - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that's a definitive advantage over -- just against naphtha? So if we were sort of grading that, ethane is still the low end but this is certainly well below naphtha as well?","James L. Gallogly","Yes.","Operator","Barrett Eynon of Pentwater, you may ask your question.","Barrett Eynon","Just a follow-up on your comment about using leverage in terms of potentially upping your share repurchases. And I'm just curious what your comfort level is in how many turns of leverage you put on there, because if you did quick math on it, essentially every turn of leverage, theoretically, that you guys deposit back, especially where your stock is today, 15% of the company. So I'm just curious how you think about how much leverage you're comfortable with for the purposes of using that to buy back shares.","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes, I think from an overall capital structure, I think we can separate that from the potential of just returning cash directly to shareholders via dividends or buybacks. So separating the 2 in terms of looking at the balance sheet, yes, again, is there some opportunity there, some flexibility as we move forward to kind of optimize that? Yes, there is. And as we go through and start the season as an investment-grade company, we'll look at that as well.","Barrett Eynon","Is there a leverage level you guys are comfortable with or you would target?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","No","[Audio Gap]","with those metrics, we're going to stay well within that.","Barrett Eynon","What number would that imply actually?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","From an EBITA turn multiple, that can go anywhere from 1x, 1.5x to 2x.","Barrett Eynon","Okay. And one other question on your historical restatement of financials, from I think it was yesterday or the day before. You kind of broke out your prior reported EBITDA in more in terms of how you segment it in terms of sort of, I guess, what your base level would be. But one thing that drew my attention was you made a bigger effort to segment your JV income and your JV dividends. Is one thought there that helps the market understand that, prior to this, your JV income had been embedded in your EBITDA number, so it was being valued on EBITDA versus a PE multiple?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","No, this is really a presentation of EBITDA, so historically, we've got those tables in our press release with -- and there were numerous, numerous unusual or nonrecurring-type items you'll see in this quarter, that we didn't have any that reached any materiality. So going forward, we're going to be presenting EBITDA as defined. We'll still continue to highlight any material, unusual or nonrecurring, so that those modeling the company can adjust accordingly, going forward. But our presentation is purely just to present the EBITDA as defined.","Barrett Eynon","But you're removing JV income specifically, it seems like, whereas before, you didn't.","Douglas J. Pike","Barrett, this is Doug. I think what we've done is we're using a strict EBITDA definition. The use of having the dividend as part of the EBITDA is really more of a cash-driven thing, which really is a historic thing from the company's history, where EBITDA and cash flow were a focus of people. Really, what we were doing with this is it'll go straight up the income statement. You'll see the equity pick up from the JVs. As you know, dividends are always a bit lumpier anyway, so you'll see an income presentation really of the EBITDA. As Karyn said, we'll continue in the earning release with Table 2. That will highlight things that you can make your own decisions on, but we'll highlight some items that, if there are any in the quarter, things such as impairments and things. I just -- to everybody on the phone, we have put a reconciliation out on the website of the past. And I think you'll see it's very clear to see what changes in periods and over the years, going back through to 2010. So I hope everything is clear to everybody, and if you have any questions, just give me a call, I'd be happy to help anyone out.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Generally, what we're trying to do here is, the income is pretty steady from the joint ventures, whereas the dividend is pretty lumpy. So hopefully, this helps everybody understand the value of those joint ventures better.","Barrett Eynon","Right. That's kind of how I interpret it. One last thing, on the cost savings and debottlenecking you're targeting. In your press release, you said that the measures you've taken would ultimately result in $775 million of annual EBITDA. How much of the measures you're taking will be realized this year, and how much have been realized through the first quarter? Just for what's going to be recognized in 2013?","Douglas J. Pike","Barrett, I think that's $775 million in the earnings release -- no, excuse me, is related to the methanol, the expansion at La Porte and also the added processing and operating flexibility at the refinery. That's staying very consistent with what we brought forward. So for more details, I'd refer you back to our Investor Day. So as those projects complete, methanol will be the end of this year, La Porte will be next year. And of course, the Refining, with the turnaround complete, that flexibility is in the system now and we'll see how the market moves forward. So we're now in a much stronger position to respond to a transitioning market in U.S. groups.","James L. Gallogly","Yes, and for everybody's recollection, those numbers were based on 2012 historic margins, just so you'd have a basis upon which to calculate.","Operator","John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, you may ask your question.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick clarification on the Refining side. On the RIN costs, you indicated it was about a $25 million hit in the first quarter, but you were running at 65% utilization rate. So if we run you up to 100%, is it more of a -- is the right way to think about it that it's roughly a $40 million hit? Or was it more -- is it not quite that simple just doing the math that way, because of either product slate changes or maybe preparation ahead of the turnaround, where you had product around?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Of course, that market has been extremely volatile. But kind of our internal rule of thumb based on what we see today is kind of an annual $100 million to $150 million kind of based on current pricing. But we'll just have to see how that all develops. Again, we would expect that those RINS would be passed on to the marketplace over time. We think some of that is being passed on. But how much, it's just a tough thing to calculate so early in the process. But obviously we didn't see that in the fourth quarter and we're now seeing that. We'll see how long the trend lasts.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question on the MTBE volume. I know it's a seasonally weak quarter, but they were a little light there, and given how good the margins are and the outlook for butane prices to remain low, just wondering if you have any ability to take some market share in the MTBE market over time and kind leverage the -- your low-cost position there?","Douglas J. Pike","Brian, MTBE typically is seasonal, so what you will often will see that we will be a little stronger sales in the second and third quarter versus the first and fourth, as we manage inventories and manage the system there. We also -- it's a product where you do, do catalyst changes periodically, so that will also change on a period-to-period volumes. But I think the key thing to remember here is, we're running our PO\/TBA plans full. That's really the priority within the intermediate system. So we're producing the raw materials at the same pace that we have been at. And we'll bring those to market with the same kind of flexibility and optimization between the various options of chemical markets and fuels markets. So that's what you're seeing really in the first quarter is one of those types of decisions, not a production-based decision.","James L. Gallogly","Yes. And, Brian, if you look at the first quarter of last year, we saw some really strong earnings, but there was some very unusual sales that were made, because there was a lot of pull in South America at that time, there was a competitor outage, a few things that were going on in the market that we reported in that quarter. We said we had high volumes for the first quarter in the year. We've got a butane advantage today. And the margins are nice, and that's a very strong business. We feel good about it. And ultimately, we think octane is going to be more and more valuable in the fuel pool [ph]  and we're excited about having -- being the #1 producer of Oxyfuels in the world.","Okay. Well, I think we've answered all of the questions. We very much appreciate your interest in our company. We did have record earnings per share, very, very strong olefin results in the Americas, steady I&D performance. I think a solid quarter to begin 2013. We look forward to updating you on our plans following the shareholder meeting. I know that there's a great deal of expectation around that, and we will be back to you before long. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's presentation.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas J. Pike","Okay. Well, thank you, Shirley. Well, hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's Fourth Quarter 2013 teleconference. And I'm joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.","Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.

And the passcode for both numbers is 3674.","Now during today's call, we'll focus on fourth quarter and full year 2013 performance, the current environment and near-term outlook. With that being said, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James L. Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompanies this call and is available on our website.","Let's take a look at Slide #4 and review a few financial highlights. The fourth quarter of 2013 results set a record for the period, with EBITDA of $1.54 billion and earnings per share of $2.11. Our EBITDA results exceeded the fourth quarter of 2012 by $278 million. Although we had record performance, the results were negatively impacted by typical seasonal trends, which impacted the quarter by approximately $100 million. Net income and earnings per share benefited from a significantly lower tax rate related to the release of reserves against certain net operating losses.","Our annual results established a new earnings record as well. For the year, our income from continuing operations was $3.9 billion or $6.76 per share. The charts on the bottom of the page provide a good perspective of the strength and consistency of our results.","Within our portfolio, the fundamental drivers of our performance were unchanged. The Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas segment benefited from the revolution in natural gas liquids, as well as strong operations. Intermediates & Derivatives benefited from similar attributes, as well as our leading propylene oxide technologies.","Our Olefins & Polyolefins - EAI segment does not enjoy the benefits of the U.S. shale boom, but a similar approach to operations in areas of differentiation have contributed to its solid performance.","2013 was a year of repositioning for our Refining segment. Lighter crude dropped in favor during the year and we took steps to be able to process these crudes more efficiently without giving up our heavy sour crude capabilities. Recently, refining margins have improved.","During these calls, I don't often mention our Technology segment, but over the years, this differentiated business delivers exceptional results. Technology EBITDA, as a percent of revenues in 2013, averaged 44%. Capital spending was modest and EBITDA grew by 18%. I'll say more about each segment later in the call.","Over our brief history, we have methodically moved the company forward by maintaining our focus on our original back-to-basics principles, cost containment and capital discipline. We have accomplished a great deal in just 3.5 years and 2013 was no exception. The next slides highlight a few of our 2013 accomplishments.","If you turn to Slide #5 of the presentation, I'll begin with environmental, health and safety performance. Those of you that have followed us know our commitment to this area. The trends on the charts speak for themselves. Our corporate results are consistent with top decile performance. Since 2009, our personal injury rate is down approximately 50% and our environmental and process incident rates have declined by approximately 2\/3. For many reasons, we strive to bring each of these metrics to 0. Good performance protects our people, our assets and the communities in which we operate. There is also a financial impact. Safe operations are also normally reliable operations. You see this to be true in our results.","On Slide #6, we outlined some of our key accomplishments. In the interest of time, I'll highlight just a few of the many achievements. First, profits reached a record level, as we surpassed last year's record earnings. Our total annual shareholder return was 45%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Those of you that have followed us over the past several years know that we always emphasize cost control. I'm proud that for the fifth consecutive year, we offset inflation and maintained flat underlying costs. We expect to do the same in 2014.","In the finance area, our strong cash flow enabled us to reward our shareholders, invest in our future and establish a strong investment-grade balance sheet. Some highlights include increasing our quarterly interim dividend over the year by 50%, paying $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchasing approximately $2 billion of our stock.","Operationally, we have increased our advantaged feedstock capabilities in both our U.S. and European olefin operations. Almost 90% of our U.S. ethylene production was sourced from NGLs and, essentially, 100% from advantaged U.S. source materials. During the summer, 40% of our European ethylene was produced from advantaged feedstocks. I am particularly proud that, exclusive of our scheduled turnarounds, our U.S. ethylene plants operated at 99% of nameplate capacity, well above the industry average.","During 2013, you saw our first significant growth programs come online, the butadiene expansion in Europe and the restart of our methanol plant in the U.S. Our first major ethylene expansion will happen in the next months, well ahead of our competition and at a lower cost.","At our refinery, we began consuming more U.S. light crudes and heavy Canadian crudes.","On the bottom of the page, we show EBITDA results by segment. We have experienced steady growth in EBITDA.","Let's turn to Slide #7 and look at some of the metrics that drove our performance. Across the top of the page, we have plotted our key volumes. I want to focus your attention on our ethylene production.","Over the past several years, our cracker operations have been strong, and we've been able to operate in both regions above industry average rates. Our U.S. data represents production after operation of our flex unit, which converts ethylene into propylene. This flexibility added substantial value during the latter half of 2013. Taking into account this ethylene consumption and our planned turnaround downtime, our U.S. crackers operated near nameplate capacity.","In Europe, we operated our crackers at 88% of nameplate capacity, approximately 10% higher than the industry average.","In the charts along the bottom of the page, you'll see a summary of product margins and spreads. The index charts represent our internal data, while the others represent industry benchmarks. The charts on the left highlight the strength of the U.S. ethylene chain. On the right-hand side, we have plotted MTBE and refining industry spreads. Following an exceptionally strong 2012, MTBE continues to deliver solid spreads. In Refining, the Maya 2-1-1 spread doesn't tell the whole story, as RIN costs, our first quarter turnaround and lower by-product values from coke and LPGs pressured 2013 results.","Overall, these charts provide a good perspective of the margin and volume factors that have contributed to our success. Importantly, solid operations and advantage positions have resulted in consistent results, uncharacteristic of most commodity businesses.","I'd like to turn the call over to Karyn at this point to discuss our financial performance.","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to Slide #8, which charts our fourth quarter and full year segment EBITDA. As Jim said, our results have been strong and steady. The fourth quarter generally reflected the trends and conditions that prevailed throughout 2013. In the interest of time, I won't repeat the key drivers but rather will use a few minutes to discuss some of the unique items that impacted results.","Seasonality generally plays a role in our fourth quarter results. This year was no exception and versus the third quarter, we estimate the seasonality impact in the range of $100 million, with the primary influences being in oxyfuels and polyolefins.","Our O&P-EAI segment was positively impacted by a $25 million insurance settlement related to the 2012 Wesseling polymer reactor explosion.","In I&D, we decided to exit our Japanese PO joint venture. The accounting related to the exit negatively impacted segment EBITDA by $26 million.","In addition to the EBITDA impacts, our net income benefited from the tax impact related to the release of valuation allowances, primarily associated with our French tax losses. The release of approximately $350 million of valuation allowances represents the bulk of the net income improvement. Together, these items reduced the full year effective tax rate to 23%.","Slides 9 and 10 provide a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2013, we generated $4.8 billion of cash from operations while utilizing $3.1 billion to pay dividends and repurchase shares. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $1.5 billion at an average coupon rate of 4.6%.","On Slide 10, we plotted a few key aspects of our cash story. Cost management is a strong theme within LyondellBasell, with the goal of maintaining cost in local currency flat to down. Over a 5-year period, our actions offset an estimated $215 million of inflation. Since 2008, our headcount was reduced from 17,000 to approximately 13,300.","In the upper right of the page, you can see our capital spending history. During 2013, we increased our capital spending to $1.6 billion, with roughly 50% of the spending in our growth program. We anticipate similar cash fixed cost and capital spending during 2014.","On the bottom of the page, we have given you a profile of the annual free cash flow and the cumulative uses of the cash during the past 3 years. Of the more than $12.5 billion of after-tax cash flow, approximately 2\/3 went to dividends and share repurchases, with 1\/3 reinvested in assets.","Since this is the beginning of a New Year, I expect that some of you may have 2014 modeling questions. Regarding capital. We are planning to spend approximately $1.6 billion during 2014. Approximately half of this is targeted toward our growth program.","We currently expect cash interest expense to be approximately $325 million based on $5.8 billion of total debt at an average interest rate of approximately 5.6%. Additionally, there should be an estimated $5 million per quarter of noncash amortization.","Annual book depreciation and amortization should be slightly higher than the $1 billion incurred during 2013.","We plan to make regular pension contributions that total approximately $185 million and estimate an expense of approximately $40 million.","We currently expect a 2014 effective tax rate of approximately 29%. Cash tax rate is expected to be approximately the same.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 8.5 million shares, bringing the total number of shares repurchased in 2013 to over 27 million. We did not recommence share repurchases in December 2013. Our prior practice has been to repurchase shares under a 10b5-1 plan. We tend to be pretty conservative in entering into such plans and did not do so in December. Currently, we do not believe that we are constrained in repurchasing shares and we intend to commence repurchasing shares when permissible after this earnings release. As you may recall, we are authorized to purchase up to 10% of our shares before the end of May 2014 and we have ample cash to effectively execute on that authorization. Of course, various facts, circumstances and marketing conditions can influence our execution. However, we continue to remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in the most efficient manner, including via share buybacks. There has been no change to our capital deployment approach or our financial policies in this regard.","With that, I'll turn things back to Jim for a further discussion of our business results.","James L. Gallogly","Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance beginning on Slide #11 with Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $883 million, $42 million greater than the third quarter. For the full year, our segment EBITDA was $3.57 billion, an outstanding year.","A few specifics will help put the quarterly results in perspective. Relative to the third quarter, our ethylene sales price was relatively unchanged and the cost of ethylene production improved from the third quarter. Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter, averaging 98%. 77% of our production was from ethane, a record level. The differential between ethylene and propylene prices allowed us to profitably operate our flex unit throughout the quarter. This added approximately $25 million to our results.","In polyolefins, our polyethylene spread expanded by approximately $0.02 per pound, while the polypropylene spread remained flat. Polyethylene volumes increased slightly, but domestic sales declined during December. We moved a bit more product into the export market during this short period.","Polypropylene experienced a seasonal sales decline of approximately 4%. For the full year, results surpassed 2012 by $605 million, primarily due to higher ethylene chain margins. Chain margins improved by approximately $0.10 per pound, approximately $0.04 per pound in ethylene and the balance in polyethylene. As you saw in an earlier slide, production and sales volumes were relatively unchanged.","Overall, 2013 was an excellent year. Strong industry fundamentals remain intact. Our crackers operated at almost 100% reliability. We increased ethylene production from ethane and total NGLs and captured value in polyolefins.","In January, ethylene margins have remained strong, but natural gas and NGL prices have increased. Heating and power demands from the extreme cold weather in the Midwest and Northeast have created localized spot shortages and extreme prices in some regional natural gas and propane markets. We anticipate that these conditions will quickly dissipate when temperatures moderate. The Midwest propane spike will have some impact on our costs. However, the impact will be partially offset by lower local ethane prices. We do not believe the overall impact will be significant.","Meanwhile, our U.S. Gulf Coast ethane costs have increased with seasonal natural gas price increases, but inventories remain high and ethane supply continues to expand. We believe that this winter pressure will be relieved as temperatures rise. When you look past this winter-related volatility, industry conditions remain favorable for U.S. petrochemicals. Natural gas and NGL supply is strong and ethane supply is increasing as Marcellus ethane reaches the Gulf Coast.","As a reminder, we will begin the turnaround at our La Porte plant during late March and anticipate that it will last approximately 80 days. During the fourth quarter, we build ethylene inventory in preparation for the turnaround.","Let's turn to Slide #12 and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $115 million. For the full year, EBITDA was $839 million, a $291 million increase versus 2012. Within the business, typical seasonal factors drove a decline in results. Our cost of ethylene production metric increased, reflecting increased naphtha and LPG costs.","Polyolefin volumes declined by approximately 4% and 5% in polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. Our polypropylene compounding and polybutene-1 businesses declined by approximately $25 million. Equity income decreased by $7 million.","For the full year, olefin results benefited from approximately $85 million associated with summertime LPG cracking, increased feedstock flexibility and increased volumes. We operated our crackers at 88%, approximately 10% higher than industry rates. Polypropylene compound and polybutene-1 results increased by approximately $15 million due to stronger volumes and margins. Equity income from our joint ventures increased by $53 million, primarily from the Saudi polypropylene joint ventures.","2013 continued to be a difficult year for European olefins industry. However, our value-oriented approach to markets, feedstock flexibility and restructuring activities enabled us to improve performance. We will continue to press these initiatives in 2014, independent of industry conditions, which, thus far, have generally been consistent with 2013.","Now please turn to Slide #13 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $354 million, a $73 million decline from the prior quarter. For the full year, this segment generated EBITDA of $1.49 billion, a $129 million less than 2012 EBITDA. The majority of the quarterly decline was attributable to typical seasonal trends in oxyfuels. Results for propylene oxide and its derivatives increased slightly. Intermediate chemical products EBITDA was relatively unchanged. Stronger acetyls and EO and EG results offset a decline in styrene margins.","We had 2 important milestones within I&D in December. We closed on the sale of our interest in the NOC joint venture to Sumitomo. This divestiture supports our intention to focus on assets which bring long-term value to our company. In that regard, we also successfully restarted our methanol unit at Channelview in the month.","The methanol plant contributed approximately $15 million to fourth quarter EBITDA.","The full year 2013 versus 2012 results reflects a similar trend to the fourth quarter analysis in most products. Following particularly strong 2012 oxyfuel margins, the market returned to margins more typical of the fundamental gasoline to oxyfuels blend premium.","PO and the other PO derivatives experienced moderate margin decline, reflecting delayed pass-through of increasing propylene prices and industry capacity additions in butanediol.","Intermediate chemicals benefited from volume and margin increases and EO\/EG, acetyls and styrene.","The New Year began with relatively unchanged conditions in propylene oxide and derivatives. Although we believe that the methanol plant restart will contribute throughout the quarter, you should expect the rates will vary as we tune and optimize the operation. Styrene and ethylene glycol margins are somewhat weaker. Through January, oxyfuel raw material margins are relatively unchanged versus the fourth quarter.","Let's move to Slide #14 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $134 million. For the full year, the segment generated $182 million of EBITDA, a decline of $299 million versus 2012. Compared to the third quarter, refinery results improved by $126 million.","During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged approximately $24 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 239,000 barrels per day. Margins at the refinery reflect a greater improvement from the third quarter than indicated by the increase in the Maya 2-1-1 spread. We benefited from a larger increase in our crack spread, moderately improved by-product credits and $24 million lower RIN costs. However, late in the quarter, we experienced operating issues in our cokers. This resulted in reduced throughput and suboptimal yields during a part of December. The estimated impact was approximately $40 million.","2013 was a difficult year in refining. Crude throughput averaged 232,000 barrels per day or approximately 253,000 barrels per day, excluding the impact of our first quarter turnaround. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark declined approximately $2 per barrel to average $23 per barrel. As I mentioned, the crack spread does not fully explain the story, as low by-product values and $87 million of higher RIN costs provided significant headwinds.","Thus far in 2014, the Maya 2-1-1 spread has averaged approximately $28 per barrel. January and February operations will be impacted by the coker issues. However, we have made adjustments to operations and we currently expect the impact on earnings to be less than $20 million. The cokers and refinery should return to full operations during the latter half of February.","Let's step back from the details and think about the business environment more broadly. Overall, the fourth quarter and 2013 were record periods. These trends continue into 2014. In fact, the U.S. oil and gas infrastructure continues to develop. Marcellus ethane will be coming to the Gulf Coast through the ATEX pipeline. The crude oil transportation network continues to expand, with projects such as the Flanagan and Keystone South pipelines. These projects should enhance our future position.","The methanol plant is a nice addition to an already strong Intermediates & Derivatives segment.","O&P-EAI may not benefit from an improved economy or industry conditions, but, internally, we have taken the right steps and our portfolio is generating earnings and cash flow in the difficult environment.","We generally continued around safely and efficiently. Our expansion plans are moving forward rapidly. The timely start of our butadiene expansion and restart of our methanol plant demonstrates our ability to execute as we grow our company. Our La Porte expansion is set for execution in the next months. As you can see on Slide #15, we have several more projects in the queue, essentially 1 project every 6 months. We continue to build momentum across the company in 2014.","We're now pleased to take questions, Shirley.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. Just a quick question on the ethane cracking up to 77% was pretty impressive. Is that a level you think you'll be able to maintain? And is there any upside to that or do you think you kind of maxed out the ability to switch to ethane at this point?","James L. Gallogly","Well, at this point in time, that's a very nice result. As you say, it's about a 7% increase. I think we can sustain that going forward. Having said that, as you know, we're going to be doing some furnace work at Channelview with a couple of new furnaces that allowed to more ethane capability there a little later in the period. We'll have the 2 new furnaces at La Porte very soon. And then, at Corpus, we're expecting to do even more, redoing coils in our furnaces there and overall, longer-term, that number is going to continue to increase.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then I know you mentioned the first quarter impact from the refining downtime, but I was just wondering with the cold weather we've had down here in Houston, too, any impact to the operations of the crackers or any of the other plants from the cold weather, any other kind of unplanned outages we might be aware of?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. In the Midwest, we had some snowdrifts at Morris that kept the trains from moving, slowed us down a little bit. If we can't move across the tracks, it's hard to move polyethylene. So that slowed us down a bit. We had a bobble at Clinton as a result of a power outage, back up and running at full rates. And at La Porte, we had a very, very slight bobble. Yes, we've had some weather impacts, but fairly modest at this point in time.","Operator","The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, a longer-term question. As you look through 2015, you have the major [indiscernible] expansions being done. But what's beyond 2015? In terms of '16 and '17, what types of projects are you thinking about, looking forward to?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Well, we have a very nice portfolio of projects that you saw in the slide, every 6 months something new coming on. That's equivalent to about a new cracker. Methanol is on, butadiene is on. We're working on our China TBA plant. In that period of time, we haven't announced new things, but we've continued to work on those. We'll announce those in later days as we develop those projects further. In the meantime, obviously, we have a very, very nice growth portfolio and I think we're executing well.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jim, just on the refinery, can you discuss when you expect to get some Canadian crudes down to the Gulf Coast and the impact from those cheaper crudes?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. I think you'll see in the summer more of that crude coming down. We've taken positions on some pipelines to increase our capacity. We expect that to really help the refinery more from the middle of the year forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMC.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you describe what's going on in the Conway hub? In that, when we look at ethane, propane mix, what we see is that it's selling for a negative value. Is that what you buy it for? Do you buy it and then you return the propane to the seller? What exactly is going on there and how meaningful is to Lyondell?","James L. Gallogly","I think you just answered the question perfectly. It's an upside down market there. As a result of some crop drying, propane had a big demand pull, then we have the extremely cold weather. We have some plants down, some pipeline issues in the area. And as a result, EP mix has kind of been negative and people went the propane back. So it's been very favorable to our operations in the Midwest. I think that's a weather-related phenomenon more than anything else, and that should dissipate. You can already see signs of things coming back in over the last few days and I think it's a short-term phenomena. As we said in our prepared remarks, we pay more for propane in a sense, less for ethane. It should have very modest impact on the results overall.","Of course, that's Conway and down in Bellevue, it's a little bit different. Prices [ph] have gone up as we mentioned as well.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I don't fully understand why your Intermediates & Derivatives business was so strong year-over-year, exclusive of the charge which is in there. Where did the operating income growth come from year-over-year? Was it from 1 or 2 big things or was it from many small things?","James L. Gallogly","I think I'd say that it's kind of a mixed bag. Obviously, for the first time in a long time, we've had some nice styrene margins, which have helped. Propylene oxide is strengthening at the moment, that's been strong. Obviously, we operate 2 technologies, PO\/SM, the PO\/SM units, and PO\/TBA. The PO\/TBA were heavily favored units earlier in the year and now with the styrene margin coming up, we're moving additional volumes. We see that one of our competitors seems to be backing down some volumes and as a result, some of our customers are coming asking for more. So that's been a positive. Butanediol has been down quite a bit. We've got methanol online now, that's starting to contribute a little bit. And so EO\/EG margins have been good. Overall, it's just a combination of a variety of things. That's a steady business, we've run it well and I think it contributes to our earnings in a nice fashion.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So just a quick question on the long-term ethane. Clearly, everyone believes that ethane is going to be long on the Gulf Coast. One of your suppliers is thinking of exporting ethane. And so what is your view on that? And realistically, if that would happen, when do you think, do you have any timeline in your mind when that could potentially happen?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we know that a competitor or 2 is already talking about moving some ethane out of the United States into European operations. I still personally think that's going to be a very limited quantity. When you look at the economics of doing that, the question is, is it good for the short-term or the long-term? And if you're a producer, and I used to be one of those, you don't like to sign up with those kind of contracts for a really, really long period of time. So I still think there'll be a bit of a development there, but I think it'll be a small story personally.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then secondly, your balance sheet is still under leveraged, very under leveraged, when you look at your net cash position. You've done one bond deal. And so what is your willingness to borrow further either to [indiscernible]?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","We've had a pretty successful launch of the investment grade space with the bonds that we did in 2013 and we'll continue to look at our balance sheet. We do have some flexibility in our balance sheet and we'll continue to work with our board as we go forward. In terms of the cash position, there's -- if you look at our buyback program, coupled with our dividends and our CapEx, there is a use of that cash here in the near term. So we'll continue to aggressively pursue those returns to shareholders. And again, we'll continue to look at our balance sheet and evolve that as we go forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can I just ask, in the press release, you talked about you purchased some ethylene ahead of the La Porte turnaround. I presume that didn't impact your cost position in the quarter but rather it will impact either the first or the second quarter, is that correct?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Basically what happens is it hurts us a bit in the fourth quarter and then some of that will come back to us more in the second quarter than in the first quarter, recognizing that we've got -- have an 80-day turnaround in front of us. So it's not so much a first quarter, but it's more of a second quarter impact as we sell that inventory back in.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned earlier the ATEX pipeline, I think, is what you're referring to. And obviously, it's a little hard to tell what's going on now given the polar vortex and all that. But as all that goes away and as all that incremental ethane supply comes, how are you guys thinking about sort of the overall SND [ph] balance in Bellevue as we move out of the first quarter into the second quarter and later in the year? And do you think there's potential for ethane to break natural gas parity either for a short period of time or for a more longer period of time or how should we think about that?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. I think -- I generally think of it as parity most of the time, but there'll be times when it does fall under. We've seen that occasionally. It looks like ethane is going to be very, very long. And I think that's why you hear certain midstream people trying to push this concept of ethane exports. They'd really like to see that happen to tighten up the balance. It's yet to be seen. I've said consistently that I'd like to see a slightly higher natural gas price to encourage further drilling. That further drilling will bring with it natural gas liquids, which helps the balance for the chemical players. So I think, overall, it's a bright future. The question is, is it just spectacular or something better than that?","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, a question on Europe. You did about $230 million better this year. How much of that would've been from the butadiene expansion? How much from cost cutting? And what kind of a tailwind do you have as your cost cuts gets larger a lot next year?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Well, butadiene's helped us some. Obviously, the butadiene spread has been less than people expected this year compared to the prior year. I mean, in the past couple of years, butadiene carried the spread in European cracking, it's not doing that today. Having said that, we set minimum contract prices to ensure a nice return on our project. And so we're exercising those minimum prices and we've had a nice contribution. But I'll tell you that Bob and his team have done a very, very nice job of simply running reasonably well and then pushing value constantly, reducing cost and just trying to improve that spread. So, Don, I'll tell you, it's just a lot of hard work to make that kind of money in the European environment and I think if you benchmark us, you'll see us to be kind of the leading return player in that space and we intend to keep working our cost and keep working our efficiencies and we're a European committed player and we're going to make some money there.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And as a follow-up, on the refinery, I know you've talked in the past that you had to get your operations -- some improvement there before you would look at strategic alternatives. But with somewhat improved operations, a better industry environment and this pending opportunity to bring in low-cost Canadian crude, is now the time to revisit the strategic options for the refinery?","James L. Gallogly","I haven't seen any refineries being sold for significant prices in the last days. And our goal continues to be, let's make that asset perform better. While the fourth quarter earnings were significantly improved, we always look at what could it have been. And frankly, I'm a bit disappointed. We had an operational issue out of our cokers. I mentioned that, I mentioned the impact of that. We could have done better and we'll see a little bit of that here in the next couple of months. Spreads are improving. I think the Refining segment could be a bit of a surprise for people compared to -- well, definitely better than what it was last year, but we're going to keep working that extremely hard. I think one of the stories that's missed is we've also taken out a lot of capital and a lot of cost in that refinery. It's a different unit than it used to be. But again, we've got to operate a little bit better, and when the spreads are there, we've got to run impeccably and we didn't do that in the fourth quarter. And so I'm a bit disappointed in the result.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","On refining but from a little different perspective, year-over-year crack spreads were down a little bit, RINs were up and yet -- and then you take out your additional costs, you were actually up on an operating basis in terms of EBITDA. So could you walk us through what really helped you in that segment? Were you able to buy some distressed cargoes?","James L. Gallogly","We always work the cargoes, but I'll say that in 2011, we had an incredible trading year. I would say that in 2013, it was about average. I don't think there's a big story there. We've worked our operational efficiencies, our costs. We had a turnaround in the first quarter. We're able to take some lighter crudes in because we reconfigured our crude unit on the cut points. But I think it's just in the early part of the year between RINs and co-products being incredibly -- RINs being high and co-products being incredibly depressed. We just were struggling to have any kind of margin. RINs are down now in the fourth quarter, there's been a little bit of benefit in co-products and I think the environment is improving and our job is go capture more of it in 2014.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up. On your slides, you show a nice spread of polyethylene over ethylene margins. That -- we know, of course, that some of your competitors have had issues and continue to have issues. Does that spread, where it is now, sustainable or do you think it could ease once the -- once any of those operational issues get resolved?","James L. Gallogly","Well, there were some instances where our competitors had some significant issues in 2013, particularly in the high density side. Margins expanded pretty nicely there. I'd tell you, in December, the U.S. volumes were a little light, in my view. But we've seen nice demand pull again in January. The market seems to be coming back and we're pressing for price increases. So our job is go capture value in not only the olefin side, but also polyethylene and polypropylene side.","Operator","The next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","On the call, you obviously mentioned that you made $15 million on the methanol side of things. And if I do a back of the envelope, I would imagine that equates to roughly around 50,000 tons. Would that be fair?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. I think so.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","So keeping in mind, call it, quarterly capacity of 200,000 tons, there could be significant upside from the methanol facility in 2014?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. We had historically said at previous year's volumes, kind of last 12 months volumes, we're quoting a number on $200 million of EBITDA a year. Margins have expanded since then. We'll just see where they end up. But we've got to run it hard and we've been through a few little teething things, but the unit seems to be very capable and we'll see if we don't have a debottleneck or 2 once we get it fully lined out.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors","Very good. Now changing gears a bit. Obviously, there was a special dividend in 2011, another one in 2012 and, obviously, this was during the period when you had certain share buyback restrictions. Just wanted sort of your thought process about share buybacks versus special dividends and the like going forward?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes. So we had some restrictions as it related to buybacks, which were really -- [indiscernible] we have the authorization now to do the 10% in terms of the buybacks over that 18-month period. As you know, we've executed on that. So we're currently focused on really trying to make the most efficient use of that regular dividend. We've continued to grow that over a few years, started with $0.10 back in May of 2011, today, it's at $0.60 with that most recent 20% increase. So a focus on the regular dividend and coupling that with the buyback right now. So that's where the focus is. That's not to say that special dividends aren't an option, but those -- the ones that we did over the last few years were really indicative of the fact that we couldn't exercise on buybacks in an efficient way.","James L. Gallogly","I think it's fair to say that every time we have a board meeting, Karyn, I and the Supervisory Board will discuss what is the optimum plan for the coming period. Share repurchase is around the table, special dividend is around the table and obviously, you've seen us expand our regular dividend very, very rapidly.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Rob Walker on for Laurence. I guess, in the Americas, in O&P, your polyolefins results EBITDA looked to have grown more in dollar terms than your olefin profits. What drove the improved spreads and is it sustainable in '14?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. I think -- obviously, we had mentioned before that there are certain competitors that had outages that helped. But there is a good steady demand. We exported fairly small quantities most of the year, with a slight increase in December. With that demand, we moved price as an industry. And as a result of that, you saw a nice expansion in polyethylene. I think in previous years, you saw less value than you would -- should have expected in polyethylene. And I think going forward, it still seems fairly snug and we have the ability to export if that's a better option. So we continue to push value.","Robert Walker - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just curious to get your thoughts on oxyfuel profits in 2014 as it -- related to -- versus 2013. Should they be up, down or about flat?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. Well, there's a few things that drive that. Obviously, 2012 was a banner year. Butane had just a very, very advantaged position for part of the year and there was an extreme demand pull. Gasoline got longer in '13. We had less butane opportunity. But still, it's a great business. Octane becomes more and more valuable as cars have to have higher and higher mileage. I think we'll just watch and see how butane responds. But remember, we're both in the U.S. and in Europe in production of oxyfuels. So far so good. We'll watch and see what happens, but 2012 was an unusually strong year. '13 was more representative of what's normal, I think.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Jim, I thought during your presentation, you talked about advantaged feedstocks in the U.S. and I think you mentioned Europe as well. Can you expand upon the position in Europe?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. What we said was during the summer months, we ran about 40% of advantaged feedstocks. What happened is, particularly in France, we're right on the Med [ph]. We were able to bring in some propane, a little bit of butane, this and that. Historically, we had only run kind of naphtha plus in our crackers there, in part because we had a refinery that we operated and we were using that as a feed prep unit. We don't have that issue. We closed that refinery down. We've got a lot more optionality. We'll chase those advantaged feedstocks and, frankly, there were opportunities in the summer that were very strong and we took advantage of them. One of the other things that will start to happen more in 2014, we renegotiated a very, very significant naphtha contract here toward the end of 2013. It kind of handcuffed us in a few of our other facilities where we had contracted from a very long-term historic basis. In the Basell heritage, you remember how that company was formed, we bought naphtha from some of the parent companies of the old days and we were kind of locked in. We build a lot more flexibility in going forward and we'll see what we can do in 2014. We've got more flexibility and if the markets open up, you'll see us try to do more of that, improve our position.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. Karyn, just to fully clarify. So your average share count is down 4% for Q4 from when you started the buyback. Where was the ending share count? And just to clarify, the intention is, absent anything unusual, that you're going to complete the 10% authorization during -- by May?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","Yes. So the ending share count, it's 549 million shares. But yes, we had the authorization to complete the share back and approval by our board to complete it within 12 months, which would be the May timeframe. Obviously, that's going to be contingent upon other market conditions, that type of thing. But we do expect to execute on that through the end of May.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, coming back to your Gulf Coast ethane mix at 77%. Can you speak to the composition of the other 23%? And in particular, what will be your technical minimum on propane these days?","James L. Gallogly","Well, with propane prices going up, we cracked less propane. We've been bringing in a lot of condensate as well and there's been a nice price differential in South Texas condensate. So we can kind of sub in and out on propane and condensates. A lot of that's related to Corpus Christi and Channelview. But overall, the whole feedstock slate has an advantage of some sort, whether it's -- it's primarily ethane today, somewhat propane, although at this moment, propane is a little higher. And then the condensates make up the rest of the mix. And so I'd say 100% kind of advantaged, propane being a little bit less so at this moment.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I'd just like to follow up on an earlier question about your mid-con crackers in Morris and Clinton. Can you help us understand some of the mechanics of your feedstock procurement there? In other words, are you buying EP mix or purity ethane typically or both of those at times? And in the case where you might buy EP mix, when we see a large negative price, given the recent distortions in the market, is it really a negative price for you or is it the case that you have to return the propane back to the seller and so mathematically it tends to work out to a positive price?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. We basically run an EP mix. But when we say that we want a very, very lean EP mix, and that's generally what we get with limited amount of propane in it, that just seems to work better in our crackers the way we're configured and that's been the advantage that we've had in that region. There's a couple of different pipelines working that area and we've taken advantage of that. There's been some downtime, but we've had no feedstock issues lately. Sometimes, we have to buy out some of the ethane, but I think the comment I made in the prepared remarks about all of this kind of being somewhat neutral to us is probably the best way to think about it. Propane has gone up, but we get some benefit on the ethane side. So overall, it's pretty balanced.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just wondered if you could expound a little bit on the potential for growth within the JV income line item, particularly with your comments on Saudi Arabia?","Unknown Executive","Mike, I'm sorry, I think you broke up a little bit there. Could you repeat that question?","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, sure. I was just wondering about the JV income line and the potential for growth there in '14, particularly [indiscernible].","Unknown Executive","Okay, JV equity income in '14 and how we see that.","James L. Gallogly","Yes, I think there's upside potential there. Our SEPC joint venture in Saudi Arabia has had nice returns for quite a while, but there's an opportunity for operational efficiency there. We did run better at our Al-Waha facility in 2013 than '12. But even there, there's plenty of room for improved operations. We don't physically run those plants, but one of our goals is to go in and work with our partners in a more efficient way and get those -- get the reliability up. We have nice feedstock margins there and a decent percentage ownership. Our goal is to make those things contribute more to our profitability going forward. And of course, Thailand has got an advantaged feedstock position, ran reasonably well last year, but in a tough market. So we're going to continue to push JV income. I think there's upside there.","Michael J. Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. On the Technology segment, I know it doesn't get a lot of attention, but the growth has been pretty tremendous. And I was wondering if you could talk about the -- I guess, the industry dynamics behind what's driving that growth and whether that's sustainable over the next couple of years?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. It really gets down to, are people building new plants? There's 2 pieces. In the Technology side, we've got the process side and then the catalyst business. On the process side, we've been the industry leader in polypropylene for quite a while between Spherizone and Spheripol, truly the industry benchmarks. And if somebody's building a propylene plant, they will call us and many -- in fact, I would just say, at most instances, we get selected, because we really have a beautiful technology with nice products. And so we get selected very, very regularly there. We're expanding our polyethylene portfolio. We're working on a new technology there. We've always been one of the industry leaders in tubular, high-pressure tubular, and there's just one other competitor that goes toe to toe with us there and I think we win the majority of those contests. We're looking at a low pressure new technology that, I think, we may build 0 number 001 in the United States. We've talked about that briefly. That may show up in the United States and that should really help us in our licensing effort going forward. The catalyst side is primarily polypropylene catalysts. We have very large long-term highly supported customers and it's good margin business and we keep them happy and continue to make sure that they have industry-leading products. So it's just a nice segment for us, good earnings and something that we drive through Technology enhancement, primarily out of our Italy operation, Frankfurt operation and then a little bit out of our U.S. operations, Cincinnati.","Operator","Our final question then comes from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It sounds like there are no strategic options available in the refinery, but are there any tactical options there? Is it fully optimized or could you even put new capital in somehow to take advantage of all the changes going on in the crude market?","James L. Gallogly","Yes. There's -- we do not have a hydrocracker at that operation and what we do today is we contract the stream that normally would go there to a third party and we share in the value of that. It always gets the question of what's the return on the hydrocracker and that capital versus other opportunities we have. And so far, other opportunities have been so strong that we haven't chosen to do that. It remains an option for us to put more capital in, to complete the kit. But as I tell everybody, let's run the kit we have perfectly and then you can come talk to me about growing it. But until then, I'm kind of not too interested in hearing about it.","John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So the project would be above your cost of capital, it's just not higher than the other projects you have?","James L. Gallogly","Well, it's above the cost of capital, but we're putting our capital primarily in U.S. olefins and higher growth projects, and those returns are stunning. The other thing we like to do is return excess cash to our shareholders in share repurchases and -- whether it's special dividends, regular dividends. So we're, we think, very shareholder friendly in that regard. So we're just not looking to go spend money on capital opportunities that exist. We're very, very disciplined.","Let me change the format for just a second and ask you all a question. We've been a company since May of 2010 when we entered New York Stock Exchange, and now an S&P 500 company. Did anybody on this call expect LyondellBasell to be where we are today? Obviously, we're tops in safety, tops in reliability, outstanding cost position, held our cost flat coming out of bankruptcy with $1 billion taken out, held that flat now for multiple years. Great growth profile, strong investment-grade balance sheet, strong shareholder return. I'm pretty sure that nobody on this call expected that.","And the second thing I'd like to say is having had that performance during that period of time, recognizing the fabric of what this company is, did any of you expect this company to let up one bit going forward? I said in day 1 when I came in 2009, we're going to make this the best petrochemical company in the world. We're well on our way. Some may say we're getting so close to that, it's just a step or 2 away. But having said that, we're not satisfied and we've had great results over that period of time, but there's a lot more to come in this company and we're energized to make that happen in 2014 forward. Thank you for your interest in the company. Thanks for your support.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may now begin.","Doug Pike","Thank you, Michelle. Well, hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's First Quarter 2016 Teleconference. And I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our CEO; Thomas Aebischer, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.","Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com.","I'd also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","Now for more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com\/investorrelations.","And reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website at www.lyb.com.","And finally, I'd like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2 PM Eastern Time today until 1 AM Eastern Time on May 23rd, by calling 866-513-4385 in the United States and 203-369-1984 outside of the United States. And the pass code for both numbers is 42216.","During today's call, we'll focus on first quarter results, the current environment and the near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I'd like to call your attention to the non-cash, lower of cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we've discussed on past calls.","As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. And during the first quarter, we recognized LCM charges totaling $68 million, any comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges.","With that being said, I'll turn the call over to Bob.","Bob Patel","Thanks, Doug. Good morning to all of you and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Let's begin with Slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter.","Our first quarter diluted earnings per share improved relative with fourth quarter to $2.48 per share with EBITDA of $1.9 billion. This excludes the $68 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment. The sale of our Argentine subsidiary Petroken resulted in a gain of $78 million, which impacted earnings by $0.18 per share. We continued to deliver with three of our five operating segments improving in profitability relative to the fourth quarter.","During the quarter, our downstream integration in polyolefins and other derivatives enabled us to capture profitability as margin moved from monomer into polymers and other downstream products. Our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well across most sides and we completed a planned maintenance turnaround in our refinery.","After the close of the quarter, we completed our second Indian polypropylene compounding acquisition. We continued to execute on our financial priorities during the first quarter and Thomas will provide you, with an update on this progress in a few moments.","Slide 5 reflects the outstanding safety performance that our employees and contractors achieved during the first quarter of this year, by reducing injuries to almost, the already low rates of the past several years. We strongly believe than an unrelenting focus on safety provides benefits to our operations and ultimately profitability.","Good operating reliability across our chemical faculties supports this belief. And now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the first quarter.","Thomas Aebischer","Thank you, Bob and good morning. On Slide 6, we outline our quarterly and trailing 12 months segment result. As Bob mentioned, three of our five business segments improved relative to their fourth quarter 2015 performance. In olefins and polyolefins Americas results were similar to the fourth quarter.","Olefins and polyolefins, EAI benefit from falling after prices and continued strength in polymers. Intermediates and derivatives benefit from a strong global styrene market and improved production following fourth quarter maintenance work. The refineries for low seasonal margins and reduced volumes largely due to a planned turnaround.","Overall, despite the substantial fall in the price of crude oil and global economic uncertainties. Our profitability has remained strong with $7.9 billion in EBITDA over the past 12 months. Please turn to Slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use.","During the first quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of cash from operations and utilized the similar amount in dividends and share repurchases. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates to borrow \u20ac750 million at a coupon rate of 1.875%. Our maintenance and growth capital investments increased to $527 million, during the first quarter. With the majority of these investments focused on our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion and turnarounds at the refinery and our Berre, France facility.","During the first quarter, we increased our cash and liquid investment by $577 million to end with a balance of nearly $3 billion. Over the past 12 months, we generated $5.7 billion of cash from operations and again used a nearly equal amount for dividends and share repurchases.","After investments in our capital program, our borrowing and other activities, the cash and liquid investment balance inclined by approximately $600 million. Slide 8 provides a longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchased shares.","Additionally, it has allowed us to access favorable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB plus, EAA 1 credit rating. We finished the quarter with approximately $5 billion of liquidity and the total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.2.","Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 12.3 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased approximately 155 million shares or approximately 27% of the initial shares outstanding.","At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 3 million shares remaining on the existing authorization. In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early March. We proposed that our shareholders vote to authorize an additional repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares.","During February, we received gross profits of $184 million from the sale of Petroken, our wholly owned subsidiary in Argentina. The Petroken polypropylene sale provided an after-tax gain of $78 million, $57 million is booked to the O&P Americas segment, while $21 million is related to the PP compounding business and booked to O&P EAI.","The gain represents an $0.18 per share impact from our first quarter earnings. Before, I wrap up. I want to point out a few other items that may help you modeling of our company. First, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5%, slightly higher than our annual estimates.","The first quarter was impacted by discrete [ph] tax events and our estimate for the full year remains unchanged at 28%. Depreciation amortization and interest expenses are currently running at rates in-line with our previous annual estimate.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob.","Bob Patel","Thanks, Thomas. Let turn to Slide 9 and review segment results. As mentioned previously, by discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impact of the LCM inventory charges.","In our olefins and polyolefins, Americas segment. First quarter EBITDA was $878 million, a $44 million improvement over the fourth quarter. This includes a $57 million gain from the sale of Petroken. Relative to the previous quarter, olefins results were relatively unchanged. Ethylene prices declined by approximately $0.005 per pound and our margin slightly declined as we incurred and estimated $20 million negative impact related to ethylene purchases in preparation for our Corpus Christi plan turnaround.","Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter. Averaging 94%, with similar high rates seen across the North American industry. 69% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 88% came from NGLs. In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $20 million. Results were driven by lower polyolefins spreads of approximately $0.04 per pound, with price declines partially offset by lower ethylene cost.","Declines in polyethylene were partially offset by improved polypropylene results, which spread the expanding by approximately $0.06 per pound over the fourth quarter. Polypropylene volumes were relatively unchanged with improved US volumes offset by the absence of Petroken volumes from also the first quarter.","During April, spot ethylene prices have improved over first quarter averages, as supply has tightened during a heavy industry turnaround season. The quarter is benefitting from a $0.05 per pound March, polyethylene price increase.","Polypropylene prices may decline by few cents during the quarter, but demand and margins remain strong. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion began last week with completion plan during the third quarter.","We currently estimate this to impact second quarter results by approximately $10 million and third quarter by approximately $40 million. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review performance in the olefins and polyolefins, Europe, Asia and international segment.","During the first quarter, underlying EBITDA was $549 million or $98 million higher than the fourth quarter. These results include a $21 million gain from the Petroken sale. Olefins results improved by approximately $65 million with reduced cost for naphtha and other fees, outpacing a decline in ethylene prices.","Our ethylene production volume was relatively unchanged as both periods included the impact of a planned turnaround. Utilization of an advantaged feedstocks increased by 7% of ethylene production to provide a $15 million advantage over naphtha during the quarter. Operating rates for the ethylene industry during the first quarter had been reported at 91%, a level that has not been seen in Europe since the first quarter of 2008.","In polyolefins, improved results were driven by higher margins. European polyethylene spreads increased by approximately $0.01 per pound, while polypropylene spreads improved by approximately $0.02 per pound. Our polypropylene compounding and equity income was relatively unchanged.","During April, global markets continued to tighten on strong demand with occasional reports of olefins and polyolefins shortages across various geographies and end uses. Next week, we anticipate completion of our Berre turnaround. Now please turn to Slide 11 for discussion intermediates and derivatives segment.","First quarter EBITDA was $354 million, an improvement of $68 million from the fourth quarter. Results for propylene oxide and derivatives and oxyfuels were relatively unchanged. The improvement in I&D was largely driven by higher volumes and margins in the intermediate chemicals business.","Styrene margins improved by approximately $0.02 per pound versus the fourth quarter. Our asset yields, C4 chemicals and the ethylene oxide and derivatives businesses all benefited from volume improvements relative to the fourth quarter, when we performed maintenance.","Oxyfuels were relatively unchanged as low seasonal margins were offset by volume improvements. April has exhibited continued tightness for styrene that has supported strong pricing. Oxyfuel margins have started to rebound from winter levels. And methanol prices continued to be pressured by additional capacity entering the market, with some offset from higher crude oil prices.","Let's move to Slide 12 for discussion of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $14 million, a decline of $54 million from the prior quarter. During the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined by $0.69 per barrel to average $17.86 for the quarter and crude throughput averaged 186,000 barrels per day.","Rates were impacted by our planned turnaround and some unplanned maintenance. The cost of the RINs was relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. And you may be aware, a fire occurred in one of our two corporate processing units at the refinery on April 8. While we have not yet completed the investigation to determine the cause and full impact of the incident. We have continued to operate the refinery during the two weeks, following the fire and we expect to operate, at approximately 75% of full throughput during the second quarter.","At the current time, we expect that repairs to return the refinery to full processing capability can be completed before the end of the second quarter. At current market conditions and repair expectations. We estimate a $40 million to $70 million second quarter impact.","Our technology segment continued to perform well, with an $18 million improvement to $73 million of EBITDA during the first quarter. Turning back to the O&P segments, Slide 13 describes how our integrated positions in the ethylene chain help provide consistent profitability. The left chart illustrates the balance of ethylene production and consumption among products in the US and relative to our wholly owned and joint venture share globally.","In the US, typically less than 20% of our sales are into the merchant markets. In addition to our polyethylene integration. Approximately one quarter of our US ethylene production is consumed internally in products and processes including ethylene oxide, styrene, vinyl acetate and metathesis. On a global basis, our ethylene positions relatively balanced.","The right chart illustrates, how polyethylene is partially offsetting moderation of regional ethylene margins and improving our capture of the full obtained margins established by global price of polymers.","Turning to Slide 14, this slide provides a similar view of the propylene chain. In the US, our propylene oxide business consumes approximately one-third of our propylene production. Although, we're short of propylene both in the US and globally. We're comfortable with our strong, long-term supply arrangement in all regions. With the addition of new on purpose propylene production from PDH and MTO technology around the world. We believe, that the world will be well supplied for the foreseeable future.","In expansion of polypropylene margins illustrated by the prices and spreads on the right chart, has leveraged our leading global position in the propylene market. And with lower propylene pricing, the lower absolute price of polypropylene has driven strong demand growth globally.","Slide 15 illustrates the impact of new capacity and new technologies on the global ethylene market. As we've discussed before, we believe that global demand growth in ethylene chain will continue to support effective operating rates between 90% and 93%. This is the zone, that we have operated in since late 2014 and where the market will typically behave in a balanced type manner, depending on maintenance schedules and operational reliability.","While the upcoming capacity additions may create periods of disruptions in local markets. The global market should be able to absorb these additions, reasonably quickly. In the first quarter of 2016, the industry appeared to shift from a balanced market toward the high-end of this transitioning zone.","We estimate that, first quarter industry effective operating rates were 95% in the US, 91% in Europe and about 90% in Asia. Today, global conditions are quite tight. The chart on the right, describes why we believe that new and rapid additions of methanol to olefins based ethylene capacity in China, is beginning to play a role in establishing a high cost floor for global ethylene chain pricing.","While naphtha and LPG economics drive the majority of global ethylene supply. The last incremental global supply is increasingly filled by production from new China MTO price. Early in the first quarter, ethylene price was supported by this high cost floor and as we entered the spring demand and turnaround season, global supply demand tightened and March prices reflect the transition from a balance to tight global market that is approximately $0.15 per pound above this high cost floor.","With approximately $0.25 per pound lower cost than MTO. US ethane-based production should continue to benefit from strong operating rates. Let me conclude with Slide 16.","The first quarter developed, as we anticipated. We continued to see strong and growing demand for our polyolefin products in all regions. This supported full chain margins for our O&P business. Our I&D segment benefitted from higher volumes after completion of fourth quarter maintenance and strengthening styrene margins.","Refining results were impacted by the turnaround and seasonally lower industry spreads. We're actively managing our portfolio, with a successful European bond placement. The completion of our Argentine divestiture, our second polypropylene compounding acquisition in India and continuation of the share repurchase program.","Looking forward, we see olefins and polyolefins markets remaining tight during the near-term. There are heavy turnaround schedules in both the US and Asia. The recent rise in crude oil prices provides tailwinds for both pricing and demand, as customers no longer feel incentives to delay purchases, in hopes of future declines in product prices.","In field markets, we're realizing typical seasonal spread improvements that support both our oxyfuels and refining businesses. Planned maintenance at our facilities is expected to impact second quarter results by approximately $20 million to $30 million and the refinery repair will impact results by an additional $40 million to $70 million. The supply and inventories of natural gas and NGL feedstocks remain strong and we expect pricing to remain favorable for the foreseeable future.","We're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne of Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne","I'm curious to your view on whether you think the European polyethylene price premium over the US is sustainable longer term and the opposite on polypropylene pricing, with the premium in the US, is that sustainable longer term? And then secondly, as the US polyethylene industry shifts to a more export-oriented market down the road, here in the next few years. Where do you anticipate your incremental exports are going to go? Can you move them into Europe?","Bob Patel","Good morning, Steve. First of all, on the European markets and even your question about US. So I think you got to step back and look at operating rates globally. I think, we're in a regime where operating rates are balanced, in that balanced zone to tight zone.","In Europe, PE prices have held up well. We think operating rates are relatively high. We're moving into a seasonally strong period. So I suspect that, generally polyolefin prices will be pretty resilient in Europe, for the foreseeable future, going into Q3. In the case of USPP prices, a very large gap had developed between Asia and the US.","And we had anticipated that some of that gap would need to be narrowed. Now part of that's happened with Asian polypropylene prices moving up in Q1 and part of that has been with PP price declining some in the US. I think, those things are coming back in the balance. But if you step back, we'll likely land in a zone, where margins are very good from a historical perspective. And I suspect that, given where operating rates are. We should be able to sustain that or for some period of time, you know.","In terms of your last question, about exports. Our marginal export from the US, should go to Asia, that's really the destination. To the extent, that we produce products in the US. And we could supplement our production in Europe. We might consider doing that, but we have a big base in Europe already. So we're really well positioned I think to optimize globally. We have a great marketing position in Asia. We have a big presence in Europe and so our shift is really moving more to global optimization in polyolefins, as this new capacity comes on. I think, we're well positioned to capture value in that regard.","Stephen Byrne","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan Chase.","Jeff Zekauskas","In your refinery operation, in the quarter you just reported. Did maintenance activity lower EBITDA by $40 million or what's the different number?","Bob Patel","Well, we didn't really quote a number around the maintenance. And I'll look to Doug in minute, but our refining segment results reflected a few things. We came into the year, as an industry here in the US, with pretty high inventories of gasoline. Diesel demand has been struggling, so we saw margins come in. I mentioned the crack spread declined some, one premiums had come in as well. And then in addition to that, we had our crude unit and coker turnaround which took some capacity out during the period. So it was a combination of both.","Doug Pike","Yes, Jeff I think you're in the right, ballpark and the guidance that we gave before and you see it in the volumes being down, so that's where you see that predominantly. But also, what you found in the first quarter versus fourth quarter was there was a Maya 2-1-1 declined a little bit. So you saw some impact from that and naturally, when you're in a turnaround period, your mix and yields tend to be affected. So there's some impact of that, in that quarter. So it's a combination of those things.","Jeff Zekauskas","Sure. And for my follow-up, what's your tentative date for when you'll be fully up and running after your $800 million pound expansion?","Bob Patel","We're expecting the latter half of the year of Q3.","Jeff Zekauskas","The latter half of Q3. Okay, good. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Roberts of UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts","I think you originally expected $162 million in proceeds from the Argentine sale, did it come in at that level?","Bob Patel","Yes, generally we came in at the level we had expected.","John Roberts","Okay.","Bob Patel","$180 million cash for the proceeds.","John Roberts","Okay, thank you. And then, is polyethylene from recycled material globally larger or smaller than MTO? And kind of where does it sit on the cost curve? I'm thinking that's also been one of the swing factors out there recently in balancing polyethylene markets.","Bob Patel","It has some, but we think that as we move into the next couple of years. MTO will really be the bigger picture because if you look at Asian capacity expansions on ethylene. I think about half of them are MTO, CTO type of capacity. So more and more I think that last increment will become more of the price setter as we go forward.","John Roberts","Because you don't think recycled has been a major factor in helping to tighten the market here because it would be high cost as oil came down.","Bob Patel","Yes, I think it has been a factor. I think it's been a factor, but it's a combination of that and the need for MTO for new sort of virgin polyethylene, if you will. That's created demand for the virgin polyethylene.","John Roberts","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is now open.","David Begleiter","Bob, just on polypropylene. It should also be, I guess a good Q2, but what's your expectation for polypropylene margins in the back half of the year versus maybe the first half of the year?","Bob Patel","I think, we're still going to see a pretty balanced type market for some time and there's not really a lot of investment in the Q. And albeit, polymer plants don't take as long, as crackers do to build, it still takes some time to do engineering and get permits and so on. So our expectation is that, the polypropylene market globally should do reasonably well and certainly in the US, operating rates will be fairly high through this year and into next year.","David Begleiter","Very good. And just lastly on styrene, Bob. Do you expect these strong conditions continue through the remainder of 2016?","Bob Patel","Yes, I think so. I think styrene has been very resilient. Demand is growing, much like polypropylene. It's been under invested for so many years and we're seeing demand growth in the case of styrene in the last couple of years at reasonable levels. So, we think we're again in that operating rate zone. Where any outages would cause margins to stay relatively strong.","David Begleiter","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And now the next question comes from the line of Mr. Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Vincent Andrews","Obviously, we all know it is a big turnaround season, underway. But one of things that's changed over the past months or so, is that. The sort of length of the season appears to have extended as a couple of cracker turnarounds have been pushed out, later into the year. I'm just wondering, what impact do you think that will have in terms of how the market, how and when the market will reset itself, close to turnaround season in terms of, it seems like there'll probably be some pretty good pricing into the season.","And there's a lot of concern about what happens to price thereafter. So, any thoughts on that would be helpful?","Bob Patel","So if you look at April - May timeframe between - planned our outages are around the 10% range. But I think the shift of that, one cracker turnaround into the fall creates a tighter environment in the fall as well. Now so, our view is that, that with these planned outages being at a higher level now in the fall as well.","We see a pretty tight market through Q3 and so far, we see pretty good demand growth, not only in the US, but globally. So, we expect pretty good market conditions through Q3 certainly.","Vincent Andrews","Okay and just as a follow-up, Sasol recently announced delay in the start-up of their Gulf Coast cracker and it appears there are some subtext from that, was that in the low oil price environment, there's some funding issues. As you look around the world to some of the other planned capacity over the coming years, do you think it's plausible that we'll see delays for funding reasons as well?","Bob Patel","Well, I think the delays could come from, not only funding but just general project delays from executions as well. I think, Vincent that this, so called second wave of cracker certainly would need to be evaluated and to what degree globally the MTO capacity will come on and. We have in our materials, the operating rates for ethylene and you see based on the current planned production increases in 18, there's a slight dip in operating rates and certainly, some of the delays occurred, it could see a much flatter operating rate curve in that balanced zone.","And I think there's a possibility of that, that's an outcome of this lower oil price environment. And we've talked about this in other venues, in other in IR sort of meetings that in a lower oil price environment Greenfield cracker investments looked to high single-digit kind of returns. So I think it's feasible that some of this could get pushed out.","Vincent Andrews","Thanks very much.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. your line is now open.","Arun Viswanathan","I guess I had a question, maybe can you describe the inventory environment out there. Do you think, your customers have built inventory in Q4 and Q1 as well, ahead of the turnaround season?","Bob Patel","I think the inventories are at normal level. I don't think they're overly excessive downstream because while there was turnaround season anticipated, oil prices were also dropping. So that caused people not to build too much because maybe there was some expectation, of prices coming down and polyethylene prices did decline earlier in the first quarter and then they moved up recently.","So, I don't see Arun. I don't see inventory is being theme here. The bigger theme is, is improving seasonal demand which we typically see in this April - May timeframe not only in US, but globally. And fairly heavy turnaround season here in the US and in Asia.","Arun Viswanathan","Okay, thank you. And then maybe you can just describe, your views on the refining segment. Would you still characterize that as core or and something you'd invest in or is it harvest mode [ph], what are your plans are there, thanks?","Bob Patel","It's a refinery there, that you know it's very complex, large scale refinery. It's here in Houston in very prime real estate. We like it, we like the asset and it generates good cash flow that we can deploy elsewhere. I don't think it's a segment where we would aim to grow, but certainly we view it as an important part of the cash generation capability of our company and deploying that cash, elsewhere in other segment that we see as being more strategic perhaps.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.","Aleksey Yefremov","Back to MTO question, what percent of global demand do you think is supplied by non-integrated MTO? So merchants methanol buyers and also, what are the operating rates for those MTO units currently?","Bob Patel","The amount is maybe in the 2% to 3% range. It's not a lot, but it's enough and is needed today to meet that last increment of demand and as I mentioned earlier. If you look forward and you look at the amount of expansion that are planned in Asia, quite a bit of the new capacity is going to be based on MTO and CTO.","So I think it's important to think about that becoming a more meaningful slice of demand that will be price setter. And then in terms of operating rates, that's more difficult question to really asses because it's need based right. So, we do know that today MTO is needed and that's really to the extent that I can answer that question.","Aleksey Yefremov","Thank you. And as a follow-up, turning to asset yields and VAM specifically. Two of your competitors announced plans or at least consideration for VAM expansion in North America. Have you looked into this and have you made a conclusion whether this is, all of interest to you or not?","Bob Patel","Well, we're basic in methanol. VAM, we see as another ethylene derivative. So just kind of bit a high level and we would evaluate VAM, like we would any other ethylene derivative. So, you know that's how we think about it. It's one of our ethylene derivatives.","Aleksey Yefremov","No current plans or evaluation of?","Bob Patel","No, nothing that we've announced, no.","Aleksey Yefremov","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Don Carson","Bob, I want to go to Slide 15. You outlined your views of global ethylene supply and demand. Can you talk a bit about your outlook for feedstocks in the US specifically ethane availability and do you see propane perhaps you know capping, how high ethane can get on the basis of increased demand from these new crackers?","Bob Patel","Yes, I mean I think certainly that interplayed between ethane, propane and butane as important. and as we come into the summer months, propane and butane tend to price lower and are more abundant here in the US. But let me talk a little bit about ethane and we know, this is a topic that's on a lot of people's mind.","If you think about different time horizons. Think about the very near term. We still think, there's a significant amount of rejection that's occurring in the US and some of that nearby the Gulf Coast in some of the shale play like the Eagle Ford and the Permian and so on. So we think in the near-term, there's plenty of ethane available and certainly during this turnaround season. There's a little bit less ethane demand.","As we go into the second half of the year in Q3, there's still quite a bit few turnarounds. So I think between that and propane and butane becoming more competitive in the cracker feed slate in the summer month, ethane should do quite well. Longer term, I can't help to think that with all of the reduction in E&P CapEx that eventually, this should be a price response, in oil. And we've seen a bit of that already with fairly big move in oil price recently.","And as the oil price moves higher presumably that makes propane and butane more valuable. And likely I think wet gas more desirable to develop. And so we think that, that the crude to gas ratio should be favorable. We think, that wet gas ought to be more desirable to produce and that in the end, that ethane demand increase overtime will be met with more supply and we've seen that in the past, where the midstream space is able to respond pretty quickly.","The infrastructure to the west is still fairly scalable. New fractionation capacity can be added very quickly. The capital cycle is far, far less than that for crackers. So in the end, I mean I think if I stand back, I think about there's a plenty of hydrocarbon here and ethane available.","It's a matter of degree of advantage and I do think that, Greenfield investment will need to be undertaken more carefully in a $60, $65 oil environment compared to the $100 plus kind of oil environment. So that's how I see ethane, you know short, medium and longer term.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar","I just wanted to ask you another question on this ethane, propane. And it's, as you see the new cracker start-up and also you have this ethane exports. And at what point in time at what price, you think the ethane export has become unviable and how do you see, exports playing a role in ethane pricing?","Bob Patel","Yes, I think some of the ethane exports are needed for just feedstocks. I don't - I think they're going to be independent of price and some are more sensitive to price. And the thing you have to look is propane based, ethylene economics in Europe, compared to landed ethane from the US and what economics that would infer about ethylene in Europe.","So some of that could change, but again more importantly I think P.J. there will be a reasonable supply response, if ethane prices were to rise and I think fundamentally there's plenty of ethane available and the ability - for ethane to provide a turn on, is a relatively shorter time period then that for ethylene.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you and for follow-up. I think Bob you mentioned that, roughly 20% of your ethylene is merchant ethylene and you announced potentially a new polyethylene plant. Would that basically close your merchant position, when the plant comes online?","Bob Patel","No, it wouldn't close it completely. And frankly, P.J. we'd like to have some merchants positions. It's for us, that's another sort of optimization now that we have. Our ethylene and derivative value chain and as many of you know, we also can convert ethylene and propylene through our metathesis process. So when we think about merchant, we can kind of balance through producing propylene, but our aim longer term, is to have that merchant position somewhere in the 10% to 15% range overtime, and if you think about back in 2013 and 2014, that merchant position clearly served as well as part ethylene prices expanded.","And so we'll have those kind periods and we think that, having some merchant position provide the opportunity to optimize the value chain even more.","P.J. Juvekar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is now open.","Hassan Ahmed","Bob, just wanted to revisit the whole MTO side of things. It seems to me that last couple of quarters, as ethylene prices have continued to come down. It seemed that there were a few new sort of MTO facilities in China, which were mechanically complete, but are still waiting for some sort of stability or positive inflection in ethylene pricing to start up. Now what's your view? Are those facilities beginning to come online? And the reason I asked that because obviously that could have a meaningful impact on methanol demand in pricing.","Bob Patel","Well certainly, and it's difficult to assess unit-by-unit, but again if you step back and you look at demand growth. It seems to me, that more of the demand growth in Asia will be met by, it will be met with MTO-based polyethylene production. And so, today we're kind of in this period of trying to assess how many units are running or not and so on. And I think as we move through this year and go into next year. MTO will be an important part of satisfying their last increment of demand. And will be a more consisted price setter.","Hassan Ahmed","Fair enough. Now moving onto the I&D segment. The sort of production volume numbers that you guys provide on a segment-by-segment level basis. Within that, if I take a look at the asset yield silo. It seems that there were big sort of jumps up on a year-over-year as well as quarter-over-quarter basis.","If I have these numbers right, asset yields was up production volume-wise 28% year-over-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter. Now I know, there was some turnaround activities in Q4, but I'm just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of these sort of big volume moves.","Bob Patel","I think, it is turnaround, but that turnaround was a very big turnaround in Q4 and it went a little longer that we had expected. So, I would say Q4 volume was lower even more so than we had expected because of the turnaround and the volumes are sustainable. Our contract portfolio is set up such that, Q1 volumes are kind of what you're expecting.","Hassan Ahmed","So but what sort of underlying call it with within acetate and VAM, what sort of underlying demand growth are you seeing globally?","Bob Patel","We're seeing reasonably good demand growth. I don't think it's anything unusually above trend line. But it's fairly steady from our perspective.","Doug Pike","Hassan, I think the larger changes that you're seeing are really related to the two methanol plants and their output and turnaround in maintenance activity with them. And if you know as you look back, recall in 2014, the channel, the plant didn't run at full capacity. Adjustments were made in 2015, we bring that to full capacity late in 2015. You had the report [ph] turnaround. So I think what you're seeing is basically methanol volumes and maintenance and turnaround schedules.","Hassan Ahmed","Very good, thank you guys.","Bob Patel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Bob Koort","Bob, I was looking into your supply demand curve, it looks like maybe there's a little iteration for some slower demand there. So the operating rate comes down a little bit, more than maybe we'd seen in the past going into 18. And I guess relative to the interesting chart, you have on the right side of the Slide 15. I'm wondering, how should we think about the margin half, as we go to those operating rates that look similar maybe there's 2012 or 2013 period. I mean, I recall back then the naphtha guys in Asia didn't make any money. So should we assume pricing would go on top of that MTO, north of Asia MTO price or is, there's some reason to think maybe they could retain some margin in that kind of global operating rate environment.","Bob Patel","I think again, it depends on how that balance develops, but if we step back. The way I think about this cycle, whatever it turns out to be. It looks to be fairly shallow. I think there's a few characteristics about what lies ahead that's different then what we've had in the past. In the past decades or past cycles.","Now this time, first of all we don't see operating rates dropping into the low 80s, like we've seen in the past. This is kind of around 90% plus or minus depending on timing of capacity expansion, how demand develops as you say. The other thing that I think is very different about this cycle was, the US is positioning in the top quartile of the cost curve. So we're going to run our asset hard.","And if you think about the fourth quartile, MTO does become more meaningful, as time goes on. And so to your point, that ought to be more and more the price setter. And as all price rises going into presumably rises, going into 17 and 18. We ought to see, the slope of this cost curve maybe you know inch up some and so, you got to look at margins I think in that context. And also the operating rates, they're going to be on either side of balance. They're not dropping as low as 80%, as they have in the past.","Bob Koort","Got it, that's helpful. Thank you.","Bob Patel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jim Sheehan of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Jim Sheehan","Could you take a little bit about free cash flow in the quarter? It dipped a little bit. What is your outlook for free cash flow for the rest of the year? And do you think, that working capital changes influence what happened in the first quarter?","Bob Patel","Well, I'll start with that and then Thomas will supplement certainly. I think, first of all working capital changes. We don't think they're going to significantly - we're not going to be really material with our cash flow development.","If you look back at the last 12 months, our free cash flow yield is been about 10%, 11% in that range. They've been double digits for quite some time. So I think our cash flow generation should continue to be pretty strong and Thomas, I don't know if you want to add more.","Thomas Aebischer","No, I don't think I can add more here. The cash flow generation for 2016 is going to be strong, as we've seen in the past. As we have talked at our year-end call. The CapEx expenditures are going to be higher in 2016 versus 2015. So that obviously, when we look at the free cash flow perspective were impacted, but we're expecting strong cash flow generation, net working capital no significant changes expected to-date.","Jim Sheehan","Very good and also on, could you talk about the - how you're thinking about M&A these days. Is there any view to diversifying the company further or how would you look at? You've got a very strong balance sheet here. Where does M&A fall in your uses of cash priorities?","Bob Patel","Well, there's really no change in our position regarding M&A. I think, I've talked about this entire call, so that we like first of all from a portfolio standpoint. We think that, the O&P and I&D value change provide a very white plain field and then I think, both play to our strengths of running large scale operations, safely, reliability. We know how to manage cost well.","We understand cycles and we know, how to do well in all parts of cycle. So as we think about cash flow deployment. And we think about various options and certainly, we study all kinds of alternative. So I don't think our positions has changed on M&A.","Jim Sheehan","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Mr. Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Sir your line is now open.","Frank Mitsch","And just quickly follow-up on that, that obviously begs the questions. You're on share buyback, you're going to your shareholders to get more approval. Is this 2.8% per quarter rate is at kind of the baseline thinking right now?","Bob Patel","Yes, so in May. Frank, hopefully get approval for this next 10% and we'll commence that program. Our approach is been, we would do these 10% programs up to 18 months kind of timeframe. So, we'll evaluate that, you've seen us increase the pace in Q4, when we thought it was even better value in our shares and so, I think we'll continue to evaluate that.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you and then following up on I&D. The PO and derivatives business of material volume growth sequential and you also pointed out, how the PG margins were essentially flat Q1 versus Q4. But you said, that your margins were down due to sales mix. Can you elaborate on what's going on in that business and what we should be expecting in Q2 and beyond?","Bob Patel","Well I&D in terms of Q1, it was really on oxyfuels. We had a couple of things going on there. Seasonally, Q1 is usually weak in terms of margins. And in addition to that, as I mentioned during the refining discussion, when premiums came in, gasoline inventories were high. So it was kind of an unusual period where, in additional to the seasonal impacts. We had some down draft in margins and we kind of see, already we see oxyfuel margins coming back.","So that was an important feature, but frankly part of that was offset by pretty good styrene margins and we think those should continue.","Doug Pike","And frank, within the volumes as you look at the volumes. If you recall fourth quarter, we had maintenance turnaround at our French, PO plant. So that affects both the propylene oxide and the oxyfuels businesses. And then, we also had the maintenance going on across ethylene glycol and the acetyl.","So fourth quarter volumes pretty heavily affected by maintenance. First quarter really reflects all assets up and running. There's a little bit of mix effect across PO. You got to compare it as a global business and as different events occur in the industry, often with other players. Which parts of the globe you're going to be supplying.","But in general, I think if you went back over our past five years. The way you see is a typical comment about propylene oxide and derivatives is a very stable quarter-to-quarter profitability.","Frank Mitsch","And in terms of the mix effects, that's really a Q1 sort of an issue and not something that we should count on for Q2 and beyond.","Bob Patel","[Indiscernible] fuel, seasonality. I think that's when you boil it down, kind of net-net, that's what it is.","Frank Mitsch","Thank you, so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Nils Wallin of CLSA. Sir, your line is now open.","Nils Wallin","I was wondering, if you could update on your thoughts on PO\/TBA plant, when you would expect to make a final decision and if you do go ahead with it, how that might affect your ability or your interest in doing buybacks while it is being built?","Bob Patel","So, we're progressing that project. We're doing detailed engineering as we speak and we would expect sometime in the first half of next year to make final investment decision, with a projected start-up date of about mid-2020. And that's currently where we on that project, Nils. And we evaluate lot of different scenarios in terms of our cash flow deployment and so on.","And so I would say, more broadly I see us being able to support and continue to invest in that project through whatever is ahead of us in the next three four years and in terms of share buybacks, we're always evaluating that as one of our options in deploying cash flows.","So when you look further out, I think we're going to continue to develop a variety of options. But remember, our aim is to meaningfully create shareholder value and continue to generate the strong cash flow, that we've been known to generate.","Nils Wallin","Of course, that's helpful. Thanks. And just another questions back on ethane. I think that they understand is that those, plenty of ethane out there in terms of you know potential capacity supply and rejection. But I'm curious as the new plants, new ethylene plants come on stream. Do we have to get the sources of ethane from further out locations like the Marcellus or the Bakken and how might those deliver cost to supply the incremental demand effect the ethane price?","Bob Patel","I think there could be periods where Marcellus ethane is needed, but if you think about the amount of new consumptive capacity that's coming. It's something in that 400,000 barrels per day sort of range, by mid-to-late 18s. But the price of ethane, I think where it also needs to be considered in the context of, propane price in the context of butane price. And also, if Marcellus ethane is needed then you know my view is that, Eagle Ford ethane and Permian and Haynesville is even more profitable because it's much closer to Gulf Coast.","So I would imagine that there would some supply response from more closer in production of ethane and the market is out of balance.","Nils Wallin","Got it, that's very helpful. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander","Just two quick ones. What's your thinking now about the incentive to shut naphtha capacity given the MTO dynamic that you outlined? And secondly, as you think about the European prospects in the medium term. The extent that ethane exports can effectively provide an alternate for the price mechanism and possibly provide a bit of support of naphtha margins in Europe.","Bob Patel","Well I think first of all in terms of naphtha crackers. We're not expecting rationalization either in Europe or in Asia, for naphtha crackers. Most of what was going to get done earlier in the decade. And as far as ethane setting the ethylene price in Europe. I don't think that's going to be the case because I think the mainstream market still kind of settles on naphtha and supply demand and I expect that to continue. But I suspect that those who have the ability to crack something other than imported methane. Then they'll kind of run those economics and they'll import more or less depending on whether ethane based ethylene make sense in Europe or not. I don't think that will become a price setter in Europe.","Laurence Alexander","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the lien of Mr. Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jonas Oxgaard","So question on ethylene North America. So you're adding another couple of hundred thousand tonnes. Other people are adding left and right and no derivatives. How much more ethylene do you think, North America can absorb being going to cash cost? And when would that happen, you think?","Bob Patel","Well, I think it's just sort of timing of derivatives and ethylene expansions and when you kind of look at turnarounds and so on, these increments are not that big to change the underlying ethylene supply demand dynamic. So our sense is that, there's still more derivative capacity in the aggregate and that, we ourselves have already a view on, where we're going to place our ethylene. So and longer term, I think we'll see more derivatives come on and some of these cracker start up. So we don't see it quite that dramatic frankly.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay, how long would it actually take for you to get your derivatives online, once you finally announce it?","Bob Patel","Well, so our polyethylene expansion that we're advancing. We're aiming for sometime in 2019 to have production.","Jonas Oxgaard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And at this point, we have no further questions in the queue. Speakers you may proceed.","Bob Patel","Okay, well thank you. Well let me just close with few comments before everyone disconnects. I want to just summarize by telling you, little bit about where I think our priorities are for Q2. To me, they're pretty clear. I think we got to get the refinery expeditiously and safely return to normal operation.","We have our large turnaround at Corpus Christi and the expansion that will follow. For as I mentioned, we're aiming to start that up in late Q3. And then ultimately, we had a more higher level. Our aim is to really maximize cash flow during this very balanced and tight market environment, not only in the US but globally. From a financial perspective, assuming that we receive shareholder approval will start our fourth 10% share repurchase program in May and so we look forward to updating you on progress on all these items and others in July. Thanks for your continued interest in our company.","Operator","Thank you and that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"14326":["LyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 27, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Douglas J.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Doug Pike, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas J. Pike","Thank you, Brian. Well, hello and welcome to LyondellBasell\u2019s second quarter 2012 teleconference. I\u2019m joined today by Jim Gallogly, our CEO; Karyn Ovelmen, our CFO; and Sergey Vasnetsov, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning and Transactions.","Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call, and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. I'd also like you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, and these forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

And during today's call, we'll focus on second quarter 2012 performance, the current environment, and the near-term outlook.","With that being said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim.","James J. Gallogly","Thank you for joining our earnings call. As Doug mentioned, a set of presentation slides accompany this call, and are available on our website.","Let\u2019s begin by taking a look at page 4 and reviewing a few financial highlights. Net income was $768 million and EBITDA was $1.77 billion. The quarter included some charges and gains that are not reflective of the underlying business and exclusive of these, net income was $939 million.","Our earnings per share were $1.33 or $1.66 exclusive of the charges and gains that I referenced. Karyn and I will discuss the quarter in detail, but I thought I would quickly summarize a few highlights and trends.","The North American olefins, we benefited from increased ethylene margins. Raw material costs declined as the quarter progressed. European olefins results exceeded expectations as raw material costs declined in advance of product price declines resulting in margin expansion.","All the olefins sales volumes declined reflecting weak economic conditions. Intermediate and derivative results remain strong and were consistent with the first quarter. We\u2019ve restructured our reporting. Oxyfuels are now part of the I&D segment. Karyn will provide more color on this.","Our earnings release also includes an attachment with additional details. Houston refinery spreads increased as the Maya 2-1-1 averaged approximately $23.15 per barrel. However, byproduct values remain weak. Our Berre refinery is now accounted for as a discontinued operation.","During the quarter, we resolved a past insurance claim related to Hurricane Ike, and recognized a gain of $100 million, and we raised our interim dividend by 60% to $0.40 per quarter. The second quarter was challenging for the entire chemical industry in terms of a sluggish economy and volatile energy costs. However, our company met this challenge with highly focused, disciplined, and effective execution, and delivered very strong results. In fact, the second quarter was the all-time record underlying EBITDA quarter for the company.","We also had record quarterly profits for three out of four of our main segments; Americas O&P, EAI, and I&D. However, there are some items, such as the changes in reporting and premiums paid for financing that may create some confusion. Karyn and I will address these during the call.","In addition to continued strong financial results, our environmental health and safety results have been very good. On slide number 5, we've updated our safety data and you can see a continuing trend. I believe that our safety record is very near to best-in-class.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Karyn to discuss some key elements of our financial performance.","Karyn F. Ovelmen","","Thanks, Jim. Please turn to slide number 6, which charts our first quarter and last 12 months segment EBITDA, the almost $1.8 billion of EBITDA reflects a $550 million increase over the first quarter.","From a segment perspective during the second quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA was $776 million. The Olefins products alone generated approximately $615 million, even while one of our largest plants was in turnaround for a month during the quarter. O&P-EAI produced over $330 million of EBITDA, including $59 million from JV dividends. The Olefins plants benefited as declining naphtha cost outpaced the product price declines.","However, Polyolefin operations were near breakeven and sales volumes declined significantly. Consistent with past quarters differentiated Polyolefin products in our joint ventures performed well.","Intermediates & Derivatives segments results continued to be very good as both the Chemical products and Oxyfuel results were relatively unchanged versus the first quarter. The Refining segment generated approximately $160 million of EBITDA, this only includes the Houston refinery results as the Berre refinery is reported as a discontinued operation and Oxyfuels are now included in the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. These results include $53 million from the Hurricane Ike insurance settlement.","The Technology segment performance was steady with EBITDA of approximately $50 million. The bar chart on the right depicts the last 12 months EBITDA by segment, recast to include the impact of this segment realignment and discontinued operations. Over the period, total EBITDA was approximately $5.6 billion.","Approximately 45% was generated from O&P Americas, while the recast Intermediates & Derivatives segment generated $1.5 billion. This might be a good time for me to discuss discontinued operations and the segment realignment.","The logic behind moving the Berre refinery into discontinued operations is relatively straightforward and dictated by U.S. accounting rules. We ceased operations in January that mothballed the facility and have been selling inventory during the past months. We are in the final stages of our activities and as a result made the U.S. GAAP criteria for discontinued operations presentation.","During the second quarter, the Berre refinery incurred cost of approximately $20 million and realized a gain of approximately $5 million on the sale of inventory. In an appendix to our earnings release we have recast select financial information back through the second half of 2010. This will enable you to clearly understand the impact of the Berre operations on our historic financials.","We also realigned our Refining and Intermediates & Derivative segments moving Oxyfuels from the former to latter. This is consistent with the change in the internal management of this business following our exit from the European refined products business.","Decisions around this business are closely associated with propylene oxide and TBA chemicals businesses. For example, the raw material for Oxyfuel production is derived from the PO\/TBA plants, and the alternative use for this raw material is into the chemical market as isobutylene. In the appendix, we have included selected information, which recast data for this segment realignment.","I also want to point out that the O&P America segment includes a $71 million charge, reflecting a lower of cost or market or LCM adjustments to our inventory. As a LIFO based reporter, the majority of our inventory is held at the cost-basis when the Company formed during the May of 2010. As a result of market price declines, the market value of the inventory pool fell below its book value. This is partially related to the NGL costs. Therefore, we need to adjust the carrying value to the current pricing, an adjustment of this nature occurs because LyondellBasell is a relatively new company and the NGL market has changed considerably over the past two years.","Another item that impacted second quarter earnings was the quarter related to our refinancing. Specifically, the quarter includes $329 million of premiums paid in the write-down of our prior financing costs. These charges reduced our net income by approximately $210 million, and earnings by $0.36 per share. Combining this with the impact of the lower of cost or market and the impact of the insurance claim, our net income was reduced by $191 million or $0.33 per share.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 7 and take a look at the key elements of our cash flow. During the second quarter, cash balances increased by approximately $300 million, closing the quarter near $2 billion. Given our strong earnings, this may fall so much short of your expectations. The key reason for this is that our working capital in the Refining and O&P-EAI businesses increased.","In Refining, we were able to opportunistically secure favorably priced crude oil cargos and this material was in our inventory at the end of the quarter. In EAI, we increased inventory in preparation for third quarter turnaround at our investment side, both increases are temporary and should reverse by year end.","On the right side of this chart, you can see that over the last 12 months our cash balances declined from $4.9 billion to $2 billion. Operations, including working capital generated over $3.1 billion of cash, while usage included approximately $1 billion for CapEx, $1.5 billion of debt repayment, and $3.2 billion in dividends.","While, speaking of cash it is a good opportunity to provide a brief update on our projected capital spending for this year. We ended the year expecting to spend approximately $1.4 billion. We currently believe that spending will be approximately $1.2 billion, the difference results from a combination of more efficient project executions and some changes in spending patterns. There are, however, no major changes in our overall capital plans.","Let\u2019s quickly turn to slide eight and take a look at working capital and some other key metrics. On the left hand chart, you can see the impact of the inventory item that I just mentioned; you can also see that both accounts receivable and payables declined which is consistent with the decline in raw material cost and product prices.","On the right, we have summarizing some key balance sheet and credit statistics. We\u2019ve finished the quarter with $4.35 billion of debt and $2 billion of cash. Our resulting net debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains under 0.5 times.","I'll turn things back to Jim now for a further discussion of our business results.","James L. Gallogly","Thanks, Karyn. Let's discuss segment performance, beginning on slide number 9, with Olefins & Polyolefins America. Second quarter EBITDA was $776 million, an increase of $178 million versus the first quarter. These results include $29 million from the settlement of Hurricane Ike insurance claim, and include the lower of cost or market inventory charge of $71 million.","Underlying Olefins EBITDA was approximately $650 million despite having significant downtime related to the Channelview turnaround, which reduced ethylene production by approximately 150 million pounds during the quarter.","I\u2019d like to discuss a few metrics that put the results in perspective. Relative to the first quarter, our average ethylene price decreased by approximately $0.06 per pound, while the cost of ethylene production metric decreased by approximately $0.13 per pound. The latter decrease was related to the lower cost of both natural gas liquids and naphtha.","Their average ethane cost declined by approximately $0.15 per gallon, propane cracking was competitive with ethane. Naphtha costs declined by approximately $14 per barrel, while in aggregate co-product values were relatively unchanged.","During the quarter, 85% of our ethylene was produced from natural gas liquids with ethane accounting for 66% of ethylene production. Our Midwest Olefins plants were particularly well positioned during the quarter. NGL supply has been very strong in the region, and we have approximately 2.3 billion pounds of Midwest ethylene capacity. At some points during the quarter, raw material prices declined to less than $0.05 a gallon making these plants some of the lowest cost in the world.","Polyolefin results also strengthened versus the first quarter as EBITDA increased by approximately $60 million. Spreads over monomer improved by $0.03 to $0.04 per pound as ethylene and propylene cost declines outpaced polymer price declines.","Polyolefin volumes declined slightly, primarily in polyethylene. However, both domestic and export sales trended upward as the quarter progressed. For example, June polyethylene sales outpaced April by approximately 100 million pounds. Overall, the second quarter was a very good quarter for this segment, and although prices declined as the quarter progressed, the underlying fundamentals that benefitted this segment remain intact. NGL prices have recently increased, but remained low relative to global crude oil prices. July Polyolefin volumes have been somewhat stronger than June.","Before we move to the other segments, let\u2019s spend a few minutes considering the trends that have occurred within the Olefins raw material environment. In the upper left of slide number 10, we applied a benchmark pricing of NGLs and Brent crude oil. Since most of the world\u2019s ethylene production is based on naphtha, the pricing tide to crude oil, while our U.S. production is primarily NGL based, this chart provides a high level indication of the growing advantage enjoyed by our U.S. crackers. It is certainly notable that ethane prices declined by approximately 50%, since beginning of the year.","In the upper right, we have plotted IHS\u2019s estimated cost of ethylene production, both for Asia and the U.S. This very, clearly demonstrates the advantage enjoyed by U.S. producers and the impact of falling raw material cost. This impact was a key driver of our second quarter results. You can also see that the preferred feedstock universe expanded in the U.S. as propane cracking economics rivaled ethane.","On the bottom of the page, we have plotted IHS ethylene margin estimates, which have been very strong. So, our lower NGL price is sustainable, were only related to the first half of the year industry maintenance activity. Undoubtedly, the latter has contributed, but we believe that NGL balances are fundamentally long.","On chart number 11, we have plotted ethane and propane production and inventory statistics. During the final months of 2011 and throughout early 2012, both production and inventory data have been at or near peak levels. The situation has been and continues to be favorable for U.S. ethylene producers. We believe that it will stay this way over the foreseeable future, although we will likely see periods of volatility.","Let's shift our focus to slide number 12 in the Olefins & Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $335 million, a $234 million improvement over the first quarter. The improvement was generated principally through increased European olefins margins and $59 million from joint venture dividends.","Our differentiated products such as polypropylene compounds and Catalloy resins continued to perform well, generating results consistent with prior quarters. Even though June polyolefin volumes were approximately 70 million pounds higher than April, underlying business conditions within Europe were quite weak. This was seen in an approximate 13% reduction in our polyolefin sales volumes and continued weak polyolefin margins versus the first quarter 2012.","Resulting second quarter polyolefin results were only marginally positive, relatively unchanged versus the first quarter. However, olefin results improved substantially. Our EBITDA per pound of ethylene produced increased by approximately $0.19 per pound versus the first quarter when we operated near breakeven. This margin increase was primarily attributed to declining raw material cost as the quarter progressed.","On average, second quarter olefin sales prices exceeded first quarter prices by several cents per pound. However, the pricing trend within the quarter was downward. Ethylene and propylene prices finished the quarter approximately $0.10 per pound below March pricing.","Within Europe, the environment for Olefins & Polyolefins remains difficult and olefin prices declined further in July. As the third quarter progresses, we expect that olefin results will be a more reflective of the weak economic conditions and uncertainties within Europe.","We expect that our differentiated product positions will continue to perform much as they have over the past quarters. We will have a turnaround at one of our German ethylene plants. As previously mentioned, we have prepared for this and anticipate that it will only have a minor impact on our financial results.","Now, please turn to slide number 13 for a discussion of the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $455 million, an increase of $37million from the prior quarter. Included in these results is $18 million related to the Hurricane Ike insurance settlement. Additionally, the results include $14 million of joint venture dividends as we received our first annual dividend from our Chinese propylene oxide joint venture.","Within the segment, underlying results for the propylene oxide and derivatives products, as well as intermediate chemicals were relatively unchanged. You might notice that we have added a graph of the spread between propylene and propylene glycol prices. Although this industry data only captures a subset of the propylene oxide industry, I think that it will help convey trends within the market. You can see that spreads have been relatively steady across the quarters.","As we previously mentioned, the segment now includes our Oxyfuels business, which also generated results consistent with the first quarter. MTBE raw material margins remained strong near $1.25 per gallon. Thus far during the third quarter, underlying business trends are largely unchanged in the second quarter. We have a turnaround at one of our U.S. propylene oxide plants that starts mid-September. We do not expect a significant impact on third quarter EBITDA results from this turnaround.","Let\u2019s move to slide number 14 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $161 million, this includes $53 million from the Hurricane Ike insurance settlement. Of course, under our new segment reporting results only include the Houston refinery. Underlying EBITDA improved by approximately $60 million. Throughput at the refinery was near capacity at 267,000 barrels per day and the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 spread increased by approximately $3 per barrel to average $23.16 per barrel.","Refinery continued to realize a lower than historic yield on the benchmark as the value of byproducts such as petroleum coke remained at crest versus the price of crude oil. We estimate that lower byproduct values impacted our margin by approximately $2 to $3 per barrel versus historic yields.","Looking to the third quarter, July operations have been steady and the Maya 2-1-1 has averaged approximately $25 per barrel. We continue to pursue opportunities to optimize our crude slate. This includes actions such as the opportunistic crude purchases that we made late in the second quarter. We also sometimes lighten our crude mix to take advantage of mid-continent pricing.","Let's step back from the details and summarize the business environment on Slide 15. Our adjusted second quarter results were our best ever, despite a challenging environment. The U.S. business continue to benefit from shale gas opportunities. The magnitude and scope of this drilling and completion technology shift is becoming increasingly evident.","In our O&P-EAI segment, the second quarter benefited from the timing of raw material cost declines. We took advantage of the opportunity, but clearly can't rely on this to be repeated under the uncertain economic situations in Europe. Despite this and other macro uncertainties, the differentiated products within this segment continue their trend of steady performance as did the I&D segment. The Houston refinery ran well, and we continue to develop opportunities to exploit the quality of this asset.","The third quarter started with similar drivers across most of our business areas, but as I said Olefins & Polyolefin prices have declined. We believe that this will manifest itself in weaker European Olefins margins while U.S. margins will continue to benefit from low cost NGLs. Before I take your questions, I want to discuss progress and opportunities reviewed at our Investor Day last year.","First, the operational and financial improvement projects have proceeded as planned. Our refinancing has been completed. The Berre refinery has ceased operations and our European restructuring is proceeding. Our capital projects are also progressing. Today, I'll briefly review the ethane flexibility; methanol restart, European butadiene and La Porte ethylene debottleneck projects.","First, the core of the ethane flexibility project was completed during the Channelview turnaround and this quarter, we are in position to increase ethane feed at the site. The methanol plant restart project is progressing as planned. We have completed our discovery work, contracted the detail engineering and ordered long lead items.","Although we have not received environmental permits, the process is progressing as we had envisioned. We expect to be in a position to restart this 780,000 ton facility during the second half of 2013 at a capital cost of approximately $150 million. At current natural gas and methanol prices, the benefit from the project would be approximately $200 million annually.","The butadiene debottleneck project at Wesseling is the only significant growth project that we're pursuing in Europe. This is a 40% debottleneck of our German facility and the finished product has been contracted, ensuring a good economic return. Construction has begun and we plan to have the expansion online in mid-2013. The La Porte ethylene debottleneck project is in a similar position to the methanol project. We have not yet received our permits, but the process is proceeding. Detailed engineering is in process and we have ordered long lead items.","We anticipate completion of this 800 million pound plus expansion during the second quarter of 2014 in conjunction with the olefin plant turnaround schedule. If ethane cracking margins remain at current levels, this project will add more than $200 million to our annual EBITDA. We\u2019ve had an excellent quarter in a tough environment. Our back-to-basics strategy, now coupled with disciplined growth is working. We are well positioned for a bright future.","We\u2019re now please to take questions, Brad.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator instructions) Our first question of the day will come from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMC. Your line is open","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMC","","Hi, good morning. I have a question for Sergey Vasnetsov. So Sergey, you've been Head of Strategic Planning at LyondellBasell now for almost two years. How has your view of Lyondell's strategy changed since you first took the position compared to how you see it now?","Sergey Vasnetsov","Jeff, when I joined the company, I didn't have a view and a strategy, so I think my view has developed for this past couple of years in discussions with our managements and with our Board. Clearly, the strategy must be based on realization, what kind of company we are, and so that\u2019s perception both internally and externally. We\u2019ve also developed, as you can see us in a stronger opposition than we were two years ago. I think in terms of our deployment of cash and variety of different place, the basic premises hasn\u2019t changed for the past two years. We identified some specific opportunities that I did know about two years ago, such as the debottlenecks and restarts as Jim had mentioned. But I think there are underlying disciplines, the approach to viewing the world and trying to strike for the best really hasn\u2019t changed. So hopefully this will continue to evolve over the next two years, and so along there and so you\u2019ll see the results of it.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMC","","Okay. And for my follow-up, natural gas liquids prices have down-stopped since the end of June. Do you read in anything into that, and do you have ideas of where natural gas liquids prices will be for the remainder of 2012?","James L. Gallogly","Well, Jeff, it\u2019s always difficult to forecast NGL prices. You\u2019re right that they have come up recently, some in the Midwest, some in the Gulf Coast, but if you look at ethane and propane inventories you\u2019re going to see that they\u2019re extremely high at this point in time, NGL prices have tracked up a little bit with gas prices and crude oil prices, but there is still, so strongly advantage in the United States that we\u2019re quite optimistic about the future. We\u2019ll see short-term volatility, but ethane price is still under $0.40 in the Gulf Coast and around $0.15 in the Midwest, so we\u2019re in a good position.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you Jim, just on the Midwest Conway advantage, is there a new spread we\u2019d be think about between Conway and Mont Belvieu going forward given the constrains still shipping ethane down?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think next year you\u2019ll see some product moving south, but I think there still will be an advantage in the Midwest. It won\u2019t be as great as we see today. At this moment in time there is such an abundance of supply that the pricing has been as low as $0.02 a gallon. That price has moved up, as I mentioned, but there still is ethane rejection taking place. So that shows you just how long the market is.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And Jim, just on the June, July PE strain, is this mainly restocking in a view and is it coming to an end from your perspective?","James L. Gallogly","Well, there is a couple of things that happened when the overall complex of oil prices and gas prices start to increase again. People say, okay, we\u2019ve hit that floor. It\u2019s time to go and buy again, but the other thing that\u2019s going on as we see a bit more export in a little bit by ourselves and quite a bit more by our competitors according to industry data. The U.S. is advantaged enough that we can move our product efficiently in other markets.","LyondellBasell exported about 15%. Most of that was South versus to Asia. We had a very, very modest volume to Asia or Africa, just a couple percent. So, the good news is that the pricing advantage that we have here allows us to be an export platform and so we expect rates to remain pretty high in the U.S.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning.","James L. Gallogly","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Jim, I guess it\u2019s pretty clear how you guys get an advantage on your costs. I\u2019m little bit uncertain. How do you get an advantage on your price? I know it\u2019s your ethylene price that you guys realized it was better than the market price or at least the change in price was?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we're just working hard, Bob. I don't know what to say. I think some of that has to do, we always watch our pennies and nickels and how we contract or lawn on ethylene. If you look at who we sell the excess volumes still a lot of that goes spot and so that may be spot has been above contract a fair amount and so that maybe part of that answer.","Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then, if I might follow-up in the spring there seem to be quite a bit of anxiety about this great wave of ethylene production rates that all the plants are going to come back on and it was going to squash this nice holiday in ethane prices, but that hasn\u2019t seem to happen even though the global economy is kind of choppy. So, I guess people were surprised in being too concerned this spring. What do you think people to get wrong and maybe it would go the other way as we go into next year? What could cause a problem in feedstock cost?","James L. Gallogly","Well, there is a few things. I think if you look at the demand side of the equation, because of the turnaround it was light in the first quarter, but in the second quarter most of the turnarounds were done most people were operating reasonably well. There is a couple of plants down at the moment; one in turnaround, one was an operational difficulty associated with the pipeline. But the volumes of demand are slightly down from where people would expect. Bu one of the big positives has been, propane has come into the mix in a big way and it's a comparable crack to ethane at this point in time. So with that going on, you're seeing very substantial builds in ethane and propane inventories which have held prices down. What could go wrong? Well, I'm feeling pretty good about it near-term, and it's a bit hard to forecast this stuff. As you know, ethane prices dropped, our NGL prices about 50%; since the end of last year pretty amazing, so with that kind of movement it's very unpredictable, there is a lot of chop, but when you look at the fundamentals it looks good through the rest of the year.","","Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Terrific thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Yes, good morning Jim.","James L. Gallogly","","Good morning P.J.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Jim you had talked about a condo cracker in the past. Now there are several other parties that are also interested in a similar cracker or partnering with somebody else. So, are the discussions happening or is the structuring of the deal taking longer, because the longer you wait more crackers are likely to start ahead of you, and so, any thoughts on that?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, we're still thinking about it, P.J., but our basic strategy has been to get debottlenecks that are significant down early. La Porte is a $800 million plus expansion. We talked about the timing of that. I hope to have that one paid for before that first new cracker is built by any of the third party. We're also looking at some debottlenecks adding furnaces at other locations, and that's been our emphasis.","The way we're thinking about it, is if we can bring on these debottlenecks and the $0.45 in annual pound range versus $0.75 plus annual pound range for new builds and get them into the market a year or two earlier than another folks, we're going to have better than the equivalent of a new grassroots cracker when you look at the economic impact. So, we think our strategy makes sense. We're starting supply-demand NGL balances later in the period and trying to decide whether it makes sense for us to join the fray with a new build. There are certainly a lot of people who have come to us and said, you're good operators and we like to partner with you. But we have not reached a conclusion yet on whether that makes sense and would be the kind of return that we would want for our investors. I really believe that some of these crackers are going to come later and be more expensive than people are talking about at this point in time, and so our emphasis is debottleneck and get it done.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. And secondly, can you describe your propylene oxide demand sort of regionally; Europe versus Asia and North America? And the reason I'm asking that is one of your larger competitors saw weakness in polyurethanes and thermosets, and I'm wondering if you're seeing that in propylene oxide or are you likely to see that?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, the propylene oxide demand is been a little bit weaker in Asia and there has been a new plant on board and they've been trying to put volume into that market, which has affected pricing. Europe\u2019s been okay, the United States has been okay. Feels a little weaker, but it\u2019s a pretty steady performer and we've got some very sound customers with some pretty solid demand and we\u2019ve been okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Thank you. Jim, couple of question on some of your initiatives that you outlined last year and thinking specifically on Europe, you talked about a restructuring potential that could deliver up to $200 million in annual cost savings and efficiencies, just wondering where you are on that, have you seen any bottom line benefit and if not what do you think the timing is?","And on a couple of projects you mentioned that you haven't gotten environmental permits yet, is permitting becoming increasingly difficult because I thought on methanol for example one of your advantages was that it was a restart of an existing facility and that you\u2019d be grandfathered on your permit?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah. Let me first talk about Europe, we said that we would take about $200 million out of the cost structure, and that\u2019s on plan. We\u2019ve had a pretty big reorganization. Now having said that, given that the tough environment over there, we\u2019re increasing our initiatives to take costs out, it takes longer in Europe we have works councils to deal with, but we are reinvigorated on that, but more to come.","I didn\u2019t mention that Mike VanDerSnick is taking over our European Manufacturing Operations, and I\u2019ve asked him to look very hard at all of our costs, and see if there is any room for us to further improve.","As you know, Europe is a fairly high cost environment in general, and while we\u2019re very competitive, our goal is to be the top competitor, and so we\u2019ll be looking at everything in the way that we operate, and the money that we spend there.","In terms of environmental permits, I think a few things have been missed in the U.S. expansions. First, it does take a fair amount of time in any event to get an environmental permit. I think if you look at who\u2019s filed permit requests on these new crackers and some other things you\u2019ll find that, a lot of the announced projects are not even at the stage where they have filed for a permit. For seconds and all in line and couple of others have now filed for permits, but we think there is an advantage to being early, and so that was a key component of our strategy. We\u2019re not behind at this stage. These permits take time. We have no reason to believe that we\u2019re going to be late in getting permits, but I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s always a bit complex to do so. We are in non-attainment areas and we have to make sure that were bringing the best available controlled technologies to the table.","We have some credits, but we\u2019re very actively engaged in it, and hope that we\u2019ll be one of the first to get our permits. But again, if you look at who\u2019s filed and all there is quite a few people who have nice capacity, and yet to file their first permit application.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is open.","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Good morning, and congrats on a wonderful quarter. Jim, a question for you around the change with Oxyfuels going into I&D, when you think of Oxyfuels and compare that to I&D, I&D has been a pretty stable business, I wouldn\u2019t argue it should be a higher multiple business. How does that change the volatility, I guess moving Oxyfuels into that business, and then does that change any of the decision-making now being rung out of I&D, as far as which of the byproducts the isobutylene or the MTBE you end up making?","James L. Gallogly","No Duffy, it won't change our decision making. Whenever we make a call on that, we actually compare our isobutylene margins or MTBE, ETBE margins. We stack up the profitability by market segment, by customer, and make conscious decisions. Even when that business was part of Refining & Oxyfuels, before it moved to I&D, we still did that analysis.","And so, I saw a comparison in a review earlier this week, and the thing that I\u2019m excited about is that, we've been able to move up a lot of the value equation in the Oxyfuels. Some of that goes into a very, very long Japanese contract. It's a decent margin. And so, I think that business has been well run, and the decision-making is very economic-based.","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital","","Great. And then a couple of questions for Karyn. It looks like about a $750 million working capital use that you talked a little bit about the plant turnaround in Germany, and then buying some distressed crude. But that seems like a pretty big chunk; three quarters of $1 billion. Can you break that out a little bit more? And then just the second one is, what effect did Channelview have on profitability when it was down first turnaround, had that not been down in Q2?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yeah, from a working capital perspective, the Houston refinery built about 4 million barrels of crude, 3 million barrels of which were advantaged crude opportunities. And then, the build for EAI was approximately 200 million. The rest really is related to timing. So when you see the drop in feedstock costs, it\u2019s faster than the increase in pricing, we\u2019ve got the accounts payable declining without that corresponding rate of change in accounts receivable. So this is a short-term impact and should stabilize our level out.","Douglas J. Pike","Duffy, this is Doug. Regarding the olefins turnaround, as Jim mentioned, there is about 150 million pounds of production that we didn\u2019t, so that's an opportunity that we really didn't have available to us in the quarter. So if you think of that, you think of the quarterly margins, that\u2019s why you need to think how the impacts from the turnaround.","Duffy Fischer \u2013 Barclays Capital","Great. thank you guys.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies & Company","Good morning. Just to follow-on the question of the 3 million barrels of advantaged crude in the inventory. How do you look at the frequency of being able to capture the opportunity crudes going forward? Should we expect that to flow out or will that be replaced by a similar opportunity later in the quarter or next quarter? I mean how should we think about the oscillations quarter-to-quarter?","James L. Gallogly","Laurence, that\u2019s been something that's been very hard to predict. You know that there has been a WTI advantage compared to Brent. That continued has been better than most people expected and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been starting to crack a little of the Midwest crudes. Some of the other crudes on a comparison to Maya, whereas last year there were Maya minus, this year they\u2019ve been Maya plus. Some of the distressed cargos that we had last year have been less available earlier in the first and second quarter, but we did find a nice batch of crude at a very nice pricing, that very few other refineries can take. We\u2019re able to and we build inventory to take advantage of that, and hedged the way the basis risk.","It\u2019s very difficult to see how much of that will be available. There is one positive though, and that\u2019s that one of our competitors have had significant operating problems and that was one of the reasons that some of these cargos are less available, because there is more heavy crude being sought because of additional capacity in the Gulf Coast, that capacity is now off-line and we\u2019re seeing some of those cargos show up again. And so, we\u2019ll be opportunistic and try to put some money in the bank.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","And then if you\u2019re thinking longer-term, the frequency or the availability of the distressed cargos, is it more a function of your relative balance sheet strength compared to competitors or is it a function of just industry utilization rates?","James L. Gallogly","Well, we run our refinery very hard. You\u2019ll see that we\u2019re running basically at capacities, some days over the nameplate, and that has been a positive trend. That was not the case with our refinery a couple of years ago as you\u2019ll remember. We\u2019ve now been very, very reliable. So, it\u2019s being able to take advantage knowing we\u2019ll probably be running. We worked that part very hard.","But we also just have a different buying philosophy than we did a couple of years ago. We\u2019ve changed out a lot of the team members in refining, and we\u2019re just a lot smarter in our crude sourcing. Now going forward longer-term, I\u2019m looking forward to crude coming from Canada, whether it\u2019s sin bed or dual bed, I think that\u2019s going to be very, very powerful for certain Gulf Coast refineries like ours that can take that crude and process it efficiently, we\u2019re very optimistic about that when it comes down in larger volumes.","Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you and hello everyone. Just a question, if we think about propane, and go out a couple of years and think about the potential source for propane exports, leave aside whether that\u2019s going to happen or not, but if it does happen, your European operations, what would have to happen for you to be able to use that propane, and how much possible do you think that is?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, Vincent, I think that there will be more propane exports going forward. At this point in time the U.S. industry is logistically constrained to move a lot more volume. There is a pricing reason to try to move the volume, but like many things as people solve the problems on logistics, there will be more propane export should start to closer to a world price. Our European operations can track some of it. Generally, we have naphtha-based crude fee there, but we\u2019re starting to run more condensates. We\u2019ll start to run more propanes and that should help us a bit.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","But where would the opportunity to increase propane those operations could accept or is there not one?","James L. Gallogly","We can take some. We have not been able to quantify that specifically. A lot of times you have to go in and run push tests and just see how things run and go from there.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, can I just ask a quick question? As the NGLs came down during the quarter, and then picked back up. What is your capability, can you remind us just sort op?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I didn't hear the remainder of that question, I'm sorry.","Douglas J. Pike","Well, Brad I believe Vincent just has lost his line.","Operator","Yes, one moment sir.","Douglas J. Pike","The line available to others?","Operator","Mr. Andrews, your line is open again.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I'll just pass it on, it's fine.","Douglas J. Pike","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from (inaudible) Pentwater. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","I just have a question \u2013 if you have a target leverage ratio on mind, given how under leveraged your balance sheet is today?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","","Yeah, I mean there is no change to our existing policy. We\u2019re currently looking at monitoring and reviewing our capital structure in the context of potential capital redeployment, overall market conditions, our working capital needs, and our free cash flow profile. But today, we have an appropriate overall leverage and liquidity policy. So we continue to look at it for review and assess our balance sheet position and capital structure, but as we continue to optimize our earnings potential with our existing assets balance with how the overall market evolves. But today there has been no change to our policy in regards to overall leverage.","Unidentified Analyst","Well, given that commentary and how much cash you mentioned you'd be generating, and the fact that you won\u2019t able to buyback shares until next year given the tax implications, are you still thinking about returning share \u2013 returning cash to shareholders through another dividend a large one?","Karyn F. Ovelmen","","Right. Again, in terms of our redeployment of excess cash, no change to our policy. We'll continue to assess the environment and for the most leveraging use of our excess cash. But assuming there is no near-term executable investment opportunities, but beyond what we've already outlined, and under the presumption of a sustainable outlook, our free cash flow profile, maintaining our credit metrics, we would look to supplement our current regular dividend with the potential of returning excess cash. This has been our policy. We\u2019ve illustrated our commitment to returning value via the special dividend that we did in 2011, and as I indicated on the call earlier, we have paid $3.2 billion in dividends over the last 12 months.","Of course, today, I won\u2019t comment on timing or levels, but as you indicated, when it comes to share buyback versus special dividend options, we do have tax implications in 2012 as it relates to share buybacks. But also as it relates to share buybacks, we do need to continue to consider our current PE ownership position and the consideration to not further concentrate our ownership profile and the overhanging of our shares. There are no changes we look forward in our approach or expectations on continuing to potentially return excess cash directly to our shareholders.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. One last question on the inventory distressed cargo purchases you did at the end of the second quarter. Can you give an indication of what kind of spread benefit that would be given what today\u2019s prices are?","James L. Gallogly","Well, that\u2019s very much competitive data","Unidentified Analyst","Okay","James L. Gallogly","So we don\u2019t provide that level of detail, but we should be running that crude here in the third quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Thank you. A couple of questions, Jim, on Oxyfuels. First off, can you comment on your outlook for MTBE margins? I think there was a competitive outage earlier this year. It looks like margins have actually strengthened in recent months. Is that all butane, cost-linked, and where you think the back half of the year looks like in that product line?","James L. Gallogly","Kevin, octane has been pretty valuable. We've had some butane pricing advantage, natural gas pricing advantage. So, we had unseasonably strong first quarter that carried over into the second quarter. Margins are holding a very, very nicely at this point in time. So Oxyfuels is looking pretty good. It always gets down to price of octane and relative natural gas butane prices; so far so good.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And I guess just a clarification if I may with regard to your shift of Oxyfuels into Intermediates & Derivatives. It makes sense to me, given your TBA co-product generation, but is that shift a matter of convenience if you will or is there an anticipated economic benefit associated with that shift and if so how large might it be?","James L. Gallogly","Well, I think, there is some modest personnel changes, but it doesn\u2019t really move the needle, it just every day we look for further efficiencies and this gave us an opportunity to achieve a bit of synergy, but having said that there is such a good connection between our PO\/TBA, and Oxyfuels now, and since we're no longer running the Berre refinery and don\u2019t have all the people associated with marketing those products, remember that a lot of our Oxyfuel products go into Europe, and so a lot of the marketing took place there. And so it just makes more sense for us to do what we\u2019re doing today and we\u2019ll look at it that way from the management perspective.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, final question if I may, can you review for us any significant maintenance turnaround activity that you would have planned for the third quarter?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, we have two items Bayport PO\/TBA and Wesseling one of our crackers in Germany is coming up for turnaround in the third quarter. As we mentioned in the call, we don't expect those to be significant financial implications because we\u2019ve built some inventory and thought through well in advance to be prepared for those.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Hoffman of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning. Jim, you seem to be pretty constructive on the outlook on the demand side here in North America as well as globally. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about like how you\u2019re looking at the back half of the year and whether you think that we\u2019ll have a significant inventory cycle as we get towards the end of the year given all the uncertainties here, especially North America.","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, I have to talk regionally and I think what I was saying is that Asia remains pretty weak. Whenever there is price firming, volumes improvement, we saw that at the end of the quarter, we\u2019ll have to see what happens in Asia, there is some stimulus planned and we\u2019ll see how that affects volumes into the second half of the year. Europe remains very weak. It was weak in both quarters so far this year kind of breakeven type. Olefins change margins, except when feedstock prices fell so rapidly. We\u2019re able to capture some value, particularly in Olefins.","In the United States, there has been some firming of demand again, maybe in part because of restocking as prices start to turn in the other direction. There are price increases on the table, which we expect to be implemented. NGL prices remain low and that gives us the ability to export. And so of the United States, we\u2019ve been able to run our plants very hard and move the volumes, but it\u2019s generally pretty tough economic times in the rest of the world, but as a company we have a good customer slate. We try to deliver value to our customers and we move our products pretty efficiently.","Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And just if you're going to address the questions at the year-end inventory, do you have any sense to what inventories are like downstream in the Polyolefins?","James L. Gallogly","And at the end of the year?","Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Well, yeah, towards the end of the year, right.","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, we try to stay in certain ranges and really look at that on an extremely regular basis. Every now and then we'll let our inventory build like we did for the turnaround in Germany, like we did to opportunistically purchase crude oils for the refinery, but generally we stay in a pretty tight range on inventories. And if we start to build some inventory, we'll start to cut back rates. But we'll just watch the economic conditions and go from there. I think Karyn mentioned that we should see that inventory build decline here into the third quarter and see that cash back up on the balance sheet.","Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Right. Thanks, and then just a question for Karyn. On the capital spend, cutting this year to building intuitive, is that sort of push it into next year or closer to $1.6 billion, is that because obviously the projects are still on track?","Karyn Ovelmen","Yeah. No, some of that's timing, but in terms of \u2013 with increased efficiencies and the capital program that we had were outlined for 2012.","Bill Hoffman \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, I think, in the given time, I think, we just feel to take questions from just two more people.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Your line is open.","Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA","Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. One of the things people have talked a lot about, of course, is the spread between Conway and Mont Belvieu. But there was also significant spread between Mont Belvieu ethane propane mix and Mont Belvieu ethane. So, I was wondering if you would be able to talk about how much you were able to enjoy or exploit that spread and where do you think that might go over the next two quarters?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, you're right. There has been some benefit to that. We do have some fractionation capability and we've done some work on the furnaces to be able to separate streams and optimize around unique furnaces as part of turnaround programs. So, we're better equipped to take advantage of that mix than we were, say a year ago. It has given us a little bit of a boost, but those market swings come and go within days. I would tell you though that we optimize our feed slate basically every hour. We're always looking to see where the market is going and what we ought to be running and switching our furnaces around. We think that agility is part of the reason we have some pretty good margins. We work that extremely hard and pay attention of those market dynamics at any moment in time.","Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA","","Got it. Thanks and then you mentioned also on the chance for heavy seller from Canada to come down to the U.S., and I would assume to U.S. Gulf Coast. How long do you think that will take and then will that ultimately push out Brent coming into the Gulf Coast?","James L. Gallogly","","Well, right now we really don't have Brent in our crack in the Gulf Coast and you don't see it a whole lot. You see some of the LLS\u2019s and things in the Gulf Coast. But in terms of what comes down from Canada, a lot of that has been moving into the Midwest because of the pipeline availability. You've seen so much in the news about the keystone pipeline and we really would like to see that build. We have been finding other ways to get certain amount of crude down to us. You had seaway get reversed. There is a few things we can do to get some barrels, but we certainly would like to see a lot more. And frankly for the good of our country, we'd like to see that investment made. 2014 you'll see a little more of that crude showing up I expect, but few things have to happen politically to get that done.","Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gregg Goodnight of UBS. Your line is open.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Hello gentlemen.","James L. Gallogly","Hello, Gregg.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","During the Investor Day you mentioned that Clinton and Nomura, she might be able to squeeze about 100 million pounds of additional capacity out of these two crackers. I know you might have a turnaround in the third quarter for more, could you talk about the timing of these potential debottlenecks?","James L. Gallogly","Yeah, actually more is due to big turnaround last year, and we \u2013 as a result of that turnaround, you've seen the volume show up a little bit better. We're kind of limited sometimes on the backside by derivatives and the ability to use it all. So, some slight increment \u2013 we're looking at about $2.3 billion between Clinton and Morris. Clinton has turnaround next year. So, we don't have a turnaround in third quarter of either of those two crackers.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Okay, very good. The second question; the Channelview, the $150 million, I assume that's designed by (Inaudible) you had a chance yet to demonstrate the additional capacity?","Douglas J. Pike","Gregg this is Doug. No, the $150 million that I referred to was the downtime of one of the olefin plants for the turnaround.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Douglas J. Pike","That was the loss opportunity because we had that facility in turnaround really throughout April.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Douglas J. Pike","That's what that is. What we did in the turnaround, of course, is we've had a project to increase our ethane consumption at Channelview, and in each of the turnarounds last year, first olefins plant, this year the second olefins plant, we've made changes so we can swing our mix and increase by about 500 million pounds of equivalent ethylene from what would have been naphtha over to ethane.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS","Okay. Well, thanks for that clarity. The last question I had if I could is, what is your view or your favorite consultants' view in terms of Refining margins longer-term, say, the next two to three years?","James L. Gallogly","Well, various people have different views. I'd just tell you that I'm a little more optimistic than some on crude cracks. If some of the capacity that's been taken out stays out, that should speak favorably to U.S. refining dynamics. We'll see how that happens. We have been able to export. The industry overall is competitive enough for various reasons that we've been able to export, even a little bit of gasoline has moved by some of our competitors over to Europe.","So that's kind of an unusual trend. The crude oil from Canada can be a powerful thing for refineries that have the ability to crack synbit or dilbit like we have the ability to do, and so longer-term, I think that asset will see an increased advantage. Near term, refinery cracks and all are somewhat dependent on oil pricing, volatility, variety of things like that and the ability to pick up distressed cargos in the meantime. So, might have we just okay right now. Coke product prices, not very good at all. So, this is a very tough one to predict, but I think longer-term the trend is positive.","Gregg Goodnight \u2013 UBS Financial","Okay. Well, thanks for taking a stab at that anyway.","James L. Gallogly","All right. So let me make a few final comments. As I mentioned, this is the best quarter we ever had on an adjusted basis, and a very tough economic environment. We ran safely. We ran reliably. We managed our cost. We took advantage of market opportunities that presented themselves. We\u2019re progressing a very nice slate of growth projects. We are trying to get those to the market early and take advantage of the conditions that we see, particularly in the United States. I think we continue to be on the path of becoming the world\u2019s top commodity petrochemical company and that\u2019s been our goal. We\u2019re starting to be really good at this business. We have some room to get better, and it\u2019s our job to accomplish that every day. Thank you for your attention.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in the conference call today.

At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Jen. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's first quarter 2017 teleconference. I am joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer and Thomas Aebischer, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin the business discussion, I'd like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyb.com. I would also like for you to note that statements made in this call relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions of management, which are believed to be reasonable at the time made and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","For more detailed information about the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially, please refer to the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our financial reports, which are available at www.lyb.com\/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with any other applicable disclosures, including the earnings release, are currently available on our website.","Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 2:00 PM Eastern Time today, until midnight Eastern Time on May 28 by calling 800-839-9140 in the United States, and 203-369-3624 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 2526.","During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current environment and near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls.","As previously explained, these adjustments are related to our use of LIFO accounting and declines in the prices of our raw materials and finished goods inventories in the previous periods. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding impacts of the prior LCM inventory charges.","With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Dave. Good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Let's begin with slide 4 and review the highlights from the first quarter.","Our first quarter diluted earnings were $2 per share with EBITDA of $1.6 billion. We continue to deliver solid results with three of our five operating segments improving in profitability relative to the fourth quarter. We continue to optimize our debt portfolio by redeeming and refinancing $1 billion at an after-tax cost of $106 million. This reduced first quarter earnings by $0.26 per share.","Our chemical and polymer operations generally ran well and we completed planned maintenance in our refinery and the Channelview co-product processing units. Planned maintenance and other non-routine costs impacted first quarter results by approximately $250 million. We continue to execute on our financial priorities during the first quarter, and Thomas will provide you with an update on this progress in a few moments.","Slide 5 reflects the leading safety performance that our employees and contractors continue to achieve during first quarter of this year. We strongly believe that an unrelenting focus on health, safety and environmental performance provides benefits to our operations and profitability as well as the more obvious direct benefits to our employees and neighboring communities.","And now Thomas will discuss our financial highlights for the first quarter.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Bob. On slide 6, we outlined our quarterly and trailing 12-month segment results. As Bob mentioned, three of our five business segments improved relative to the fourth quarter 2016 performance.","During the quarter, strong ethylene co-product pricing benefited both our Olefins & Polyolefins segments while strong margin for methanol and styrene drove improvements in our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. The refinery experienced low seasonal margins and reduced volumes due to planned maintenance.","Please turn to slide 7, which provides a picture of cash generation and use. During the first quarter, excluding changes in working capital, we generated over $1 billion of cash from operations and about half of this amount was returned to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Our investments in maintenance and growth capital expenditure were $421 million during the first quarter, driven by maintenance turnaround, Hyperzone PE, PO\/TBA, and Tier 3 gasoline projects.","During the first quarter, our cash and liquid investments balance declined by $233 million in part due to a $432 million increase in accounts receivable, driven by higher product prices and volumes. Over the past 12 months, we generated $4.9 billion of cash from operations and used approximately $3.5 billion for dividends and share repurchases. After investments in our capital program and other financial activities, the cash and liquid investment balance declined by approximately $800 million.","Slide 8 provides a longer perspective as well as some current financial metrics. Our strong results and cash flow generation over multiple years has positioned us to steadily raise our dividend and purchase our shares. Additionally, it has allowed us to reduce our interest expense and access stable credit markets while maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB+\/Baa1 credit ratings.","We finished the quarter with approximately $5 billion of liquidity and a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4x. Our share repurchase program continued during the quarter with another 1.5 million shares purchased. Since the inception of the program, we have repurchased approximately 181 million shares or approximately 31% of the initial shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately 20 million shares remaining under the existing authorization. In our proxy statement filed with the SEC in early April, we proposed that our shareholders vote to authorize a new repurchase program of up to 10% of our outstanding shares.","During March, we also took advantage of favorable financing conditions and issued $1 billion of 3.5% bonds due in 2027, and used the proceeds and available cash to redeem an equivalent amount of our 5% notes due in 2019. The new bond captures the lowest credit spread for a 10-year bond issuance in the company's history. This exercise allows us to mitigate refinancing risks in 2019 for our largest and nearest maturity bond, while also extending the weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio by one year to approximately 13 years.","Through the use of interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, we converted the 3.5% coupon to initial rate of approximately 1.2%. We incurred cash charges of approximately $65 million related to the bond redemption. Those cash charges in addition to other non-cash charges led to an after-tax accounting charge of approximately $106 million that reduced earnings by $0.26 per share.","Before I wrap up, I want to point out a few other items that may help your modeling of our company. Excluding the first quarter bond redemption charges, our expenses for interest, depreciation, amortization and our effective tax rate are all currently running in line with our previous annual estimates.","With that, thank you very much for your attention. I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thanks, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 9 and review our segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory charges.","In our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment, first quarter EBITDA was $723 million, a $131 million improvement over the fourth quarter. This includes a first quarter $31 million gain from the sale of property in Lake Charles, Louisiana, fourth quarter 2016 pension settlement charges of $23 million and LIFO inventory charges of $20 million.","Relative to the previous quarter, olefin results improved by approximately $95 million. Ethylene margins improved by approximately $0.03 per pound and volumes increased following the completion of planned maintenance and implementation of our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion.","Planned maintenance on our Channelview co-product units during the first quarter resulted in an estimated $110 million impact due to elevated butadiene prices during the quarter. Ethylene operating rates remained strong across our system during the quarter, averaging 91%. Our Corpus Christi ethylene plant continued to ramp up and operated at an average of 80% of the full expanded capacity during the first quarter. 74% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 87% came from NGLs.","In polyolefins, combined results declined by approximately $45 million. Ethylene and propylene monomer price increases outpaced polyethylene and polypropylene prices, reducing spreads by approximately $0.02 per pound and $0.04 per pound, respectively. During April, spot ethylene prices have improved over first quarter averages, but are slightly lagging increasing cash costs. The quarter is benefiting from a $0.03 per pound March polyethylene price increase. Polypropylene prices have been tracking reduced prices of propylene with improving monomer supply.","Our Channelview co-product units restarted in early April after planned maintenance. April operating rates for our Corpus Christi ethylene plant have been over 90% of the expanded capacity and are expected to be at the full expansion capacity by the end of the second quarter. No other maintenance is planned in our olefin system for the remainder of 2017.","Turning to slide 10, I would like to highlight recent developments in ethane supply that we discussed during our recent Investor Day. U.S. demand for natural gas is growing on the Gulf Coast due to the commissioning of LNG export facilities, stronger industrial demand, and the increases in pipeline exports to Mexico. This 20% increase in gas demand will bring more ethane and other NGLs to market. In addition, the ethane content of the gas is increasing with more production from NGL-rich basins.","As a consumer of ethane, we're always cognizant of the logistics and transportation costs associated with this supply. Fortunately, most of the recent activity has been focused in the Permian, Woodford and Eagle Ford Basins, which all have good connectivity to the Gulf Coast ethylene cracker market. Combination of these developments supports our ethane pricing views and have leading analysts and consultants to a more moderate view of future feedstock costs.","Let's turn to slide 12 (sic) [11] and review performance in the Olefins & Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $529 million or $131 million higher than the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 results reflected LIFO inventory charges of $17 million and a pension settlement charge of $8 million. Olefins results improved by approximately $60 million, with ethylene prices increasing nearly $0.03 per pound and higher co-product values offsetting higher naphtha costs. Our ethylene production volume increased due to the absence of fourth quarter maintenance. Utilization of advantaged feedstocks decreased by 4% as co-product credits outweighed the higher cost of naphtha feedstock.","Our crackers operated at a 95% rate during the first quarter, exceeding industry performance by about 4%. Combined polyolefins results improved by approximately $50 million due to higher sales volumes. During April, global markets remained tight to balanced with increased maintenance across the industry during the spring months. As in the U.S., no major maintenance is planned in our European olefin system for the remainder of 2017.","Turning to slide 12, we outlined our current view of the supply and demand picture for global ethylene. A year ago, many consultants were predicting a more severe reduction in operating rates as new U.S.-based capacity was expected to start up during 2017 and 2018. But with continued global demand growth and project delays, the decline from today's very high operating rates is forecast to be relatively shallow and short. We see effective operating rates remaining within and above this blue zone where markets are relatively balanced. Focus is now turning towards 2019 and 2020 where it appears that capacity utilization could exceed the high levels of 2015 and 2016.","Please turn to slide 13 for a discussion of our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $339 million, an improvement of $33 million from the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2016 results reflected a LIFO inventory charge of $16 million and a pension settlement charge of $16 million.","Results for propylene oxide and derivatives improved by approximately $15 million. Increased margins for styrene and methanol were the primary driver for improved results of approximately $65 million in intermediate chemicals. The gains in both the PO and derivatives and intermediate chemicals businesses were offset by approximately $40 million of charges in the first quarter and $30 million of gains in the fourth quarter related to the recovery of precious metals after catalyst changes.","Oxyfuels and related products results declined approximately $10 million on lower sales volume. Prices for styrene and methanol have moderated during April as industry production capacity returns to the market. Two months of planned maintenance began in mid-March at our PO\/TBA facility in the Netherlands, that is expected to impact earnings by a total of $40 million primarily during the second quarter. Our Channelview methanol plant began planned maintenance in early April, that is expected to impact earnings by $20 million during the second quarter.","Now, let's move to slide 14 for a discussion of the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was a $30 million loss, a decline of $111 million from the prior quarter. Please note that the fourth quarter included $46 million of LIFO gains from the consumption of low cost crude inventory. Planned maintenance on one of the two crude units and the fluid catalytic cracker reduced throughput, product yields and gasoline production. This reduced results by approximately $100 million during the first quarter. The cost of RINs decreased relative to the fourth quarter.","During early April, we completed planned maintenance on a crude unit and the fluid catalytic cracker. Our investment in sulfur treatment for Tier 3 gasoline was also completed. We're pleased to report that the refinery has recently been operating near-nameplate rates and no major maintenance is planned for the second quarter. Our Technology segment continued to perform well with $60 million of EBITDA during the first quarter.","Turning to slide 15, the first quarter developed largely as we anticipated. We continued to see strong and growing demand for our polyolefin products in all regions, supporting full chain margins for our O&P businesses.","Our I&D segment benefited from strong styrene and methanol margins. While Refining results were impacted by planned maintenance, we completed our Tier 3 investments for low sulfur gasoline. We continued to optimize our debt portfolio by extending the maturity of our debt. Looking forward, we continue to see olefin and polyolefin market demand supporting strong global operating rates over the near term.","While the recent high prices for ethylene co-products are subsiding, polyolefin chain margins remain strong for both our shale-based and naphtha-based production assets across the globe. We continue to see U.S. supply and inventories of natural gas and NGL feedstocks remaining abundant, and we are encouraged by increased production, transportation and fractionation investments near the U.S. Gulf Coast.","In fuel markets, we are seeing the beginning of typical seasonal spread improvements that support both our oxyfuels and refining businesses. Planned maintenance at our facilities is expected to impact second quarter Intermediates & Derivatives results by approximately $40 million to $60 million. We currently expect our Corpus Christi ethylene expansion to ramp up to full rates during the second quarter.","As many of you know, our Investor Day is typically held every two years and provides an opportunity to comprehensively discuss progress of our company and chart a path forward for the coming years.","Please turn to slide 16 and allow me to review a few of our key messages from the Investor Day we held earlier this month. In this graphic, we depict how LyondellBasell's foundational strategy is rooted in consistent and simple themes. We focused on running our assets well, practicing prudent financial stewardship, capturing high-return organic growth and leveraging our strengths to find opportunities in the cycles of our industry.","These messages are clearly understood across our company and supported by a relentless focus on operational excellence, performance benchmarking, and aligned incentive systems. Simple concepts but difficult to replicate with our robust processes and a dedicated team.","Over the past seven years, we have shown LyondellBasell's leading performance in the upper left and upper right-thirds of this circular diagram. During our Investor Day, we devoted time to a topic that we seldom discuss: timing and capturing opportunities in cycles. Since 2010, we diligently built the framework for cost leadership, operational excellence and organic growth that resulted in substantial value generation for our shareholders.","As shown on slide 17, we view inorganic growth as a logical extension to our capabilities to be pursued as and when opportunities present themselves. We don't intend to depart from the guiding principles that created our success. We do think it is logical to evaluate all options, including inorganic growth, to generate additional value for our company.","During our Investor Day, we described some product chains where we believe our focus on discipline would improve value and illustrated the capacity within our balance sheet to pursue worthwhile opportunities. I won't try to review all these points in the limited time we have now, but let me emphasize that inorganic growth is only one option and, like other investments, requires a clear path to value creation. This was presented in the context of finding opportunities in cycles. We remain patient, thoughtful and disciplined as we pursue the next steps in LyondellBasell's evolution.","Turning to slide 18, I would like to conclude with a few messages that we would like you to take away from our Investor Day. LyondellBasell already has a leading scale and market position built on strong foundations. We know the skills and strengths that created our success and are watchful for opportunities where with these capabilities can add value.","Our portfolio of businesses is global and has breadth, advantaged positions and flexibility. Our work is supported by robust processes and a dedicated team of employees aligned with shareholder interest. In summary, LyondellBasell's prudent financial stewardship, strong dividend, low valuation and earnings upside provide a compelling case for investment.","We're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. It looks like in your North American Olefins operation, you were squeezed a little bit in polyethylene, but maybe contract prices in polyethylene went up $0.05 in February and, I don't know, $0.03 in March. So was there a delay in capturing that price increase? And all things being equal, should we see a lot of the benefits of that in the second quarter?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Generally, we do have a lag in the implementation of those price increases compared to the announcement date. So I think it's very typical of what we've experienced in the past and indeed we should see the full benefit in Q2.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","In Q2. And in the Refinery operation in April, were output rates very low, that is, did you average below 200,000 barrels a day or were you above that in April?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","In April, once we finished our maintenance, we've been running at essentially our design rate of about 270,000 barrels per day.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Did you finish that in early April, is that it?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. Early April. Yeah, about the second week.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just had a question on what you're seeing, I guess, in the olefins markets. There has those increases in February and March, inventories appear relatively low, your commentary suggests that you guys are excited about running full out for the rest of the year. But how do you see kind of the capacity playing out and pricing as well, given what's going on with feedstocks and demand? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, in the near term, Arun, we're headed into a period where, generally, demand picks up seasonally. As you likely mentioned, inventories especially here in the U.S. are on the low side. I think that's all very constructive as we go through the second quarter. As has been well noted, there are new capacity expansions coming online in the second half of this year. If you look under the headline of those expansions, quite a bit of it is linear low density polyethylene, a market in which we have very small participation. There's some low density and then of course some high density. So, I think it's important to consider the types of polyethylene that comprise these new expansions.","And on the ethylene side, I think given that the derivatives in some cases are ahead by a quarter or two of the cracker expansions, we're pretty constructive about ethylene markets for the balance of this year. So, as you rightly said, we're focused on running full out for the remainder of the year.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just a quick follow-up on the other side, propylene was down a little bit in April. How are you looking at PO markets and that side of your business as well? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, PO demand is still very steady and as you know, quite a bit of our PO is sold on a cost-plus basis. So, we don't see a lot of volatility in terms of earnings in that part of I&D. For the remainder of I&D from a demand standpoint, things are very steady and as we had expected. On the supply side, there were some disruptions in supply in the industry in methanol and in styrene in Q1, but those seem to have resolved or largely resolved themselves and you're seeing pricing moderate. But if you look at pricing by historic standards, we're still at pretty healthy levels.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Your chart that you show on the bottom of slide 9 that compares ethane-based versus naphtha-based cracking margins on ethylene would suggest you would have run more naphtha-based through your crackers in the first quarter. Is there a reason you didn't need as much of the byproducts or any comment on that? And where do you see that feedstock split right now and in the second quarter?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","We tilted a little bit more towards liquids, but just as a reminder, we have that co-product unit at Channelview that was out for planned maintenance for a couple of months. So that limited really our ability to flex towards more liquid cracking in the U.S. In Europe, we did move more towards naphtha cracking because of the higher co-product values. But those have now adjusted back a bit. Propylene has come down some. Butadiene has come down quite a lot in the last couple of months, still at pretty reasonable levels, but down from a very, very high peak earlier in the year. So I think where we are today, Steve, is we're back to NGL-cracking being favorable on both sides of the ocean. And so as we come into the summer months, propane and butane should be even more advantaged and more a part of the cracker mix. So we're kind of going back to what I would consider to be more normal (29:33) for U.S. and Europe.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And you mentioned butane is, as you look at that MTBE margin chart that you show, is that healthy margin you illustrate for April because of tightness in isobutylene or just pickup in demand for MTBE? What's driving that?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah generally, what drives that is a combination of two things, one is butane price coming down seasonally in the summer, because it comes out of the blend pool in gasoline. And then secondly, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, that we generally see spreads rising through the summer months for gasoline, so an improvement in gasoline spreads and butane coming down relative to crude oil.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Morning.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Bob, looking at the planned maintenance costs in Q2 versus Q1, just give us again the benefit of the oil pickup, given lower costs in Q2?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","So, Q1, including sort of the lost profit associated with us not producing, the impact was about $250 million in Q1, and we're expecting that to drop down to $40 million to $60 million in Q2, so about a $200 million improvement.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just Bob, on the cadence of buybacks, a little bit low in Q1. You may have been constrained in any authorization. How should we think about buybacks in Q2 post the new authorization and Q3, back half of the year.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Sure, certainly. Let me start and then I'm sure Thomas will supplement with some comments. First of all, as noted, we have proposed for shareholder approval another 10% program for starting in May. Our AGM will be in the second half of May. And this effectively replaces the current program starting at the time of approval.","David, I expect to continue to see share buybacks as part of our capital deployment strategy, given that we expect to generate strong free cash flow going forward. I think what we're doing a little bit more is we're trying to be a little more opportunistic to take advantage of general market volatility. This is not a shift in sort of our view on buybacks, it's really more sort of trying to optimize. So, Thomas, if you'd like to add a little more to that.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning. So if I can add, we absolutely continue to believe that repurchasing our shares offers strong value and low risk. As we compare buybacks to organic growth projects and risk-adjusted M&A, share buybacks will continue to have a role in our portfolio of capital deployment options.","And we don't comment on the details of our trading plans, the 10b5-1 pre-established plan will obviously be subject to the uncertainties of the market volatility with trading volumes at rates that could exceed or fall short of the predicted outcome. But I think the message here is what Bob has said, we go for another approval for an additional 10% and we still believe that the share buybacks offer a good option and good value.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. Bob, the on fourth quarter call, you'd indicated you just have about 2 billion pounds of additional ethylene in 2017 versus 2016 due to the Corpus Christi expansion and a lack of planned maintenance turnarounds. What is that number now given some of the outages that you had?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Don, I think it's still developing in that range. I mean we'll have to see how the year plays out. At Corpus Christi, as I mentioned, we've been ramping up through Q1 and on our way to 100% here of our full capacity. So, I think for now, you should assume that it's largely that same number and we'll update that as the year progresses.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Right. Okay. And I noticed your propylene production was down sharply year-over-year, was that related to the Channelview co-products unit being down or did that latter \u2013 or was Channelview just really a C4 item?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No, that was just mainly a C4 item. Propylene production also can be impacted by how far we're running on (34:29) unit, so that can have an impact. So, it's really about kind of optimization in their system.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then finally just a question on the polyethylene price outlook, you did get $0.08 in February and March, you said there's a lag in realizing that. It looks like the industry gave up on the $0.03 April initiative, has pushed that to May. How do you see polyethylene developing? As you said, it is seasonally stronger in Q2, but we do see some softness in offshore pricing.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. It feels tight to us and so we just kind of have to see how the quarter plays out.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Bob, that $40 million charge in I&D, I'm not sure I clearly understood what it was for, and we also noticed that this quarter's press release indicated that there was a slightly smaller charge in the fourth quarter that I don't recall seeing in the fourth quarter press release. So what is the charge about and are we done with it, or it's just something we need to anticipate in the balance of the year as well? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I'm going to start by saying that, Vincent, it's kind of a one-time item and it's just related to when we make catalyst changes. We look at how much precious metals we have on the books versus what we recover. So it's not something that we do every quarter. Dave, I don't know, if you want to add any more to that.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, Vincent, actually in the fourth quarter, it was a $30 billion (sic) [million] gain and then a $40 million loss in the first quarter. So it was quite a bit of variance quarter-to-quarter, normally, we wouldn't talk about this, but just the variance quarter-to-quarter, we brought it to light.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, it's a fairly big swing from a gain to a loss, but shouldn't expect this is to be recurring.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just, Bob, you mentioned the different grades of polyethylene and sort of the cadence of supply that's coming in those different grades. Could you just talk a little bit about how those grades may compete with each other and what sort of substitutability there might be from one grade to another in certain applications, and how insulated should different grades be from each other as the supply comes online?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, there's very little competition in between the grades. So if you think of \u2013 give you one example \u2013 if you think about metallocene linear low density polyethylene, it really doesn't compete with high density polyethylene for pipe or blow molding, so they are \u2013 the mainstream markets for these products are quite different and the overlap is very minimal.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, the share buyback announcement you have there and trying to connect that with the M&A comment, should I interpret that as there is nothing out there right now that you're all that interested in or am I over-interpreting that?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No. I think if you \u2013 again, what we presented at our Investor Day for M&A was really in the context of thinking through opportunities in cycles. And frankly, given valuations where they are today \u2013 and we don't see a whole lot of opportunity \u2013 and so, our buyback program, we said, we've gone back to shareholders for another 10% and we expect buybacks to be part of our capital deployment strategy. So, on acquisitions, frankly, there's really nothing compelling that we see at the moment.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you. If you don't mind, a completely different area, you mentioned methanol has been strong, it's moderating. But if an upset gets you this kind of a price increase, usually means we're fairly tight. What does that mean for octane values? And is there a chance we can actually see MTBE finally go up some in the near future?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I think certainly, when you see this kind of price response, it does indicate markets are more balanced, because I think what we're looking for is, more specifically, gasoline spreads, how we do through the summer. We're relatively constructive about that. And if you think about our I&D business, that combined with relatively lower butane price should drive margin improvement, and we've illustrated where we are here in April. So, Dave, do you want to add something else?","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, Jonas, I think we see this shaping up pretty much as a normal year for MTBE, not like 2015, per se, but more typical with the summer season, unlike what we had in 2016.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","So, 2015 was extremely strong and 2016 was weak, and we think something in between is kind of what we expect here in 2017.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of John Roberts of UBS Technology (sic) [Securities]. Your line is now open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. The isocyanate market is pretty tight right now, which you don't produce, but it consumed along with propylene oxide. Does that constrain you at all in your propylene oxide sales?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Not too much really, I mean I think we have very long-term off-take agreements on PO and so we're not held back in terms of our production rates because of tight isocyanate markets. We're frankly running our PO assets pretty full today.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And do you think methanol prices are going to be set by MTO affordability going forward, or do you have a different view at all on methanol prices?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I think MTO certainly plays a very big role in methanol prices as well as, we think, kind of the marginal cost of production for ethylene. So, our belief on that hasn't changed.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question is from the line of Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Just a couple quick follow-ups, how often do you need to do that precious metal catalyst recovery in the I&D segment, how often does that take place?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Good morning, Frank. It's not every quarter. It's once every 18 months or thereabouts. But we have many different units, so I don't think we can give you a guidance on an exact cadence. Thomas, if you want to add anymore to that.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Right. So, as Bob has said, we have many different units, we are talking mainly about gold and silver, both a significant charge. And I would like to reiterate, this is a non-cash charge, the significant non-cash charge we had in the first quarter is related to silver, so it's connected to our EO business. And having said this, expect so. Let me maybe make that very clear how it works. We bought that silver three years ago, so we bought it at market value three years ago and now we replace the silver, we virtually borrowed silver during the maintenance part of the catalyst and so have to readjust the book values, purely non-cash. The next one in the silver area is expected in the next two to three years, so nothing immediate.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Very helpful. And Bob, just coming back to capturing opportunities in cycle, subsequent to the Analyst Day, obviously we saw the sale of a major ethylene facility. Would that have fallen outside of your \"disciplined approach\" or is it just not an area that you want to expand upon inorganically?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I think for now, our focus, Frank, has been on derivatives, so building out our polyethylene. As you know, we've announced a new polyethylene plant, which we will break ground here in May. And the location of the cracker is not near really our assets, it's in Louisiana, where we don't have any ethylene or polyethylene assets. So beyond value, there were other sort of strategic factors that made it less suitable for us.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Terrific. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Good morning. Bob, on slide 10, you called out a number of factors that seem to support the supply side of the ethane market, such as rig count additions and a richer mix. And yet, if we look at the forward curve for ethane about two years out, it's around $0.325 gallon versus $0.245. So up about $0.08 or 30% to 35%, contango. And I'm wondering if you can help us reconcile that, is it a case, for example, that the forward market is just not very deep in ethane, so we shouldn't read much into it or are there other factors that could result in that type of tightening there? Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Good morning, Kevin. Absolutely. I think that's part of what you're seeing is that it is a very thin market, especially as you go further out in time. Secondly, there's a bit of a lag between market pricing and the announcements being sort of confirmed. So, we've read about more fractionation capacity coming. We understand others are considering more fractionation capacity. So, I think there's a bit of a lag from the time that announcements come out to the time where prices reflect more supply. But clearly, we're seeing more supply from the Permian and from the Eagle Ford, and we expect that that should be ample to supply new crackers going forward.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, if I may. Do you happen to have handy a breakdown of the aggregate $250 million maintenance hit for each of your segments?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, we talked about $110 million associated with our co-product processing unit and about $100 million related to the FCC and then the balance was on a sundry of things. But I think those were probably the two big items that we discussed.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Excellent. Thank you.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","And the precious metal catalysts were in there, the $40 million for the first quarter in I&D as well.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Your line is now open.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Bob, was taking a look at the MTBE volumes. You obviously called out in the press release that there were seasonality obviously. But even on a year-over-year basis, if I take a look at the MTBE, ETBE volumes, they were down almost 11%. So just wanted to sort of figure out what was going on there.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I think that's maybe inventory-related. There's not really a clearer driver for that. I mean we're not producing less, per se. We do have, as I mentioned, the turnaround on our PO\/TBA unit in the Netherlands and we started that right at the end of the first quarter. So other than inventory fluctuation, nothing that I could point to Hassan.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Got it. Got it. And on a different sort of product side of things, you talked about benefiting a bit in Q1 from higher styrene margins. In April, they came down a bit. Just wanted your views about, be it Q2 or 2017, what your outlook is for styrene in the near term.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think with demand growing at a reasonable pace, not a lot of new capacity globally, we're still in styrene in a very balanced sort of market environment. And I think we'll see these periodic run-ups if there is unplanned outages, or sort of large swings in inventory. But I think it's a market, much like methanol, that's reflecting balanced, or higher operating rates, which are sensitive to unplanned events.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Perfect. Thanks so much, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. I got two questions.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","One sort of short term and one long term. In the short term, what are inventories at converters of your customers, and do you believe that they will destock inventory as they see new capacity starting up in second half?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","In terms of inventories at customers, from what we see in terms of rail car turns and things like that, we don't see anything unusual, P.J. I would suspect that inventories are kind of at normal levels. And there is industry data available at the producer level and it points to pretty low inventory. So I would say, if you kind of combine the two together across the PE producer\/consumer value chain, likely we're below average in terms of inventories going into a seasonally higher demand period.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And then we are beginning to see a third wave of ethylene expansion or ethylene capacity announcements for the next decade. And these are serious players like NOVA\/Total and Exxon\/SABIC. So do they see this ethane availability at from Permian and Eagle Ford that you talked about, do they see that and is that what is driving this new wave of projects?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","I think, to a degree, it shows conviction about ethane supply beyond the current set of expansions that are coming. But certainly, as you say, as if I read it correctly, I think the Total cracker is not a world scale, it's an extension of their existing cracker. And then, of course, Exxon\/SABIC is a world scale cracker. But the P.J., I think as we look at two or three crackers, it's not as much as eight crackers, which I would consider more to be a wave as opposed to two or three which, if you step back and think on a global context, demand grows at a pace where you need about four to five new crackers every year to meet demand growth. But it doesn't seem to be as large of a wave as maybe what we've seen here recently.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. On the PE inventory front, could you also comment on what you're seeing in Asia and if there's still a lot of support for exports, given where inventories might be in that region of the world?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, Jim, in Asia generally, you do see more volatility in the inventory and I think in Asia, what I understand is that they're probably a little bit above average in Asia in terms of inventories. But that gets worked off pretty quickly and again, we're going into, globally, a very seasonally higher demand period in the spring and summer months. So, our view is that export opportunities are there and certainly our production in the U.S. is not limited because of lack of export opportunities.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. And you mentioned butadiene prices are down pretty sharply after their peak. Do you see butadiene prices stabilizing anytime soon?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I think \u2013 first of all \u2013 sort of the spike was a confluence of few events, some planned turnarounds, upcoming, I think, there was pretty good size inventory build especially in Asia. There's still, if you look where we are today, we're still above the kind of levels we were even a year ago. So I think the larger part of the correction seems is behind us and you're seeing now cracker peak slates adjust back to NGLs here in the U.S. which would indicate less butadiene output and propylene output.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","David Kinney - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. If we could limit things to just one question, so that we can get everybody in before we have to finish here, that would be great.","Operator","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I was hoping to get a little clarification on an answer you gave to just question earlier on the call. If we were to see, hypothetically, polyethylene prices flatten out here in on April and in the second quarter, would you still see some pricing capture benefits? Is that what you' were trying to say?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, yes, so, Ryan compared to Q1, because Q1, the entire quarter didn't include the increases, we were sort of implementing those through the quarter. So, what I was trying to say is that we would see the full impact of the $0.05 and the $0.03 in Q2.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. But it wasn't designed to mean that there was a delay from the list price change, it was really just kind of a flow-through?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Flow-through, exactly.","Ryan Berney - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Bob, just on the M&A front. Do you think that asset level or corporate level acquisitions would be more attractive right now? And just overall, maybe you already answered this, but do you feel that there's more opportunities out there compared to six months ago or fewer? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, I think Matthew, first of all, on M&A, it's really about value creation and whether we can kind of apply our strengths to create value. So, I wouldn't limit to either corporate or asset. And so it's really about how we can leverage our platform to create value. More or less, I mean, I think, as I mentioned earlier, today we don't see anything compelling, frankly, just to be clear, valuations are elevated, different products and are different parts of your cycle.","And so the whole point of our Investor Day presentation was really to sort of layout a multi-year sort of plan, not a this quarter will we \u2013 may or may not do. And as we think about the next couple, three years, most of our conversations with investors, they've been dominated by the expectation of some sort of cycle. So, really all we attempted to do was frame how we might think about finding opportunities in a potential cycle.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies LLC","Hi. This is Jeff Schnell on for Laurence. Following up on your comments on pricing mismatch and project announcements, and with regard to your potential projects, should we see \u2013 should we expect announcements to be flagged early in the process? Or do you expect them to be announced later to gain timing advantage versus competitors?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","You mean, Jeff, in terms of new cracker announcements?","Jeffrey Schnell - Jefferies LLC","Yeah any. Yeah, new build. Yeah.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I don't know, it's difficult to say. For us, I think we've clearly stated that we have one more debottleneck we can do at Channelview. We're focused on getting this polyethylene expansion completed by mid-2019, and then we would consider perhaps other polyethylene expansions. So difficult to really, for me, to assess or have a view on other strategies.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay? Okay. Good. Well, I think that was our last question. So, let me conclude with a few closing comments. First of all, thanks, as always, for your thoughtful questions. Markets around the globe remain pretty strong and I think given that we've had a few quarters of heavier planned maintenance, we're really well-positioned for the remainder of 2017 to fully capture opportunities and run our global asset base at full rates.","Our strategy remains consistent, strong focus on operational excellence, which means running what we own today very well, deploying the strong free cash flow in a disciplined way, and remunerate shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to build out our organic growth pipeline.","We'll also evaluate inorganic growth, as I've discussed, but it's really in the context of finding opportunities in cycles, and we'll have to see kind of how this cycle plays out. But make no mistake that we can \u2013 we'll focus on shareholder value creation and thinking about how we can leverage the platform that we have to create more value.","So, with that, thank you for your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you with second quarter results in July. That concludes our call. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, everyone. And that concludes today's conference call.

Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thanks Doug. Good morning, to all of you, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. For those of you that follow LyondellBasell you might recall that one year ago, in my first earnings call as the CEO of LyondellBasell, I had described how we built a company capable of delivering differential results for our shareholders in a variety of business climates.","I'm pleased to report that we successfully navigated the volatility of 2015 to deliver another record year for you, our shareholders.","Before we get into the numbers, I would like to introduce a new member of our team, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Thomas Aebischer. Thomas comes to LyondellBasell with a long history of global accomplishments in the arenas of finance, information technology, accounting, tax, and procurement. I'm confident that Thomas will provide our finance and IT organizations with the experience and leadership to drive our continued success. Thomas, welcome to LyondellBasell.","Thomas Aebischer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you very much both for your kind words and good morning to all of you. Although I have only been with LyondellBasell for a few weeks, I'm very impressed with the relentless commitment and focus for superior results that I have already seen in the company. I look forward to meeting all of you, our stakeholders and the investment community and describing how we will continue to build value with disciplined and consistent financial management.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thanks Thomas. Let's take a look at slide four and reflect on a few of the more notable financial accomplishments for 2015. Although we operate in a very capital intensive industry, LyondellBasell's record earnings in 2015 generated robust cash flow and a 34% return on our invested capital. $1.4 billion of this cash was used to fund our capital program, while over $6 billion was committed to dividends and share buybacks.","Our dividend yield placed us in the top quintile of the S&P 500 index and the purchase of our outstanding shares relative to our average enterprise value placed us in the top 3% of the S&P 500. The strength of our earnings and our disciplined use of cash helped us to again outperform the S&P 500 on total shareholder return basis.","Before we dive deeper into the financials, I would like to call your attention to slide number five. LyondellBasell culture places a strong emphasis on continuously improving our health, safety and environmental performance. I'm proud to report that our team again achieved record safety performance in 2015. This is top decile performance for our industry. We believe that outstanding safety performance is an essential foundation for reliable operations that deliver differential financial performance. While I'm pleased to see the improvement for the past year, we'll continue to be relentless in our drive for safety perfection.","Our annual results summarized on slide number six, exceeded the previous records established during 2014, with $8.1 billion of EBITDA and $10.35 of earnings per share during 2015. As seen in the quarterly results on the bottom of the slide, LyondellBasell's strong operating performance during the second quarter and third quarters enabled us to capture the benefits of tight markets, due to industry outages.","Relatively lower margins resulting from more balanced markets, seasonal trends and lower crude prices coupled with several planned and unplanned outages in our plants reduced the company's fourth quarter profitability.","Slide seven, summarizes some 2015 accomplishments and segment results. Three of the five segments Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International, Intermediates and Derivatives and Technology achieved a record results, over $5.8 billion of cash flow from operations enabled us to buy back 52 million shares or 11% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015. Additionally, we increased our interim dividend by 11% to $0.78 per share bringing our total dividend for 2015 to $3.04 per share.","I won't mention each of the operating accomplishments shown here, but I think these items exemplify our continued operating strength in advancing growth programs. Strong operations, advantaged feeds and incremental volumes reflect a common and consistent theme from how the entire team at LyondellBasell continually finds ways to realize more productivity from our existing assets.","Let's turn to slide 8, and look at some of the metrics that drove 2015 performance. I'll highlight a few. Across the top of the page, we have plotted our key volumes. From the left, you can see the additional volume from our La Porte ethylene expansion, and the steady increase in polyethylene and polypropylene volumes largely from existing assets.","In the charts, along the bottom of the page, you see a summary of product margins and spreads. The indexed ethylene and polyolefins charts represent our internal data, while the other two represent industry benchmarks. Falling U.S. ethylene margins were partially offset by rising polyethylene and polypropylene margins, helping to maintain strong chain profitability. In Europe, both Olefins and Polyolefins margins increased. MTBE and refining industry spreads remain relatively constant with prior years.","Please turn to slide nine, which plots fourth quarter and full year segment results. As I already mentioned, this has been a record setting year for both EBITDA and operating income. I'll review these in detail during the segment discussions.","Please turn to slide 10, which provides a picture of our cash generation and use. During 2015, we generated $5.8 billion of cash from operations. We also took advantage of favorable interest rates and borrowed $1 billion at a coupon rate of 4.625%. The cash and short-term securities balance ended the year at $2.4 billion.","Turning to slide 11. You can see the $5.8 billion in cash from operations; this cash generation has allowed us great flexibility. Over the past four years we have funded $5.6 billion of capital investment and $18.7 billion towards dividends and share repurchases. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately 142 million shares or about 25% of the total shares outstanding. At the end of 2015, we had approximately 15 million shares remaining under the existing share repurchase authorization.","Since this is the beginning of a new year, I wanted to address some of your 2016 modeling questions. Regarding capital, we're currently planning to spend approximately $1.9 billion during 2016. This spending level progresses both our base maintenance and growth programs. Approximately 40% is targeted toward our growth program. Base maintenance spending increases this year due to a heavy turnaround schedule and increased health, safety and environmental spending. The majority of the growth spending will be dedicated to the Corpus Christi ethylene expansion that should begin production during the third quarter.","Although not all plans are finalized, we expect capital spending to remain around $2 billion annually through 2020. The largest individual growth project is our PO\/TBA plant, which is currently estimated to cost approximately $2.1 billion. While we have not yet finalized plans and timing for all of our polyethylene growth projects. We are currently performing design engineering for a 1 billion pound expansion that could be complete during the 2018 and 2019 timeframe.","Our net cash interest expense for 2016 is expected to be approximately $320 million. This includes interest on $7.7 billion of outstanding bonds at an average coupon rate of approximately 5.2% and $12 million of interest on short-term facilities.","At current conditions, we estimate that these expenses will be offset by approximately $100 million in benefits from interest rate and currency swaps and interest on our cash balance. 2016 annual book depreciation and amortization should be approximately $1.1 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions that total of approximately $110 million, and we estimate a pension expense of approximately $65 million. We currently expect a 2016 effective tax rate of approximately 28%. The cash tax rate is expected to be somewhat lower.","Now let's turn to slide 12, and review segment results. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of the LCM inventory charges.","In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $834 million, $86 million less than third quarter. For the full year, segment EBITDA was $3.8 billion.","Relative to the third quarter ethylene margin decreased by $0.06 per pound, this decline was driven by prices that were lower by $0.04 per pound and higher cost due to lower coal product prices. Our operating rates remained strong during the quarter averaging 95%. 72% of our ethylene production was from ethane and approximately 90% came from NGLs.","In Polyolefins our polyethylene spread was relatively unchanged, while the polypropylene spread was up approximately $0.04 per pound. Polyethylene volumes were relatively unchanged, polypropylene experienced sales volume decline of approximately 8% due to operating issues at our Bayport plant.","For the full year results decreased by $369 million with higher Polyolefin results offsetting more than half of the decline in Olefins. Polyolefins results provided approximately $570 million of improvement over the prior year due to margin improvement and increased polyethylene volumes from our 2014 Matagorda debottleneck.","Overall 2015 was a year of transition with lower crude prices moving margin from Olefins into Polyolefins. Industry operating rates for Olefins improved and our crackers operated reliably. We completed our Channelview expansion during the third quarter and captured the additional capacity from our 2014 La Porte olefins expansion and Matagorda polyethylene debottleneck. Our growth program for ethylene and polyethylene continues to add value.","In January, spot ethylene prices have continued to decline as the market follows lower oil prices. We continue to see margins holding for polyethylene and additional upside for polypropylene margins in a very tight North American market. A heavy turnaround season is planned for U.S. crackers in 2016, with the schedule particularly heavy during the second quarter where IHS estimates that 10% of North American capacity will be offline. Our Corpus Christi ethylene turnaround and expansion will begin during the second quarter with completion planned during the third quarter.","Let's turn to slide 13, and review performance in the Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and international segment. During the fourth quarter, underlying EBITDA was $451 million or $104 million lower than the third quarter. For the full year, underlying EBITDA was a record of nearly $1.9 billion, a $445 million increase versus 2014. Olefin results decreased versus the third quarter by approximately $130 million due to lower margins.","Polyolefin results improved and the sales volume increased by 6% and 5% for polyethylene, and polypropylene respectively. Polyethylene margin remained strong, but we're relatively unchanged, while polypropylene margins had a modest improvement. Our polypropylene compounding business improved modestly on higher sales volumes. Equity income decreased by $11 million due to reduced margins at our Saudi Arabian joint ventures.","Olefin results for the full year increased by approximately $25 million over 2014. This increase is largely the result of a lower cost of naphtha that outpaced the declines in ethylene pricing. Excluding the impact of our M\u00fcnchsm\u00fcnster cracker turnaround, we operated our crackers in Europe at 95%. Our Polyolefins results increased approximately $420 million year-on-year reflecting improved spreads and higher volumes for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Polypropylene compounding and Polybutene-1 results were relatively unchanged versus 2014.","Equity income from our joint ventures increased by $54 million due to strong margins at our joint ventures in Poland and South Korea. During January, industry conditions were generally consistent with the fourth quarter. During March, we'll start to turnaround on our Berre, France olefins cracker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $20 million.","Joint venture equity earnings are anticipated to decline modestly in part due to lower Polyolefin prices and the Southeast feedstock price increases that took effect in late December.","Now please turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $286 million, a decline of $220 million from the third quarter. For the full year, the segment generated record EBITDA of nearly $1.7 billion, $104 million more than 2014.","The fourth quarter decline was attributable to typical seasonal demand declines combined with planned outages and uncharacteristically high unplanned outages in our plants. The segments fourth quarter results were impacted by planned maintenance totaling approximately $20 million and unplanned downtime impacted results by approximately $50 million. Propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased by approximately $10 million with slightly lower margins due to sales mix.","In our Intermediate chemicals business, EBITDA declined by approximately $160 million as styrene margins declined by $0.07 per pound. Included in the Intermediate chemicals results, acetyls results declined by approximately $30 million due to lower volumes from an extended turnaround, and a $0.17 per gallon decrease in methanol pricing.","Oxyfuels results were lower by approximately $60 million in line with typical, seasonal trends. During most of 2015, LyondellBasell's propylene oxide and derivatives and styrene business captured opportunities while the industry experienced operating problems that tightened the markets for those products.","Intermediate chemical results improved by approximately $120 million due to improved styrene margins that were partially offset by lower methanol and vinyl acetate margins. Oxyfuels results decreased by approximately $60 million versus 2014, which benefited from unseasonably strong fourth quarter margins one year ago.","The New Year has started with stable demand in the propylene oxide market. Oxyfuel margins remain near typical winter levels, methanol prices have come under pressure with additional capacity entering the market and lower crude oil prices. In contrast to the fourth quarter, we do not have any significant planned maintenance scheduled during the first quarter.","Let's move to slide 15 for a discussion of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $68 million, a decline of $75 million from the prior quarter. For the full year, the segment generated $519 million of EBITDA, an increase of $110 million versus 2014. During the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread averaged $18.55 per barrel and crude throughput averaged 206,000 barrels per day.","Rates were impacted by planned and unplanned maintenance. The total impact is estimated to be approximately $50 million, the lower Maya spread was primarily driven by seasonally weaker gasoline crack spreads. The cost of RINs increased by approximately $10 million related to the EPA ethanol requirements.","2015 full year Refining results improved over 2014, despite challenges from a labor strike in the first quarter and fourth quarter operating issues. Crude throughput averaged 238,000 barrels per day down 21,000 barrels per day from 2014. The Maya 2-1-1 benchmark decreased by approximately $2 per barrel to average $22 per barrel for the year. The refineries capture rate of this margin improved during 2015 with improved secondary product margins and higher utilization rates \u2013 higher utilization of discounted Canadian crude oil volumes. The cost of RINs were relatively unchanged.","We're currently performing planned maintenance on a crude unit and a coker that is expected to impact first quarter results by approximately $40 million. First quarter crude oil throughout is expected to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2015.","Turning to slide 16. Let's step back and consider the changes that are occurring in our core Olefins and Polyolefins markets. As crude prices have fallen over the past 15 months, there has been some compression in North America and monomer margins, but they remained quite good. This is illustrated by the grey bars it the chart on the top left. The chart in the upper right demonstrate that polyethylene and polypropylene demand growth improved in 2015, relative to the prior four years to approach the long-term growth averages we have seen over the past 25 years. This strong growth supports the balanced to tight conditions that are likely to persist into 2016. These healthy markets have resulted in the strong Polyolefin margins in both Europe and the U.S., as you can see from the blue bars on the left.","Finally, the table on the lower right, highlights LyondellBasell's leverage to be strong integrated chain margins. Global supply and demand balances, regional feedstock advantages and industry operating rates continue to support our positive outlook for our industry and our business.","Let me conclude with slide 17, the fourth quarter was a period, where the ethylene industry returned to a balanced market, as industry operating problems subsided. Polyolefin margins expansions offset much of the decline in monomer margins. At LyondellBasell planned maintenance activities across our assets negatively impacted our results by approximately $55 million, while unplanned events increased the negative impact by $105 million.","The fourth quarter was also impacted by seasonal factors, primarily in our fuel related-products, which negatively impacted the core group by approximately $100 million. This is generally comparable to the seasonal impact over the last few years. During 2016, oil price volatility and concerns about the global economy will undoubtedly foster uncertainty in financial markets. Despite such uncertainty, we believe that we continue to benefit from abundant supplies of low priced feedstocks and from solid underlying demand for our products.","Additionally, we anticipate that the heavy industry outage schedule for the first half of 2016 will continue to be constructive for the markets we serve. Before we open the line for your questions, I want to make you aware of our upcoming investor reception to be held here in Houston in conjunction with the IHS World Petrochemical Conference. As in the past, we will be hosting the reception with members of our executive leadership team at the end of the first day of the conference near the venue. Please watch your email for invitations or contact Doug for further details.","We're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Stephen Byrne of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. You mentioned your ethylene operating rates at 95%. What would you estimate global cracker operating rates to be? And where do you think they could be over the next couple of quarters, in light of the pickup in turnarounds that you mentioned?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, Stephen. Global operating rates, you know our sense is that they've been averaging in the high 80%s to about 90%, excluding some of the unplanned outages. So, last year in the second quarter they probably drifted a little lower. I think in 2016, markets are going to be relatively balanced. In 2015 demand growth for ethylene nearly matched supply growth for ethylene. So market conditions look very similar. I think the thing we're going to have watch is the level of unplanned outages that created the tight markets in second quarter.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And what feedbacks are you getting from your customers with respect to their inventory levels, as oil fell during the fourth quarter?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well if you think about it, throughout last year, as oil price declined and there was uncertainty about global economic growth, we saw our customers depleting inventory especially downstream of our polyolefins business. By the end of the year, our sense was, they were buying only what they needed and they were buying kind of one week at a time. So anecdotally, I would say that inventories are very low and we see even in the last week of January, when we saw oil prices move up a little bit, we had a certain sudden rush in terms of demand, both in Asia and in Europe. So my sense is inventory is very low.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speaker. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to get a \u2013 I guess some thoughts on this demand situation. It looks like demand is flowing through slightly better on polyolefins. Is that \u2013 would you attribute any of that to inventory building ahead of this large turnaround schedule that's coming in North America? And then secondly, do you think that there is any kind of flow through from lower energy prices on demand?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yes, good morning, Arun. First of all, in terms of inventory build in polyolefins, we haven't really seen that. And typically, with turnarounds, my sense is that the industry doesn't tend to build polyolefin inventory, especially here in the U.S. where we're able to supplement ethylene production through purchases and so on. So, I think inventories are probably at average levels in our industry and I would say downstream they're on the low side.","In terms of demand benefiting from lower energy, difficult to say. I think the more important theme is that in 2015, we saw very good strong growth in polyethylene and polypropylene globally, including in Europe where we saw demand growth. And I think this is a testament to the fact that both of those product areas and about two-thirds of our total output from the company goes into non-durable applications, which tend to grow generally irrespective of economic conditions. And so, again, I see next year 2016 being very similar, that demand growth and supply growth will likely match, and we'll have pretty balanced markets. And again, if there is inventory replenishment downstream then that should add to demand in 2016.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great, and just as a follow-up, just want to get your thoughts on capacity growth in general, there is obviously a lot of crackers set to come online in 2017 through 2019. Do you see all of that coming through, and how does that affect your own decisions to expand polyethylene capacity?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","There are \u2013 I think there are something like eight crackers that are planned here in the U.S. between 2017 and 2020. As evidenced by prior start-ups, not all of those will start-up on time. Our sense is most of those will go; timing could vary based on what's been announced.","Our approach has been, in the past, and will continue to be in the future, that we want to be largely integrated in the ethylene and derivative chain. But we do have some merchant \u2013 we do have a merchant position, I expect us to have one in the future. And as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, so far we're advancing a 1 billion pound expansion and we have a few others that we're working. So, those others, it will be more a matter of timing and phasing.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, it's Brian Maguire on for Bob.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Hi, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I was hoping you could share your thoughts on any potential impacts on the lifting of the crude export ban in the U.S.? And I guess, particularly and refining operations, any expected impact from that?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Brian, I don't see much impact, in terms of crude supply. We've been diversifying our crude supply over the past three years or four years and we have a good mix of Canadian, Mexican and other sources. So, I don't expect much of an impact.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And one follow-up, I know, you mentioned couple times, how strong polypropylene margins have been recently. I guess, just kind of what are you seeing in January and how do you expect that to play out through the rest of 2016? Is it a case kind of like with polyethylene, where the polymer margin can \u2013 is tight enough that you can sustainably hold on to that? Or do you expect to have to pass some of the lower monomer through, as 2016 goes on?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, in the case of polypropylene, we see a very, very tight market, there is really not any new supply coming here in the U.S. So, I would expect that to continue. We've had years of fairly modest margins. And as you know, our company has significant leverage to polypropylene. We're the largest polypropylene producer in the world. And so we're very constructive about polypropylene.","Polyethylene, I think is very balanced. We get these inventory cycles that come through, but again as I mentioned in the prior question, small increases in crude price have caused spurts of buying which tells me that, there is not a lot of inventory downstream. And I think, as we go into the seasonally strong period in March, April, May, we should see markets be very firm.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Bob, on styrene, you've been positive, constructive for the last number of quarters, what's your view now on styrene heading into 2016, post the little bit weakness you saw in Q4?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","David, I'm still constructive, I mean, I think if you step back and look at supply \u2013 new supply, there isn't much that's coming. There is \u2013 anticipated restart or already restarted POSM unit in Europe that was down, there're some others that are down in Asia right now. But again styrene, a lot like polypropylene has gone through even more so I would say, styrene has gone through years of under investment and demand has finally caught up. And we see styrene market being much more balanced over the coming years. And we think, now that the shift in polystyrene demand has happened. Demand should grow reasonably well year-over-year.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And last Bob, there's been some M&A activity pick up this week, what's your view on M&A for Lyondell, maybe over the next two years, three years, four years? How will that play into your growth plans?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","I think as I've mentioned David in prior calls, our priority thus far has been on share repurchase, and when we think about deploying our free cash flow. But as all good companies do, we study various different ideas, and we know the lane that we want to play in, we know our strengths, and so we continue to monitor the market. And we're always weighing share buyback versus other options.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. Bob, just I thought you might outline in more detail some of your derivative expansion plans in this call. Just wondering when can we expect more of an outline? And is it primarily polyethylene that you remain interested in, do you have that capacity to increase your polypropylene plants?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yeah. So far I've defined for you the 1 billion pound expansion that we're thinking we'd bring online in 2018 and 2019. We'll develop further plans as the year progresses. So you can imagine, I don't want to get out in front of my board in terms of the kind of growth plans that we envision. But if you just step back and think about our strategy and our approach, we aim to be largely integrated in ethylene and derivatives. And I think that will stay true as time goes on.","In terms of polypropylene, we're actively studying debottleneck ideas, and we'll consider greenfield as well. Still early, we've seen this improvement in polypropylene very quickly in 2015. So, we'll be very thoughtful and methodical as we've been in the past, but to the extent possible debottlenecks have served us well in the past and that's an area, we'll explore in the future first.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And just on the polypropylene outlook, as you showed in the slide 16, polyethylene demands recover to its long term trend, polypropylene hasn't. Do you think that as propylene is come down to a more normal ratio relative to ethylene that you could still see further demand expansion in polypropylene?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Absolutely, I think, polypropylene demand will likely accelerate more as propylene is much more competitive, especially here in the U.S.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. I'm surprised you thought that customers' inventories of polyethylene are low going into all this outage activity that we going to have in North America. Why do you think, they are not preparing for that?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","I think, their sense is that the product is very available. That's usually been the trend. The only time John that I have seen customers build inventory is when we had a couple of bad hurricanes come through Houston, I think that spooked people. And so prior to hurricane season they build for a year or two. But generally they don't do that, we haven't seen that.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I'd imagine by now you've repositioned your ethylene that gets displaced by the new oxy cracker. Could you just confirm that?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yes. We've been actively contracting ethylene, as you know, with our Corpus Christi startup in the third quarter. We're well ahead of our planning on all of that and we had a fairly, matured merchant portfolio in terms of customers for ethylene and so we were planning for that very well.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, Hassan.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","You touched in your prepared remarks, you touched on a bit of a hit to your Saudi joint ventures. Now we all know obviously that the Saudi's escalated cost towards the end of the year, in terms of natural gas cost, ethane cost and the like. So what sort of \u2013 if we were to sort of freeze product pricing at current levels and oil prices and the like. What sort of a year-on-year hit should we expect from that feedback cost escalation in Saudi?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yeah, Hassan for us it's very modest. As you know, our joint venture, equity ownership is about 25% in the biggest ethane cracker investment over there for us. I would estimate that to be in the $10 million to $15 million range annually. So it's not significant, frankly.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Super. And as a follow up, on the acetyl side of things, bit of an interesting year last year, where you had like a series of industry outages in 2015, then you had initially higher methanol prices then a precipitous decline in methanol prices. So how should we be thinking about, the acetyl business on a year-over-year basis, particularly in light of \u2013 some of this capacity coming back on line and continue downward pressure on methanol prices?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well I think, in terms of methanol Hassan, certainly more capacity has come on line and you can see the impact of that. I think, it's going to be a more competitive market in 2016. In terms of further downstream into acetyls, we're going to have to watch how Asia demand develops and how well global capacity runs. But likely, a little bit more competitive market in 2016 than there was in 2015.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Super. Thanks so much Bob.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. Can we talk a bit about feedstocks, in particular ethane and propane, I'm just looking at natural gas, is at $1.99 and propane has become the preferred crack again. So, I guess two questions within this, one is how low do you think ethane is actually going to be able to go with the natural gas price and we passed the point where propane can't drag it lower either, and then I have a follow-up.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Sure. Well, first of all, we talked about this last time that as ethane price moves up and down, it doesn't track exactly with its cost floor day-to-day. But over time our sense is that there is \u2013 ethane is still very well supplied, and it should sell closer to its cost floor. The fact that propane is more in favor today in terms of economics, I think that will ebb and flow as we crack more propane then ethane could come back in and the key for us at the company is to focus on flexibility. And then, so I think we have a very flexible cracker fleet that can crack all the way up to naphtha still and then that's what we are aiming to do, Vincent is to make sure that we retain that flexibility and incrementally build on that.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, I guess that gets into my follow-up question, which is the new oil price stack and futures curve. Are you changing your thoughts on flexibility and what you want to be more flexible for, is that shifting away from ethane at all as we move into the latter half of the decade where there is going to be a lot more ethane demand and maybe not as much production?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","I think \u2013 again I think flexibility is going to be the key and so we are investing incrementally to increase our flexibility to crack more propane, a few other feedstocks. And so, that's what we want to retain longer-term. It is difficult to call two years, three years from now whether it will be ethane or propane. We want to make sure that we can crack meaningful amounts of the big feedstocks.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, fellas.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, Duffy.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Question just on the split between ethylene and ethylene derivatives. When we get through with the \u2013 your debottlenecks that are going on this spring for you and for others. It looks like ethylene capacity is going to increase, until you bring on your potential polyethylene. Should it be fair to think about things sliding for the ethylene side and moving more towards the derivatives over the back half of 2016 and 2017?","Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations","Well, Duffy this is Doug. We've long had a very solid merchant position with the key supplier base there. And obviously, as we increase the ethylene when we bring up the capacity at Corpus Christi, we'll add that probably in the third quarter you'll see that come into the market. That's contracted, but you'll see that as merchant sales. I think (44:45) remember its merchant sales, is where it's going to, so it's contracted merchant.","Then, as we move down the road, what we'll do is we'll bring the polyethylene capacity up, and that will sort of rebalance across that. And as Bob said, he's looking at other polyethylene options, and other derivative options for it within the company. So, yeah, you will see our merchant position for a while step up in a contracted manner.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, just the lower oil price environment, how does that affect the economics of the PO\/TBA plant you guys are contemplating in Texas?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yeah. I think, Duffy on that one, the key is first of all having a view on octane and we think octane is going to be very tight because a lot of the new engines are high compression engines, who require high octane. The other thing that's important to remember about PO\/TBA is that the TBA benefits from butane selling below oil price. So, we see butane discounts relative to oil sustaining at the kind of levels that they've been \u2013 50%, 60%. If you think about the gas barrel, or associated gas that gets developed, wet gas will be preferred because it has co-products that have good economics. So, we think that still looks solid, and remember the startup on that is mid-2020 or early 2020. So likely by then, I would think oil prices are higher than where we are today.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Terrific. Thank you, guys.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov of Nomura Securities. Your line is now open.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. If I remember correctly, you were initially thinking about 1 billion to 2 billion pounds expansion for your polyethylene plant, and it seems like you have decided on the low end of this range. Could you just give us some thoughts on why? Why did you come down at a 1 billion versus 2 billion?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yeah. I think, Aleksey, this is really more about phasing. So we're advancing the first project in a more focused way, and then as the year progresses, we'll be in a position to talk a little bit more about the phasing of the next project. So, it's not an absolute, this one is the only one we'll do. We have several ideas; I just want to make sure that we do them in a paced kind of phased manner.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And as a follow up, in the medium-term, it appears that your cash flow does not support both dividend and the share buybacks at the current pace; you would need to keep borrowing incrementally to sustain this pace of buybacks. Is your medium-term plan to keep doing that, to increase the leverage, or perhaps the level of buybacks could be impacted?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, if think about our cadence, what we have done up to this point is we've been on this pace of 10% share buyback. I think you should expect that we're going to be relatively consistent with that. We'll be issuing our proxy in early March and so you can read the detail there. But given where share price is today, given what our earnings outlook is, I think we should be able to support a reasonable share buyback program. We've shown in the past that we've been willing to take on incrementally a bit more debt to support the share buyback program. I think we're prepared to do that; if you look at our leverage we're quite low. So, we'll continue to evaluate that as the year goes, but I would expect that our pace in the past is what should occur in the future.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey good morning, gentlemen. Hey Bob, you outlined a \u2013 coming back on polyethylene, you outlined a case that you're not really seeing margin compression here in January relative to Q4. And your expectation is you're going to see demand improve seasonally and there is a lot of industry turnaround. So, I'm guessing you're thinking things are going to stay relatively stable through the middle of the year. And then, when things start to pick back up, operations start to pick back up, what do you say to investors that might be expecting to see some more margin compression in the back half of this year?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yeah good morning Frank. Absolutely, in the first half of the year we think that markets are going to be fairly tight. In the back half of the year, we are going to have to see how demand develops in China, here in the U.S. and there is certainly new capacity coming online. So I think, that it will probably more of a balanced market in the second half, as opposed to the first half that has the potential to be a very tight market.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And staying with that demand theme globally, obviously you will see how China develops. How are you thinking about that region right now and for that matter, how are you thinking about European demand as well. Obviously the stock market is telling us one thing; what are you seeing on the ground?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","In terms of polyethylene demand?","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sure, yes.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yeah, well I think demand is still \u2013 is developing quite nicely. Again as I mentioned earlier in one of the questions, we're seeing buying activity pick up as we move towards the second half of January. And I would expect that this year we ought to see similar growth to last year. And frankly, if I'm right about lower inventories downstream, the higher \u2013 as the oil price incrementally stabilizes or moves up, we should see inventory replenishment downstream, which will add to demand growth year-over-year. So frankly, I'm pretty constructive about polyethylene growth here going into 2016. Frank, downstream, our customers don't have a lot of inventory globally.","Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thanks very much. There's been an enormous curtailment of oil drilling in the United States, and presumably that curtailment will continue. Do you think that that will affect ethane supply over the next couple of years?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Jeff, so far we don't see an impact. It's certainly something we watch, and if we look at what industry consultants have been talking about and our own intel, our sense is that ethane should be very well supplied. There is enough ethane to supply the expansions that are upcoming. Our sense also is that, if you think about gas drilling, likely the wet barrels could develop first because ethane and propane and butane incrementally provide value to the economics of gas.","So, we're pretty constructive and again for us, we continue to focus on our ability to also crack more propane and butane and so on. And I think the industry will swing from ethane to propane and propane becomes more favored and that'll naturally balance the three NGLs, I think. So, more and more we need to consider the NGL pool as a total rather than the individuals, I think.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, for my follow-up, you talked about stability in polyethylene margins. And I mean, no one exactly knows where polyethylene prices are going to go, but isn't that sort of the general drift of things, that maybe in the next couple of months they'll come off, I don't know, a nickel a pound, something like that? So, do you have a different view, or do you think that your margin compression in polyethylene will come in the second quarter?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","I think, you said it well Jeff, it is difficult to predict the price where it's going to go. But, one thing that I think about is the balance between supply and demand, whether it's regionally or globally and my sense is that we still have fairly balanced markets. While coming into a March, April, May timeframe, it will bring a seasonal uptick in demand, likely inventory restocking. I would imagine at some point oil price will reach some kind of a bottom and if that happens it will bring buyers back.","We've had \u2013 if you think about 2015, we had a year where not only there was lack of confidence on oil price, but also there were questions about economic growth in the U.S., and in China, and we are destocking, despite that polyethylene demand grew more than 4%. So that's what makes me constructive. In the near-term, I don't where polyethylene prices are going to go, but I think markets are pretty balanced.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Bob, if the first wave of crackers start up in the U.S., at least four or five crackers, and if we need to get Marcellus ethane down to \u2013 of course to feed those crackers, do you see a port pressure on ethane if it has to be brought in from Marcellus?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yeah, I think if it has to be then certainly there is a tariff that they have to pay to get the ethane down. But I would say that as the first wave of crackers come online, there are closer supplies of ethane that will come to market. If ethane price were to rise enough for propane and butane to become much more economic, I think you'll see those who can shift to those other feedstocks, we'll do it. So \u2013 so that will all bring things in balance. And our sense is that the industry is still rejecting somewhere 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of ethane. And albeit some of that is up further away, but there's certainly enough nearby that I don't see ethane price rising dramatically above its fuel value. But it's something we'll continue to monitor of course.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. And you have a great balance sheet today, and given that if we do get into a cyclical downturn, how do you think your capital allocation strategy could change, and how can LyondellBasell take advantage of that situation? Thank you.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, in past investor meetings that we've had and when we did Investor Day last year, we showed you our cash deployment hierarchy. And I would say we're still very consistent with what we've shown you. Our first and highest priority is to making our assets very well. So we're going to spend money on maintenance capital and health, safety and environmental capital. We'll pay our dividends, we'll service our debt, and \u2013 when you think about our dividend, it's about 30% of our EPS. So, there are a lot of capacity certainly in our balance sheet as you rightfully mentioned, is very flexible. So, I thing we want to maintain this kind of strength and flexibility as we work through the back part of this decade and I think we'll find opportunities based on these strengths.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you speakers. Our next question is from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Yes. good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. What is your view on the ethylene price in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world? It seems significantly lower than Asia, certainly, and Europe. Is it going to sustain itself at this discount, or do you think that there's any sort of arbitrage opportunity?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Good morning, Nils. Well, first of all, when you think about the ethylene price, let's go back to Q4 and think about what developed during Q4. Production of ethylene in the U.S. was at a record level in Q4, where we had the highest production. At a time, when we also had a largely merchant supplier of ethylene had logistic issues where they had to move ethylene out of a cavern because they were going to do some maintenance on it. Also we had a very weak PVC market.","So I think all of those things led to a decline in ethylene price in Q4 and that's kind of where we are today. As we work through Q1 and Q2 and we've talked about some of these large unplanned \u2013 sorry planned outages that are in Q2 that will likely tighten the market. I would expect PVC to improve. This specific logistics issue I described, and I think that will run its course by the end of Q1. So we'll have to see, but it seems to me that ethylene price ought to drift somewhat higher and the forward curve indicates that for ethylene.","The other thing that's important here in the U.S. is to also look at polyethylene price, and look at polyethylene price in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world. And I think that starts to make a lot more sense. So, our ethylene is priced more locally and polyethylene is priced globally. And it's important to remember that distinction as we move through the year.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. Understood. Now, certainly, polypropylene has seeing a significant jump in its margin through 2015, it seems like 2016 even in January, there was some margin expansion there too. Is there to \u2013 it's a kind of a two part question. At what point, will this encourage additional investment in the U.S., you think to build more capacity? And then, is there a chance that polypropylene is getting to expenses relative to say high-density polyethylene and it might encourage some inter-polymer substitution.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Well, I think in terms of expansion, first of all you have remember that from the time somebody decides they're going to expand it to takes two to three years to that polypropylene capacity. So, I think meaningful expansions as we sit here today likely not until back half of the 2018 and maybe 2019, something like that, if someone were to decide today.","In the near-term, polypropylene expansions have to come in concert with some thought about the source of propylene, and as we have more flexible crackers and propylene output varies, those who are going to expand have to take a view on where propylene prices are going and where the supply is going to come from.","So, my sense is that this year, people will probably take a look at that and see where we go. In the near-term, I don't think higher polypropylene prices will impact demand or substitution from polyethylene, we've seen these periods in the past. I think polypropylene is very competitively priced.","Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","All right. Thanks, guys.","Douglas J. Pike - Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. I think we're about out of time. So, I think we'll have one more question, please. I apologize to anyone that we haven't been able to take their questions.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our last question is next from Alexander Laurence with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Just a quick one. As you look at the cadence of investment over the next four or five years, to what extent is that being regulated by engineering bandwidth? And is there a need to sort of improve the bandwidth or increase engineering capabilities into the next cycle? So, can you just give us a little bit of longer-term context on that?","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","Yeah. I think certainly, that has been the most challenging part of this construction cycle is the frontend engineering and so the industry or the EPC companies have added some of that capability. And if you think about our projects like the PO\/TBA project and our polyethylene project, those are kind of on the backend of construction of the big crackers and so on.","So I think those projects will benefit from some slackening in demand, but not only engineering capability, but also for construction and commissioning and so on. So, I think, we're well placed and if you think about future cycles, the industry has certainly added capacity to be able to execute projects.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Bhavesh V. Patel - Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Management Board","All right. Well thank you for all your thoughtful questions as always. Let me close with a few comments. First of all 2015 was a very challenging year, we had significant oil price decline, feedstock price volatility and uncertain outlook for global economic growth. Despite all of these headwinds, our portfolio continues to prove its resiliency and we delivered record results.","I think our focus on safety, operational reliability and cost efficiency continue to serve us very well and position us to outperform in a verity of market conditions. This focus has enabled robust free cash flow generation, which has been deployed in a very shareholder-friendly way through low cost, high value growth projects, strong regular dividend, and large stock buybacks. Going forward, our focus and priorities remain very consistent.","Thanks for your continued interest in our company.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference.

The passcode for both numbers is 1346.","During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives.","That being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","All right. Thank you, Dave. Good day to all of you for participating around the world and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call.","Let's begin with slide 3 and review the highlights. During the third quarter, our company overcame headwinds from rising feedstock costs, global trade rebalancing, and new industry capacity. We ran our assets well and improved on 2017 profitability in four of our six segments.","Year-to-date, LyondellBasell's EBITDA is nearly $250 million higher than 2017. Third quarter diluted earnings were $2.85 per share. Our results include $53 million of pre-tax charges associated with the acquisition of A. Schulman on August 21. That reduced earnings by $0.11 per share. After adjusting for transaction and integration expenses from A. Schulman and gains from an asset sale in the third quarter of 2017, our quarterly results improved by $0.55 per share relative to the prior year.","During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's value-driven growth strategy achieved several milestones. We've formed the world's largest compounding company with the acquisition of A. Schulman. We launched the Advanced Polymer Solutions business segment to provide focus and visibility for this new global platform. And, in Houston, we began construction of the world's largest propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol plant.","We continue to evaluate a potential transaction with Braskem. At the same time, our strong cash flows enabled us to return over $700 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","In short, the employees of LyondellBasell are delivering on our promise of value-driven growth through a balanced strategy of operational excellence, profitable organic expansions, accretive M&A, and generous shareholder returns.","Please turn to slide 4 where we report our safety performance for the third quarter with combined A. Schulman results since August 21. The drive for excellence at LyondellBasell begins with a commitment to safety and environmental performance based on the idea that our assets, the communities in which we operate, and our more than 17,000 employees should all finish the day in the same or better condition than they were at the start of the day.","Our first communications with the A. Schulman employees that joined LyondellBasell in August consistently emphasized the importance of safe, injury-free operations. As we complete the fourth quarter, our team has recommitted to ourselves, our colleagues, and our families to finish strong in 2018 with another record year of improved safety performance.","On slide 5 we describe the businesses that form our new Advanced Polymer Solutions business segment. APS is more than just the former A. Schulman business. The segment also includes LyondellBasell's global polypropylene compounds business from our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment, to double the volume and add more than twice the EBITDA to the legacy Schulman business.","We also moved nearly 1 billion pounds of premium Catalloy and polybutene-1 polymers from O&P EAI and O&P Americas to complete the new APS segment. Combined with the adjusted EBITDA of approximately $200 million reported by A. Schulman, these businesses generated approximately $640 million of EBITDA during 2017.","Slide 6 provides a glimpse of how our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment extends LyondellBasell's reach into growing and attractive markets. We have grouped the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment into two business lines. The Compounding & Solutions business combines LyondellBasell's existing polypropylene compounding business, which is largely focused on automotive applications, with A. Schulman's more diverse business lines. Masterbatches, our compounds that provide differentiated properties when combined with commodity plastics used in packaging, agriculture, and durable goods applications. Engineered composites and engineered polymers add value for more specialized high-performance applications across a variety of industries. Specialty powders are largely used to mold toys, industrial tanks, and sporting goods such as kayaks. Performance colors provide powdered, pelletized and liquid color concentrates for the plastics industry.","The Advanced Polymers business of APS consists of LyondellBasell's legacy Catalloy and polybutene-1 polymer product lines. These unique polymers can be used within APS for downstream compounding or can be sold as raw materials to third-party customers. Catalloy is a line of differentiated propylene-based polymers that add value in packaging applications and construction materials such as the white membranes that are capturing an increasing share of the commercial roofing market. Polybutene-1 is a unique polymer that is used in both specialty piping and packaging applications.","The Advanced Polymer Solutions segment provides both focus and visibility for LyondellBasell's new platform of profitable growth.","And now Thomas will provide more detail on our financial highlights for the second quarter.","Thomas Aebischer - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Bob, and good day to all of you. Please turn to slide 7 which illustrates the developments of our business segments over the trailing 12 months. As Bob mentioned, four of our six segments have delivered increased profitability over 2017. Improved performance, particularly from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, more than offset compressed margins in O&P Europe, Asia, and International.","During the third quarter, we were pleased to see continued strength in ethylene and polyethylene chain margins in North America where robust demand offset headwinds from higher ethane costs to support quarter-over-quarter earnings growth for our Olefins and Polyolefins America segment.","Our refinery ran well during the third quarter. In the coming days, we will complete our last major planned maintenance event in advance of 2019 when increased demand of low-sulfur marine fuels specified by the International Maritime Organization is predicted to bolster margins for LyondellBasell's refinery. We were pleased to see that last week's IMO meetings in London reaffirmed the implementation plans for these new standards to reduce ship emissions.","LyondellBasell's Technology business delivered another quarter of outstanding results, driven by increased licensing revenue. In the first nine months of 2018, LyondellBasell announced new license agreements for nine polyethylene and polypropylene plants around the world. During October, we announced another seven new plant licenses, bringing the year-to-date total to 16 new license agreements, the most ever in company history. The net result is that LyondellBasell's trailing 12 months' EBITDA is now approximately $7.4 billion, more than $550 million higher than the same period last year.","As Bob mentioned, earnings grew by $0.55 per share relative to the same quarter last year. While nearly one-fourth of this improvement is due to higher earnings, nearly 70% of this earnings growth can be attributed to the reduction in our effective tax rate due to U.S. tax reform and other tax planning that decreased our rate by 9.2 percentage points to 17.2% in the third quarter. After excluding our beneficial second quarter tax settlements, we expect the full year effective tax rate to be somewhat lower than our initial guidance of 21%.","On slide 8, you can see that LyondellBasell's businesses continued to generate over $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities during the third quarter. Approximately $1.8 billion of cash was invested in August to acquire A. Schulman and, during September, we called $375 million of A. Schulman debt. Our strong balance sheet enabled us to continue investing in our organic growth projects while returning over $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","The quarter closed with over $2 billion of cash and liquid investments on the balance sheet. With approximately $3.3 billion of unused and available credit facilities, we closed the quarter with a total liquidity in excess of $5 billion.","Now please turn to slide 9. The chart on the left illustrates our cash flow performance over the trailing 12 months. Over this period, LyondellBasell generated nearly $5.7 billion of cash from operating activities. This powerful cash generation has enabled our free cash flow to rise at the same time that our capital investments are also increasing. LyondellBasell's trailing 12 months' free cash flow yield was 9.7% at the end of the third quarter. Capital expenditures during the third quarter were approximately $480 million. Investments should increase during the fourth quarter as we continue the construction of our Hyperzone PE facility and accelerate the activity for building our PO\/TBA plant in Houston.","Our 3.9% dividend yield remains in the top quartile of all S&P 500 companies. Similar to the second quarter, we repurchased more than 3 million shares during the third quarter and finished September with 387 million shares outstanding.","With that, I will turn the call back to Bob. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you, Thomas. Let's turn to slide 10 and review our segment results. In our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment third quarter EBITDA was $704 million, a $33 million increase over the second quarter. Olefins results improved by approximately $120 million compared to the second quarter of 2018 with the price of ethylene increasing approximately $0.04 per pound. Ethylene operating rates increased during the third quarter, averaging 93%. With the completion of planned maintenance at one of our four \u2013 one of our Channelview, Texas crackers in the second quarter, we were able to partially offset the impact of increased feedstock costs in the third quarter with propylene production from our flex unit. Approximately 81% of our ethylene production was from ethane and 93% came from NGLs.","Polyethylene results decreased approximately $80 million during the third quarter, partially offsetting the improvement in olefins. Polyethylene spreads over ethylene decreased by approximately $0.06 per pound as the increase in ethylene price was coupled with the decline in polyethylene prices.","Polyethylene chain margins are stable in October as an increase in polyethylene price was offset by higher ethane costs. We may see some margin recovery with the higher polyethylene prices in the fourth quarter and the recent moderation in ethane.","Please turn to slide 11 to review the fundamentals behind the current ethane volatility. While most observers agree that ethane will be abundant in the long term, supply constraints in the recent weeks have caused prices to escalate from below $0.30 per gallon to over $0.60 per gallon. This past week, we've seen prices moderate to the low $0.30 per gallon range. This volatility is driven by an increase in ethane demand from new crackers and exports combined with constraints in midstream pipeline and fractionation capacity.","The chart on the right illustrates our view of the U.S. Gulf Coast ethane situation. The bars represent ethane demand from both Gulf Coast ethylene crackers and exports. Many of the older ethylene crackers have the capability to optimize by switching feedstocks as market conditions change. For the years 2018 and beyond, we show this range of feedstock flexibility and the resulting impact to ethane demand. As you can see, supply and demand balances can quickly change by switching feedstocks in response to input prices, and reduced demand from ethylene crackers is rapidly reflected in lower prices for ethane.","Today, many crackers continue to maximize ethane feed but we will likely see increased utilization of feedstock flexibility as the industry navigates through this period of volatility. We believe our view of port purity (00:16:07) ethane supply, represented by the blue line, is conservative and only considers fractionation projects that are underway. In addition to these projects, there is potential for new pipelines, expansions, or additional fractionation capacity that can further improve the ethane balances.","Beyond new midstream investments and the increased utilization of alternative feedstocks, any increase in cracker maintenance downtime and the moderation of ethylene capacity additions will provide further relief over the coming quarters. Most supply-and-demand forecasts indicate that the current tightness in ethane should resolve by 2020.","In summary, we believe this volatility is temporary and a result of misaligned investment cycles in the petrochemical and midstream industries. The strong underlying fundamentals are supportive, and there is attractive earnings growth potential as ethane supply improves while demand growth moderates.","On slide 12, I would like to size the potential impact of higher ethane prices and highlight how LyondellBasell's feedstock flexibility and diverse business portfolio can reduce this impact. LyondellBasell's fleet of U.S. Gulf Coast crackers have very high feedstock flexibility. The chart on the right shows you the range of feedstocks where we can operate. As you can see, we are able to use as little as 25% ethane and as much as 65% naphtha in our feed.","Our olefins optimization team is continuously seeking to maximize profitability across our crackers through optimization of feeds and products. We can rebalance NGL feeds within hours and switch to liquids within days to respond to changing economic conditions.","Additionally, our two Midwest crackers have access to low-priced Conway ethane\/propane mixed feeds. During October, ethane supply to our Midwest crackers was priced at approximately $0.13 per gallon. These crackers are not subject to the higher Gulf Coast ethane prices and continue to benefit from very strong chain margins.","If you consider our last 12 months' U.S. ethylene production and subtract our low-cost Midwest volumes and Gulf Coast merchant ethylene sales that pass through the ethane increase costs, you're left with about 5.5 billion pounds of annual ethylene volume that could be impacted by higher ethane prices. For this volume, a $0.20 per gallon change in ethane price will impact annual earnings by about $380 million. This estimate assumes we continue to crack around 80% ethane and does not take into account benefits from feedstock flexibility.","Furthermore, we are assuming in this analysis that prices for ethylene derivative products such as polyethylene, styrene, ethylene oxide, and VAM do not change. A price increase of $0.03 per pound for both polyethylene and styrene could reduce the impact by $290 million. This is another example of how LyondellBasell's diverse portfolio of businesses and assets helps to stabilize earnings during challenging market conditions and produce the resilient results that we delivered during the third quarter .","Now please turn to slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $262 million, $93 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $55 million. Volume decreased primarily due to planned maintenance which began in September at our cracker in Wesseling, Germany, impacting the quarter by approximately $15 million. This maintenance will be completed in the fourth quarter and is expected to impact results by $25 million in Q4.","Olefin margins also declined in third quarter as increases in feedstock costs outpaced an increase in the olefin prices. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $45 million. Polyolefin demand followed typical seasonal declines during the third quarter and polypropylene margins have decreased following increases in the price of propylene. Joint venture equity income increased by $15 million.","The chart on the lower left indicates that European polyethylene chain margins in the third quarter of 2018 were approximately $0.21 per pound, a similar level to the average seen five years ago in the region for the full year 2013.","European polypropylene margins have also declined, reaching approximately $0.02 per pound in the third quarter of 2018.","Minimal industry investment has resulted in a slight improvement in polypropylene margins compared to the average for 2013. Annualizing the third quarter 2018 profitability from our O&P EAI segment produces a much higher result than what we realized in 2013. After adjusting for historical profitability from businesses that were moved to our new APS segment, O&P EAI is now generating EBITDA at an annual rate that is more than $500 million higher than five years ago. Our restructuring efforts for the segment in the early years of this decade and an improved market for polypropylene are producing sustainable earnings improvements for LyondellBasell.","During October, European markets for polymers remained pressured with sluggish demand growth and ample supply. Market pressure is expected to continue during the fourth quarter with typically lower seasonal demand. Low water levels on the Rhine are also causing disruptions for petrochemical transportation and production in Germany that could counter these trends and lead to tighter market conditions.","On slide 14, let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $504 million, a reduction of $138 million from the prior quarter. While the high number of red arrows in the chart on the upper right clearly indicates a decline, you might recall that we are following a record-setting second quarter. We continue to be very pleased with the margins and business performance of the segment.","Planned maintenance on one of our propylene oxide plants in Bayport, Texas impacted third quarter results by approximately $20 million. This maintenance will be completed in November and is expected to impact fourth quarter results by approximately $25 million.","PO and derivatives results declined approximately $50 million. Volumes were lower due to planned and unplanned downtime, and we also experienced a seasonal decline in markets. Intermediate chemicals results fell by approximately $35 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to a $0.04 per pound decrease in styrene margins. Lower seasonal margins in the third quarter drove a decline in oxyfuels and related products of $55 million. During October, oxyfuels margins declined with weaker gasoline demand. Margins for styrene and methanol are also expected to moderate as new methanol capacity fully enters the market and styrene capacity returns following industry maintenance downtime.","Turning to slide 15, let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. As I mentioned, we completed the acquisition of A. Schulman on August 21, and the results from the new product lines are included from that point forward. Thus, comparisons of underlying business drivers for the second quarter are related to the LyondellBasell legacy product lines of polypropylene compounds, Catalloy, and polybutene-1.","EBITDA decreased by $51 million compared to the second quarter. Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition were approximately $49 million during the third quarter of 2018. Results for both Compounding & Solutions and advanced polymers were relatively unchanged versus the second quarter. The addition of new product lines from the acquisition offset seasonal volume and margin declines for polypropylene compounds.","Our integration of A. Schulman is going very well. Of the $49 million of costs assigned to the segment during the quarter, approximately 60% were related to the integration and 40% to the transaction. As of the end of the third quarter, we have focused on reducing redundancies to capture cost synergies at an annual rate of $32 million. We are well on track to reach our target of $150 million in cost-based synergies within two years.","The chart on the lower right provides a good example of one of the attractive and growing markets found in our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. As I mentioned earlier, Catalloy is a line of differentiated propylene-based polymers that can be used in packaging, compounding or in construction materials such as the white commercial roofing membranes that we see in a photograph on slide 6.","Polyolefin roofing membranes are becoming the preferred solution for commercial roofing and growing at an annual rate of 7% per year due to their durability, cost savings and energy efficiency. The unique and desirable properties of LyondellBasell's Catalloy polymers provides an advantage for commercial roofing applications, and our sales volumes in this market have outpaced the industry and have grown by 9% over recent years. We look forward to sharing more examples of the products and customer solutions that are driving growth for our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment in future calls.","Now let's move to slide 16 for a discussion of our Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $84 million, a $20 million decline from the second quarter. Crude throughput at the refinery averaged 232,000 barrels per day with planned maintenance beginning in September that impacted EBITDA approximately $20 million. This maintenance will be completed in November and is expected to impact fourth quarter results by $45 million.","While the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread decreased by more than $4 per barrel when compared to the second quarter, our refinery benefited from margin improvements driven by favorable Canadian crude oil prices relative to the Maya price. During October, we continued the safe execution of our planned maintenance at the refinery. Margins are moderating with a declining Maya 2-1-1 crack spread driven by lengthened gasoline inventories as the summer driving season ends.","On slide 17, I would like to review the drivers that could fuel LyondellBasell's earnings growth over the next 12 months. These are no longer distant promises. These are opportunities that we focused on during the third quarter and will continue to advance during the coming months. The completion of the A. Schulman acquisition is improving our vertical integration and expanding our reach into growing and attractive markets. Our integration management office is rapidly driving integration and capturing synergies. The startup of our Hyperzone polyethylene capacity in 2019 will meet the rising demand and favorable markets for high-density polyethylene to improve our capture of integrated chain margins.","Our Intermediates and Derivatives team have diligently driven structural improvements within their business which continues to benefit from favorable market conditions. Our team at the Houston refinery has delivered six consecutive quarters of highly reliable operations with improved margins. And going forward, our refinery is well positioned to benefit from new regulations for marine fuels during the latter half of next year.","Turning to slide 18, let me summarize this quarter's highlights. During the third quarter, our company delivered year-over-year and year-to-date EBITDA improvements in four of our business segments. We overcame the challenges of new industry capacity and rising feedstock costs, increased third quarter profitability for our O&P Americas segment. Over the past 12 months, our company generated approximately $5.7 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed to funding for our increased capital investment, paying a top-quartile dividend, completing over $800 million in share repurchases, and completing the acquisition of A. Schulman.","We have built the world's largest plastics compounding business. We're progressing on integration that will capture significant synergies in this new segment. We have advanced on the construction of our new polyethylene and PO\/TBA capacity, and we're continuing to evaluate the Braskem opportunity. Our global portfolio of businesses provides confidence in our ability to remain resilient, flexible and advantaged in this environment. Going forward, we look forward to the safe and timely completion of our fourth quarter planned maintenance that will allow us to capture this advantage during 2019 and beyond.","With that said, we're now pleased to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question is from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Bob, the ethane flexibility slide you showed is quite interesting. And you mentioned you've got pretty quick ability to switch. So I'm curious, in light of when ethane got up to $0.60, can you give us your spread across those different input molecules, what you used, ethane, the propane, butanes and the naphtha?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we can change very quickly. And in some cases, we were able to switch to liquids very quickly. Channelview and Corpus Christi are our most flexible crackers and that's where we tend to focus on pushing more on liquids. So, I don't have the exact numbers with me at that point in time what we did, but we did start to move where we could quickly.","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And did you adjust at all? I noticed in your interesting slide about the industry flexibility, you referred back to 10 years ago. It seemed like there's been a wave of conversions or upgrading to ethane feedstock ability. Are you pretty confident that most of those \u2013 and I guess speaking from your own assets that you can go back to where you were 10 years ago in terms of liquids processing capability?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. In our case, certainly we've accounted for our ability to process the co-products from heavier feeds and we've retained all that capability, again, primarily at Channelview, and we did our best estimate of the rest of the industry and took into account what capacity was converted versus which part of the capacity was made more flexible (00:32:44).","Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Right. Thanks for the help.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. You may go ahead.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Bob, I was wondering if you have the ability to crack Y-grade. If there's a surplus of it with not enough fractionation capacity, can you crack Y-grade or do you have downstream limitations on recovering that methane?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. So, Steve, we do have capability of cracking Y-grade and, in fact, we're working on increasing that capability, and we're able to make some relatively low-cost investments and increase our flexibility to crack Y-grade and we're working on that right now.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Interesting. And then a quick one on all the media attention on recycled plastic and so forth. Do you see that as just kind of peripheral noise or are you hearing it from your plastics customers where they have a meaningful interest in increasing the blend of recycled plastic into their product that could create a pull?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I think, Steve, the area of plastic waste and sustainability is continuing to get more interest and rightfully so. But I think it'll take time for the infrastructure to develop and the capability to develop to increase recycling. As you know, we have a joint venture with SUEZ in the Netherlands, what we call QCP, and that's very much that. It's a platform that eventually we will grow to have more recycled content. But if you step back and think about plastics demand growth, demand growth for plastics is still growing at a multiple of GDP. So to the extent that there's more recycled content, I still think the growth story is in place for plastics.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. You may go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Ethane has come down quite a lot, Bob, recently. Do you think that that has to do with different crackers being turned around or do you think that the industry is already switching over to other feedstocks and so, what that did is it lessened demand for ethane and brought the price down? How do you diagnose the price change?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Slide 11 in our presentation really shows how balanced the market is on ethane. And when we reach this sort of balance between supply and demand, small shifts in supply or demand tend to make the price dynamic. And I think what's happened in the recent weeks is that there's been some planned maintenance on some fairly large ethane crackers. There's also been some switching to other feedstocks. So, I expect that for the next few quarters we're going to see this sort of dynamic pricing on ethane. When some of these crackers return, you could see ethane price rise again.","And that's why we wanted to size the impact to LyondellBasell on a large change in ethane if it were to be sustained an entire year. And what you see is, given our portfolio of crackers and given our two Midwest crackers, the impact to us is not as great as one might think before flexibility-based mitigation. So, if we just continued to crack a lot of ethane \u2013 we've sized the impact on page 12, if we flex to other feeds, then the impact would be less.","So, I think we're going to see ebbs and flows through next year. We'll have turnaround season again in the spring. So, likely, that will reduce ethane demand. And in the meantime, more fractionation capacity is coming in 2019. More pipeline capacity is being built. So, we're going to go through a period of sort of timing of when feedstock is built out and when new consumptive capacity comes on.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, given that there seems to be some switching to probably naphtha, when you think about propylene values for next year, do you think propylene will be a little bit looser in 2019 than it was in 2018 given feedstock switches and other considerations?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Possibly. But it will be episodic I think, right, because as feed slates change, it won't be consistently well supplied. So I think ultimately, Jeff, what changes the propylene situation is as new PDHs are built, those are sort of structural increases in supply.","And to your point about naphtha, there's actually also switching to propane and butane. And there are more LPGs coming from West Texas down the Y-grade lines. So, there's a lot of propane and butane on the Gulf Coast.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. You may go ahead.","Frank J. Mitsch - Fermium Research LLC","Thank you, and good morning, gentlemen. Bob, I'm guessing a little less stressful this third quarter than where we were a year ago with Harvey. I wanted to ask about Braskem. When do you think you're going to have a decision there? And obviously I'm wondering if that might also play a role in your pace of buybacks here in Q4 with the market turmoil. Can you add a little color as to what investors might be able to expect in terms of M&A versus buyback and kind of the timing on that?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, Frank, we're continuing to work diligently and thoughtfully through our analysis around the Braskem transaction. There's really no timing to report at this point. We're continuing our work and thinking around shareholder value creation. And so, as we consider buybacks, to me, those are sort of independent decisions today. And whatever it is we decide in terms of our allocation of capital, we're aiming to create shareholder value. So stay tuned.","Frank J. Mitsch - Fermium Research LLC","All right. Great. So, the decisions are kind of independent at this point. Fair enough. And then, I was struck by the title and the discussion on slide 17, Tangible Earnings Growth Over the Next 12 Months. Obviously, there's some debate out there as to what happens on margins on the olefin\/polyolefin side of things. Should we be interpreting that statement to say that you're anticipating EBITDA over the next 12 months to be higher than EBITDA over the previous 12 months?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, what we're trying to indicate there is just sources of earnings growth. We haven't netted against polyolefins' market conditions. But I think, clearly, our I&D business has had a step up in earnings this year. We, at the last earnings call, talked about a 15% or so increase that's sort of structural in our business in I&D compared to our prior run rate. Refinery is running better. We think second half of next year, there will be some fuel switching as IMO starts to take hold and people get ready for March of 2020. And our new polyethylene plant in the second half of next year will consume ethylene today that essentially is selling near its cost. So, those are three, we think, meaningful sources of earnings growth next year.","Frank J. Mitsch - Fermium Research LLC","All right. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Alex Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bob, European polypropylene margins declined meaningfully this year. And in the U.S., polypropylene margins held up pretty well. What in your view explains this difference and where do these regions are likely to converge? Is Europe likely to improve or U.S. decline?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I think, Alex, globally, polypropylene is still very constructive. Operating rates are still relatively high. I think, in Europe, as we've had in years past, typically in the summer season, we see seasonality because the vacation periods are longer and often converters shut down for periods of time. Demand growth is a little bit slower this year in Europe. So, we think that partly also contributes.","But if I step back and look at the global situation in polypropylene, I think polypropylene still looks to us to be a very balanced tight (00:42:11) for the coming year or so. And so we would expect that polypropylene should hold up pretty well.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Thank you. And as a follow-up on polypropylene, you've indicated that you're looking at some polypropylene capacity projects in the U.S. and Europe and also PDH. Have you moved the likelihood of those projects higher or lower over the last six to nine months or so?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","We're still working through our early engineering estimates. Frankly, we're thinking through \u2013 on the Gulf Coast locations which location would be better given propylene supply, and we've had a few other things going on in the company. So, we're still working through it, and we think that propylene is an area where we'd like to continue to invest.","Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Instinet","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. You may go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","With ban on single-use plastic bags in many large cities around the world, do you see that end market for polyethylene coming under pressure? In other words, historically, people have assumed a GDP multiplier of 1.3 times or 1.4 times on polyethylene. Do you think that comes under pressure in the future?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, P.J., it's not a large part of the overall polyethylene market. And so, segment by segment there are different drivers but if I kind of step back and think about polyethylene demand growth, it's more about food packaging, polyethylene pipe, and some other sort of durable goods where I think polyethylene demand will continue to be driven.","With respect to the single-use bags, some parts of the world have mandated thicker bags that can be reused. So, ironically, if that were the case, then more polyethylene would be consumed because the bags are thicker. And I can tell you, when I lived in the Netherlands, we used to buy those thicker bags and reuse them. So, I don't know that demand really sort of goes away for those bags. It just converts to other forms of packaging.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And secondly, what are your views on the second wave of these ethylene crackers in the U.S. in light of this volatility in ethane? Do these companies say that this ethane situation would be resolved by the time these crackers come online, so they'll continue to build or do you think they start to get pushed out because of the situation?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, it's difficult for me to predict what others may do, but certainly, for us, we think through long-term supply and essentially the returns that we can earn on new investment \u2013 and we want to see more of the fractionation capacity and more pipeline capacity investments actually come to fruition before we would consider further ethylene investment in the U.S.","Now, we're a bit uniquely placed because we've already invested in ethylene earlier in the decade. And our focus for the coming three, four years is really about now investing in derivatives to consume the ethylene that we've already expanded. So I would imagine that this volatility and impact on the global cost curve should be a part of the equation as new investments are contemplated.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Just on U.S. polyethylene, we saw a surprising price decrease in August and then we had the ethane spike in September and then got the price back. And now there are, I believe, nominations for both October, which is almost over, and November. So, could you just sort of reconcile what's going on in the U.S. market with that surprise decrease and now the increases and maybe contrast it to some of the weakness we're seeing in the Asian PE markets? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Well, I mean, it's difficult to predict here how prices will evolve. But the increases and decreases, Vincent, to me say that the market is relatively balanced. And in the face of a significant cost push, there was some increase that went through in the market. And I suspect that as we look at operating rates globally, not a lot will change. Even though there's new capacity coming, demand is growing as well. And we've gone through this in prior earnings call slides where we've shown operating rates are still 90-plus percent. And so, I suspect that prices will be dynamic based on how costs develop as well.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And maybe just on that, this whole ethane thing seemed to come \u2013 we all seemed to get blindsided by it, analysts and producers alike. As you guys did your sort of look-back on what's happened over the past three months, what do you think the blind spot was for everyone that we didn't see that big spike coming?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. That's a great question, Vincent. I think that the thing that many of us missed was the fact that ethane was being rejected in the Permian in favor of more propane and butane moving on the Y-grade capacity, the line capacity that's already there. In the past, we were of the mind that the Y-grade that comes from West Texas is very rich in ethane and it's been wetter and wetter as time has gone on. But when that ethane got rejected, the composition of the Y-grade that came to Belvieu had less ethane. And I think that's what we didn't see. And you can imagine from a midstream gas processor perspective, by rejecting some ethane, they can actually move more Y-grade in total out of the gas pool. So, I think that's the part we probably missed.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. You may go ahead.","Bhavesh Lodaya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So, one more on the ethane and on the U.S. ethane advantage as such which we have enjoyed for quite many years for now. So, while you may see flex economics come into play, it's also more likely that that comes into play when ethane rises significantly from here. So, are we going to enter a period where the entire NGL barrel kind of like raises in value? And what does that do for the U.S. ethane advantage as you look forward the next few years?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. I think it's really \u2013 the ethane advantage still looks very durable to us because it's based on a view that there's an abundance of ethane supply. So, what we're seeing today is just a little bit of mismatch in timing of new cracker capacity for ethane consumption and new fractionation and pipeline that brings ethane to market. So, we view this very much as temporary and we think that the U.S. will continue to enjoy some advantage over the long term.","The thing that certainly our company is watching is the degree of that advantage and how that might result in investment returns for new capacity. So, in the early days, in our company, we made a conscious choice to not convert to ethane cracking. We retained our flexibility, and we concentrated it around a couple of our crackers, and I think that will serve us well as we manage through a dynamic market environment like we have today.","Bhavesh Lodaya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then one on the Technology segment. Some impressive wins with new licenses there and we're also seeing a very strong first nine months compared to the previous year. Can you share what the breakup is between the catalysts and the licensing revenues, and how sticky are some of these earnings?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, first of all, as we license technology, the catalyst sales go with it. So, the catalyst revenue and earnings tends to be more consistent and growing. The licensing can be cyclical based on investment cycles. But at the moment, we're seeing quite a bit of interest in our technology especially in Asia. And there's been some shift in the licensing landscape for polyolefins as well, which has worked to our benefit. And ultimately, I think the investment that's occurring around the world speaks to the confidence in plastic's demand growth at greater than GDP levels. So, we're quite optimistic about our technology segment and we continue to invest in new catalyst capacity. As we sell new licenses, we anticipate that we'll be selling more catalyst over time as well.","Bhavesh Lodaya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. You may go ahead.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Bob, as you survey your portfolio, are you witnessing a normal demand pattern from a seasonal perspective across your major product lines in October and to the extent you have visibility into November or are there areas either by product line or geography where destocking is more pronounced than you would normally expect from a seasonal point of view?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Kevin, good morning. We see very typical demand here in the fall. Europe is slightly weaker I would say but otherwise, the rest of the world, we see demand being quite good and we're running our assets extremely hard around the world.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just to follow up on the technology licensing activity, obviously impressive results there. Do you think that you can go higher in 2019 from an investment cycle perspective in polypropylene plants, for example, or not?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No. I mean, the rate at which we're doing licenses today is quite high. So, just to sustain these rates gives us great earnings potential as we go forward. Again, typically, we see the catalyst income from a license four, five years later, and when we do these \u2013 when we sign these licenses, there are progress payments that occur over three, four years. So, there's kind of a \u2013 there's a tail of earnings that come. And so, there's been a meaningful step up here, and I think we can certainly continue this level for next year.","Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. Thanks very much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Bob, just on ethane in 2019, how are you thinking about prices both on an absolute level as well as a relative level relative to its fuel value?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Well, David, I've been saying for quite a long time that ethane is going to trade over time $0.07 to $0.10 over its fuel value. Given that supply and demand are much more balanced today on ethane than they have been in the past few years, we could see that price over fuel value increase.","I do think that it's going to be \u2013 it's going to move around depending on turnaround season. So, in the spring when there are turnarounds and there's less ethane consumption, then prices could moderate. New fractionation capacity is coming. I think it's estimated to be online sometime around the middle of next year. And new Y-grade pipeline. So, it'll be dynamic.","But I think given that our overall thesis is there's lots of propane, there's a lot of butane, and if some of the ethane that's being rejected today in the Permian, if it ends up coming back into the pipe and coming down to Belvieu, then we just need 50,000, 100,000 barrels a day more of ethane to change the supply\/demand balance. And so, I think it will be dynamic. And companies like us, we just need to make sure that we're looking at economics weekly as we do and shift our feed slate to maximize profitability.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Very good. And just on Braskem, how do the recent Brazilian election results impact or affect your thinking on Braskem?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I read everything that you read about the new president. And so, I mean, for now, we're very much focused on the fundamentals and value creation potential. And so, as I said earlier, we're working through the analysis and thinking through the value proposition.","David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. You may go ahead.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, fellas.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Question, just you had mentioned that spot ethylene is close to cash breakeven. With Indorama about to start up a cracker where they'll back out some spot purchases that they've done historically, do you think you'll be able to continue to run full out or will you actually have to run at lower operating rates, do you think, until you get your polyolefins absorption online later next year?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah, Duffy, I expect that we'll continue to run pretty full. I don't expect us to slow down on ethylene.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just one more on Braskem. For the majority of the dance, at least that we've been privy to kind of know about with Braskem, your stock price was circa $110 a share. Now that it's $90, does that change the way you look at Braskem or your share value is disconnected in your mind from the value of Braskem?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, look, I mean, again, it's really about long-term value creation in a transaction like this. And so, we're firmly focused on \u2013 just like we did with Schulman, thinking through how we can create value with something like this. So, our \u2013 it hasn't changed and as you can see, as evidenced by the third quarter, we've had still significant amount of share buyback. So, nothing has really changed in my mind.","Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. You may go ahead.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. Can you talk about the Rhine River impacts? You said that this could tighten up some product chains for you. What about your ability to either obtain raw materials or ship products or supply raw materials to property tenants in Wesseling and things like that? Do you see any downside risks?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yes, Jim. So, our European team is hard at work in managing through the low Rhine levels, and we do see some very modest downtime and then downside risk in our EAI segment as a result of the low Rhine levels. So, just on an output basis, not considering any increase in product prices, we could see in Q4 $30 million to $40 million of impact across the quarter if this situation continues and we don't get rain over there.","So, it's pretty modest, and we've had one of our crackers down for turnaround, so that actually reduces the impact. Our larger cracker at Wesseling is down for turnaround and will be coming up in November. So, as we bring that up, really, our consideration will be do we bring it up to full rates or do we bring it up to a little bit lower than full range. So, that maybe helps you size the Rhine River impact. It's quite modest.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Terrific. And on IMO 2020, are you confident that the EPA will not be able to delay this process or reduce enforcement of the standard?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, it's difficult to predict what regulatory agencies may do, but it seems to me that there's a lot of momentum around the world around this change in regulation. And many ship owners have acknowledged that this will happen. So, the only thing we can do is make sure that we're prepared to run our refinery at full rates. And given that we're just finishing our maintenance on the crude unit in the cokery \u2013 one of the two coker units at our refinery, we're set up for virtually no planned maintenance in the second half of 2019 through 2020. So, I think we're really well positioned to take advantage of whatever IMO turns out to be. And frankly, I think it's degrees of upside.","James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on I&D. The business has been performing very well in 2018. Do you see that business kind of moderating in coming years back to $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion in annual EBITDA or do you see a trajectory towards $2 billion kind of continuing? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, so the run rate, if you look back before this year, our run rate's been about $1.5 billion plus or minus. And I've talked about a 15% to 20% step-up that's structural, and I think that's how you ought to be thinking about it off of the $1.5 billion number. And then, there's some seasonality, as you know, with our oxyfuels business that puts some seasonality in that segment. But over an entire year, a 15% to 20% step-up over the $1.5 billion number is, I think, a good basis going forward.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. And just on polypropylene, maybe you can just give us your assessment of supply\/demand. There hasn't really been a lot of new supply added. I mean, what's your view on whether the market could bear something like that or your own footprint? Thanks.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, polypropylene, I mean, in the U.S., there's not a lot of new capacity coming in the next 12 to 18 months, or 15 months, let's say. There's a few debottlenecks here and there including we have a couple of small ones that we're implementing now.","I think in the absence of new capacity, and demand growing at 3%, 4% a year in the U.S., market looks to be very solid in the U.S. Globally, it seems that operating rates are still going to be quite high and, around the world, demand growth for polypropylene has been extremely strong and especially in the Far East, in China. So, I expect polypropylene to be a very constructive business going forward.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global Advisors. You may go ahead.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good morning, Bob.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Good morning, Hassan.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Bob, two-part question on Braskem. First, obviously, you talked a bit about Brazil and the Brazilian elections and the like. But obviously there's been a government change in Mexico as well, and at least recently, I've been reading more and more articles pertaining to the Mexico contract, that it's below market, they may reconsider that contract. So, first part to the question is, how does that sort of go into your calculus about the deal?","And then the second part is, obviously valuations have come down tremendously across the board but certain product areas have been hit harder, like polyurethanes in particular. So, how are you thinking about other deals as well above and beyond Braskem in light of some of these valuation moves?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. Good question. So first of all, on Braskem, I mean, I'd just kind of repeat what I said earlier. We're working through our analysis and obviously, thinking through the Mexico situation is part of our analysis. And so, we'll work through that. But it's a fairly new asset that they have down there. So, we consider that as well.","As far as other alternatives, we just need to work through kind of one opportunity at a time and think through value creation. So, we're very focused on understanding the various aspects that have been raised on this call and things that you've read and being thoughtful about how we can create value for our shareholders.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Understood. Now as a follow-up, Bob, on the China pollution side of things, again, sort of mixed messages out there. Some people sort of talking about how regulation is going to move from federal to provincial levels and that may sort of make things a bit more lax, meaning thereby that maybe capacity comes back online. But then the flip side of that is that people are talking about the 2+26 being expanded to 11 more cities. So, what are you guys seeing on the ground there? How do you see that in terms of influx of new capacity or further curtailments?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, I think, directionally, environmental pressure will continue in China, and there will be some ebb and flow in terms of news. But I think, directionally, there is a move towards reducing coal and improving air quality in China, and I don't think that changes. So hence, more methanol being consumed for olefins. I mean, I think that will \u2013 it's cleaner than coal-based olefins, so we could see that, and some naphtha crackers I suppose. But I don't see the environmental pressures easing. I think, over time, they'll continue to get more stringent, as the rest of the world is.","Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Very helpful, Bob. Thanks so much.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. You may go ahead.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. We started with ethane, maybe we'll finish with ethane here. But on slide 11 again, in 2019, Bob, you have the supply line above the minimum. In midyear, doesn't the supply line kind of touch the minimum after we get a couple more crackers starting up? And then, in the upper right-hand corner, you've got $0.25 to $0.60 a gallon which is the historical range but I think ethane even at $1 a gallon still, export polyethylene is still breakeven. So, do you think if we get tighter in mid-2019, we could spike above $0.60?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. First of all, I don't know about the $1 analysis. I'll have to get my team to look at that, but depends on oil price and depends on naphtha price. So, there's a lot of factors.","It's difficult, as you can imagine, to forecast a spike or to predict. I mean, I suppose you could see spikes but they're very much just that, they're spikes then they come back down. And I think one thing you've seen over the past few weeks and even years past that this industry and the cracker fleet in the U.S. does exert its flexibility when needed. And we as a company certainly are well positioned to do that. As I mentioned earlier in response to one of the other questions that we're also increasing our ability to crack Y-grade. So, I think that will be another dimension of flexibility that we'll continue to enhance. And our two crackers at Channelview and the Corpus Christi cracker are extremely well positioned to be flexible given proximity to Eagle Ford. And then when you think about our Midwest crackers, that's almost 2.5 billion pounds of ethylene that is unaffected by ethane price on the Gulf Coast and enjoys a significant advantage.","So, I think the line sort of touching the blue part or not, we're going to have next year new crackers start up and new fractionation and new pipeline capacity as well. So, the price will be a bit more dynamic next year. But again, I step back and think about the overall supply of ethane and I think it's abundant. If even a little bit less gets rejected and comes down the pipe to Belvieu, that could change the equation very quickly.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. You may go ahead.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Yeah, two quick ones. Given the discussions \u2013 or the way you're seeing the IMO impact play out for the refining industry, would you be open to reconsidering structures for the refining asset or treating it as a noncore asset?","And secondly, how do you see Lyondell's role in the micro plastics debate? I mean, do you want to be at the forefront or is it more going to be see how the regulatory landscape shifts and then grow the recycling side of the business accordingly?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, two very different questions. On the refinery, Laurence, our view hasn't changed. Our focus has been on running the refinery better and better, and I think we've demonstrated now with six quarters of really great operating performance which we expect to continue. We've been positioning ourselves for IMO by completing our maintenance so that we can run essentially full in 2019 and 2020.","And so, I think we're really well positioned to capture value from IMO. And we're not really detracted from that, if you will. And so, that's going to continue to be our focus and we'll think through how best to capture that value. So, really nothing further to add in terms of the refinery.","In terms of micro plastics, and perhaps if I could broaden that to plastic waste, I think really one of the best ways a company like ours can influence what happens and how we engage is through the various associations around the world like American Chemistry Council, Cefic, and there's a lot of work going on through industry associations to engage in essentially ending plastic waste and thinking though over the long term how we can increase circularity.","So, stay tuned. I think there will be some definitive sort of things that will come out as we go through the next couple of quarters. But I think this is best done from our perspective through the industry associations which we participate in and have leadership positions on in many cases.","Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Thank you. You may go ahead.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Hey, Bob. It looks like in Refining, you outperformed some of your Gulf Coast peers in the quarter. You mentioned you saw some benefits from heavy Canadian barrels, which we estimate are approximately 15% to 20% of your crude slate. Could you talk about any potential efforts to increase WCS runs further whether that be by maybe crude by rail or whether you're looking at additional pipeline commitments on some of these new Canadian pipelines?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Yeah. So, Matthew, on Canadian crude, we've really maximized what we can do on Canadian crude. Maybe incrementally something around crude by rail, but I would not expect a meaningful change in the amount of Canadian crude we're cracking. And as you I'm sure know, those pipelines are on allocation, so we really can't get more allocation. But we are maximizing and I think, over time, we hope that that will impact Maya pricing and bring that back into balance.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Sounds good. And then, in I&D, you mentioned the PO results were off $50 million. I think $20 million of that was due to the turnaround. I guess the remaining $30 million or so, is that due to the market slowing and is that an issue perhaps with just slower demand growth from potentially weaker housing market?","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","No, nothing structural there. That's just ebbs and flow of the market. Nothing structural to read into that.","Matthew Blair - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Okay. All right. Well, thank you.","Bhavesh Vaghjibhai Patel - LyondellBasell Industries NV","Well, let me offer a few closing remarks. Thank you for all of your patience as we've run over a little bit.","So, as we look ahead from Q4 and into 2019, while we've talked a lot about ethane on this call, and we know it will be dynamic next year, for LyondellBasell, we do see meaningful sources of new earnings from our A. Schulman acquisition, our new polyethylene plant, step-up in I&D earnings, IMO impacts in the second half of the year. And I think a lot of these sources of earnings growth can offset potential impacts from new PE capacity and ethane. So, we look forward to updating you on that as well as all of our growth initiatives on the next call.","So, thank you very much. Have a great day. And we're adjourned.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
