This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark and welcoming you to our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $389.4 million. Earnings per share were $1.75, and our return on common equity was 15.9%. This quarter's results included $4.9 million of severance related and restructuring charges within expenses. This compares to $12.3 million in the prior quarter and $6.6 million one year ago.","Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some of macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter, but were mixed on a year-over-year basis. Compared to the prior year, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 8.2%, while the MSCI EAFE was down 0.10%. On a sequential basis, end of period markets were favorable with the S&P 500 and EAFE indices increasing 3.8% and 1.6% respectively. Recall that some of our fees are based on lag pricing, and those comparisons were favorable on a sequential basis, but mixed versus one year ago.","On a month wide basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were up sequentially 6.7% and 4.9% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the S&P 500 was up 6.7% while EAFE was down 2.1%. On a quarter lag basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were up sequentially 13.1% and 9.6% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the quarter lag S&P 500 was up 7.3%, while EAFE was flat. U.S. short-term interest rates were lower during the quarter on average as seen by the sequential declines in average one-month and three-month LIBOR, up 6 and 18 basis points respectively.","Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter, down 4% and 3% respectively compared to the prior year. The year-over-year declines favorably impacted expense, but had an unfavorable impact on revenue. On a sequential basis, the British pound ended the quarter down 2%, while the euro increased 1%.","Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was flat with noninterest income down slightly from one year ago and net interest income up 1%. Expenses increased 1% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $6.5 million in the current quarter compared to a provision of $1.5 million one year ago.","Net income was flat year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 2% with noninterest income up 3% and net interest income down 1%. Expenses declined 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income increased 12% sequentially.","Return on average common equity was 15.9% for the quarter, down from 16.5% one year ago and up from 14% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $11.3 trillion increased 6% compared to one year ago, and were up 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $8.5 trillion were up 5% compared to one year ago, and up 4% sequentially.","Both the year-over-year and the sequential performance was driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 3% on a year-over-year basis and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance reflected higher markets and new business, partially offset by lower period end securities lending collateral. The sequential increase was driven by higher markets, partially offset by outflows.","Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, flat compared to last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $955 million in the second quarter, up 1% from last year and up 3% sequentially.","Foreign exchange trading income was $60 million in the second quarter, down 23% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by lower volatility, as well as lower foreign-exchange swap activity in our treasury function. Volumes were also down on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, but the mix of trades had a favorable sequential impact.","Other noninterest income was $73 million in the second quarter, up 3% compared to one year ago and up 15% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a valuation adjustment to visa-related swaps in the prior year quarter and income relating to a bank-owned life insurance program implemented in the current quarter, partially offset by lower brokerage and treasury management fees.","The sequential performance was driven by the bank-owned life insurance program and lower visa-related swap expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $425 million in the second quarter, increasing 1% year-over-year but down 1% sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $549 million in the second quarter and were down 1% year-over-year, but up 3% on a sequential basis. The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fees growth by almost 1%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $385 million and were up 2% year-over-year and up 3% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business, partially offset by both unfavorable currency translation and unfavorable markets.","On a sequential basis, the impact of favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.6 trillion at quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates.","Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $111 million in the second quarter were down 2% year-over-year but up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to adjustments in the prior year due to a change to gross revenue presentation, partially offset by favorable markets. The sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $887 billion, up 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new businesses, partially offset by lower securities lending collateral levels. The sequential growth is primarily driven by favorable markets.","Securities lending fees were $22 million in the second quarter, down 28% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower volumes, as well as lower spreads. The sequential decline was driven by lower spreads, partially offset by higher volumes. Securities lending collateral was $163 billion at quarter end and averaged $164 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels declined 11% year-over-year and were up 4% sequentially.","Moving to our wealth management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $406 million in the second quarter, and were up 4% compared to the prior year quarter and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was primarily due to new business in favorable markets. The sequential increase was mainly attributable to favorable markets.","Assets under management for wealth management clients were $293 billion at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by favorable markets, partially offset by outflows. On a sequential basis, favorable markets were offset by outflows. The outflows were mainly within cash products, and in part were relating to change in our product offering where we discontinued the suite of client deposits into off balance sheet money market funds.","Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $425 million in the second quarter, up 1% year-over-year. Earnings assets averaged $106 billion in the second quarter, down 8% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $89 billion and were down 7% versus the prior year. Interest bearing deposits declined 4% from one year ago to $72 billion. Noninterest varying deposits, which averaged $18 billion during the quarter, were down 17% from one year ago. Loan balances averaged $31 billion in the quarter and were down 4% compared to one year ago.","The net interest margin was 1.61% in the second quarter, and was up 13 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects balance sheet mix shift and the impact of higher short-term interest ratess. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down 1%, average earnings asset declined 4% on the sequential basis as deposit levels declined 2% in the prior quarter.","It is worth noting that more than 85% of the sequential decline in deposits was related to lower wholesale deposits, which we use for leveraging purposes within our treasury group. These accounted for approximately 3% of our non-U.S. office deposit balances in the second quarter. Client deposit levels were down less than one-half of the percent on a sequential basis.","On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 3 basis points, primarily reflecting a balance sheet mix shift, partially offset by lower short-term interest earnings. We did not see the opportunity for foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function to the extent we have seen in the last several quarters. The activity this quarter resulted in approximately $2 million of foreign exchange trading profit with a slightly less amount that what we gave up in net interest income. This quarter's results were more in line with business as usual results. For comparison, in the prior quarter, we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of $13 million, offset by $10 million less in net interest income.","Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the second quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 67% of our total deposits. This is down from 69% in both the prior year and prior quarter periods. I wanted to highlight two items for you to know as we look at our sequential trends. First, during the quarter, we implemented a bank-owned life insurance program that had the effect of moving $1 billion from earning to non-earning assets.","The program was in place for approximately one-half of the quarter, and resulted in an approximate $3.5 million decline in net interest income and $4.2 million increase within other operating income, as well as the tax benefit. On an annualized basis, we would expect the program to benefit net income by approximately $14 million with $36 million increase within other operating income, offset by a decline of an estimated $29 million in net interest income and a tax benefit of an estimated $7 million.","Second, as I referred to when we discussed wealth management assets under management. During the quarter, we had a change in our deposit products, whereby we discontinued the sweep of client deposits into off balance sheet money market funds. This change resulted in an increase of approximately $4 billion in period end deposits that you should see on our savings, money market and other line within our balance sheet.","Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $1 billion in the second quarter and were 1% higher than the prior year and down 2% sequentially. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $4.9 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. For comparison purposes, note that the prior year and prior quarter included $6.6 million and $12.3 million in charges respectively. Excluding the called out charges, expenses for the current quarter was up 1% from one year ago. The impact of favorable currency translation benefit expenses are just under 1 percentage point on a year-over-year basis.","Excluding charges in both the current and prior year quarters, the following items were key drivers within the expense categories. Compensation was higher, primarily driven by higher salaries due to base pay adjustments and staff growth, partially offset by lower expenses related to long-term performance-based equity incentives. Employee benefits expense was slightly higher due to higher payroll withholding tax, partially offset by lower medical cost and retirement expenses.","Outside service costs were up slightly due to higher technical services expense, partially offset by lower third-party adviser and sub-custody expense. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year mainly due to higher software related spends. Other operating expenses were up from the prior year due to higher miscellaneous expense, partially offset by lower FDIC premiums and lower staff related spends.","Shifting to the sequential expense view, including the expense charges in both the current and prior quarters, expenses were down 1% sequentially. Compensation expense declined, primarily reflecting lower expenses related to long-term performance based equity incentives, partially offset by higher salaries due to base pay adjustments and higher cash based incentives accruals. The prior quarter's equity incentive expense included $30 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff.","Employee benefits increased sequentially, primarily due to higher medical costs. Outside services declined sequentially due to lower technical services and legal related costs, partially offset by higher third party adviser fees and sub-custody expenses. The lower level of technical services did benefit from approximately $6 million in onetime vendor expense credit during the quarter.","Other operating expense increased from the prior period, primarily driven by higher business promotion expense. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The staff growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe and Arizona, partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations.","As we have discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative, which we started in 2017. We have been realigning our expense with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. We continue to embed a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slower our expense growth to be more closely align with our organic fee growth.","Our second quarter results reflect approximately $47 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately 2.5 points. This would equate to just under $190 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal.","Turning to Page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense of the fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to fees is particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. We remain focused on continuing to drive organic growth in our business, and managing our expenses to improve our efficiency and productivity.","Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.6% under the advanced approach, and 13.2% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7.6% and at the bank was 6.9%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement that became applicable in Northern Trust effective at the start of 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the applicable 100% minimum requirement.","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basal III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators from the implementation of final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","During the quarter, we repurchased more than 2.9 million shares of common stock at a cost of $271 million. As we announced in June, our 2019 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reverse. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividends of $0.70 per share. Yesterday, our Board of Directors formally approved the planned dividend increase, which represents a year-over-year increase of 27% and a sequential increase of 17%. The capital plan also provides the flexibility to repurchase up to $1.4 billion of common stock.","The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on various factors, including but not limited to, Northern Trust business plans, financial performance, other investment opportunities and general market conditions, including share price.","In closing, despite the impact of the mixed global macroeconomic environment, we performed well during the quarter, increasing our pretax margin to 34% and generating return on average common equity of 15.9%. Our balanced business model continue to generate organic growth with each of our client facing reporting segments of Wealth Management and C&IS contributing approximately 50% of our earnings.","We are excited about our competitive positioning within each of our businesses. In Wealth Management, our holistic advice approach continues to resonate with prospects and existing clients. We continue to deepen our talent and expertise with key hirings across our business. In C&IS, we continue to have success in growing our asset servicing business as evidenced by wins announced during the quarter, such as Magnetar Capital, Anchorage Capital and the World Bank.","Our technology, operational expertise, client focus and flexible operating model continue to support our strategy very well. We remain focused on providing our clients with exceptional services, improving our productivity and driving profitable growth.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust second quarter earnings conference call. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Paula, please open the line.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","So curious about the thinking about interest-bearing cost for the non-U.S. office line. You had called out the reduction in wholesale deposits, which I'm sure was helpful. But just wanted to confirm whether or not there was any of the noise flowing through that line that we should think about? And then thinking about deposits broadly, how should we think about the deposit costs for those $4 billion in interest-bearing that you flagged in your end of period, resulting from the termination of the money market fund program?","Biff Bowman","On the additional color on the deposits in the foreign office deposits, in addition to the lower leveraging amount that we highlighted, we've really had two individual clients that accumulated large deposits in the first quarter and they deployed them in the second quarter. We would consider that normal operating flow that we see from time-to-time and between quarters. So we can really identify that movement in the foreign office deposits, excluding those that were impacted by the lower leveraging in a handful of clients, in the case I just highlighted two clients really made that move.","So not uncommon for us to see builds in certain periods, and then the deployment of that in other periods, so I'd say normal flow there. In terms of how should we think about the pricing of the deposits in the retail space or in our wealth -- from the closure, if you will, of our anchor-sweep product, we did offer our rates for those individuals at attractive rates for that, that allows us to maintain. That has a finite period, and when that rolls off then they will be at market rates on the competitive front.","Mark Bette","And Brennan, I would just add. If you look at the savings money market and other line, you did see increase sequentially in the cost, which is partly reflective of what this indicated but then also the set increase in December, there was a lag pricing impact in the retail deposits. So that wasn't quite fully reflected in the first quarter yet. So that's another part of the sequential impact.","Q - Brennan Hawken","And then, Biff, do you still expect -- I want to say that you had flagged during a presentation intra quarter that you expected deposit betas to be quite high in the event of a fed rate cut near 100%, as I recall. Is your expectation still that they would be that high? And why do you think that betas are going to be so much higher on the way down than we have seen in prior historical periods of that rate cuts? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","It's still our view that the betas will be -- let me separate first retail and institutional deposits. It's our view certainly on institutional deposits, which make up the majority of our balance sheet that the betas will be pretty high. And almost like, say, almost symmetrical as they were on the way up is, it's the most recent betas were pretty high. We think that that same beta favourability would happen all the way down. So, perhaps not at a 100%, that depends on the competitive landscape but high on the way down. So that's what we see institutionally.","On the retail space, I think it's really a function of the competitive landscape there. So they were -- they moved up fairly slowly. So we benefited from the early days of the rate hikes, and then that beta moved up overtime. I think you could probably also see some of the same symmetrical path down in betas on the retail space. But there is a much more transparent market to understand the pricing there, and we need to remain competitive in that landscape.","So I guess, I'd summarize in end by saying I think we still believe that the overall betas would be pretty high on the way down and pretty fast. If you get closer and closer to a zero down for U.S. dollars that could create some compression as we get closer to that, but there's still a few hikes before we get there.","Operator","And moving on, we'll go to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","A quick one related to fee caps. Mark, it's obviously very strong year-to-date. I'm just curious how -- particularly in the U.S. -- curious how breakpoints, fee caps play a role and make it hard for us to look at any custody fee rate trends? And maybe you can throw in there comment about what kind of fee rate on the new assets coming in the door?","A - Mark Bette","There is a lot that goes into that. So we don't specifically look at fee rates internally, because of really the mix of business can be quite different. So you could have a very large custody mandate with that that's where the fees might be small compared to a small assets under administration mandate, where the fees are larger. So as far as the trends go there, it's hard to pin down something there. I would say though that as we've highlighted before when we look at that line, about 40% of the fees are not asset value related.","So, in general you would get the fees moving less than what you would get the assets, assuming that asset mix is coming out at the same rate, which it's not. I would say that some of the places where we're winning are in places that we do have and we talk about hedge fund services and areas like that that does usually generically would have higher beta or a higher fee rate than what say domestic custody would have for instance. ","Biff Bowman","Glenn, I would just add second part of your question was the new assets coming on board, the fee rates. I think Mark's point is important there is the types of wins we're having where its growth in -- I think we mentioned Magnetar and Anchorage hedge funds. They're still good value added in fee base there and then there is other large, just pure asset servicing custody wins where the competitive landscape, the basis point yield might be a bit lower. So you've got to really look at the mix coming in. And we've got a pretty nice mix, both globally and product set mix. So we get a nice blend of rates coming in on the new business, it's not all just in lower margin company rates.","Glenn Schorr","Maybe a one quick follow up to Brennan's question, I hear you loud and clear on the high betas on the way down on the institutional side. I'm curious, is there difference in client segments, by client segment in the retail side? I'm surprised to see such rate sensitivity. It's not what I think of when I think of Northern Trust Wealth Management.","A - Biff Bowman","I think what you have to look at there is you've got to look at the beta over a much longer period than just one quarter, because we could have been behind the market, slower to the market over periods of time. And you can see beta moves in certain period that larger than a data than you would expect, because we're catching up from some competitive landscape.","And I will still say it is still competitive for even high network deposits. You've got sophisticated investors who are looking when yields get to some differential with the market that are seeking at least for the cash portion of their business balances, they're looking for market rates. And so we need to remain competitive. It may not be quite as competitive as those that are relying on retail deposits, but it remains credited.","Operator","And next we'll go to Mike Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Maybe first one just on the expense growth, so that's been coming in better this quarter and year-to-date versus the targeted in line with the organic growth rate. Just curious, should we be expecting maybe any new spend in the second half of this year, or could that be coming in lower? Just given the revenue backdrop and some of the uncertainty, whether it's -- you mentioned some of the FX, but also the rate backdrop?","Biff Bowman","So here, I would say the environment we're operating in its not lost on us. So a net interest income environment that looks like it'll become more difficult in terms of where the rates are moving. So we really want to continue to drive our organic revenue in our franchise. But we have to be mindful of the macro headwinds that we're facing. We can't just singularly focus on that. So that means I think the disciplines that you've seen in the first six months of this year and I think even longer term than that, they are vital to our profitability. They have to remain.","So we are focused on certain disciplined capital deployment for projects, return seeking project, disciplined expense management around occupancy, procurement, business promotion, location strategies, automation driving it, organizational design, all things we talked about. Those are even more in focus. They have been in focus. You've seen the benefits of our focus of them. But they are even more in focus as we are recognizing the environment that we're entering.","And I can tell you that I think some of the cultural behaviors that we've embedded as a part of value for spend, are now part of the disciplines that will help us we think continue to execute on that in the second half of this year and in the future. So, there is not a planned ramp in those expenses, because we are certainly cognizant of the environment we're operating in. And there is a strong focus on maintaining those. What I will say though and want to be clear is we think our organic growth rate is still a very important governor, if I could say that, on what is allowable for that expense growth rate. So we still want to grow our franchise organically. And there is some expense needed to fuel that organic growth. But as long as that's proportional and appropriate with enough spread in it, we think we can move it forward and move the profitability of the firm forward.","Michael Carrier","And then just as a follow up on NII. So you mentioned your expectations on deposit betas. And then just, if we go down the path of getting a fed cuts. Just anything from a positioning or duration, the balance sheet, anything change or do you expect anything? And just so I'm clear on deposits, you mentioned on the institutional side some of the activity that you saw on the non-U.S. You mentioned some of the things that you guys do on the leveraging. And then it sounds like on the retail side, you're seeing some money move on. When we just think about the start to jump off on, is that roughly unchanged, because you had the depression like of the institutional but you're having the retail come on board?","Biff Bowman","Let me break that into two parts. One, you're talking about the balance sheet jump off point from a size. And then the first is sort of I think more of an outlook on net interest income, and I think we will give a little color there. I would imagine people want to hear that. If you looked at our net interest income from the Q1 to Q2, when and we stripped out. There was some favorable impact from the lower FX swap activity, but we implemented BOLI, which we took our earning assets down. If you netted those out, our sequential decline was probably just under 3%. I know we reported 1% but those factors moved it around.","If we look at the current implied curve and reassume two rate cuts in July and September, we would think in the third quarter that we would see about 2% to 3% decline in net interest income from this quarter's reported net interest income. And that includes the impact of BOLI and other things in there. So we would see somewhere around 2% to 3%.","In the fourth quarter of this year, we would say flat to slightly down from there. And again that's relying on a whole series of factors, how do the betas play out, how does our balance sheet play out over that time in terms of volume and mix. There's a lot of factors. So based on our best modeling and our best forecast, at this point, relatively modest decline in the net interest income in Q3 and flat to slightly down in Q4 based on our current thinking in there. In terms of the balance sheet size, Mark, if you want to?","Mark Bette","I guess if you look at the average balance sheet, and you're thinking about that as your starting point, which is probably the best thing to do, because we do have period end deposits flows that spike up. The one thing I would point to is this change in the sweep product in wealth management where that was really only a partially quarter, it happened at different points throughout the quarter. So for that line, the savings money market and other looking at the end of period for that might be a little bit closer to where it might run during the quarter, but that remains to be determined. But that's how I would position as far as balance sheet jump off plan.","Operator","And next we'll go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Good morning. A couple of follow ups to that, one, if your rate cuts were all in July, if you got your rate cuts in July. Is there a material change to the numbers you just described, or not really?","Biff Bowman","Not really. In fact, it might be very, very modestly better to get 50 basis points than 225s, 50 and a 25 we would probably have to get back to you what that is. But we know what it is but it might be a little bit more impactful. But a 50 is very modestly better. So I could say roughly for your projections probably about equal over two quarters.","Betsy Graseck","And then can you just give us some color as to what the decisioning was behind the BOLI? What was the reason for that? And should we expect more, either BOLI like type of transactions going forward, or other securities asset repositioning that you might be doing in a changing rate environment?","Biff Bowman","As you know, we've embarked and what I will call a balance sheet optimization type program. And we've look at certain asset classes or certain yield opportunities on our balance sheet. We had no BOLI investments, which made us relatively unique in the marketplace. And in the current yield environment and particularly with the declining rate environment, the benefits of that actually were pretty powerful.","As we sited, its $14 million of benefit in net income for franchise, it does take down NII -- on an annualized basis, it does take down our NII budget, it will flow through the other income line. And you saw some of the benefit of that in just one half of one quarter. We're always looking at optimization efforts. I can't say whether we would add more or less BOLI, for instance, in this transaction but this was our first pass at it.","Betsy Graseck","I guess, I was just wondering like how you decided to size it the way you did. Was it -- as you kind of indicated, you were the only one who didn't have it. So was there a relative positioning vis-\u00e0-vis peers, or I'm just trying to wonder why $1 billion\u2026","Biff Bowman","There is several factors to that, A, limit a size. There is regulations as to how much is a percentage of capital that you can have. But remember, we have counterparty credit exposure then that we have to go out to with very high credit quality carriers that we know have this credit exposure to. And so our credit group also is providing input as to the sizing of the portfolio. And when we put all that together, it added up to a $1 billion for now.","Betsy Graseck","So you would say -- I should take from that that you're optimized on the BOLI positioning?","Biff Bowman","As we hit here today, that's -- we have $1 billion in there. We're always looking at those opportunities. I can't say whether we'd go higher or lower in the future. But I think we're here for some period of time.","Operator","And next we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. ","Alex Blostein","Thanks for the NIR guidance, and I know you guys typically don't get into explicit guidance. But given where we're in the cycle, I think it was definitely appreciated. So thanks for that. Question for you guys around expenses, again. So given the fact that historically you've been sort of aiming to align expense growth with organic, fee growth, so call it, 4-ish, 5-ish percent, or something like that. In light of a tougher backdrop from NIR, and obviously it tends to be much higher margin type of business for you guys. Is there an emphasis to potentially bring that down below the organic fee growth levels? In other words, could we still anticipate some of the positive operating leverage or dynamic even with your current NIR outlook?","Biff Bowman","I think we are looking at that hard, Alex. Like you said, we can't ignore the backdrop we're in. And pressure on one of our important revenue lines, net interest income, may put additional pressure that we have to look at on our expense line to widen out that leverage that you're talking about. Some things will naturally happen there. I think it's important, for instance, I'll tell you. Certain cash based incentive plans. If net interest income goes down, they're going down. So that will give us some natural reduction in our expense lines, if that's the backdrop. But then the discretionary items I described, we may have to continue to push harder and harder on some of those levers to widen out, if you will, the organic leverage in our business to overcome, if you will, some of the pressures we see on net interest income, for instance.","Alex Blostein","Second question around foreign exchange trading, so last quarter I believe there was $13 million swap benefit in that line. So kind of I think apples-to-apples, you've seeing an improvement sequentially in a fairly difficult environment. So curious again kind of what -- and I know this has been a focus for you guys to drive some of the organic initiatives in foreign exchange trading and gain some market share. So maybe a little bit on kind of what's going on underneath the surface within that part of the business? And any better way for us to think about kind of the go forward?","Biff Bowman","So you're right. At the core, the core FX actually did pretty well, if you'd strip the swap impact out of that. I think there's a couple of factors in there. One, as we saw our share of FX transactions, so we got more client based increase from quarter-over-quarter. So we're communicating, marketing better products and capabilities to capture the higher percentage of share of trade even in a lower volatility environment we captured more share of trade.","And we also saw a little bit higher volume in some of the emerging market currencies in the quarter from our client base, I don't know if that's true for everyone. But from our client base, back in and itself, also has a little wider spread. So the combination of those two, I think, actually drove a relatively good core FX performance quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","And next from Wolfe Research, we'll go to Steven Chubak.","Steven Chubak","So I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the securities book. I appreciate all the detailed NII guidance. And as we model the securities yield and layer in the forward curve. Can you just remind us what percentage of the book reprices each quarter? And where does the overall duration of the books at today, given some of the extensions you've been doing?","Biff Bowman","So the overall duration of the book, let me answer the second part is at 1.3 years. And we have been adding some duration, you're right. But duration that we've added has been somewhat muted as the longer rates have come down and obviously, creates a view of faster prepayments. And so that has the impact of shortening the duration. So we're lengthening it with our purchases but the actual come down of the rates in the long end of the curve mutes it. But we're still longer at 1.3 than we've been traditionally where we've run probably closer to 1, or 1.1 in terms of the duration.","As far as the repricing goes, we've talked about before how our securities portfolio can be divided between a shorter or longer. The shorter book is probably a little bit less than half of the total securities book, and that's where you would get mostly when you think about one month LIBOR and three month LIBOR, that repricing would happen fairly quick, obviously, within a quarter. And then the other part of the book, the longer book, that's as you get securities rolling over, you put something on two years ago it rolls over and then you reinvest that. So that would happen on more of a staggered basis across a period of time.","Steven Chubak","And just one follow-up for me on some of the deposit growth commentary, and I think there is a big debate about how much of the rate headwinds can be offset with volume growth. And you noted that deposit betas should be elevated on the way down, but just given overall and more sophisticated client base. How are you guys thinking about the pace of organic deposit growth that you can generate within both retail and institutional? And just looking out to the forward curve, you gave some very helpful detail on '19. Just as we look out to 2020. Do you believe there is a path to generating sufficient NII or volume growth to offset some of those rate headwinds?","Biff Bowman","If we look out to 2020, I would say, we're going to start to become more reliant on an organic growth rate that we've talked to you before in our asset servicing business primarily to drive the custody growth and the deposit growth that you're talking about. We could be more aggressive in our pricing to try to attract deposits. But given the construct of our balance sheet, that type of funding need has to make good economic sense for us to want to do it, and we don't have a big loan portfolio on for instance.","So I think the growth rate in our deposit is going to come from, at least most of that will come from just the organic growth we've seen in our fees. So if we've talked about 4 to 5, some portion of that would come with deposits, not all of it, because we do fund administration and other work, which may not come with custody deposits on the balance sheet. But much of it comes with custody deposits. So, I think that becomes more of the benchmark for the balance sheet growth.","And to your point, depending on how rates move, it'd probably be difficult to make it up with volume, to your points. What I would say is, if we get more than two insurance type cuts that the fed may -- that we would project, but you put your own projection on it. If we get more than two and we start to get into something that looks like quantitative of easing. Historically, I think the custody banks have been the recipients of the liquidity that's pumped into the system. And so we could see deposit growth and balance sheet growth move at a much faster rate if this becomes more than a one or two rate cut cycle.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hi, just two questions. First, maybe one last one on the deposits, and noninterest bearing actually was flat on a sequential basis. A lot of your peers were down and have been highlighting declines, going forward. I guess is that, that organic growth you're talking about. What's keeping your noninterest bearing flat and how do you think about that over the next, I guess, looking over the next couple of quarters?","Biff Bowman","Let me walk you through that again. So we had about $18 billion in average noninterest bearing deposits, I think, in the quarter. And if you look at those, about 85% of those are in dollar. So of the dollar deposits noninterest bearing, 25% are wealth management deposits. Those have been historically very sticky and they have remained sticky for a long time. Another 25% are our treasury cash management business. They are there for balances, to pay fees, et cetera. Those two have been fairly sticky.","So I think you've got kind of the half of the dollar base noninterest bearing that have been and remain pretty sticky. That leaves the other 50% there, which are part of core institutional asset servicing. Many of those we think are just part of operational needs and been there. We talked about $3 billion to $4 billion being what I would say was perhaps yield seeking that was sitting there in non-interest bearing. And we've seen -- we have regular dialogues with those clients. We believe those are also there for the liquidity purposes. We certainly have seen run-off in noninterest bearing over the year, but more frequently we think most of that is sought -- the yield seeking piece had sought yield already. So we've seen a little bit more stability in noninterest bearing in the last two quarters.","Q - Jim Mitchell","And maybe just bigger picture, I know you guys have been talking about efforts to boost organic growth and wealth. Maybe you just can update us on what you've been doing there. Any evidence you had of that on accelerating that would be helpful. Thanks.","Biff Bowman","So you could see with our wealth management reported figures, they had a strong quarter, very strong quarter, very healthy margins and good fee growth rate year-over-year, some of that driven by markets but some of that driven by organic. And again, they continue to look at geographies where we have -- want to increase our market share.","We don't always have to have a physical presence. As we've talked about in the past, there are certain cities and markets where we've got grown our market share without having to have a physical presence. And those are generally very attractive pieces of business with low physical overhead needed to get there. We can serve it out of Chicago, or Florida or New York, or wherever.","And then I would say our product suite, particularly our holistic advice, our Goals Powered solutioning, has resonated and particularly resonated with people in an environment where we've seen a little bit more volatile. Certainly, interest rate uncertainty, markets are favorable. But you've got a lot of people looking at the landscape, the geopolitical landscape, and there some certainties on the horizon. And so we think our technology tools led to pretty increased strong organic growth in that business as well.","Q - Jim Mitchell","So is there any hard number you can point to in terms of new account openings, or flows picking up to help us?","Biff Bowman","We don't disclose that. I mean you could look at the fee growth rates in the business and make your own assessment on the market impacts of that and you can probably get to an underlying core growth rate.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Q - Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask you about the leverage -- the deleverage this particular quarter, looked like there were deposits that were outside of the United States. And where you're using that as a source of being able to take some wholesale funding very low and then redeploy it in the United States at a higher rate. Is that some of the FX translation, is that why you wanted to get out of it? Or just what was the motivation for it? And what's the trigger to get out of the leveraging strategy you had out there?","A - Biff Bowman","Well, I'll split this question with Mark. But the strategy for getting out of it is, Marty, the wholesale funding, the return on it, quite frankly, has gone to about zero. So from a return, even an incremental return, the cost of wholesale funding and the investment that we were putting it in was generating a very low to no return in this environment. So we took the decision to pull some of the leveraging off. And I think, Marty, the currency or where it sits on the balance sheet, these are euro-dollar deposits. So the wholesale deposits where we went to a money fund or something like that, it's a wholesale deposit. Mark I don't know -- a euro-dollar deposit\u2026","Mark Bette","So we're not crossing currencies with it. So we're keeping it in U.S. And it is -- you do see it certainly short term borrowings and other line where we do or we'll do of sprint bidding, some of our home loan bank borrowings. And then the wholesale deposits flow through the non-U.S. office line. So it's a combination of those two that we use for leveraging purposes. But it is on the liability side, U.S. dollars and then U.S. dollars on the asset side as well.","Marty Mosby","And then we've talked extensively -- I've been an advocate for expanding the duration to protect NII as you end up having these declines. What is your perspective in the sense of doing, not doing that as you've gone through the cycle? And why wouldn't we have been more proactive and defensive to protect against a fairly valuable part of our income stream, which is this net interest income?","Biff Bowman","So Marty, over a year ago, we started talking about, here about the duration extension of the portfolio and have been executing on that. I know at 1.3 that still seems perhaps short in duration to be average. But for our portfolio, that's a fairly meaningful increase. And again, we take that duration. We don't do it for any credit additions. It's generally done through duration of treasuries and added. So we have been doing some of that over the periods. And there, obviously, are other hedges and swaps and other things that we can do into the portfolio to help look at that.","So we've been -- I would say, we've been contemplating a rate move for at least a year from our outcome ALCO, and have been executing on some of that behind the scenes. So I think it's one of the reasons actually our net interest income and others has held up reasonably well. Obviously, we continue to look at that. And some of those decisions now, with the way the shape of the yield curve is right now, there is some NII give up in protecting against a long-term move down in rates as you might imagine based on where the very short end of the curve is now versus the long end. But we have taken some of those decisions. So, thanks.","Operator","Moving on, we will go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Biff, just one more thing on the NII first. So if I take the 3.5 impact from the BOLI and then the 29 for the year. Effectively are you saying that the decline in 3Q is really just from the BOLI, and that core NII dollars are basically going to be flattish? Is that the right way to think about it?","A - Mark Bette","Well, this is Mark. We also had a benefit from the FX swap. But in a way, you're right. I mean, if you added back BOLI, you would be flat but that was because of the fact that we had a benefit from the FX swap, which was basically offset by what we saw play out with the interest rate environment.","Ken Usdin","And then my second question just on the cost side. So value for spend is expected to run rate by the end of this year. And it's been a 3 percentage point helper to the cost growth rate. So as we look out into past 2019 -- it's run rate by the next year. But you've gotten a good chunk of it already, so the magnitude of help. Does it stay the same as you go forward? Like are we going to expect 3 percentage points of help on an ongoing basis, or do you have to think about re-upping the plan at some point to maintain this right balance, any thoughts there? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","So your thinking is right. The 2% to 3% per annum benefit that you've talked about is what we're seeing. In terms of will we re-up value for spend. Let me frame it this way. The answer to that is, to meet the financial model that we've talked about, which is set an organic fee growth rate, we've talked 4% to 5%. Then we look at our expense base beneath that and we say we've got certain inflationary price expenses coming at us. We've got certain investments that we want to make and we've got certain expenses that we need to fuel that 4% to 5% growth rate.","If we want to get leverage in that equation, I guarantee you, you need a productivity offset to make that math work. So if you've got 4% to 5% growth rate, you add in inflationary expenses, you add in investment needs, you add in the expenses needed to grow that 4% to 5%. You probably produce something higher than the 4% to 5% expense growth rate. What we're saying is that needs to be the productivity we need to get on an annual basis in our franchise to drive leverage into that business. And your magnitude is in the area code that we're thinking about, the 2% to 3% range every year. A good way we think about it is it's got to be at least as much to offset inflation.","So if our expense improvements have to be at least enough to offset inflation, then you have your cost to drive the new business. And you've got some available for investment. And that's the way we think about, the more we driving productivity the more we share and profitability and investment opportunities for the firm.","Operator","And next we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Biff, can you -- I know the modelling is challenging and nobody can really predict the future on interest rates with 100% accuracy. But I recognize we're all focused on the short end of the curve. What happens in you guys' outlook if the long end of the curve actually rises due to maybe trade -- I mean with China, stronger economy and we're looking at two and three quarters 10 year in the first, going into the first of next year. How does that affect what you guys have been talking about on net interest income?","Biff Bowman","I think, Gerard, the answer to that is, it's probably depends on how the steepness of the curve moves between the short and in the long end. So if the long end moves up and the short end moves up in parallel, it's a different impact than if the short ends stay where it is and the long end moves up when we get steepness in the curve.","From a loan book perspective, we don't have nearly as much mortgage based credit that's going to be impacted by the type of move you're talking about in the long end of the curve. So I would say less impactful to us in that space. But the investment opportunities along with the curve and the spread they offer from the short end of the curve does matter to us. So I guess I would have to say it depends on how the rest of the curve shifts with that move in the long end.","Q - Jim Mitchell","Okay, because I was assuming your end drops with the long end steep, so you have so called bold steeper in the curve is what I was thinking, but thank you. And then second question, when you guys step back and you look at the challenges that companies always face and opportunities that you guys have. What are some of the -- aside from interest rates since we've talked about that. What are some of the challenges that you guys foresee that you have to overcome maybe in the next 12 or 18 months when you look out at the businesses?","A - Biff Bowman","I would say, if we look, there is always a significant demand for technological investment for our business. And we compete, particularly on the asset servicing side, in a highly technologically driven field. And so making sure we make the right investments in that technology to remain competitive. Along with the word competitive, I would say, we are in a competitive marketplace. And while I would say we have seen pretty similar type fee pressures that we've talked about in the past, compression of 1.5% to 2% in the marketplace, we're in a competitive environment with good competitors. And so we want to monitor the competitive nature there. So we got to remain vigilant to the competitive landscape on the horizon.","And on the wealth space, I think it's one of opportunity. So what -- you asked what the challenges are. I think for that, it's what are the right pockets to grow in, where do we want new -- where do we have less market share than we would like and where we can get to, to that client base, because where we are established we do very well in those markets. And I think there is opportunity for us in certain markets where we're maybe under-represented.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Quick question on the expenses, the trust and investment fees came down again this quarter, it's been trending lower over the past couple of years. But given your pull back on expenses, are you still expecting that to trend lower from here, or is it just that it's more challenged environment and we should expect it to flatten out for a while?","Biff Bowman","So that question, I would say, we do hope that over long periods to evaluate that that we want to continue to drive more productivity in. So we've not achieved nirvana in terms of that rate. What I think we have to be cautious of is we have seasonality in our business. For instance, next quarter we have the Northern Trust open, which puts pressure on expenses in a quarter. And obviously, markets can do volatile and drive the fee line. And our expenses can't necessarily react in 90 day to a market that can move.","But if you look over longer periods of time, the answer is there is continued focus on driving that down. And I would give you an example. If you do these calculations between our two businesses, they're quite different. And the mature wealth management business does drive that expense to fee ratio lower than the low of 500, for instance. And so I would say the answer is over long measurement periods, they're still absolutely focused inside the firm on continuing to improve that. You may see quarterly moves that go up or down just based on seasonality and\/or market volatility.","Q - Brian Kleinhanzl","And a separate question on the agency MBS portfolio are they going to see a drop off in yields like the other banks are seeing from premium amortization. What was the impact on premium amortization this quarter, or is there something of a lag effect for you?","A - Biff Bowman","So I think we've talked to you about premium amortization being somewhere around the $10 million to $12 million in a quarter, and it was inside of that range in this quarter. So the nature of our portfolio and the way we've modeled that and everything, it produced premium amortization that was much in the range we've guided to.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Bev Fleming, for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beverly J. Fleming","Thank you, Ryan, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call this morning are Michael O'grady, Northern Trust's Chief Financial Officer; Eileen Blake, our Controller; and Allison Quaintance, from our investor relations team.","For those of you who do not receive our fourth quarter earnings press release or financial trends report via e-mail this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. In addition and also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation which we will use to guide today's conference call. This January 18th call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be available through February 17th. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.","Now, for our Safe Harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those indicated by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties. I urge you to read our 2010 annual report and our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results. ","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'grady.","Michael G. O'grady","Thank you, Bev. Let me join Bev and welcome you to today's call. First, I'll review our fourth quarter financial performance as we customarily do. And second, as we indicated in our last earnings call, I'll review the initiative we call driving performance which is our corporate-wide effort embarked on earlier in 2011 that focuses on improving our productivity, profitability and returns in order to deliver greater value to our clients and shareholders. ","Before we get into details, I'd like to make a few overview comments on the quarter. The operating environment Northern Trust has faced in the last several quarters continued in the fourth quarter. While these conditions presented mostly challenges for our business, we saw certain benefits in our financial results in the fourth quarter reflected this dynamic. While the U.S. economy exhibited signs of a continued slow recovery, there was growing uncertainty in Europe. As a result, many of our clients remained cautious, which was reflected in continued increases in demand deposits on our balance sheet. ","With interest rates still at historically low levels, we realized only a modest benefit from higher deposits as yields on high-quality investments decline. In addition, fee waivers on our money market funds increased as a result of low rates. ","Another benefit of the improving U.S. economy can be seen in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. With trouble loans declining, our provision also declined. Equity markets were up in the fourth quarter but down on a quarterly and monthly lag basis. This had a negative impact on our trust fees as most of our fees are calculated on a lag basis. And foreign exchange volatility and volumes trended lower in the fourth quarter resulting in lower foreign exchange trading income. ","Importantly, the uncertain backdrop does present the opportunity for Northern Trust to fulfill our role as a trusted advisor and service provider to our clients. We continue to be very successful in adding new clients, both personal and institutional, which enabled us to organically grow our business and partially offset the impact of these headwinds on our revenues. To provide the high level of service Northern Trust clients both new and existing are accustomed to, we continue to invest in our business both people and technology, which caused our ongoing expense levels to grow. ","To achieve our goals delivering value to both our clients and shareholders, we have been actively identifying ways in which we can increase our productivity while maintaining the differentiated client service experience. With successful execution of driving performance, we expect to improve profitability and return. We'll talk more about that in the second section, but now, let's move to Page 4 and discuss the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. ","Earlier this morning, Northern Trust announced fourth quarter reported net income of $130 million, a decrease of 17% versus last year and 24% versus last quarter. Earnings per share were $0.53. Fourth quarter results included $13 million in adjustments related to Visa, so consistent with our treatment of Visa items, operating earnings, which exclude the adjustment, were $0.50 per share. There were 2 additional items that we do not adjust for in operating earnings but impacted the fourth quarter. First, we recorded $61 million in restructuring, acquisition and integration expenses during the fourth quarter or $0.17 per share. The charges primarily relate to the driving performance initiative. There's a schedule of the components of the charges in the appendix. ","Second, net interest income in the quarter included a $7-million increase associated with the settlement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment for certain structured leasing transactions. This settlement, along with related income tax impact, amounted to a benefit of $0.02 per share on the quarter. For the full year 2011, reported earnings were $2.47 per share. Operating earnings, which exclude only Visa, were $2.41 per share and restructuring, acquisition and integration charges were $92 million or $0.25 per share.","If you turn to Slide 5, Slide 5 summarizes our results for the quarter. Operating net income, which excludes Visa, was $122 million, and down 15% year-over-year and 28% sequentially. Excluding the after-tax impact of the additional 2 items I mentioned, the restructuring charge and the lease settlement, operating net income would've been up 9% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. On that basis, both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were favorably impacted by higher net interest income, a lower loan-loss provision and a lower effective tax rate. And while the fourth quarter was the first quarter to include the full impact of the Bank of Ireland security services and Omnium acquisitions, increasing both revenues and expenses, they were essentially just below breakeven on an operating basis. ","Compared to the prior year, these favorable factors were partially offset by reduced foreign exchange trading income and higher compensation expenses. Compared to the previous quarter, these factors were more than offset by lower trust fees and foreign exchange trading income and higher equipment and software expenses. Our return on equity on a reported basis with 7.2% reflecting the quarter's charges and the difficult environment. Our return on equity adjusted for Visa and for the 2 items I mentioned earlier, it was 8.7%, essentially in line with recent experience, but below our historical returns and our future aspirations.","With that background, let me get into the detail behind the fourth quarter results, beginning with C&IS trust investment and other servicing fees on Page 6. Trust investment and other servicing fees in C&IS, our institutional business, totaled $306 million in the fourth quarter, up 14% year-over-year and down 2% on a sequential basis. Net new business in C&IS was strong for the quarter and for the year and came in just below a record we set in 2010. We were successful with clients new to Northern Trust in all regions around the world but also continued to garner new business from existing clients. We're particularly pleased with the pace of new wins and the robust pipeline in the hedge fund administration space. As I mentioned, the equity markets were mixed in the fourth quarter, with the S&P 500 up 11% sequentially, yet EFA was up only 3%. As you'll recall, some of our custody and investment management fees are calculated based on a 1-quarter lag methodology. Given that markets were down in the third quarter, with the S&P down 14% and the EFA down 20%, sequential performance was negatively impacted by the quarterly lag month. ","C&IS custody and fund administration fees were $206 million in the fourth quarter, up 24% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the recent acquisitions, which together added $35 million in custody and fund administration fees this quarter and new business. Flat performance sequentially, primarily reflects the weak quarter lag markets offsetting that new business. ","C&IS assets under custody were $3.9 trillion at year end. Compared to the prior year, AUC growth of 4% primarily reflects the impact of new business, partially offset by lower securities lending collateral, flat year-over-year performance to the S&P 500 and lower international markets. Compared to the prior quarter, AUC growth of 2% primarily reflects new business and higher equity markets offset by the stronger U.S. dollars, lower securities lending collateral and a decision by a global client to consolidate its custody assets elsewhere. ","C&IS investment management fees were $61 million in the fourth quarter, down 10% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. In both comparisons, new business was insufficient to offset higher money market funds, fee waivers and market impacts. Waived fees associated with institutional money market mutual funds were $12 million in the fourth quarter, up from $10 million in the third quarter and $3 million in last year's fourth quarter. ","C&IS assets under management were $489 billion at year end. Compared to the prior year, flat AUM primarily reflects the new business offset by flat U.S. market and lower international market. Compared with last quarter, AUM growth of 2% primarily reflects new business and the blended impact of higher U.S. and international markets, partially offset by lower securities lending collateral. ","Securities lending fees equaled $19 million in the fourth quarter, up from $17 million in last year's fourth quarter, yet down from $21 million last quarter. Borrower demand remains soft as securities lending collateral of $95 billion was down 5% in the quarter, more than offsetting the impact of higher spread.","Fees in our Personal Financial Services business are outlined on Page 7. Trust, investment and other servicing fees in PFS were $236 million in the fourth quarter, flat year-over-year and down 4% on a sequential quarter basis. New business was strong in the quarter, and for the full year, PFS had an all-time record for new recurring fees. Existing and prospective clients continue to place their trust in expertise solutions, brand and financial stability of Northern Trust. Strong new business was unable to offset the impact of equity markets and higher money market fund fee waivers. These waivers reduced PFS fees by $21 million in the fourth quarter compared to $10 million in the quarter earlier, and $19 million in the third quarter. With respect to market impact, our PFS regions use a 1-month lag methodology and on that basis, equity markets were down 5% on a sequential quarter basis in the fourth quarter.","Wealth management fees are calculated based on a 1-quarter lag methodology. While the S&P 500 was down 14% in the third quarter, Wealth Management Group fees are modest 1% due primarily to strong new business.","PFS assets under management were $174 billion at year end, up 13% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects new business and more than offsetting the impact of flat markets. The sequential increase reflects new business and higher markets.","Total revenues are summarized on Page 8. Total trust, investment and other servicing fees, which I just highlighted for C&IS and PFS, were $542 million for the quarter, up 7% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of lag market effects and fee waivers. Foreign exchange trading income was $72 million in the fourth quarter, down 27% year-over-year and 18% compared with last quarter, reflecting lower client volumes and downward trending volatility. Other operating income of $38 million decreased 11% year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting the impact of currency translation gains in the prior period. ","Net interest income was $281 million in the fourth quarter, up 21% year-over-year and 5% sequentially; and net interest margin was 1.28%. As I mentioned earlier, net interest income in the quarter included a $7 million increase associated with the settlement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment for certain structure leasing transactions. Absent that benefit, the net interest margin would've been 1.25%, unchanged from the third quarter. The increase in net interest income was primarily the result of growth in average earning assets. Balance sheet growth has been fueled by strong client deposits, more specifically, demand deposits more than doubled year-over-year and averaged over $20 billion in the fourth quarter. These deposits have been primarily invested in our investment securities portfolio. ","While the net interest margin was down year-over-year, it was stable in the third and fourth quarters when adjusted for the leasing item in the current quarter. In total, revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were $965 million, up 6% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. ","Now, let's look at fourth quarter expenses on Page 9, which are shown on operating basis, which excludes only Visa, but includes all restructuring, acquisition and integration-related charges. Total expenses were $785 million in the fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Fourth quarter expenses included $61 million in charges associated with integration and restructuring activity compared with $4 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter expenses also included for the first-time, the full run rate impact of acquisitions, which added $43 million in the current quarter and $31 million last quarter. Expenses adjusted for restructuring charges and all acquisition expenses were up 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Compensation expense, our largest category, was up 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.","The adjusted 2% sequential increase in total expenses was primarily driven by higher equipment and software expense as we continue to invest in technology to support our clients, higher business promotion and higher charges associated with account servicing activities. ","Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 24.1%, well below 32.6% last quarter. The lower tax rate primarily reflect the favorable resolution of a number of outstanding matters with both the IRS and state tax authorities, including the leverage leasing matter, as well as benefits from adjustments to corporations intercompany service allocation methodology. Our average effective tax rate cost the past 5 years was approximately 33%, which is more representative of a normalized rate.","Moving to Page 10, credit quality was better in the fourth quarter as non-performing loans decreased 14% sequentially to $294 million at year end. Improvements were evidenced in commercial and institutional, commercial real estate and residential real estate, each declining sequentially by about $4 million. Other Real Estate Owned also decreased by $9 million on the net basis sequentially and was carried at $21 million at year end. The net result was non-performing assets were 1.08% of total loans and Other Real Estate Owned, down from 1.18% in the third quarter. Net charge-offs were $18 million which compares with $44 million last year and $29 million last quarter. Our loan-loss provision was $12.5 million in the fourth quarter, down from $40 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $17.5 million recorded last quarter. As a result, the allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases was $295 million at quarter end, representing 1% of total loans and leases and one time on non-performing loans.","Let me wrap up this section on Page 11 by briefly covering 3 topics of interest relative to our balance sheet. First, our securities portfolio, which was about $31 billion at year end continue to be managed in a high-quality fashion, with 86% of the portfolio invested in U.S. Treasury, agency in AAA securities. During 2011, we extended the duration portfolio slightly. The portfolio at year end had a maturity duration of a little over 2 years and repricing duration of about 10 months, both slightly higher than the prior quarter. Second, with respect to the Eurozone, we've essentially no exposure to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain within our balance sheet securities portfolio, deposits with banks and due from. We continue to invest and place deposits with a select group of stronger banks at sure tenures. Third, our capital levels remain very strong, with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 12.5% and 12.1%, respectively. And we estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III framework, as we currently understand the regulations, would equal 12.3%, exceeding all regulatory requirements.","We continue to invest in our business, deploying capital to support our clients' needs and through strategic acquisitions including the 2 completed in 2011. We maintained our dividend throughout the financial crisis, paying $273 million in dividends in 2011 for a dividend payout ratio of 45%. We bought back approximately 1.6 million shares in 2012 at the cost of $79 million, virtually all in the first half of the year. ","Dividend and share repurchases combined, our total payout ratio was 58% for 2011. Capital strength is and will continue to be a hallmark of Northern Trust and a key point of differentiation. As did the other banks in the regulatory capital planning process, we submitted our capital plan earlier this month to our primary regulator and expect to hear back in mid-March.","Let's move to the second section of today's call. While our client-focused business and financial condition are strong, the macroeconomic conditions continue to restrain revenues and return. As I mentioned earlier, we reported $2.47 per share in 2011 and reported a return on equity of 8.6%. Our earnings returns are below historical averages, and we expect the environment to be challenging for the foreseeable future.","Northern Trust is a different company today than 5 years ago or 10 years ago. As a company, we have more clients, we have greater global reach, we provide new products and services and we operate in a more complicated environment. It is a necessity that we step back and look at how we operate our business. ","I want to also emphasize what this isn't. The underlying businesses and strategies in Northern Trust are sound and compelling. We are not changing the core strategies and principles of Northern Trust, nor is this a once every few years across-the-board series of actions. Rather, driving performance is about continuously examining every aspect of how we execute our business in order to accelerate productivity in the near term and improve the long-term. It's about driving performance to deliver greater value to our clients and shareholders.","On Page 13, we outlined the goals, drivers and estimated impact of this corporate-wide effort. An overarching and critical goal is to maintain a laser-like focus on our clients. This is the heritage of Northern Trust dating back to our founding as a competitive differentiator that matters in the marketplace. We will not take any actions that will compromise the client experience, and we'll strive to enhance it.","Our goal is to optimize operating processes in order to improve productivity. And by doing so, improve the profitability and returns of our business, regardless of how favorable or unfavorable the macro environment may be. Northern Trust has a high performance oriented culture, and we intend for this effort to contribute to that. Our actions fall into 4 broad categories: Revenue enhancements, process optimization, technology efficiency and corporate-wide initiatives, which I'll discuss in more detail in the next page. We estimate this effort will improve pretax income by $250 million by the end of 2013.","Page 14 outlines the category to key drivers and example initiatives within each. As I just mentioned, driving performance includes both revenue and expense initiatives. By 2013, we expect the mix of impact to be approximately 1\/3 revenue, 2\/3 expense. Let's talk about some of the specific initiatives we're pursuing. ","First, we're pursuing revenue enhancement initiatives to accelerate our revenue growth. Fundamentally, the revenue initiatives are meant to fully align our offering with what our clients value most. Over the past several years, the needs of our clients on both the personal and institutional sides have evolved as has the mix of products and services that we provide them. In light of these changes, we have taken a fresh look at what our clients really care about in our offerings to realize value here more fully. Furthermore, we are taking steps to simplify our pricing structures in a client-friendly way that provides transparency for the valuable services we offer such as advisory and fiduciary services. We are taking a coordinated set of actions to deepen relationships with our clients, ultimately increasing our share of wallet. Relationships with our personal and institutional clients are the cornerstone of our business. As such, we are pursuing these initiatives in a very customized way and generally on a client-by-client basis.","Driving performance expense initiatives are broadly based on implementing sustainable actions that, holding all else equal, take cost permanently out of our operating model. With process optimization, one of the most significant elements is streamlining our major business processes. Just a couple of examples, taking a look at how we strike our hands on a daily basis and how we open a client account and maintain the documentation associated with them. Activities such as these drive significant costs, so implementing steps to make these processes more efficient while still retaining or even improving our high levels of client service. Some of the tools that we are using to reduce costs include centralizing and consolidating activities, shifting additional activity to the middle and back-office, and eliminating redundant or low value-added activities.","Beyond our major processes, we will continue to optimize our operational footprint as we have for several years, assessing how to best serve our global client base. Another major piece is procurement. By enhancing our procurement organization and embedding new processes, we can realize meaningful savings on a category by category basis from office supplies to travel. On the technology side, we have worked with industry experts to rigorously benchmark our technology spend. The good news is we believe that we have a very efficient technology structure due to our integrated operating model and a history of organic growth. The leading benchmark confirm this for us. That said, IT efficiencies do play a role in driving performance. We've identified opportunities to migrate our IT resourcing mix to lower cost sources without compromising service or risk. Again, while our applications portfolio is relatively clean, we will rationalize the number of IT applications with overlapping functionalities. Last, within technology, we expect that managing internal end-user demand to things such as PCs, storage, telecom, market data, et cetera, will drive savings as well. ","Finally, we're pursuing a set of corporate-wide initiatives. Notable elements here include simplifying our organizational structure and aligning our retirement benefit plans with market levels. So you can see that we have a wide range of initiatives underway aimed at improving productivity, and ultimately our profitability and returns.","Moving to Page 15, driving performance is not just a 2012 project. We began this effort in mid-2011 with a business-led bottoms up evaluation of efficiency opportunities. As a matter of fact, many initiatives have already begun and been implemented. For example, we consolidated our banking charters in October of 2011, and consolidated several offices in Illinois, Florida and Texas in late 2011. We also began reorganizing parts of Global Fund Services in the fall. This bottoms-up approach was followed by a top-down analysis that looked across business units in global operations and resulted in many of the initiatives discussed on the previous page. Implementation is well under way across the wide variety of categories outlined earlier.","On Page 16, we summarized the charges already taken in support of this effort and reiterate the expected financial impact in the years to come. The financial effect of these initiatives on margins and returns will depend on a number of factors, including the timing of realizing the benefits and how effectively we continue to grow our business overall. However, in order to isolate and measure the benefit of the impacts of these initiatives, we calculated the impact of successfully achieving $250 million on our current baseline. We estimate, using 2011 results, that our successful execution of these initiatives will improve our pretax margin by 5 to 6 percentage points and our return on equity by about 2 percentage points. We expect to realize over half of these benefits in 2012.","Finally, as you know, Northern Trust has historically disclosed long-term strategic financial targets, which included revenue growth, operating leverage, earnings per share and return on equity. We last updated these long-term targets in 2006.","While our financial performance has often surpassed these targets, there have been time periods, including the current period we have been experiencing since 2007 when our financial performance has not met these goals. As we discussed earlier, our efforts have been and will be increasingly focused on improving the profitability and returns of our business. To that end, the primary financial measure we are utilizing for our business is return on equity. While there's no single metric that's sufficient to evaluate performance, we believe ROE is the most comprehensive measure that captures both how profitably we operate the business, as well as how efficiently we manage our shareholders' capital. Over time, Northern Trust has achieved attractive ROE levels considering the operating environment within average reported ROE for the last 10 years of 14.6%. And even over the last 5 years, which includes the financial crisis, our average reported ROE was 13%. ","Importantly, Northern Trust also has a strong track record of organically growing its business and revenues over time. We will continue to do so with the objective of organic revenue growth in excess of our peers. With the strong discipline around productivity and efficiency being emphasized through driving performance, we expect to produce positive operating leverage and higher margins. The lack of clarity in the outlook for the global economy, interest rates and equity markets, along with an evolving regulatory framework, make it difficult to project target returns in the near term. However, we're confident the corporation will continue to produce attractive returns to its shareholders over time.","We expect the current macroeconomic conditions will persist into this year and likely beyond, further pressuring returns. With this backdrop, our long-term ROE target is 10% to 15%. With the successful execution driving performance, we expect to achieve the lower end of this range, and with an improved operating environment, we expect to move up higher in the range.","Let me summarize by reiterating a few key points made during today's call. Northern Trust remains focused on our clients and on helping guide them through this challenging market environment. We continue to win new, meaningful business from both personal and institutional clients who value the service and expertise that we offer. Our strategy, our brand and our financial strength have been steady and resilient during this prolonged difficult environment. Driving performance will increase our productivity, while maintaining our differentiated client service experience. It's about delivering greater value to our clients and to our shareholders.","Thank you for participating in Northern Trust Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call today. And with that, Ryan, please open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions. One, on the Slide 14 when you go through the drivers of the improvement of the $250 million that you're looking for, in the revenue enhancements, could you just give us a sense as to how you size them? Is that something that you've done tough one already and the pre-work here or is it an expectation that with increased focus and attention through just increasing the number of people focused on a particular client? Do you think you can get the revenues up?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I want to talk about that a little bit more. And I think it's important that, that part of the set of initiatives there is across the business, so both on the personal and the institutional side. And it is something that very much we spent the time sizing up but I think more importantly, have already begun to implement. On the personal side, really, what this is primarily is implementing a fee methodology and schedule, if you will, that's objective and simple and transparent to clients. And as a result of that, we think it better aligns the fees with the value proposition that we deliver, and as a result, the fees can and will change for a number of clients. Some will go higher, some will stay the same, some will go lower but overall the way we sized it out, we do see that overall, our fees will go up. That's something also that was implemented at the beginning of the year, so we expect to realize the benefits throughout 2012. On the C&IS front, that's a different business, if you will, with regards to how you think about the value proposition and the fees that we receive from our clients, and I think it's important on that front to separate between new business, business that we're winning now versus business that's been in place for a long time. On the new front, there I think that the business takes into account the current environment we're in and the services that we're providing. And so that business, the value proposition, if you will, is well aligned. It's on the existing business where on a client by client basis, we spent a lot of time looking at all the clients, both those that the activity with them and the services we provided continue. But more importantly, with those where it's changed over time. Where previously, when we entered into the relationship with them, the activities that they anticipated and we anticipated have now changed in some respect. So they previously would have potentially anticipated doing more securities lending, but now at this point, are not doing that. It's really a situation then when we address that with them in a way to realign that value proposition in a way that works for both parties. So that could involve just doing new services with them. We can manage some of their assets as a way to improve the overall relationship for both parties. So that process is something that's been designed, but then as far as the implementation, it's been happening for some time period and will continue going forward but in a very measured way.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And PFS is fully in the run rate at this stage?","Michael G. O'grady","Correct, the new fee schedule, if you will, implement that this year.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Page 16, when you go through the estimated pretax impact of $250 million, which is about half realized in 2012. How do we think about that in relation to future charges that you outlined, future charges that have incurred. Can you give us any sense of how much of the total charges of the program have you already incurred versus what you expect going forward?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, sure. So the charges relate to any of the activities that we anticipate as part of these initiatives going forward in the next 12 to 18 months. And just from an accounting standpoint that we can recognize the costs that will be associated with those. The reason why we have down here future charges is that there will be additional activities as we go forward in this. As I mentioned, it's not just a 2012 project. That will also result in charges. So, for example, with an office to the extent that we close an office, we don't take the charge for that until we've actually vacated the presence -- premises. So it has to do with the accounting for that. We'd like to think that the charges that we've taken here in the fourth quarter represent the majority of what it's going to be. But at this point, we're not estimating or projecting what future charges will be.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I know you've been at this for a while, but I guess what started out sounding like an expense containment initiative now appears a lot more substantial. I was just hoping if you look back at the last year and a half, just could you give us a sense of why maybe that changed and what exactly you all learned incrementally as you went through the process?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, Howard, I think your characterization is correct, which is this is not just a cost containment exercise. And in fact, that is the part where we pulled back to look at the business, how was the environment changed and what do we need to do in order to be competitive and to serve our clients, not just in the next year, but going forward. And so many of the incremental initiatives you see here fall into the category there, with regard to process optimization, and that's where we're looking at the major processes within the institution to determine if there are better ways to do that. So an example would be if you think about client administration, which would involve account openings and the account maintenance process there, that's a process that doesn't just happen within any particular part of the institution, but rather happened across the enterprise. And so what we're looking at is how can we make that process better for clients, and also more efficient for us? Right now, while the process certainly works well, we think it can be much better. Right now, it's largely a paper-based process. And it's something that involves a number of people involved in that. We think that to the extent that we can streamline the process, apply some technology to it as well, so automate parts of it, that we can make that, as I said, better for the client as they open an account, but then also reduce our cost.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up to all of this, in places where you are changing pricing schedules, are you assuming anything in terms of client attrition? And similarly, are you holding back any project spending that you otherwise would've liked to do?","Michael G. O'grady","No, on both fronts -- when we made our estimates here, Howard, we definitely have tried to take into account that there could be potential attrition from this. We don't expect that there will be much, and I say that in a sense that we're going about it in a very careful way, and we do think that it's being done in a way that aligns with the value that we deliver to the clients, but we have taken that into account. And on your second point, there will be some investments in technology as a part of this, as we look to improve the processes and automate certain activities that we have. But the capital investment here is really very modest, and it's also something that fits into the broader context of our capital spending.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then finally for me, Mike, you touched on capital return. I thought Rick made some fairly constructive commentary during the fourth quarter on his desire for capital return for the firm. What are your current hopes for an overall payout ratio? And is there any level of concern about kind of the 45% dividend payout for 2011 as the -- this CapEx which you have not won, there seems to be more scrutiny on the 30% figure.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. As I mentioned and as you know, we submitted our capital plan. And so we'll just have to sit tight and wait until our regulator, primary regulator gets back to us with their view on our capital plan. But what I can say Howard is that I -- if you look at the history of Northern Trust, we've always taken a balanced approach to both dividends and share repurchase. And we'll continue to attempt to take that approach going forward. We really think about a capital primarily from the standpoint of having the appropriate level of capital in the institution as opposed to a particular payout ratio. Now that is another lens which can be applied to it. But at this point, I think that you can expect that we'll be consistent with what we've done in the past, and we'll just need to wait and see how the regulators though that the plan that we've put forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Stilmar with SunTrust.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Really quickly, diving still into the idea of revenue opportunities, you talked about potentially providing or taking market share and providing new products and services that your customers wanted, was wondering if you could touch on what some of those products might be in both the institutional and personal side and then maybe are these completely new products and resources that reflect the time period or is this taking wallet share or market share from somebody else and how does that dynamic basically work? I was wondering if you could walk through your thoughts on both of those.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. John, I was primarily referring to on the institutional side, where we are dealing with very large global institutions, and they are active in a number of areas. In a number of areas frankly that they're products or services that we can provide, which we may or may not be providing them at this point in time. It would be a rarity that we're ever providing a single or even just a couple of services to a client. It's usually a much broader relationship. But it's also a situation where we likely don't have all of the business that we can have as they work with multiple institutions. So increasing the wallet share really is working with clients to see if we can't provide more services. It does mean picking up market share from others to do that. But it also, it doesn't mean that this point that we need to go out and get a new capability. We have the capabilities and the products to serve. It's just a matter of getting greater market share with them.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then touching on another topic with regards to money market fee waivers. You obviously, amongst the trust banks that felt the sting of the low-interest rate environment on your revenues pretty significantly, and as the SEC is reviewing money market funds, are we kind of at the point now where this sting is already out of it and there really isn't that much risk to revenue? Should you get an adverse or kind of rule from the SEC? Or how do you look at the proposal of the SEC relative to kind of the revenue opportunities and what you would expect institutional clients to do based on that?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. John, I'm going to break that up into 2 separate questions. First is with regard to the level of money market fee waivers. Right now, rates are very low. Is it possible they could be lower? I guess that's possible. So that could have an impact. The other thing is that they are affected by the size of that business for us. So if our assets under management grow, then that can also increase the amount of fee waivers. Having said that, to the extent that our fee waivers grow our overall fees for those funds are growing. So it doesn't necessarily mean that we won't have greater revenue. It just means that the fee waivers themselves could be greater. But at this point, given the amount that we're waiving, yes, we'd like to think that we're well past the majority of the amount that we would waive. Now the second question with regard to just money market funds in general, you mentioned the SEC, there are obviously other regulators that are broadly involved in this. And it is something that because of the importance of that business to us, we're actively a part of the dialogue. So we're in dialogue with our clients as to how they think about the fund because remember, many of these clients can potentially either be in our money market funds or could be depositors of the bank. So we're in dialogue with our clients. We're certainly active in discussion with the regulators as to how they're thinking about money market mutual funds. And then also, we're a part of the various industry groups as well, whether a number of proposals out there with regard to whether it's variable right now or other ideas. And I would say at this point, there is not a clear direction in our view that this is headed. But it's something that will continue to be on the front edge of.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a few real specific questions, can you remind us what the targets were in 2006?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. Bev, do you want to...","Beverly J. Fleming","Sure, Mike. We were looking at revenue growth of 8% to 10%, earnings per share growth of 10% to 12%, positive operating leverage and an ROE of 16% to 18%. Those were the targets that we rolled out in 2006.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And so now, it's solely the ROE target of 10% to 15%?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, Mike. That's right in the sense of that is the target that we're going to put out there publicly. Having said that, as you can imagine, we run the business looking at a number of metrics. And as I mentioned in my comments there, that's not to say, for example, that revenue growth is not extremely important to us. It's just the fact that if you think about what impacts revenue growth there, the headwinds that we've encountered here with interest rates and markets and foreign exchange volatility that at a top line, those can have a fair amount of variability. Having said that, we view that it's our job here to manage the business in a way that ultimately generates returns for our shareholders in all types of macro environment. So that's why we felt it was best to focus everyone in on one primary metric.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And do you have a view on what your cost of capital is?","Michael G. O'grady","Well, I think that everybody can calculate their own cost to capital. We definitely do that for ourselves internally. It's not something that we disclose. But I do think that in the same way Bev has said that our targets have come down, certainly, with lower rates, et cetera, we do view that the cost of capital has come down as well.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And I guess where I'm leading to is, is your ROE target high enough going back. The early part of last decade, 16%, 17%, 20% at times, and now we're down to 10% to 15%?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I mean, we certainly strive to generate into the high end of our range there, Mike. But at the same time, given the current environment, we think that it's appropriate to look at the business as it is now, take initiatives like driving performance in order to improve their performance. But be realistic, given the environment, and frankly the uncertainty both macro also but regulatory really, with regard to capital when we set that target.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And if I can just segue to the cost savings, so you're looking to eliminate 6% of the 2011 expenses of $2.8 billion, if I look at that correctly.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And are you leading the project since you're relatively new to Northern? If I'm not mistaken, it's helpful to have a fresh look at situations such as this. So if you can just kind of describe your background and the perspective that you're bringing to this project.","Michael G. O'grady","So you are correct, I'm relatively new. And so I'd like to think that I have a perspective that's valuable overall. But I am just one of the perspectives. This is something that's critical to the whole senior management team. So everybody from Rick and Bill on down is really responsible for this. We do have a pretty disciplined process around it. So we have a project management team that has been a part of not only developing these initiatives, but also ensuring the implementation. But it is a top priority of the institution overall.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And actually, how much is PFS versus C&IS?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. We're not really breaking it out and part of that, Mike, is because one of the key things here is that this runs across the institution. Much of this is looking at, as I mentioned, whether it's client administration or whether it's things that we can do in our lending area to improve the efficiency of our documentation, things like that, that happened in all of our businesses or multiple businesses. So it's really not broken out by individual business units.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just hearing on the revenue enhancement side of it a little bit more. In terms of these 3 components, the value proposition, unbundling and the extend in wallet share, can you describe a little bit the timing of the -- of your expectation of revenue improvement from each of the aspects? And then did I hear you correctly that you said the PFS new schedule run rate is or new PFS schedule is already in the fourth quarter run rate or the first quarter of '12?","Michael G. O'grady","No. The fee schedule itself was implemented as of January 1 of this year. So it's not in the fourth quarter. So the items you mentioned there, I mean, I would say that the idea of fully aligning the value proposition is true for both PFS as well as C&IS and NTGI. And so, that initiative, or that characterization, if you will, is really what we're doing overall. The specific fee methodology change is PFS. So as you heard there, by implementing that at the beginning of the year, that's something that we'd like to think that we'll see very near-term positive impact from that. On the C&IS front and the idea of gaining greater share of wallet, as I mentioned earlier, Brian, that is client by client and has been happening for some time period. I think that as a result of everything we're doing here, we'll accelerate that. But that's something that will continue through 2012 and into 2013 as well.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what portion of that 30% to 35% would you describe as the everything but expanding the wallet share? Is it majority, minority?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as a portion of that amount. I mean, I think as far as we're going to go, Brian, as far as breaking it down the buckets that we have on that page.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just as we think of the longer-term operating leverage potential. Obviously, as you move through this and make the organization more lean, when we do eventually get to a better environment be it from higher market levels or a better rate backdrop, what's the sense of, I guess, sort of expansion and projects spend? You said before you're not really holding back projects spend right now, so should we assume that you'll see pretty substantial, potentially pretty substantial operating leverage, a couple of years out in 2014 and 2015? Or do you sense that there are a lot of sort of pent-up demand for projects that you sort of put on the back burner during these projects?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I'd answer this, Brian, in 2 ways. First of all, as far as, I'll call it the operating leverage, what we're doing here is to look to improve margins in the current environment. And we obviously have suffered as a result of some of the conditions and the fact that there is operating leverage in the business, but it cuts both ways. And so to the extent that, that operating environment improves and we are successful implementing the initiatives here, yes we do expect to see the benefit of that in our operating leverage as you mentioned, kind of 2014 and '15 as well. As far as projects, there's nothing that we're -- what I would call constraining as a part of this. It's much more about making sure that as we spend our capital dollars, that we're prioritizing the right projects. And if you're taking one of my comments earlier with regard to that, that was just to say that there is not a significant capital investment that's required, that's incremental as a result of the driving performance initiative.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's very helpful. And maybe just switching to the balance sheet. Just looking at some of the trends from third to fourth quarter on the rate side, the interest-bearing deposit yield went up pretty significantly on the asset side, 113 to 129. Can you describe what drove that? And then secondarily on the U.S. government securities, looks like you added quite a bit of additional exposure there. What are you investing in incrementally in terms of maturities on that side?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. First, to respond to the first part, as far as the interest bearing deposits with banks and the increase there, a higher proportion of the dollar amount there or the balance that's invested in Australian dollars, which have a higher yield. So that was really the biggest driver of that increase. As far as the securities portfolio, yes, you're correct. We did increase the amount in U.S. treasuries and was mentioned in my comments earlier extended our maturity somewhat. So that is treasuries that we've put out for 2 years. And really, I, Brian, try not to look at any particular investment as indicative of what our investment strategy is because the portfolio really is managed overall. So it's not for some reason we think a particular security, the particular part of the curve is a sweet spot, but rather just trying to make sure that overall, we have the right level of liquidity, and we have the right level of credit quality which we've had.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay, that's helpful. And just lastly on the tax rate going forward, should we continue to assume something in the 33 to 34 range or are we moving lower? I know this quarter was an aberration, but just wanted now look to 2012.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. For now, I would stick with that historical average that we've had which is in the neighborhood of 33%.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","On your comments on the fee waivers, do you think -- I don't know if I heard you correctly. Did you just say that you think you're 50% through going through the accounts that have fee waivers or did I misunderstand that?","Michael G. O'grady","No, George. You didn't in the sense of if nothing else changed, so I say that in a sense of rate, market rates or the asset levels that we have. We are more than 50% through the fee level. So I was just saying, so we're waiving more than 50%.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. If -- obviously, as you grow your business and maybe more customers then we'll get these fee waivers because of the rate environment, what rates are most impactful on waiving these fees? What are you finding to be the rate that we've got to see go up so this phenomenon for you and your competitors goes away?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. It's really just overall short-term rates and very high quality securities. So you can't pick one single metric and say, for example, an x rate or index goes up. But it had because in the same way I just mention how we think about our investment portfolio, with NTGI likewise have a look at their short duration portfolios, it's a number of factors that they take into account that have the right credit quality, the right liquidity and also get the appropriate rate that they can. But certainly, I think as you see the combination of shorter term rates go up, that's going to be your best indication that we should see relief on this front.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And is it unfair to say or maybe fair that if everything remain constant for a moment and you went through the remaining 50% of the accounts, would the fee waivers will essentially double or is that too bearish or too pessimistic?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. That's not how I would necessarily think about it. Again, if nothing else change right now as far as the rate environment and the asset levels that we have, Gerard, then our fee waivers would not change the next quarter. Now, obviously, those things do change, but at this point, if they were the same you would have the same level, and you wouldn't expect to continue eat through all the way to the total amount of your fees.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, coming back to your return on equity target. I know, Mike, you were with the firm back when they had their Investor Day on May 26, 2010, and when you look at those slides, you guys gave us that return on equity number which of course was similar to what you mentioned on the '06 numbers. On the revenue growth and EPS growth and the positive operating leverage which you referenced back to the '06, do you guys plan to give us those targets as well at some point in the future or are you just going to stick with the ROE number?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, we're just going to stick with the ROE for the reasons that I said, Gerard. Again, while we do think that there are number of other financial metrics that are useful and we certainly use a number of them internally, we think that it's best to have this primary metric that we can guide, both you and frankly the company internally towards what we're trying to drive the business towards.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Lastly, on the Basel requirements on capital, assuming you guys are, let's say, 100 basis points simply buffer on top of the 7%, what's that comfort level? Because Northern has always been very conservative in the way they view capital, what the comfort level for your Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III if the requirement for you folks is 8%?","Michael G. O'grady","As you mentioned, we won't know if there's any buffer at all or what that buffer would be. As far as that comfort level, the main thing I would say is it's very important for us to be very well-capitalized and to compare favorably with others. And so there are many factors that would go into it. It would depend on the environment that we're in. It would depend on the levels of other institutions. So many factors are going to where we think the appropriate place to be needless to say, we're very comfortable with our current level, but that's something that I continually get monitored, both by ourselves as management and the capital committee that is responsible for that, but also with our Board of Directors and our discussion with the regulators.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to go back to your guys comments on cost savings. Just kind of go through that maybe in a little bit more detail. So if we were maybe to break up the 1\/3 comes from revenue, 2\/3 comes from cost cuts, how much of that, if anything, is already in the run rate, but -- because as you pointed out, Mike, you guys closed a couple of branches already. So I don't know if some of those cost savings are already coming through or all of that is really incremental to the current run rate?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I would say there is a very small portion that is in the run rate at this point, Alex. You mentioned some of the things that happened, but most of those happened kind of fall towards the end of the year. So of the total there, it's a small amount. It begins in this quarter, if you will, that you'll see more of it.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the progression of how you think this is going to come through, you highlighted 50% realizing 2012, and again, is that mostly on the cost side or revenue side or total?","Michael G. O'grady","It's balanced between the 2.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then it looks like your net interest margin was pretty stable over the last 2 quarters for you guys. Is it fair to think about freights don't really change from here? Maybe you guys have been trying to be a little bit more the balance sheet management to kind of keep NIM a little bit more steady and again holding everything else equal, that sort of the run rate we should think about for the foreseeable future?","Michael G. O'grady","I think you characterized it correctly, Alex, which is we are trying to maintain the NIM where we are at this point in this environment. At the same time, there can be various factors that change that move that around a little bit. So as much as that's the objective, I don't think that we or anybody else can really project out exactly where it will end up.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then, my last question on foreign exchange trading. One other terms bank is coming in today that they have seen some migration from clients in the construction business to either electronic or I guess direct trading. Have you guys seen anything similar in your business or do you think the decline this quarter is really just purely volumes and volatility? And then maybe, broader if you can help us understand the breakdown in your FX results standing instructions versus direct?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So I would say that the reduction that you saw in our foreign exchange trading income definitely relates primarily to the broader trends with regard to volatility and just volumes overall. Now having said that, like any market, Alex, it's a dynamic market. And so there are constantly things that are changing, as you mentioned, where technology is being introduced, which changes the nature of the way the business works and the transactions get executed. And that is something that we certainly are a part of. And that's why we do invest in our businesses like that one to make sure that our technology is such that we can capture the business to the extent that it migrates that direction. There are also other dynamics just as to how clients think about executing their FX and who they do that with. And again, we are constantly assessing the way that we approach our clients, both the existing ones but also potentially other clients to be able to provide that service to them. And so, it's of a complex part of the market that we, like the others I think, are very focused on making sure that it continues to be a good business for us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Hopson from Stifel, Nicolaus.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","There's a slight difference between the affect on margin and the $250 million, I think, some wondering if that reflects the ongoing additional cost of software, et cetera. And then the second question regarding the current quarter. Looking at average core assets under custody and the fee levels, did client behavior changes affect any of those balances? So as money moved out of, say, registered products over to deposits, with that influence on either revenues and\/or assets under custody, was there some negative mix shift, in terms of servicing fees?","Michael G. O'grady","On the second one, I would say that that's not something that we would be able to attribute to one or the other. I would say though that the broader point that you're making is valid, which is clients are definitely looking at the alternatives of either placing their short-term investments, meaning cash investments in a money market fund or on the balance sheet of an institution like Northern Trust. And when they do that, they have to think about not only the economic returns that they would have, but also the safety of that short-term investment as to whether it's a deposit at an institution like Northern or whether it's a part of a mutual fund that's invested in a certain set of high-quality investments. So we do see that, and we do see migration between the funds and our balance sheet. And I think that will continue as we go forward. As far as being able to determine the impact of profitably of one versus the other, that's not something that we see as having a material impact on us, given that we do both for our clients.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. But would you charge a lower custody fee on money market versus something else, I guess, is my question.","Michael G. O'grady","No, we don't change our fees based on -- if I understand your question, no, we have not adjusted our fees in any way related to that.","Beverly J. Fleming","Jeff, could you repeat your first question?","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So if you look at the margin effect on the current revenues, you say 5% to 6%, and if I take the $250 million divide it by the current revenues, I'm coming up with a larger number, more like 7%. So is my math just wrong?","Beverly J. Fleming","Well, the $250 million is a split of both revenue and expense. So you would need to take that into consideration in your calculation.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A couple of quick questions on the expense side. First of all, just with regards to getting the 50% in 2012, is that also an end of year run rate of context similar to how you're talking about 250 by the end of '13 run rate it?","Michael G. O'grady","It is, Ken, but certainly both in both years. We're looking to do this as quickly as we can so that we have year end -- maximum year end benefits both in 2012 and 2013.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So -- okay. So you're saying that the...","Michael G. O'grady","Just methodology though to answer your question.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, I get it. So to the methodology, yes, but on the realization you hope to do it quicker than just to that point as far as recognition across the year. That's a fair way to say it?","Michael G. O'grady","That's right. So there's -- neither of those are intended to be back end weighted if you will. We're supposed to do it as soon as possible to capture the maximum benefit in the year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good clarification. Second one, the fourth quarter expenses were elevated relative certainly to the revenue output, having sequential growth and it core expenses x the charges and the decline in top line revenues quarter-to-quarter. So I'm just wondering, I know you called out the specials related to the program, but was there anything just in this quarter that you'd also say in a core basis was either above trend or elevated that would look better as we get into the beginning of next year?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, I think where you did see elevated levels is I think I call that 1 point in the dialogue there is on equipment and software, we did see a higher level in the quarter-over-quarter comparison. That's a result of the investment we've made over time, but also in the quarter there where we had higher equipment rental and maintenance costs. But overall, I would say that the run rate that we saw there is exactly why we're focused on driving performances to really improve across the board on the line item and, it's not necessarily focused on any particular line item.","Beverly J. Fleming","And, Ken, one other thing that I would say about another line item, the other operating expense line item. That one you can see in the press release was elevated due to some business promotion activities as well as account servicing charges. But I think more importantly, I'd remind you that in the first quarter, we typically see higher business promotion expense related to the Northern Trust open as well as to our -- that's the approach that we take to immediate expensing of some stock options.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, yes. Okay, and then a big picture question is on the plan. So you're helping us size the $250 million in context of what you would do to pretax margins and ROE. But I just wanted to make sure, is there any incremental message there relative to the growth of the rest of the business? Because previously, I think the [indiscernible] you've been talking about slowing the rate of growth and improving margins at the same time. So I just want to understand the flavor for what's going to be happening behind the scenes of the plan, meaning you're still expecting net expenses to grow over the next couple of years or is this a different context given how you're sizing it for us in terms of just that -- is it more of a net add as opposed to a kind of reduction relative to a growth rate expectation?","Michael G. O'grady","I don't think we're changing the way that we've discussed it with you. But just to clarify, we still see significant growth opportunities. So as we mentioned earlier in the call, this year was a very strong year for net new business to the firm. And we see significant opportunities ahead of us as well. And so we don't believe that it's in the shareholders interest for us to try to slow the growth of the business overall. What we do think is in the shareholders interest is to improve our productivity in a way that it increases the profitability of that growth. And so we think as a result, it's best to provide you and us with a way to capture these initiatives and be able to determine what the impact of those initiatives will be, separate from the underlying growth of the business.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And speaking -- then my last question speaking to the growth of the business, once again, you guys had exceptional deposit growth, both in kind of core deposits and non-interest-bearing, and I'm just wondering if you can tell us a little bit about how much of that is still the flight to quality versus how much of it is just kind of core customer growth in terms of your ability that those become either core deposits or perhaps some still flight risk to them as the world normalizes?","Michael G. O'grady","So the growth in deposits is still with what I would call core clients. So it is a matter of them leaving more cash in the form of demand deposits on our balance sheet. Having said that, I think that it's very difficult to predict how that will change as the environment changes. So as much as those are deposits with core clients, I don't necessarily think that it should be interpreted that those clients wouldn't change their mind as the environment changes and take those off the balance sheet as deposits going forward. So it's not in any way flyby deposits that are coming from entities that we don't do other things with. But at the same time, I could see them go down in a different environment.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And as a result, does that still keep you with excess growth still being somewhat conservative with how you reinvest it as we're seeing with the treasury investments and such?","Michael G. O'grady","No question that we have to maintain appropriate liquidity as a result of that and yes to be shorter, as far as the duration there puts pressure on the net interest margin.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I'm not sure if I missed it in the prepared remarks, but do have -- can you tell us what your won but not yet converted new businesses as you exited 2011?","Beverly J. Fleming","Glenn, that's not a disclosure that we've provided in the past, so we don't have anything to give you today on that.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","All right, I'll try a different way, Bev. The new business that you're bringing on, given your pricing comments and obviously, there's lots of different parts of new business, but in general, is the new business coming on at a higher average fee relative to when we do the math in our model on the current book?","Beverly J. Fleming","Well, one of the things that you'd want to be aware of is that we are being very successful with assets under administration. So you would see in the custody and fund administration fee line, fees that could be associated with assets that are not within assets under custody. So from that perspective, the math that I'm familiar with that you're doing has looked better actually in the last couple of quarters because of that phenomenon.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Understood. I appreciate that. And then last one is all the questions around the ROE target now versus then I think is interesting. Curious if you could break down. If you look at the top end of the range and that 300 basis point differential, is that the pure -- the best -- the purest way to look at, at what the increase capital requirements for the industry are and the rest as a function of business trends? Or am I reading too much into that?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, I think it's still probably a combination of both at this point. So yes, the industry is carrying more capital as a result of the broader economic but also regulatory environments. But it's also to say that at this point, given the visibility of the environment here and how long we can continue to see interest rates that are at these levels, and the nature of some of the other changes in the business with regard to securities lending, potentially with foreign exchange, that the combination of those 2. And I think just the last thing, just more broadly speaking, the returns that all financial institutions will look to be able to generate going forward. I think if you factor those 3 things in, that's how you get to the range that we're in.","Beverly J. Fleming","Ryan, I believe that was the last call. So we thank you for participating, and we will speak with you in April.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $409.9 million. Earnings per share were $1.80 and our return on common equity was 17%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter\u2019s results included $5.7 million of severance related and restructuring charges within expenses and $30 million in benefits for income taxes, primarily attributable to the adjustments recorded associated with the Tax Cuts and Job Act.","Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets had a mixed impact on us during the quarter. End-of-period markets were unfavorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indices declining 6.2% and 13.4% respectively. On a sequential basis, both indices also declined with the S&P 500 down 14% and the EAFE down 12.5%. Also on a sequential basis, the average daily market value of the S&P 500 was down 5.1%, while the EAFE declined 6.3%. However, as you will recall, some of our fees are based on lagged pricing and in the prior quarter, the S&P 500 was up 7.2%, while the EAFE was up 1.8%.","Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter, driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter down 6% and 5% respectively compared to the prior year. The British pound and euro also declined sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines for the pound and euro against the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact to revenue and a favorable impact to expense.","Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 5% with non-interest income up 4% and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 2% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $4 million compared to a credit of $13 million one year ago. Net income was 15% higher year-over-year.","In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 2% with non-interest income up 2% and net interest income up 3%. Expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income increased 9% sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 17% for the quarter, up from 15.1% in both the prior and prior year quarter. Assets under custody and administration up $10.1 trillion declined 6% compared to one year ago and were down 7% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $7.6 trillion also declined 6% compared to one year ago and were down 7% on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower equity markets and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates, as well as the impact of one large domestic custody client transitioning out during the quarter.","Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, down 8% year-over-year and down 9% on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by unfavorable equity markets outflows, which include the impact of lower period end security lending collateral and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates.","Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 5% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $934 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and down 1% from the prior quarter. Foreign exchange trading income was $78 million in the fourth quarter, up 24% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function, as well as increased client volumes and higher volatility. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher volatility.","Other non-interest income was $75 million in the fourth quarter, up 4% compared to one year ago and up 36% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to a net gain on the sale of non-strategic leases in the current quarter, partially offset by lower treasury management fees and securities commission and trading income. The sequential increase was also due to the net gain from the lease sale, combined with an impairment recorded in the prior quarter, as well as a lower Visa related swap expense. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $430 million in the fourth quarter increasing 9% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our Trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $536 million in the fourth quarter flat year-over-year and down 1% on a sequential basis. The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fee growth by approximately 1.5% and the sequential growth by just under 1%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fee, were $376 million, up 2% compared to the prior year and flat on a sequential basis. Both the year-over-year and sequential performances were driven by new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rates and markets.","Assets under custody and administration for C&IS fee clients were $9.5 trillion at quarter end, down 6% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower equity markets and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates, as well as the impact of one large domestic custody client transitioning out during the quarter. Recall that lagged market factors value into the quarters fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS fee custody and fund and administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS fee was $105 million in the fourth quarter were down 1% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to net outflows, partially offset by favorable markets and a change to gross revenue presentation. The sequential decline was primarily due to outflows. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $791 billion, down 9% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by unfavorable equity markets outflows and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.","Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, down 14% year-over-year and down 10% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performances were impacted by lower volumes, as well as lower spreads. Securities lending collateral was $150 billion at quarter-end and averaged $158 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels declined 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially.","Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $398 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Within wealth management, the Global Family Office business fees increased 7% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business and favorable markets. The sequential performance reflects favorable markets and new business. Recall that our Global Family Office fees are impacted by quarter lag market values.","Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by higher fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, new business and favorable markets. Sequential performance within the regions was relatively flat as the unfavorable impact of lower equity markets was offset by new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $279 billion at quarter end, down 4% year-over-year and down 6% sequentially.","Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $430 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged to $112 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $93 billion and were down 4% year-over-year. Interest-bearing deposits declined 2% from one year ago to $74 billion. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $19 billion during the fourth quarter, were down 10% from one year ago. Loan balances averaged $32 billion in the fourth quarter and were down 5% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.52% in the fourth quarter and was up 13 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by higher premium amortization and a balance sheet mix shift.","On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $12 million or 3%. Average earning assets declined only slightly on a sequential basis as deposit levels were only slightly lower than the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 5 basis points due to the favorable impact of higher short-term rates and a favorable balance sheet mix.","As we have discussed in our most recent quarters, we do continue to see the opportunity for foreign-exchange swap activity within our treasury function. This activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to Central Bank deposits as we swap out of U.S. dollars, but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income. For this quarter, we saw additional foreign-exchange trading income of $17 million, offset by $14 million less in net interest income. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 70% of our total deposits. This is equal to one year ago and up from 69% in the prior quarter.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were $1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 2% higher than both the prior and prior year quarter. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $5.7 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. For comparative purposes, note that one year ago our results included severance and other charges of $17.6 million, as well as $12.9 million expenses related to special one-time cash bonuses paid in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The prior quarter included $2.7 million in severance and other related charges. Excluding the called out charges, expense for the quarter was up 5% from one year ago.","With respect to the remaining increases in year-over-year expense growth, the following items were key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher primarily driven by increased incentive compensation and this year's base pay adjustments, which were effective in April. The impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Employee benefits were higher, primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses and higher payroll tax withholding, partially offset by lower medical expenses compared to the prior year.","Outside service costs were higher, driven primarily by higher third-party advisor fees and increased technical service cost expense, partially offset by lower consulting expense. There was a corresponding increase to Trust investment and other servicing fees as a result of the higher third-party advisor fees due to the change to gross revenue presentation.","Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year due to a software related charge, higher software amortization and higher equipment related costs. Occupancy-related costs were lower compared to the prior year, primarily relating to non-recurring lease adjustments recorded in the prior year. Other operating expenses were down from the prior year, primarily due to lower FDIC expense and staff-related costs, partially offset by higher costs associated with account servicing activities.","Shifting to the sequential expense view. Excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses were up 2% from the prior quarter. Compensation expense increased sequentially due to higher costs associated with performance-based incentives, salaries and other compensation costs. Employee benefits expense increased primarily due to medical costs. Outside services increased sequentially due to higher legal and consulting costs and higher technical services expense, partially offset by lower sub-custody and third party advisor fees. The sequential increase in equipment and software was primarily attributable to a software related charge.","Other operating expense declined $8 million from the prior period, driven by lower business promotional spending due to the timing of the Northern Trust sponsored golf tournament during the prior quarter and lower FDIC costs, partially offset by various other miscellaneous expense categories, including costs associated with account servicing activity. Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The staff growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona, partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations.","Turning to Page 8, as we have discussed on previous calls through our value per spend initiative, we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. And currently, we are embedding a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our fourth quarter results reflect approximately $36 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth by approximately 3 point. This would equate to approximately $145 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities.","Turning to the full-year, our results in 2018 are summarized on Page 9. Net income was $1.6 billion, up 30% compared with 2017 and earnings per share were $6.64, up 35% compared with the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outlined a non-recurring impact that we called out for both years. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 16.2% compared to 12.6% in 2017.","Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 10. Trust investment and other servicing fees grew 9% in 2018. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business, favorable markets, the acquisition of UBS Fund Administration businesses in Luxembourg and Switzerland, and the impact of revenue recognition. Foreign exchange trading income increased 46%, driven by an increase in swap activity within our treasury team and also growth from the client driven trading.","Net interest income increased 13%. The growth in net interest income was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates coupled with earning asset growth. The net result was 11% growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2018. On a reported basis, expenses were up 7% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense charges in both '16 and '17 that are on the prior page, expenses were up 8% from 2017, reflecting the UBS acquisition, the underlying growth within our business and the impact of revenue recognition.","Turning to Page 11, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity.","Turning to Page 12, our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.7% under the advanced approach and 12.9% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7% and at the Bank was 6.4%, both of which exceeded the 3% requirement, became applicable to Northern Trust effective at the start of 2018.","With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the applicable 100% minimum requirement. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our model and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation with final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III ruling. Yesterday, we announced the $0.05 increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.60. This represents a 9% sequential increase and an increase of 43% on a year-over-year basis. During the fourth quarter, we also repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of $235 million.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for some closing comments.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Thanks Biff. Good morning, everyone. Before we open up the call for questions, I want to offer some closing comments regarding 2018. The three primary objectives for our strategies are to continuously enhance client service, improve our productivity and grow profitably. In 2018, we executed multiple initiatives and made significant investments in order to make meaningful progress on all three objectives.","For example, we executed on an important initiative to realign some of our operations and technology functions in order to enhance the client experience by better aligning ourselves and our activities with client needs and our business strategies. We can see early benefits of this realignment as we can effectively and efficiently serve clients end to end and be more nimble in this rapidly changing environment. As Biff highlighted, we've made considerable progress towards our value for spend goal of achieving expense run rate savings of $250 million by 2020. Throughout the company, we have made a commitment to making a value-oriented mindset on ongoing aspect of how we conduct our business.","We are investing meaningfully in technology and our talent. In wealth management, we are expanding the capabilities of our goals driven wealth management platform and we continue to hire talent in focused growth areas. In asset management, we expanded our product offerings, including the development of new ETS and alternatives products. And in C&IS in conjunction with the integration of the UBS asset servicing acquisition in Europe, we are investing heavily in building a future state fund services platform and we strengthened our technology capabilities by acquiring or making investments in BECS, Lumin, Parallax and C Tech.","Our shareholders benefited from the execution of our strategy through the company's financial performance and return on to capital in 2018. As we began 2019, we are excited about our competitive positioning within each of our businesses. We remain focused on providing clients with exceptional service, improving our productivity and driving profitable growth.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Biff, Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. April, you can open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will first hear from Michael Carrier of Bank of America.","Michael Carrie","Biff, maybe first one is just for you. You mentioned some of the lagging pricing on some of the assets and just given the period end just wanted to get maybe an update on how you are thinking about the expense outlook for 2019 and beyond? You gave the update on the value per spend. But just how maybe the lower revenue environment can you just dial areas back versus what you are going to remain in investment mode for longer term growth?","Biff Bowman","Mike, maybe it would be helpful on the call if I walked through the lag and the lag impacts first and then we will talk about the expense reactions to that, because I think there is some important information here. First if you look at our fees as a firm if I look at our C&IS business first I'll start there, approximately 60% of the fees are equity market sensitive or sensitive to the asset -- they are asset sensitive, they move with markets, and so 40%. If you look at our custody and fund administration line and for those that are sensitive, about 70% to 75% of our fees are on a month lag basis. That means 25% to 30% are on a quarter lag basis. In the past, I know we have talked more about 50%-50% in that lag but our mix has shifted between our global fund service business that are traditional and IIG businesses as we call institutional investor businesses. And so that is more of a 75% -- 70% to 75% is on a month lag and 25% or so percent is on a quarter lag in our custody and fund administration fees.","In C&IS investment management fees, which about 40% of the fees are sensitive to equity markets, about 50% is daily but the vast majority of that is in cash funds. About 40% is quarter lagged but more heavily exposed to equity and than 10% or so is on a month lag basis. If you go to our wealth management business, it's more aligned with where we traditionally talked it has not moved as much, but roughly, if you look at our Global Family Office about 65% to 70% of the fees are quarter lagged, 25% of those percent are daily -- 25% is daily and 5% to 10% is in a month lag. And then if you look at our wealth management regions, about 70% are on a month lag basis, 20% are on a daily basis and 10% are on a quarter lag basis.","I hope that's important for everyone so they can understand the lag nature of our business for fees to give you some color. I think the rest of your question was really been around with that backdrop, what can we do from an expense standpoint. And I'll take a quick stat and Mike might have a few comments that he wants to add as well. From an expense standpoint, the first thing I'd say is we continue to focus as a firm on the organic trajectory of our businesses. So that's important to us what we think we can grow organically and what we can grow our expenses organically. But we're not immune from considering the macro factors in our expense run rate as well.","The way we look at it is this, we have certain inflationary pressures on our expense base, but we think about generating productivity through things like value per spend or other forms of productivity that has to at least offset that inflation in our model. That leaves us with expenses in our view that are there to support the organic growth rates that I talked about and\/or to invest in our businesses. And we calibrate those so that we generate organic leverage from what we think we will get on the organic growth rate. So that's the framework we think about expenses and we do think that if we get that right, we drive the productivity and drive the productivity as hard as we can that we can still create that leverage even in an environment where we do see some volatility on the fee line or volatility in the markets.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yes, I would just add to what Biff said that overtime we have the financial model that Biff described there, and so it's important that we continue to execute on that overtime. Having said that, you also have to navigate the environment that you are in at that particular point in time. And clearly, the environment right now is more volatile than it was say a year ago, and so that does means being very careful in thinking about how we manage the expense base for the business as we go through this market environment. So being relatively tight if you will as we go through that and focusing on these longer term productivity initiatives that we've had in place.","Importantly, as Biff talked about a year ago or before that, the environment was relatively strong and that\u2019s when we launched into value per spend. And the point is that we didn\u2019t want to wait for a more challenging environment to say okay now we need to come up with ways to reduce the expense base. So it's both through cycles if you will, but then also trying to be mindful of the environment that you are in.","Michael Carrie","And then maybe just a quick follow up. Just on your organic growth outlook, I think you guys have been in that call it 4% to 5% range over time. Given what you're seeing in terms of the investment opportunities and maybe some of the competitive dynamics in the industry. Are you still comfortable with that type of outlook just given some of the dynamics in the industry? Has anything I guess changed from that perspective?","Michael O\u2019Grady","So from an organic growth perspective, we still are targeting the range that you talked about there and I would say right now in the past year, we were towards the low end of that range. And there's a number of dynamics around that and maybe just to break it down a little bit by our businesses. Starting with asset management, I don\u2019t need to go through all the dynamics facing that business, but that's a business that has seen its organic growth rate come down. And in the past year, basically we were flat as far as organic growth in the business. So a little bit negative on flows and picked up a little bit on fee realization through mix. But essentially at flat that's going to dilute the overall organic growth rate for us.","If you look at the asset servicing part of the business, which has been growing at a higher organic growth rate, it continues to grow at the same level that it's been at. In 2018, it was again towards the lower end of that range. But if you think about that as being roughly half of the fees and the range for them being 5% to 6% over time and towards the lower end, still a healthy rate for that business. And I would be glad to break that down further as to what we saw in 2018.","And then the wealth management business again different set of dynamics, which I won't go through but has been at a lower organic growth rate. And so even separating out the impact of asset management products in that business, the organic fee growth rate has been more in 2% to 3% range for that and we were roughly in that range for the year. So when you do the weighted average of that that's where you come out to again towards the lower end of what you're talking about. But if you say strategically what are we trying to do, well, we are trying to execute on strategies and target markets where we think that we have an opportunity to maintain that growth rate.","Operator","Next we will hear from Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken","You spoke to the lag effect, which is helpful to get a refresher on in great depth, thanks for that Biff. Just curious if you could comment on the fee rate. So we saw it rebound from the third quarter where you had some transactional headwinds. Thinking about that looking forward how should we consider fee rate in each of your businesses. Might the lag effect that you walk through not only have an impact on the calculation of the AUC dynamics and AUM dynamics but also the fee rate, and how should we calibrate that as we move into 2019? Both considering the drop in 4Q and then the rebound here quarter to-date that we've seen in March.","Mark Bette","Brennan, its Mark. I'll take a first shot at that. Part of it would be the -- when you're doing the true averages of September 30th to December 31st AUCA or even AUM and wealth management, you are picking-up end of period number that\u2019s going to be lower for the assets, even though the fees haven't fully reflected that yet. We did see in the fund administration -- the custody and fund administration, we did see a little bit of a pick-up from transactions that would help there as well. Moving forward and as we've talked about that it's a really is that the custody and fund admin is a tough one to look at fee rates just because of the mix of businesses that you bring on and that every asset is not equal. So it's really about bringing on services, doing as much as you can for every dollar of asset.","On the wealth side, I would say as we have talked about before if you look at the regions within wealth management split let's say roughly evenly between product asset management and the advisory fees, the advisory component has actually held-up pretty well and we look to stay competitive in that area. And then on the product side, we haven't can quite seen the declines that we've been seen if you went back 18 months ago or so. But overall I think part of the fee realization might be the fact that the assets are fully reflecting the fourth quarter markets whereas the fees don't quite maybe has that yet.","Brennan Hawken","So maybe we're going to be looking at some fee rate pressure that's subject to a lag, seems like that's what you're saying there, Mark thanks for that. And then I wanted to circle back on the expense question. Mike, it seemed as though you had said that and it seems like this is bit of a different approach than what we've heard from northern in years past. Is that while you guys came up with your values for spend program, making hey when the sun was shining, so to speak. As you enter into a period where you have a potentially more volatile equity market environment, maybe less helpful, better tailwinds. You are going to be diligent in investments and the expense line so as to adjust for potential headwinds that might come through. Is that a fair conclusion there or am I reading too much into what you said?","Michael O'Grady","Well, I'm not suggesting that you read more into it than what I'm saying. Having said that, I do think that's a fair characterization. So we recognize the importance as I said of just continually improving our productivity. So it's not a good market bad market thing. And that's why we wanted to put more, I would say structure and focus around value per spend going back a year plus ago. In addition to that though when we enter an environment like this, just as you said and I think it's a good point. There are other expenses that are discretionary, if you will, so the level of \"investment spending\" that you're making. Theoretically, you can say, well, we're just going to flat-out invest through the cycle. We're not pulling anything back. And on the other side, you can say we're going to completely pull back on our investment in order to just get the expense growth rate down. And I think you hit on it when you said, yes, we can look at those categories and say not just whether we're going to do them but what is the pacing for that? Do we need to see a little bit more into 2019 before we continue on certain investments? And there is -- sorry for the express, but there is no such thing as the free lunch. If you delay on something, you are delaying on something. And if you don't make that investment, well, then you are taking the risk for future revenue. So those are the type of decisions that we have to make but it is acknowledging that we do have discretion around those. So let's try to manage those for the environment that we are in as well.","Operator","Next we will hear from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Question for you guys around pricing trends in the servicing business, obviously, I'm sure as you heard from last week, it sounds like the pressure has accelerated on a bunch of parts of the ecosystem here. So curious what you guys are seeing in terms of pricing and institutional servicing? There has always been -- obviously the mix is different and also there has always been some element of pricing pressure. But really just trying to get a sense of whether or not you are seeing any acceleration and pricing degradation here? And then separately, can you help us get a flavor for the makeup of your customer base within C&IS between U.S. non-U.S. asset managers, hedge funds, et cetera?","Michael O'Grady","Alex, its Mike, I'll start off. So the way I would characterize the environment that we have been in and I think we are still in is an environment where there is more activity. And what I mean by that is whether it's asset owners or asset managers for different reasons are definitely looking at what they're doing and how they're doing it and there are implications from that. So what does that mean? On the asset owner side of the equation, you have very large asset owners that have managed their capital or their investments in a certain way. In other words, have they completely outsourced it to external managers or have they done some internally. And frankly, we are seeing those types of organizations look at going both directions, and we've seen the impact of that.","So some of the larger ones saying we are going to do more in-house, because we think that that\u2019s a better way for us as a scale manager of investments. When they do that, they have different data needs and different capability need. So a lot of time spent around the technology and what we can provide to them, APIs, think database things like that. And again, depending on what you can offer versus competitors, et cetera, it can change the dynamics but there is more activity around that.","Second, I would say with other asset owners, they have actually looked at at the opposite way. And we saw some of the impact of that in 2018, where as an asset owner that has done more in house they've said, frankly, that's not our business, if you will. In other words, large corporate pension plans saying we're not going to continue to operate a large in house investment team instead we're going to go more external, we are going to go more passive that's lower cost. And our objective is to get to the right answer for the client. And so in doing that these are still clients but what we do for them is less and we will see some fee impact from that.","As you shift to asset managers, there has been a lot of discussion on obviously the pressure on asset managers and therefore their primary objective of looking at the cost of these types of services. They have also when they're asset based they have seen the cost go up in an absolute dollar perspective. So they do look to see if they can reduce cost. There are different ways to get there, whether it's just negotiation with the provider or do they go out and do just an RFI or do they go to RFP, and what are the results of that. So as a result of all that, I would say more activity.","Now if you looked at 2018 for us as a result of more activity, I would say our gross business one, if you will, was towards the high end of the rates that we have been at, so in essence good number. The next as I mentioned before towards the lower end of the range. And then if you say okay how do you break out the negative or the \"loss business\" in that. The largest portion of it, so say you are in the neighborhood of 3% from a rate perspectives was more towards if lost or repositioned. And I should add into that certainly you see flows change and the impact of flow. So if we're the custodian for a very large sovereign wealth fund that we do it for equities and they switch out of equities then we're going to see impact of that. So you did see more funds flow and more activity there.","When you say loss business, so did you lose a lot and why did you lose it. Again, I would say every situation a little bit different. In certain cases, do we lose through the process because the competitor does a better job it certainly is going be the case. We'd like to win them all but we don't win them all and obviously, we're up against the best in this business. And at times could it be because of pricing, and let's say either to retain the business they've gotten aggressive on pricing or in this case to win it away. That's certainly part of it. But I would not tell you that we've seen overly aggressive pricing by competitors in order to win business on. I would say it's consistent with where we've been. We've tried to be very disciplined around our own pricing. And again, I would say that we've seen some impact but not dramatic.","So when you take the repricing component, it's going to be more in the neighborhood of 1.5% to 2% of what we saw this year from a rate perspective. So you're going to have that, as you mentioned, all the time in the marketplace whether it's a little bit higher or lower. But for us I wouldn't say that part of it has been dramatically different. And then I'm going to let Mark to address the second part of your question.","Mark Bette","As far as the mix when we look at C&IS, and you're right we don\u2019t published the actual segments within the C&IS. But when we look at it, roughly about half of C&IS is the fund services business, which is where our asset managers would be, and that's we don't breakout that between traditional. But within that, you have traditional asset managers, you have hedge funds, private equity funds. I would say that our GFS business is larger in EMEA than in the United States. So that hopefully gives you some flavor for the makeup of the fund services.","Alex Blostein","And then my second question is just around expenses and maybe I'll frame it a little bit differently. But I guess if I look at your core expense base in 2018 net of the severance charges and a couple of other things you highlighted, looks like we are running a little bit below $4 million. And assuming that you continue to aspire to grow the business organically in the 4% to 5% range. Is that a fair way to think about the growth and expenses off of that sub $4 billion number for 2019?","Michael O'Grady","At the highest level, Alex, I'd say, yes. So in other words that's -- we're responsible for all the expenses. So we do break them down and cut them every way you could possibly think of. But at the end of the day, we're responsible for all of them. We aspire to do a little bit better than that number in the year from an internal target perspective, mystify a little bit for various reasons, not from a value per spend or productivity perspective but from some of the other things that Biff mentioned in his commentary there but that\u2019s kind of the base, if you will. And then going forward, again, it should be aligned with the organic growth rate in the fees. And so to the extent we can stay in the range that we talked about from a fee growth perspective then yes, then that's what you would expect from an expense perspective. To the extent that that goes down for whatever reason, then we have to look at how do we bring that organic growth rate on the expense down with it.","Operator","And next we will hear from Glenn Schorr of Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Just want to little follow up on the pricing discussion. Has anything dramatically changed in terms of client contracts, in other words, like the public money coming up every year or two and the rest of the world having five to seven year role. So maybe something like 15% to 20% of clients come up each year. Am I in the ballpark on that?","Michael O'Grady","Glenn, I would say for certain clients, you do have I'll call it more locked-in term that generally where there is more of an investment upfront for the on-boarding. But in most of these contracts, there is generally a notice period six months notice or something like that. So we're not counting on just the contractual term and the fact that they would be locked in. And I would say this is particularly with some of your more just traditional asset management business, they have the ability to accelerate it. So has that sped up a little bit? Again, I haven\u2019t looked at anything analytically. But as I mentioned before, I think we've just seen more activity as they have looked at their situation, I'll call it.","Glenn Schorr","And maybe you could talk to the good part of growth. In response to, I think it was Mike's first question, you talked about that 4% to 5% certain growth and you dangled a little bit of if you want more, I'll give you more on what clients are driving. Could we talk a little bit about what are driving it?","Michael O'Grady","Well, if I understand the question just peeling it back a level as to where we are targeting in order to have a higher organic growth rate, maybe starting with the asset servicing business. We have benefited from our focus on alternative managers. So for us particularly hedge funds and our hedge fund services business has grown at a higher rate. And again, we will continue to focus there. And we think there's opportunity in the other parts of the alternative space for us, both to the market itself but then for our position there. We also believe on the asset owner side with what we would call the more complex asset owners. So this is to my previous comments about asset owners that are doing more asset management if you will on their own. They tend to be asset owners that have high allocations to private. To some extent, hedge funds but also significantly in private equity infrastructure, et cetera. They have a different set of needs and therefore, we've been focused on how can we meet those needs with technology and a service model. And you saw the investment we made in a technology company that was part of it that was really to join up with what we've been developing on our own but we see greater growths in that segment.","Thinking about Luxembourg, obviously, we did the acquisition there but the fund services markets in both Ireland and in Luxembourg are both healthy. But I would say for us, in particular, Luxembourg has been and we think will grow at a higher rate for us just given our position there, which is lower position and now moving-up in the ranks there and we did see that. And then just shifting over to wealth management, on the wealth management side, again, we think that our value proposition resonates particularly well as the level of complexity goes up for the client or to the prospects, so ultrahigh net worth.","When I talk about goal driven wealth management, the platform that's behind that the technology that is geared more towards the ultrahigh net worth. And so we have seen a higher level of growth in that area and will continue to do it and then Michael as you see the numbers in Global Family Office. And I'll say that's beyond just keep doing a good job. There's been some very specific strategic initiatives in that business that are working very effectively. So, in particular, we looked at the technology there and we upgraded our technology offering, both the ability to do partnership accounting, just being a little bit technical but then also what we can offer as far as analytics. So we have something called anchor analytics that again is resonating very well with existing clients but also prospects.","And then I would just also say in wealth management. From a market perspective, we've talked many times about certain markets where we have lower market presence like in New York, like in Texas where we see higher growth rates for us. And that's not to diminish the growth from some of our more mature markets like Florida or here in the Midwest. And then just to close out in asset management, a significant focus around the area is again where we think we can grow faster, like ETFs and Quant active, which are not the larger parts of our assets under management base but where we see greater growth potential for us. So hopefully that gives you some of the areas that we're focused on.","Operator","Next we will hear from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So I wanted to start-off with a question on the securities portfolio. You manage the duration of the securities book very conservatively, I believe the duration now in assets is just a little above one year. And with the conversation now shifting from fed tightening to a likely fed pause and dare I say even fed easing cycle. I was wondering whether you might consider of locking in some duration and maybe mitigate some of those NII pressures in anticipation of possible fed easing in the future.","Biff Bowman","So the answer to that is we have our asset liability committee meets regularly and frequently. And what you just described is the key input to our decision-making and certainly an item that we're considering, given the balance of risks now between future rate increases and either no rate increases or even a reversal of the trends we've had. We do that on a regular basis. We have that conversation at all times. And we've benefitted as you see from the growth in our net interest income overtime from that short duration, but internal debates and views on what may happen in the future is something we consider. As a general rule, overtime, we've always had reasonably short but there is the ability to look at how we want to position that. And I can assure you that that is actively discussed and regularly discussed internally, and will continue to be. And as we look at what is I think now a more balanced picture in terms of what may happen in terms of future fed increases and\/or at some point maybe even a reversal of that trend. But we are certainly looking at it and you can see those things in some of our disclosures in the Qs and Ks where we look at sensitivity of net interest income to those factors.","Steven Chubak","And just one follow-up for me on capital management. One of your peers recently increased their capital return with the mid-cycle ask. You guys have incredibly robust capital ratios. I'm just wondering if that\u2019s something that you would consider pursuing. Maybe any insight into how you're thinking around long term capital targets have evolved. I know you try to stay at least in the ballpark with some of your peers that you compete with for RFPs. From the looks of things, you are actually above many of those peers today. I'm just curious how you are thinking about managing to explicit long-term capital target or what you think is a reasonable expectation from here?","Biff Bowman","So with regard to, first of all, we did a dividend increase yesterday, which was something that we had in our capital plan ask from last year, not public here until yesterday but we did do that. But the way we think about capital and the way the firm thinks about capital is; first, do we have enough to support our growth; second, do we have enough to support ourselves through times of high stress; do we have enough to maintain very high ratios and ratings; and then do we have enough to support a competitive position in the marketplace so that we can compete against others to win that business. I think the answer to all of those is, yes that we are strongly and well-capitalized at this position. And so as we think about entering the capital planning cycle and the submissions are due first part of April, we enter those from a position of strength.","That gives us a great deal of flexibility in our thinking and we do look at the competitive environment in terms of where we are, that's one of the four items I just highlighted for you. We think about our position vis-\u00e0-vis the others. But we think we are very well-capitalized right now and are focused on thinking that through in our capital ask and the regulators. In terms of would we ask in the mid period at this point, we think we have got a plan at this point in time that we are going to continue to execute on in the remainder of this quarter and the remainder of the second quarter and we will submit in April. But it's a strong position that we enter the capital planning cycle and submission from, and it allows us to think about our returns with great flexibility.","Operator","Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just to circle back to wealth management, Mike, I think you said that right now that organic growth range is low single-digit in the 2% to 3% area. Maybe if you can just talk about whether you think that\u2019s more of a regional focus in terms of improving that or rather more of the capabilities that you are talking about? And then also just what the client behavior is trending like in wealth management given we're seeing more volatile markets, are there anything more of cash? And then can you accelerate your own investment products within the open architecture platform across that business?","Michael O'Grady","Brain, a couple embedded ones in there, so make sure I hit on all of them. As far as the growth, I would say I'm going to call it across the business, so both within the regions but also in Global Family Office. I did highlight some of the things we're doing in Global Family Office, but that's not to say that that's the only area where we see opportunity increase that organic growth rate. And in fact, when I talk about goals driven wealth management ultrahigh net worth that's in the regions, if you will, so good opportunities across the markets when we look at trying to increase that. And I would also just say part of that is I am going to call it addition through subtraction just meaning we have a higher gross in new business rate, it's just that you also have to deal with the flows and people pay their taxes and things like that, that nets you down to that two or three. So we're trying to just get to the best net number that we have that we can get.","I think the second part was just about client behavior and I would say, you are absolutely right. When we talk about volatile markets, etcetera, the first thing that we think about is how do we make sure we're very close to the client and managing the situation with them. And I would say so far that we haven't seen a lot of dramatic behavior or changes. And I would say that that's particularly because that's the driving objective behind goals driven wealth management is keeping them focused on what are their goals, what are their objectives and we put together a portfolio that support those goals. And it gives you the ability to go through volatile situations like this without being over reactive and quickly moving out of equities only to then miss the opportunity when it goes back up again.","I will say in addition to that we do provide our strategic and tactical allocation portfolios from asset management to our wealth management client and they do tactically move. And last year I think appropriately it moved to more of a neutral position earlier in the year and then more recently in the beginning of this year, moved back to a more balanced position by increasing the allocation to risk assets. So once again, trying to see through cycles for our clients but then also being mindful of what's happening on a tactical basis as well.","Brian Bedell","And are you able to get more of the Northern Trust investment in managed product within that asset allocation platform, or are you seeing or just you are using more of an open architecture approach?","Michael O'Grady","So I would say everything I talked about there is agnostic to the product. Asset management itself, Northern Trust, is certainly trying to develop products that meet the needs of clients, but that's the only time that those two would come together. So I talked about ETFs and being focused on ETF as part of the success there, they've designed product that we think meet with the goals and objectives of our clients. But it's that direction, if you will, I'll call it top-down, not something the other way.","Operator","Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck ","So just a couple of follow-up questions here. I heard earlier about the conversation around price pressure, 1.5% to 2% in line with what you have been seeing for a while now. I guess I'm wondering if you could give us a sense, Mike. What that range of pressure is on just a couple of key either client types or product sets that you offer? I guess, I'm thinking maybe it\u2019s a little bit heavier on some of the more equity mutual funds and might be it'd be lighter if it all on alternatives but maybe that\u2019s wrong. And just like to get your sense on that?","Michael O'Grady","So I'm not going to be in a position to give you a product by product breakdown of where they're more or less. I mean, I think in general as I said, it's more about activity than it is about everybody just driving to lower cost per se. And as much as we know that there's a lot of pressure on asset managers and maybe you would say particularly certain categories of traditional asset managers that doesn't mean that a hedge fund is not focused on their expense base as well. It's probably more acute in the traditional asset management space, I would say that. But I know that that doesn't mean that we are immune in other categories as well.","And as I mentioned on the asset owner space as well, they certainly do look at the fees that they pay in order to custody and administer the assets. And so it's not again just a asset manager phenomena, it's something that you have to anticipate, which once again goes back to if you know that that's going to be to the case overtime what you do strategically. And I think importantly the first thing we do is we want to make sure we are providing value right, because the value is going to support the fees that you are paying, it's also going to lock you more into that client relationship. Then we are also going to look at productivity. Both in general as I talked about but within the client how can we be as productive as possible. And sometimes it goes the other way, which is to look at the value we are providing, look at the fees we are getting. And frankly if it's the other direction then we have to have that conversation with the client about the fee that they are paying relative to the service that we are providing to them. So I know that doesn\u2019t necessarily give you the specificity that you are probably looking for, but that would be my perspective.","Betsy Graseck ","I know you can't give. I was just looking for whether or not there was a range we could talk about. But I get your point. I guess the other question I had Mike was just on in the conversations you are having with both existing and perspective clients. What do you see as some of the biggest pain points that clients have frictions to solve that you are focused on addressing, say over the next year or so?","Michael O'Grady","So if it's institutional clients, I would say that on the asset owner side, the primary pain point is around data. So they are primarily trying to assess and determine for themselves what is the appropriate data model for them to have data operating model, and you say what does that mean? Well, it would be easy to say I want perfect data that\u2019s real time. We can provide that essentially. But in providing that that is a higher cost model to be able to provide that to them as opposed to a model that is either on a daily basis or some other basis, okay. And the point on that is it's worthwhile for the client if they are actively managing their investments. So higher cost but they would view it as more than make-up for it, because we are actively managing the assets, and that could be either directly in the market investing, it could be active with managers and it could be also what we would consider overlay strategies where they want to be able to quickly shift their asset allocation. But to do that, they need essentially real-time information in order to be able to do that.","Now, as I hopefully laid out, there is a spectrum there of both what the needs are and what we can offer, and so it's not a one-size-fits-all for all of those clients. And that's the dialogue. So with each client, you really have to assess where they are and what they're trying to achieve. And then as a result do they have the right offerings for them. And then I would say on the asset manager side, this is where we're investing significantly in our fund services platform, meaning both fund accounting and transfer agency to really make that much more of a digital experience for the client. And if you think about what we're doing there, we are helping our clients, meaning the asset manager service their clients. And so they are trying to provide a digital experience to their clients, while they can't do it unless we can provide it to them as well. So that's where the investment has been and trying to solve that pin point if you well for dealing with their client. So hopefully that's helpful.","Operator","Ken Usdin of Jefferies has our next question.","Ken Usdin","Just if I might just clean up a couple of questions. So Biff, you mentioned in your prepared remarks when you're talking about the AUC that the quarter you had a transition out of a large custody client. And I was just wondering can you help us try to understand of the 7% decline roughly just how much that was? And if in fact, the revenue from that client was also already out of the quarter's run rate?","Biff Bowman","Yes, so we refer to one large client transition out during the quarter, you're right. And it was a U.S. large corporate client. It was primarily a U.S. corporate cash custody relationship. When you look at it in our trend report, I think Glenn you'll be able to see that the drop of about $91 billion that you'll see in AUC in fixed income within C&IS, that's a reasonable indicator of the magnitude, that's a pretty good explanation of that. And then in terms of the fees, it was partially transitioned. So it was partially it was -- that's where Mark has talked about not all AUC is created equal and there's different fee structures associated with some of that. But it was -- it makes enough movement in the fixed income space that we called it out here.","Ken Usdin ","And then just a couple of little ones, there are couple of good plusses and minuses throughout the fees and expenses. And I'm wondering can you help us to the extent that you can clarify what leasing gains, software charge and the magnitude of what it sounded like a little higher servicing errors perhaps on the other expenses? Seem like there was some lumpy stuff and a bunch items. Any help you can help us in trying to get some starting points?","Biff Bowman","On the leasing side in the quarter, there was approximately $5 million worth of the gain. And we didn\u2019t call that out explicitly, because over the course of the year, there are gains and losses of that in the quarter. And interestingly enough over the course of the year, they wash through. So we at that magnitude haven\u2019t necessarily called them out given their size.","On the expense side, the items that I would call out on the software charge that we talked about. If you look at the sequential increase for us, which I believe was just under $7 million in equipment and software, I think it's fair to say that that was essentially all attributable to the software charge. So that gives you some idea of the magnitude of the charge, but it was largely that was driven there.","And then in terms of the costs associated with client servicing, we tend to look at that line item, which as you know it sits in other expense over the course of the year. It is fair to say that in this quarter that was higher than our normal run rate and meaningfully higher than that. But if you look at that line over the course of the year, it reverted closer to where we see it. It was a little higher we called it out. And the fourth quarter was indeed higher. But hopefully that gives you some color on what those were. Inside of other expense, which is a copulation of a lot of different moving parts, we had FDIC expense move in our favor by let's say $5 million to $5.5 million in the quarter, but we have these larger expenses associated with servicing clients meaningfully above the normal run rate and they are more than offsetting that. And then we have a lot of other items like value-added tax that all moved that item around. I think it's probably better to look at other expense over the course of the year and look at the average of those run rates.","Operator","Next we will hear from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just a question on the balance sheet and deposit flows. Seems like noninterest bearing and interest bearing both stable quarter-over-quarter. Do you think the flows, the outflows particularly non-interest bearing are starting to come to an end? Should we start to think about deposit growth yet or do you still think given where rates are, the deposits continue to trend down? Just wanted to get a sense of how you are thinking about it?","Biff Bowman","So we did see the stabilization, particularly in the non-interest-bearing line item in the quarter. I think it was down about $200 million, so essentially flat non-interest-bearing movement. And as we discussed last quarter when we look at that bucket and the nature of the makeup of that bucket, we think that a lot of the most rate sensitive money had already sought other return seeking products, whether those were within Northern Trust or somewhere else. So we feel reasonably confident that that bucket has reached at least the current level where rates are right now. And in particular, if we don't have any future rate hikes, we think that there could be some stability in that.","In the interest-bearing portion of the deposits, while it was flattish from what you can see here, there was some movement down in interest-bearing that can bolster with wholesale funding or others, not a lot, a little over between $1 billion and $2 billion. We view that more as normal operational movements but we would see amongst our clients as they reposition their portfolios, reposition their cash. That is much more a function of the interest-bearing to us, is much more a function of the growth of our business where we're growing our asset servicing relationships and we just generally see our balance sheet growth. Can we see deposit growth? I think we can see deposit growth if we see our asset servicing businesses continue to grow and our wealth businesses continue to grow we should be able to see that.","Counterbalancing that is any actions that maybe going on amongst the fed in terms of its own balance sheet management activities, which can put some pressures on it. But generally, we've seen now a couple of quarters of some balance sheet stabilization in terms of balances.","Jim Mitchell","And as we think about continuing organic growth in that mid single-digit range is that where you like as you think that\u2019s a intermediate term goal in terms of deposit growth?","Biff Bowman","It's not always one-for-one on that in terms of the balance sheet growth, because it depends on the nature of the organic fee growth we're getting. For instance, we could win fund administration and other type businesses where we don\u2019t necessarily have the custody, and we may not actually get balance as they come but we get fees. So it isn\u2019t necessarily one to one with that but it is growth where we get traditional AUC. There's generally some balance sheet growth that could come with that. So I don\u2019t know that I would quite put it at the -- peg it at the levels you talked about, but it could grow from there.","Operator","Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl ","Quick question if the fed does pause given where we're at with the deposit pricing and still seeing some upward pressure there, I mean if Fed doesn\u2019t move next year. Do you still think that you can see some margin movement I mean just assuming that the balance sheet stays flat? Or at this point in the time, we're almost liability sensitive?","Biff Bowman","If all things being equal here, if everything else is equal, we do think that there could still be some NIM expansions with no fed rate hikes. But the pace of that growth and the pace of that will be subject to the asset re-pricing that we have. We still have some assets that will roll some that need to reprised, so we do think there could still be some NIM expansion, but probably at a more measured pace. In terms of liability pricing with no future fed rate hikes, we don't see at this point a meaningful need to continue to have see upward pressure on deposit pricing. There might be some modest amount somewhere in the portfolio on the margins, but not broadly across the portfolio. We think we're at or near market competitive levels.","Brian Kleinhanzl ","And then just a separate one on tax, looks like you ended the year at the low point for the tax rate and that's excluding some of the onetime items you called out already in the presentation. How are we thinking about the tax rate then as you go through 2019? Are you able to adjust your go forward tax rate down, because of the guidance that you put out?","Biff Bowman","Yes, I still think at this point in time to 23% to 24% range that we've given you, is where we would suggest you think about for 2019.","Operator","Next we will hear from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us -- you have talked about this transitioning some folks into lower cost markets from your higher cost labor markets. How much more can you do there? I mean are you 50% there 90% there where there is not much more you can do in transitioning people into these lower cost markets?","Michael O'Grady","I'm glad to start on that one, Gerard. So I think it's a appropriate observation and one that we have had for some time, because it has provided a significant benefit to us over the last several years meaning going back 12, 13 years ago when we first started what I would consider location strategy to actually move functions into different geographies. And that has matured over time how we think about that. So Biff in his commentary had mentioned some of the different locations, those locations are not all the same. So what we do in Bangalore, for example, is different than what we may do in Manila or what we do in Limerick or Tempe. And so we've evolved it in that way.","The third thing I would say is that we've been growing as we've talked about. We have a higher growth rate in our businesses and particularly in asset servicing, which requires more people for it. And so really what it's enabled us to do as opposed to moving positions over, it's that we essentially absorb the growth in those locations. And then to wrap up with the answer to your question, there is still opportunity, both because of the growth and where it happened but also certain functions that still have not fully matured into where their appropriate location is. But acknowledging that and saying well then what does that mean if you are closer to the end I'll call it of location strategy and then in the beginning. And that's why we talked about automation and robotics and what we can do from that perspective. And we have a number of initiatives underway that are part of value per spend where we are looking to automate the functions as opposed to necessarily moving them to a different location. And the view is that that creates even more scalability than in our model.","Gerard Cassidy","And then as a follow-up, Mike, you guys obviously are very well-capitalized. You have had a successful acquisition strategy over multiple years of buying different businesses and integrating them into your organization. As the markets remained maybe more volatile pressures on revenues or across the board. Does it make sense to look at acquisition opportunities may be in a more heightened fashion or maybe that hasn't changed and you have been looking, and you just haven\u2019t really found anything?","Michael O'Grady","So, as we've talked about on the call, we're all very cognizant. There are a lot of negative aspects of volatile or down markets. And having said that as Biff articulated well with regard to capital. Now is a particularly good time to have a strong capital base and is part of the strategy with regard to capital because it does provide us the flexibility in these types of conditions to both be more opportunistic to your point on acquisitions, if they are attractive for us and to be able to have the flexibility around our capital returns. So, the answer is that we -- yes, we are always looking at acquisitions that can accelerate our strategies. And often, we're not able to execute on those because of the market, i.e., high valuations. And then you are presented with the opportunity because of the environment that either strategically, competitively, certain companies may have issues that then present themselves as opportunities for us or from a pricing valuation perspective, it just becomes more attractive.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Whether you intended to or not, I think you're coming across a little cautious on this call. So I just wanted to ask you, was that your intention going into the call. And specifically, when you add it all up, do you guys expect to show revenue growth faster than expense growth in 2019? And your ROE target, I'm not sure if you updated that are not, but it was 10% to 15% and you reported 16% in 2018. So is there caution? Is that the reason why you're not raising your ROE target or am I just missing something here? Thanks.","Michael O'Grady","Sure. It's Mike. I'll address both of those. So first of all, as far as the tone, we didn't come in with an objective for a particular tone. This is just the way that we're looking at the business and the environment et cetera. But needless to say, I mean, I would say, we're certainly optimistic about our position from a competitive perspective and our ability to serve clients and to continue to grow and produce attractive returns for our shareholders.","More specifically to your questions with regard to organic growth, fees and expenses, I would say in 2018, the objective was to have those in line, as we've talked about and we came up a little bit shy of that. So we did not meet our target. Now, almost were there and there were certain aspects of as to why that happened. And again we own all the expenses, so it's more reasons as opposed to excuses. And then coming into this year, absolutely the objective is the same on an organic basis. Now, there's a lot of things we can't control. We talked about the markets, how it effects our fees things like that. But the view is, if we can produce it on an organic basis and you have a year like 2018 that produces, I think 1.6 points of fee operating leverage. So that remains the same and that's our objective.","And then as far as ROE, we haven't changed the range per se, but I would definitely say that has not limited us in our aspirations or targeting. So we had 16% this year and certainly are not afraid to target for ourselves doing better, absent knowing what is going to happen in the environment. And I would say, now it's a particularly difficult time to say, all right, should you recast the range when part of the reason why we're above the range frankly is because of tax reform a year ago, which boosted the ROE. Hopefully that stays in place, but again there is nothing certain on that front. And then also the markets and everything we've talked about here, we tried to have a range that was through the markets. Hopefully we're not at the top end of that for it, but we don't find the range itself to be constraining on our activities or aspirations.","And finally, I would say for shareholders, we're trying to produce the most attractive combination of growth and returns. So as I've said many times, if it was just about the returns there is probably some things we could do to pull back on spending and investing and things like that. And in the short-term get it up, but over the long-term not create as much value for shareholders. And so, how do we make sure we're balancing growth with returns, particularly when we're at a relatively attractive levels.","Biff Bowman","Whether if I could add here, I would say, Mike, tonally there was no preview of let's have this be cautious, what it was is us just talking about the environment we're operating in right now. But I think, as Mike said he is optimistic about the positioning of our businesses and the opportunities to grow organically. And I would say -- he and I are both and the Board and everyone is equally optimistic about the financial strength, with which we entered this period of uncertainty and volatility. We have a strong balance sheet, we have good liquidity and we're well positioned to take advantages of the opportunity that type of volatility can put in front of us.","So whether you call that caution or optimism, I think that gives us a great array of opportunities. But we are entering a period of time that looks different, then say previous five, six, seven, eight year positive equity run and at least the last three or four with upward sloping rate likelihood. So I -- there was no intention to be tonally cautious, just factually the environment we're operating in, but business positioning, I think, Mike and I would both agree financial strength and strategic product and execution strength are pretty high.","Michael O'Grady","Our objective is to deliver on the results.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations Bev Fleming for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead.","Bev Fleming","Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Biff Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer, Jane Karpinski, our Controller; and Allison Quaintance from our Investor Relations team.","For those of you who did not receive our third quarter earnings press release and financial trends report by email this morning they are both available on our website at northertrust.com. In addition, and also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation which we will use to guide today\u2019s conference call.

Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.","Now for our Safe Harbor statement, what we say during today\u2019s conference call may include forward looking statements which are Northern Trust\u2019s current estimates and expectation of future events or future results. Actual results of course could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2013 annual report and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.","During today\u2019s question and answer session please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, everyone, and let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust earnings conference call. It is my privilege to be here today with you to review Northern Trust third quarter financial performance. I hope to meet many of you in the coming weeks and months. As is our customary practice, today I will review our results for the quarter after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions.","So starting on Page 2 this morning we reported third quarter net income of $205 million and earnings per share of $0.84. Our return on equity was 10.1% in the quarter. As you evaluate our performance this quarter, recall that our results in the third quarter of last year included a $33 million gain on the sale of an office building and the results in the second quarter of this year included charges and write offs of $42 million. Excluding these items our earnings per share of $0.84 in the third quarter increased 11% year-over-year and decreased 3% sequentially.","Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mixed in the third quarter, a theme which has been ongoing for some time. U.S. equity markets were higher at the end of the third quarter both year-over-year and sequentially with the S&P 500 up 17% and 1% respectively. International equities as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index were up approximately 2% year-over-year but down 6% sequentially with the sequential quarter decline driven largely by a stronger U.S. dollar. In bond markets the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was up 1% year-over-year but down 1% sequentially.","Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $5.9 trillion, up 13% over last year, and assets under management ended at $923 billion, up 9%. On a sequential basis client custody assets declined 2% and managed assets were essentially flat. I\u2019ll provide further details on asset trends later in this call.","Currency markets had multiple impacts this quarter. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 36% lower than the third quarter of last year having hit an all time low in the month of July before trending up in the months of August and September. Sequentially, the G7 index was essentially flat while the emerging markets index was down 10%.","Currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Currency rates, which influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar, impact client assets and our revenues and expenses. The dollar was generally weaker on a year-over-year basis yet stronger compared to the second quarter. Dollar strength in the sequential quarter comparison tempered client asset growth and related fee growth with an offsetting benefit to expense growth.","Short term interest rates remained at every low levels and continue to pressure our net interest margin and result in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three month LIBOR averaged 23 basis points down 3 basis points year-over-year while the fed funds effective rate an average overnight repo rate both remained low at 9 and 8 basis points respectively.","With those comments providing the context of the environment let\u2019s move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the third quarter. Compared to last quarter revenues were flat as higher trust investment and other servicing fees and net interest income were offset by lower foreign exchange, trading securities commission and trading, and other operating income. Expenses, excluding the prior quarter\u2019s charges and write offs, increased 1% due primarily to higher employee benefit and other operating expenses offset partially lower outside services and equipment and software expenses. We had no loan loss provision in the quarter as credit quality continue to improve.","Reported net income increased 12% sequentially. adjusted for last quarter\u2019s charges and write offs net income decrease 3%. Year-over-year revenues adjusted for last year\u2019s gain on the sale of a building were up 6% and expenses were up 5%. Revenue growth was the result of higher trust investment and other servicing fees and net interest income.","Expense growth primarily reflects higher competition and benefits and equipment and software expenses. Reported net income was 1% lower year-over-year. Excluding last year\u2019s gain on the sale of a building that income was 10% higher year-over-year. Earnings per share was $0.84 and our return on equity was 10.1%.","Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4 of your deck. Third quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were approximately $1.1 billion, up 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, revenue growth excluding last year\u2019s gain was 6%. Trust investment and other servicing fees the largest component of revenues were $718 million in the up 11%yoy and 2% sequentially.","Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 11% year-over-year corporate and institutional services business increased 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially while fees in our wealth management business grew 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Higher equity markets in new business were both drivers of growth with higher money market mutual fund waivers partially offsetting.","In addition, currency translation helped fee growth by about 0.5% on a year-over-year basis but detracted from fee growth by 0.5% on a sequential basis. Fee waivers were approximately $34 million in the third quarter, an increase of $1 million over last year and $3 million sequentially. The higher waivers were primarily due to the gross yield on t fund declining by approximately 1 basis point on average both year-over-year and sequentially. I\u2019ll go into further detail on trust and investment fee shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was 46 million in the third quarter down 26% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Currency volatility was lower in the third quarter hitting a an all time low in July before trending up in August and September. Client trading volumes was lower year-over-year yet modestly higher sequentially. Other non-interest income was $65 million in the third quarter down 3% from last year when adjusted for the sale of the building and down 14% sequentially in both comparisons the decline was due in part to lower securities commissions and trading income. The sequential decline was also due to lower income from currency which I\u2019ve also discussed some more detail later activity and lower leasing and loan servicing income. Net interest income which I\u2019d also discuss in more detail later was $256 million in the third quarter up 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.","With that back drop let\u2019s look at the component of our fee revenue on Page 05. For our corporate and institutional services business fees totalled 400 million in the third quarter up 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $275 million in the third quarter, up 15% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.4 trillion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflects new business and market conditions including higher equity and bond markets particularly in the year-over-year comparison.","In the sequential quarter comparison, C&IS fees and assets under custody were dampened by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar primarily due to the dollar strength in the quarter relative to the euro and Sterling. Investment management fees in C&IS was $75 million in the third quarter were up 6% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $703 billion, up 11% year-over-year and up slightly sequential. The year-over-year increase in C&IS assets under management was due to higher equity and fixed income markets in new business as well as higher securities lending collateral.","In the sequential quarter comparison, higher fixed income cash and securities lending collateral were partially offset by lower equities as the stronger dollar hampered international returns. For example, MSCI EAFE Index was down 6% in the third quarter driven primarily by currencies. C&IS investment management fee growth was reduced by higher waivers on institutional money market mutual funds. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equalled $17 million in the third quarter, $1 million higher year-over-year and $2 million higher sequentially primarily reflecting the lower gross yields achieved in the underlying funds that I previously mentioned.","Security lending fees were $22 million in the third quarter, down 3% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower spreads while the sequential quarter decline reflects the traditional impact of the international dividend season which resulted in wider spreads in the second quarter. Securities lending collateral was $121 billion at quarter end, up 16% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially.","Other fees in C&IS were $28 million in the third quarter, up 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects new business and investment risk in analytical services while the sequential quarter increase primarily reflects higher revenue for benefit payment services.","Moving on to our Wealth Management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $318 million in the third quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially reflecting higher equity markets in new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $220 billion at quarter end, up 4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially.","Recall that earlier in 2014 we transferred $7.6 billion in assets under management from wealth management to C&IS. Absent that transfer wealth management assets under management would have increased about 8% year-over-year. The sequential decline in wealth management assets under management was due primarily to lower non-U.S. equity markets. As I mentioned earlier the MSCI EAFE Index was down 6% in the quarter. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in wealth management totalled $17 million in the current, flat compared with last year and up $1 million compared to last quarter.","Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $256 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 1% compared to the second quarter. The increase in net interest income was driven by a larger balance sheet as client deposits averaged $86 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. These increased deposits were primarily invested on the asset side in Federal Reserve deposits and securities. Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin which at 1.05% in the third quarter was down 9 basis points year-over-year.","In the sequential comparison, higher average earning assets were partially offset by a 1 basis point decline in the net interest margin.","The yield on the securities portfolio increased 2 basis points sequentially primarily reflecting lower premium amortization in our mortgage back securities portfolio due to changes in prepayment speed assumptions versus the prior quarter, as well as the maturity of lower yielding floating rate agency securities.","Adjustments to premium amortization in the third quarter increased yield on the securities portfolio by approximately 5 basis points and the net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points compared to 7 basis point and 3 basis point increases respectively in the second quarter.","Loan balances averaged $30 billion in the third quarter, up 6% or $1.6 billion year-over-year with growth primarily in commercial and institutional and private client lending partially offset by a lower level of residential real estate loans. The yield on the loan portfolio decreased 6 basis points sequentially primarily due to lower yields of commercial loans.","Turning to Page 7 expenses were $775 million in the third quarter, up 5% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. When adjusted for last quarter\u2019s charges and write offs of $42 million expenses were up 1% sequentially. Compensation expense increased 7% year-over-year primarily reflecting staff growth, annual merit increases and the unfavourable impact of movements in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with about half of staff growth in the Asia Pacific region including our offices in India and our newest operational center in Manila. On a sequential basis, excluding the charges compensation expense was essentially and staff growth was less than 1%.","Employee benefit expense was 11% higher year-over-year as higher employee medical expense and payroll tax expense more than offset lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the second quarter charges, employee benefit expense increased primarily due to higher medical expense offset partially by lower payroll tax expense.","Outside services expenses were down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. When adjusted for the prior quarter\u2019s charges the year-over-year decline primarily reflects consulting and technical services expense.","Equipment and software expense was up 5% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. Excluding last quarter\u2019s software write off the sequential decline was 6%. Software amortization and computer depreciation were slower in the third quarter. Spending and support of our technology strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet regulatory and compliance requirements.","Other operating expense increased 2% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Both comparisons reflect higher charges associated with account servicing activities which can be uneven from quarter-to-quarter.","Turning to Page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve our expenses to fees, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from 131% in 2011 to 108% in the third quarter has been a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity from 8.6% to 10.1% across the same time period.","As announced in July, we have reorganized to allow our client facing groups to focus on profitable growth and our operations and technology functions to efficiently enable this growth. We also announced in July the elimination overtime of approximately 200 positions. The success of these actions along with sustainable improvements to our operating model which continue to accrue from driving performance are critical to our future financial performance. Our focus on profitable growth and productivity gains will allow the company to invest in future growth opportunities that will produce targeted return over time.","Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remain very strong with common equity tier 1 ratios of 12.7% and 12.8% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.3% and under the standardised approximately 10.9%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at both the corporation and bank is above 5% which exceeds the 3% requirement applicable to Northern Trust.","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the third quarter, Northern Trust issued $400 million in perpetual preferred stock at a dividend rate of 5.85%. At its regularly scheduled meeting yesterday, our board of directors declared the quarterly dividend on the preferred stock. Given the early August issuance the initial preferred dividend payment will cover five months and, therefore, equal $9.5 million in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock at a cost of $77 million bringing to 315 million our total share repurchase activity in the first nine months of the year.","Our 2014 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 273 million of common stock through March of 2015. With the final liquidity coverage rules having been issued in early September we believe Northern Trust is already above the 80% minimum required effective as of January 1, 2015 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective of January 1, 2017.","Let me close with a few thoughts on the positioning of Northern Trust. From a strategic perspective, the third quarter again demonstrated that we are competing successfully in our target markets. Noteworthy on that front was the on-boarding of Bridgewater Associates to our hedge fund servicing platform as well as recently announced deployments by Woodford Investment Management to provide a full suite of investment operations and outsourcing services and by five local government schemes in the United Kingdom to provide a range of global custody services.","Our four inaugural FlexShares Exchange Traded Funds reached the important three-year milestone in the third quarter. FlexShares account to $8.5 billion making it the fastest growing ETF family for each of the past two years delivering thoughtfully designed products that meet the targeted investment objectives of personal clients. In August, Northern Trust celebrated its 125th anniversary, a testament that we continue to provide exceptional service expertise and advice to clients around the world.","From a financial perspective we achieved strong growth of 11% in trusted investment fees and improved further the ratio of expenses to fees. Our return on equity was 10.1% in the quarter and we remain focused on consistently achieving returns in our target range. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Eric, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions).","And we'll take our first question from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon everyone. Hi. How are you? So first question I guess on the operating leverage. If we go back to Slide 8 that you guys illustrated considerable progress in terms of how you're management expenses relative to the trust and investment services fees. Just curious to think about, if you guys were to think about markets flat over the last 12 months, where would that 108 be? And I guess, more importantly, if the broader equity markets backdrop as a bit more choppy from here, should we still count on that ratio coming down over the next 12 months?","Biff Bowman","So I'm going to talk a little bit about. If you look at our assets under custody growth year-over-year, Alex, and -- I'm trying to guide here to the -- to this point is, about 60% of our growth in AUC year-over-year was driven by markets but 40% was driven by new business and other flows in that front. So we recognize the markets have a meaningful impact on that but that there is a meaningful piece of that that is moving up and the fees are moving up because of excellent new business growth in our businesses.","The other thing I would say is, while the market has impacts on certain of our services, certain of our fund administration services, our global fund services business are driven by transaction volumes as much as they are driven in the fees associated with those, as much as they are driven by assets under custody or market level appreciation. So I think the combination is the market certainly has an impact and is important to us. But hopefully, that gives you some clue as to the new business was a meaningful portion of that improvement as well.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got you. Yes. Sorry. I guess I was just trying to get you looking at the bit more importantly the operating leverage of that. And clearly, the expense growth should -- was below the growth in your servicing fees and management fees but that's partially because the servicing fees and management fees share point were growing due to market gains.","Biff Bowman","Yes.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","But I guess, are there leverage you could pull to continue to see the decline in the non-interest expense relative to your fees, if the markets don't go up from here?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So we remained vigilant around our expense management. And there are obviously, levels. I would say I'd refer you to the second quarter where I think you saw one of the levers that we were able and did a decision, we did take around our staff levels and the 200 person charge, if you will. The charge we took in the second quarter is an example of one of those levels. But there are many other levels and the management team here remains committed to driving through expense initiatives on that front. I would also, if I could real quickly add around our efficiency and productivity initiatives. We\u2019ve taken on board a lot of key projects, one of which would be -- I'll give one small example, if I could. We had multiple vendors providing us with pricing services, literally dozens. We consolidated those down into a few number pricing vendors and that drove a meaningful savings for the institution. We have lots of those types of initiatives ongoing.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Understand. Thank you for that. And my second question was just around the overall kind of franchise exposure to the euro. You guys clearly have some presence there and I'm just trying to better understand if the euro continues to weaken against the dollar. What does it mean from the net profitability perspective for Northern, is it a headwind or tailwind or fairly neutral given how revenues expenses should go?","Biff Bowman","So good question. If the dollar -- I want to put it in a couple of buckets, if I can here. Firstly, we got -- if I will say, balance sheet exposure. So money on our balance sheet that's in euros or client's money that's on our balance sheet in euros. We did like many of others in the financial industry on August 14, Bev, I believe.","Bev Fleming","October.","Biff Bowman","October. Excuse me, on October 14, we put in place a negative 20 basis point charge for the balance sheet, if you will, which was in-line with what the ECB had done earlier in September. So we pass on, if you will, some of the financial impacts from the balance sheet perspective.","The other part though to consider is, we have a substantial amount of our assets under custodies you might imagine that are in euros. A strengthening dollar doesn't help us on that regard as you would suspect. It's not the largest currency. Our largest currencies inside of our AUC would be the dollar first obviously and the second would be the sterling, but the euro is the third largest in our AUC and we have a substantial amount of assets, non-dollar denominated assets in our mix. So it will have some impact their on the AUC.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. But from a pre-tax dollar perspective, is it -- do the expenses kind of offset that or it's in that kind of headwind it goes to, to pre-tax income?","Biff Bowman","Sure.","Bev Fleming","And Alex, on the -- from the income statement perspective, we actually hedge the net. So we do have revenue impacts, we do have expense impacts from the dollar and we hedge the net. We have significant natural hedge, if you will, because we earn revenues in multiple currencies. We also pay expenses in multiple currencies, so we have somewhat of a natural hedge. But then, we hedge the difference to pre-tax. So the impact from a bottom-line perspective is actually very modest.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yeah. Got it. Yeah. That's what I was trying to get it. Thank you so much again.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Hi. If I can start with a question on the asset servicing business and I'm just trying to think of obviously, the Bridgewater was one of your largest mandates and E&A is somewhat of new type of arrangement for you. Bev, can you talk a little bit about how you view margins on those types of mandates versus your existing -- your current book of business in asset servicing and then the growth opportunities of that? In other words, as you are building that business, do you start out with lower margins with the hope of adding more clients to that particular platform?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So I'll tackle that in a couple ways here. So I think the first is in the case of Bridgewater, they take a variety of different services that we provide, which include as we described it sort of the shadow fund accounting process that we would do, and I would say a variety of other middle office type products and services. Each of those has a different type of basis point fee or margin associated with it that the market dictates. So the combination of that for any one client like that would be a blend of whatever those are. So in the case of -- in the case of Bridgewater, I would only say that they are profitable. And we continue to be pleased to have them on board and think we can leverage that platform for other clients.","I think the second part of your question is that the implementation and the expenses associated with that implementation we feel are highly leverageable to other clients in this space. And in fact, we've begun dialogues with many on a similar path around that. So we definitely believe that they are the investment, the capital investment is highly leverageable to other clients.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just to share on a sort of a go forward basis. We appreciate that obviously there is a long time range to this. But has the Bridgewater mandate -- and maybe in combination with Omnium acquisition dramatically changed your ability to tap that -- the alternative ends of the market to the extent that you think over the next two to three years you will be investing fairly heavily in growing that business versus the rest of your servicing business. And maybe just quickly, also relative to your -- touch on the investment in the wealth management business as it relates to for persons (inaudible)?","Biff Bowman","I\u2019m going to answer the first two. I may need a little help on the second part of your question around the well. But the -- I think the first part was, do we think this will enable us to win other business? And I would say the credibility that having the largest hedge fund as a client has absolutely helped us. But I would add to that that the strength of the Omnium platform now Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services, the actual technology what we have there has also added credibility for us to be able to talk across the market. So I would also highlight one thing. I think people think of it only in the alternative space where it would largely be used and we think only traditionally of asset managers. But there are a lot of client's interest in this that are sovereign wealth funds, large foundations and endowments who have large pools of alternative investments within their portfolios and the technology around this has been a very attractive entr\u00e9e into some of those businesses. So I think it has as boarder opportunity set than just asset managers. So that was the answer for the first part.","And then, you -- the second part around wealth management, I didn't quite pickup.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. That -- sorry, but I didn't ask (inaudible) really. What I was getting at with the wealth management side was, as you think about investing in the asset servicing business, how do you think -- I guess the question is, does that sort of distract you from investing more aggressively on the wealth management side or do you feel that your investment over the next two to three years in both of this businesses can remain fairly consistent with each other?","Biff Bowman","Sure. We absolutely believe that we have the ability to invest in both businesses and we've talked about the mega market strategies in the past and other strategies here. So we absolutely think we can invest in both. Right now, we have to be disciplined about that, but we absolutely believe we can. And I would also highlight that some of these capabilities that we talked about in GFS translate into the very high-end of our wealth business setting with the global family office. So the ability to deal with complex alternative investments as you might suspect for families of -- at the highest end of our network spectrum that capability is very attractive there. So I see a lot of synergy and leverage, if I can in that investment across multiple businesses.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Hi Biff, how are you? Just a follow-up on expenses, the 200 FTE savings, you had talked about this little last quarter. But can you help us understand how much of that benefit? I think it was $25 million, was in this quarter's run rate and how you expected to lead in over time?","Biff Bowman","Yes.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Or when did you expected to get to a run rate?","Biff Bowman","Yes. I would say this. We are on track to achieve the $25 million goal amount in the second quarter. I think Mike said last quarter that the savings would be modest in 2014, which really is the majority in the fourth quarter. And then, we'll see a ramp in 2015. I think we expect to achieve about 80% to 90% of that $25 million by year end 2015. I can tell you that we've begun that process in Q3 of moving through the 200, so -- but it will be a very, very modest impact in 2014. But you should expect to see about 80% to 90% of that $25 million by year-end 2015. And we'll achieve the full run rate entering 2016.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And then, if I could ask you to extend a little bit more just on the -- into workings of the FX business. And obviously, I heard your points about volatility being flat. But can you just help us understand may be how the quarter progressed? I think you did say higher volumes but obviously, volatility was only average, flat on average and third quarter is typically a little seasonally soft. But I think relative to expectations and relative to the industry proxy it would have seen like the business should have done a little bit better. So was it mix, was it electronics? May be just you can flush that out for us, it would be great. Thank you."," ","Biff Bowman","Okay. Thank you. So I will say this, the -- as a sequential quarter we were down, while I would say volatility was probably flatter. The first thing we think about in that is this, we look at our actual the notional amount traded to our clients and I don't know what others clients looks like, but we can look at our clients and look at the notional amount traded through our clients. And that was down modestly for us, so that's one factor and we do think about that. It depends on if our clients were trading in emerging market currencies, which were down and the volatility was lower there than it wasn't some other. So there is a couple factors that can help drive that number a little bit lower than what we would have seen given the volatility in that space. So I think that's one area you touched on I would say this. We continue to invest in this business with our client guidance around the types of ecommerce and needs that they have to enter this market and it\u2019s a meaningful commitment in both talent and capital to continue to improve and to continue to grow this source of revenue very important source of revenue for the bank.","So I think it\u2019s a combination of those things, others may have if you look back, we looked back 22 quarters just as a fact and if you look versus peers our peers we take turns having better FX performance in any given quarter. So I think it has to do somewhat with our client mix and their action they took in any given quarter. And the third thing I would add is you are right there is some seasonality traditionally for us we see about a 12% to 15% decline sequentially which was what we saw this quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Hi I had a two part question on capital. So how are you thinking about a capital structure today? Do you intend to issue more preferred and build up to that 1.5% of RWA? And the second part is how are you thinking about capital buffers to require minimum specifically I was interested on some color around if Tarullo succeeds in forcing your larger peers to hold higher capital cushions, are you looking to match them or really use that as a advantage and run at lower levels?","Biff Bowman","Let me take the second part of that question first if I can so I don\u2019t, Bev write down the first part so I don\u2019t forget it, thank you. But on the capital buffers issues we currently today with guidance from our board and all of our governance committees place a premium on making sure we\u2019re well buffered if I can say that with our capital position and you can see that through our capital ratios as we describe.","If, in our business if you think about that we\u2019re a gatherer of assets, we need to look somewhat similar to our closest peers particularly in the corporate intuitional side but also in the wealth side in terms of safety and soundness and stability. And so that probably means that our ratios need mere or be as close to theirs that is reasonably prudent for us as a financial institution. So you\u2019re right we may not be governed at the same level as a GSIP but we do believe that we may very well have to act and have buffers and others in place similar to that so that we have a competitive at least a quality when we go to the market. That is though, Ashley, if I can say this that is still playing out a little bit as we look at this.","A good example might be around supplementary leverage ratio for instance that you cite and then whether that's not a buffer but there is a different standard for banks of different sizes. So we continue to play with that that\u2019s probably a long way around for we continue to look at this but we think we've probably largely have to stay in line with our peers.","And the first part of the question was around our capital structure I believe and if we would contemplate more on the preferred side. So the answer is right. Today, your question is right in the sense of we did the $400 million in August it gave us an opportunity to add to our tier one capital where we had faced in approach we would have gone to zero the trust preferred phase out and so we effectively had none. So we were effectively covering what I will call the first two levels of our capital ratios with all common, that's a fairly expensive solution.","I think we will continue to look at that mix on a regular basis to understand if there isn\u2019t more opportunity in the trust preferred to help as you say get to that 1.5% additional cushion over the common equity tier one ratio. I think we got a pretty good thought process around that now from our capital planning and we\u2019ll continue to look at that.","Operator","The next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi how are you there? So a couple of questions one, just on the last subject I mean is there a I would think there should be an opportunity to reduce common as a percentage of total RWA through this process with buybacks over time is that a fair assumption?","Biff Bowman","Yes I think the \u2013 we\u2019re going to perceive it with our capital plan if I can, our capital plan actions that you\u2019ve seen and I would like this it\u2019s our intend to continue to take the actions that we described in our capital plan and you are well aware of it over time.","In terms of the reducing common or the shares I think you\u2019re asking if the share is outstanding issues is what, is that you\u2019re trying to talk about in the capital fact --","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Yes, right. With common as a percentage of RWA, the contribution of common to RWA shrink over time as you are accelerating buybacks given the pref, I think because we all kind of came to this with you have enough cushion over the minimum, why do you need pref, so the pref makes sense if you are able to reduce the common.","Biff Bowman","Yes, so again I refer back to the capital plan and we think that, yes, we think executing on or our intent to execute on the capital plan should help us with that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay, got it. Just wanted to clarify. And then secondly, just on the fact that you need to charge clients for the 20 basis points in the euro zone given what the ECB is charging you to leave cash with the ECB, just trying to understand what kind of behavior activity you\u2019ve seeing there? I would think it would mean that you have clients moving if they could from euros into other currencies. I\u2019m wondering what else they could potentially do to offset that? Could they bring you more business to offset incremental fees or it\u2019s more of a one size fits all everybody gets a 20 bps if you\u2019re leaving euros with you?","Biff Bowman","Yes, so good question so, I would say we are working with our clients to look at what their alternatives are in that space because as you might imagine some care about that rate. So there are money funds, there are suite vehicles, there are other services and capabilities where that we could help guide them some of those are our products, some of those are products elsewhere in the market but we are working with them. To-date, we have seen a I think \u2013 I\u2019d say relatively modest decline but in the 15% to 20% range in just our euro based deposit. It\u2019s not a large part of our deposit base, its sub 10% of our deposits are in euro, our total on our foreign office but our total deposit so it\u2019s not a big but we've seen a modest run off in most, we think is really there to support business activities. And so it\u2019s there and its sticky.","Operator","The next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Hey how are you doing, Biff? Quick one on expenses. And it\u2019s somewhat of a follow-up to what we've heard before. So is there any way you could give some color or clarity on whether or not we saw some uplift this quarter from expenses that might prove transient, specifically elevated regulatory, expenses and maybe the amortization from on-boarding expenses on Bridgewater that might have been capitalized?","Biff Bowman","So let me walk up through what potentially is transient I will just say nothing else moves around. So I got to start with we have what we refer to as cost of servicing clients. That number is, it moves around; it was very modest in the first and second quarters of this year. It was back to what I would say a more normalized level over a long period of time but that is a number that can move quite meaningfully in any given quarter.","I would say our healthcare expense in this quarter as it relates to healthcare claims we looked back at about three years worth quarterly claims history was at a high. We don\u2019t have an ability to project if that will continue or if that was just we had a tough quarter from a healthcare claim perspective that was a fairly a meaty number.","As it relates to the regulatory part of your question, I would say this. The rate of growth of our regulatory expenses has slowed. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the overall regulatory expenses have grown -- slowed excuse me or gone down from the levels you\u2019ve seen.","So the pace of growth has slowed but there is still some growth in that and there are round things like we\u2019re in our second round of the CCAR for Northern Trust and there is work we have to do around that there is resolution planning etcetera that we have to deal with on that. So there are some expenses in there that I would consider volatile from a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Great. I guess no impact from increased amortization on on-boarding expenses as far as Bridgewater goes?","Biff Bowman","There was some in the quarter. I would say the others have a chance to be at least that volatile is not more in terms of that. That number probably won\u2019t be as volatile as well over time because we know what the amortization is so and it\u2019s the other side of it you can move in bigger increments generally than that number would.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Yes, I guess I was just saying it wouldn\u2019t volatile versus last quarter when it was...","Biff Bowman","Yes, it would have been volatile versus that, I would have been more than the quarter before.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","All right, fair enough. Cool. And then for my second one, given some of the pressure that large global competitors are under from a capital perspective, is it your sense that the certain global custody assets come up for sale? And if they do, is that something that Northern Trust would be interested in expanding on towards that side of the business, on the institutional and trust side as opposed to the wealth management side is there, do you guys have a preference as far as that goes?","Biff Bowman","So I would say this around any acquisition. I would describe this is opportunistic and if that opportunity provides us with a geography or a product or a capability or a technology that we don\u2019t have we\u2019re opportunistic in that. We have not traditionally just bought businesses to ramp up scale in a market where we already have scale. I won\u2019t put an absolute on that but that has generally not in the philosophy firm, it has been to address one of those first sort of four factors that I talked about.","Operator","The next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to look at the other fees. You had talked about lower security commissions as well as currency related hedging. The number dropped to kind of the low level it has been at over the last year. I was curious what kind of noise or what would be expected in there?","Biff Bowman","Yes, so I\u2019ll address one on the securities commission and then I may let Bev take the foreign exchange currency part. One example would be what we would recall banking referral fees but our bankers well often because we\u2019re not an investment bank we\u2019ll partner with some other investment banks and we refer we\u2019re in a credit we refer deals to them to do some of the underwriting. We get referral fees for that. They were significantly down quarter-over-quarter.","And the second is in our wealth business a lot of the times we will actually look at interest rate swaps and talk to our clients about interest rate swap options that they may have in their portfolios. The volumes in that were down substantially from Q2 to Q3. So those two items I\u2019d say have some volatility to them in any given quarter, it depends on how many, how much the deal flows in those two quarters that drove those two, and Bev I\u2019ll...","Bev Fleming","Sure. Marty I think your other question has to do with the decline with the decline and other operating income, is that correct?","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","That\u2019s right, with the currency-related hedging, they talk about the hedging and they are in the press release.","Bev Fleming","Yes, there were actually three different drivers to that particular figure. I mean first of all we did have leasing income lower in the quarter we did have a small lease gain recorded in the second quarter, and so when you do that quarter-on-quarter comparison it has an impact. We did see lower service charges related to some aspects of our banking business credit related service charges like commercial loan fees, letter of credit fees, commitment fees and like so that was down as well.","And then the third one would be what you\u2019re pointing out which was one of the drivers listed which would be currency related hedging activity. As I mentioned earlier we do net hedges on our income statement and there was a modest impact from the asset was a drag on this particular line item. We also hedged the balance sheet back to functional currencies and that had a modest drag as well. So we really had kind of three or four different items that together contributed to that sequential quarter decline.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","And then my follow-up question in relation to that is, not to be specific but just in general, it seems like the core underlying trust custody asset management fees and expenses all moved in the right direction. There did seem to be several unusual expenses, other kind of areas and ancillary fees that were weaker than really kind of maybe took away a penny or two this quarter relative to what you might've expected.","Biff Bowman","Yes, our view I think our view would be aligned with that the core underlying business performed well and the core trust fees and the core expense management was strong and that some of the ancillary or other forms of income had some volatility in the quarter and we feel pretty good about the core underlying performance of the business. We feel very good about that.","Operator","And the next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi, first just a clarification on the preferred stock. So I guess what we are trying to figure out, should we be lowering our numbers for the $0.10 hit to the new preferred stock, or should we assume that gets offset with buybacks?","Bev Fleming","Well you definitely should be incorporating again to your fourth quarter model the preferred stock dividend which was declared by our board yesterday and I would repeat what Biff said in his prepared remarks that this quarter will be -- fourth quarter will be a little bit unusual and that we would have five months instead of the normal three. The figure that's provided was $9.5 million in the fourth quarter.","With respect to repurchases of common we\u2019re continuing to proceed under the capital plan that was not objected to by the fed so you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s remaining and we will continue to action on that for the next two quarters.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right, great. Separately, Biff since this is your first public forum and you are new as CFO, can you talk about conceptually how you might want to change the balance, if at all between the customers, the employees and the shareholders? In other words, when you think about allocating expenses and resources among those three groups, do you think one needs to be favored a little bit more than it\u2019s been in the past? And I guess the customers, you guys win all sorts of awards especially for the private bank, employees this quarter you said the comp is up 8% year-over-year and then shareholders a great 10-year record but lousy five year record. So, how do you think about the balance among those kind of three constituencies?","Biff Bowman","Thanks, Mike. Well I think they\u2019re all very important how is that is that a good hedge as the new CFO. I think they\u2019re all vital but I will say this I would that the firm not this isn\u2019t just me this is the firm it\u2019s focused on a key word here is profitable growth. So we do know that we need to be profitable and grow, and not just grow. And so the focus on profitable growth the focus and rigour around the return on equity range that we've given to you and to the shareholders of 10 to 15. We want to continue to move into that range on a regular basis.","I believe this is our second quarter in a row and that so there is no decoration of victory and we need to continue to move. Higher in to that range with the thing so we can control and if we get external help it will help lever it other way up. But to your point I would say this all three of those matter a lot and in my role that focus on the shareholder is paramount to my day to day job and its where my focus and attention is on a regular basis right now.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take the next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been asked, but one that we haven\u2019t discussed is can you talk about the new business wins in the pipeline, how you are seeing that develop and if there\u2019s been any kind of improvement or is it still strong? Just some color would be great whether it\u2019s across wealth management or institutional?","Biff Bowman","Sure. So I can say really across all of our businesses across all of our geographies and across all of our products it was a very successful third quarter. I\u2019ll start with the C&IS business if I could. I think they had one of the if not their very best quarters; I'm looking at that if I'm allowed to say that, but I think that they had one of their very best quarters that we have seen from a new business and probably as important is that is the strength of the pipeline behind it. As you might imagine that pipeline is really a cross product it\u2019s not just our global fund services business servicing asset managers. Its broad based with sovereign wealth fund, its broad based with foundations endowments, healthcare, corporate institution and pensions and its very broad based across geographies probably about as diversified as I\u2019ve seen it from a geographical perspective. So I think that's the strength.","Similarly in the wealth management space another strong new business quarter I think that that\u2019s borne out in the fees, in the fee growth that you\u2019ve seen particular success in our west region this year. I know we published in our regional reports. They continue to have good momentum but it was really good across all geographies. So we feel really pretty positive on the new business momentum and I would highlight here perhaps if I could briefly with the leadership changes that we've just gone through now that momentum is being amped up by each of the new business unit presidents and they\u2019re as whether out meeting with their clients and helping with the pipeline and developing the pipeline I believe. Steve Fradkin is out today in at North East helping them continue to build the product line there.","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Well just maybe a follow-up on the institutional side. It seems like you have had a bit of an uptick in the growth rate just trying to get it\u2019s pretty competitive. What do you think has been driving your uptick in the pipeline? And I think when we look at some of your peers it has been (technical difficulty)","Biff Bowman","I would answer that by saying I think there is a couple of key factors I think one is we've got some technological advantage particularly in the global fund services space. We got some technological advantage that we\u2019re trying to lever and use at this point and as I think I described earlier its leverageable beyond just asset managers; it resonates with anybody who has large alternative asset portfolios in their mix. So I think that that is one of the prime factors that we have.","And I just think our product quality continues to be strong and its being well received in the market. So I think but there is some technological strength right now for us particularly in the space I described around the Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services, etc.","The other thing is we have some geographies where we've had some success we've had tremendous growth rate in Australia. So our product and reputation and our quality there I think is allowing us to pick up some meaningful market share it\u2019s not just there but it\u2019s one example of a meaningful market move for us.","Operator","And the final question today is from Jeffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Jeffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hello there. On the money market fee waivers, how do you think about the trajectory of recapturing those, if rates eventually start to move up?","Biff Bowman","Yes. Thanks Jeffery. So I think we have said, (inaudible) I go up with -- I think we've said that as a 50 basis point move, all things being equal, that we would recapture a meaningful portion if not all of those fee waivers. But I want to put a little bit more color to that. That assumes that we are in the exact same competitive environment and that coming out of this low of an interest rate environment over this length of period of time, I would be hesitant to say that I know what the competitive environment for that will look like. So our partners in Northern Trust Asset Management are clearly looking on a regular basis to understand what the impacts will need to be on what they charge on those funds over time and they will consistently look at that end. They may look at different fee structures to be competitive coming out of a very, very low rate environment. That could have an impact on our fee waivers. And as we get more color on that over time, we'll try to give that color to you. But at this point in time, we do think there probably will be some competitive pressures to be candid, but we still think we should cover meaningful portion of those fees with a 50 basis point rise.","Jeffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","When you talk about competitive pressures what you\u2019re getting out there is any chance of the competition there will go into keep the fee waiver in place little bit longer (inaudible) slowly in order to try to capture more volume, is that (inaudible) up?","Biff Bowman","Yes. I think what we're -- like I said, coming out of a low and long environment and I don't know how low and long it will remain. But I think everyone has gotten used to very low fees or waived fees in their funds and we're just not sure how the markets will react from pricing their own funds. That being said, you also have money market reform in place, which could help firms think about their pricing on those models. So I think there is a whole confluence of events quite frankly that could have the revisitation of pricing in that space.","And the last thing you said, which I think is also right is, there could be pricing in the marketplace to gather assets. People could want to go because you may have certain firms and competitors that decide not to be in the space after reform and others may aggressively price whereas to gather assets in the cash. So the confluence of those three I think could actually lead to the need to look at the pricing in the funds for all competitors. But I'm not sure how that will play out to be candid.","Operator","This concludes today's question and answer session. Ms. Fleming, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Bev Fleming","Thank you, Eric, and thank you to everybody who joined us today.

Let me turn the call over to Michael O'Grady.","Michael O'Grady","Good morning, everyone. And let me join Bev and welcome you to Northern Trust second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, I will review our result for the quarter, after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your question.","Starting on page two. This morning we reported second quarter net income of $182 million and earnings per share of $0.75. Our reported return on equity was 9.2% in the quarter. As outlined in our earnings press release issued this morning, we remain focused on sustainably improving our financial performance and return.","To that end, we recorded charges and write-offs in the second quarter of $42 million. Excluding these items, our earnings per share would have been $0.87 and our return on equity would have been 10.6%. I will discuss the charges in more detail later in today\u2019s call.","Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mix in the second quarter, a theme which has been ongoing for some time. Equity and bond markets were higher at the end of the second quarter both year-over-year and sequentially.","In the U.S., the S&P 500 was up 22% and 5% versus last year and last quarter, respectively. International equity as measured by the EAFE Index were up 15% and 2%, respectively.","With market trending up as the quarter progressed, average daily market were also higher, although lag the end of period comparison by about 4 percentage points year-over-year and 1 percentage point, sequentially. In bond market, the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index was up 1% both year-over-year and sequential.","Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $6 trillion, up 20% over last year and assets under management ended at $924 billion, up 15%. On a sequential basis, client custody and managed assets were up 4% and 1%, respectively.","Currency market had multiple impacts this quarter. Currency volatility, which influences foreign exchange trading income was lower in the second quarter, having decreased each month in 2014 to multiyear lows and is even lower in July.","Currency rate which influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar increased revenue and expense by about 1 percentage point each due in particular to the strengthening of the British pound during the second quarter.","Short-term interest rate remained at very low levels and continued to pressure our net interest margin and result in fee waivers on our money market mutual fund. Three months LIBOR averaged 23 basis points, down 5 basis points year-over-year and down 1 basis point sequentially. The Fed fund effective rate at 9 basis points was down 3 basis points year-over-year but up 2 basis points sequentially.","Average overnight repo was 8 basis points in the second quarter, down 3 basis points year-over-year but up 3 basis points sequentially. With those comments providing context on the environment, let\u2019s move to page three and discuss the financial highlights for the second quarter.","Starting with the year-over-year comparison, revenues were up 6% and expenses were up 11%. Revenue growth was the result of higher trust investment and other servicing fees and net interest income.","Expense growth reflects the $42 million in charges and write-offs. Excluding those items, expenses rose 5% due to increases in compensation and benefit, outside services and equipment and software.","We had no loan loss provision in the quarter as credit quality continued to improve. Reported net income was 5% lower year-over-year. Excluding the charges and write-offs, net income was 10% higher year-over-year.","Compared to last quarter revenues were up 4%, primarily driven by higher trust, investment and other servicing fee. Expenses excluding the charges and write-offs were essentially flat sequentially as higher compensation and equipment and software expenses were offset by lower business promotion and occupancy expense.","Reported net income was essentially flat from the prior quarter, adjusted for the charges and write-offs, net income increased 16%, sequentially. Earning per share was $0.75 and our return on equity was 9.2%. Adjusted for the charges and write-offs earnings per share was $0.87 and our return on equity was 10.6%.","Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page four. Second quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were approximately $1.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues were $707 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially.","Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 9% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially, while fees in our wealth management business grew 6% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially.","Higher equity markets and new business were both drivers of growth, with higher money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offsetting in the year-over-year comparison. Fee waivers were approximately $31 million in the second quarter, an increase of $8 million over last year but $2 million lower sequentially.","The higher waivers on a year-over-year basis were primarily due to the gross yield of the funds declining by approximately 5 basis points on average from the prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, yields increased 1 basis point.","Overnight repo rates, a key driver of money market mutual fund yields were down 3 basis points year-over-year and up 3 basis points, sequentially. I\u2019ll go in a further detail on trust fees shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was $53 million in the second quarter, down 26% year-over-year, but up 5% sequentially. Currency volatility was lower in the second quarter, having decreased each month in 2014 to multiyear lows, client trading volume were lower year-over-year, yet higher sequentially.","Other non-interest income was $75 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially, primarily reflecting gains from currency related hedging activity. The sequential quarter increase was also due to higher security commissions and trading income, and then other than temporary impairment item booked in the first quarter.","Net interest income, which I will also discuss in more detail later was $253 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially.","With that backdrop, let\u2019s look at the components of fee revenues on page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $395 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially.","Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $261 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and up 4%, sequentially, while assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.5 trillion at quarter end, up 21% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially.","Growth in fees and assets primarily reflect favorable market condition, including higher equity and bond market, and favorable movements in foreign currency rate, as well as new business. Fees were also impacted in the sequential quarter comparison by higher sub-custodian recoveries.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $78 million in the second quarter were up 5% year-over-year and up 4%, sequentially. Assets under management for C&IS client were $702 billion, up 17% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially.","The year-over-year increase in C&IS assets under management was due to higher equity and fixed income market and new business, as well as higher securities lending collateral. In the sequential quarter comparison, higher equity and fixed income market was partially offset by lower cash balances.","C&IS investment management fee growth was dampen on a year-over-year basis by higher waivers on institutional money market mutual fund. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equals $59 in the second quarter, $5 million higher year-over-year, primarily reflecting the lower gross yield achieved in the underlying funds that I previously mentioned.","Securities lending fees were $30 million in the second quarter, down 4% year-over-year and up 32%, sequentially. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflect lower spread, while the sequential quarter increase reflect the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spread.","Other fees in C&IS were $27 million in the second quarter, up 7% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the new business in investment risk and analytical services. The sequential quarter decline primarily reflects seasonally lower revenue from benefit payment services.","Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $312 million in the second quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 4%, sequentially. And assets under management for wealth management clients were $223 billion at quarter end, up 10% year-over-year and up 3%, sequentially.","The increase in wealth management fees due to higher assets under management was partially offset in the year-over-year comparison by higher waived fees in money market mutual funds. Fee waivers in wealth management totaled $60 million in the current quarter, compared to $30 million in the second quarter of last year and $80 in the first quarter.","Moving to page six, net interest income was $253 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and down slightly compared to the first quarter. The year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by our larger balance sheet as client interest-bearing deposit averaged $66 billion in the quarter, up approximately $10 billion or 18% year-over-year.","These increase deposits compared with a year ago were primarily invested on the asset side in Federal Reserve deposits 25 basis points. Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin, which at 1.06% in the second quarter was down 4 basis points year-over-year.","In the sequential comparison higher average earning assets was offset by a 6 basis points decline in the net interest margin. The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 16 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio due to factor prepayment speed option.","Adjustments to premium amortization in the second quarter decreased the yield on the securities portfolio by approximately 7 basis points and the net interest margin by approximately 3 basis points, compared to 4 and 1 basis point increases, respectively in the first quarter.","Average loan balances were approximately $1 billion higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter with growth coming primarily from commercial and institutional, private client and commercial real estate. The yield on the loan portfolio decreased 6 basis points sequentially, primarily due to yield on commercial loans and day count.","Turning to page 7, reported expenses were $811 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and up 6%, sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded charges and write-offs in the second quarter of $42 million, of that total $28.5 million relates to severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 200 positions.","As outlined in our earnings press release $25.5 million of that charge appears in the compensation line of our income statement, $1.9 million in the employee benefit expense and $1.1 million in outside services expense. Another $4.3 million relates to the ongoing realignment of our real estate portfolio and appears in occupancy expense.","In addition, we recorded $9.5 million in software write-offs in the second quarter. Our actions taken this quarter, reflect the continued focus on improving profitability and returns and specifically, we expect the charges to produce annual ongoing saving of approximately $25 million once fully implement.","Turning to page 8, expenses excluding the charges and write-offs were $769 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Expense growth is primarily driven by a combination of the cost and investment to support the growth of the business along with certain expenses that can vary by quarter. Expense growth was higher in C&IS where we experienced faster fee growth and lowering wealth management, which maintained attractive margins.","Compensation expense excluding the charges increased 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, annual merit increases and the unfavorable impact of movements in currency rate.","Staff levels increased 4% year-over-year, with about half of staff growth supporting the growth of global fund services in C&IS, the business which is experiencing above average growth and in which we are investing for future growth across traditional, hedge and other fund structures.","The majority of the remainder staff growth was in our operations, technology and risk management group. On a sequential basis, excluding the charges, compensation expense increased 1%, primarily driven by annual merit increases. Staff growth was less than 2% sequentially.","Employee benefit expense excluding the charges was 4% higher year-over-year as higher employee medical expense and payroll tax expense more than offset lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense decreased slightly excluding charges, as higher medical expense was offset by lower pension expense.","Outside services expenses, excluding the charges increased 5% year-over-year and decreased 1%, sequentially. Higher volume driven sub-custodian and higher legal expense drove the year-over-year increase, but lower technical services expense was partially offset by seasonally higher sub-custodian expense in the sequential quarter.","Equipment and software expense excluding the write-offs was up 16% year-over-year and up 5%, sequentially. Spending in support of our technology strategy continues as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet regulatory and compliance requirements. Occupancy expense excluding the charges was down 1% versus the prior year and 3%, sequentially.","Other operating expense decreased 7% year-over-year and decreased 11%, sequentially. Both comparisons reflect lower charges associated with account servicing activities, which can be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. The sequential quarter comparison also reflects lower business promotion and marketing costs associated with the Northern Trust open out in the first quarter.","Turning to page nine, we continue to be focused on improving profitability and return. As Rick will discuss later, we are reorganizing to allow our client facing group to focus on growth and our operations and technology functions to efficiently enable this growth.","This structure along with the actions announced today will create the opportunity for future productivity gain and the expected cost savings rollout that company to simultaneously increase profitability and invest in future growth opportunity that we expect will produce targeted returns over time.","Our success in achieving our overall productivity goals can best be measured by our return on equity and pretax margin is a significant contributor. We track both closely. However given the impact of macro environmental factors can have on pretax margin, we also closely track the ratio of expenses to fees. Although by no means immune to external factors, we believe it's a useful metric to gauge our progress.","As Page 9 demonstrates, in 2011 when our return on equity was 8.6%, our pretax margin was 24.2% and the expenses to fees ratio was 131%. Since then, we made progress in improving our pretax margins to 29.4% in the second quarter due in large part reducing the ratio of expenses to fees to 109%, both adjusted for this quarter\u2019s charges and write-offs.","Capital is outlined on Page 10. As Northern Trust exited parallel runs for the calculation of Basel III advance risk-weighted asset, we are required to report our ratios on both in advance and standardized basis. The ratios calculated on a transition basis to both advanced and standardized, remains very strong with common equity tier 1 and tier 1 capital ratios of 12.7% and 12.9%, respectively.","Based on interpretation in the final Basel III rules released by the Federal Reserve on a fully phased-in basis, our common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would be approximately 11.1% and under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.3%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer.","The supplementary leverage ratio at both the corporation and bank are above 5%, which exceeds requirement applicable to Northern Trust. As Northern Trust progresses through the fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our model and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $75 million, bringing to 238 million of total share repurchase activity in the first half of the year. Our 2014 capital plan provides for repurchase of up to an additional 350 million in common stock through March of 2015.","In closing, we remain focused on growing and steadily improving profitability in order to drive returns into our target range. Year-to-date fees have grown 8%, revenues have grown 6% and excluding charges and write-offs, expenses have grown 5%. Our pretax margin improved to 28% and our return on equity was 9.9%.","With that, let me turn the call over to Rick.","Rick Waddell","Thank you Mike and let me extend my thanks to everyone listening to Northern Trust earnings conference call today. We appreciate your interest and continued support. Yesterday, we announced several leadership changes that will become effective on September 1st.","These changes have two key objectives, first, to sharpen our focus on profitable growth and second, to further develop our leaders by exposing them to different roles. Jana Schreuder will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer with operations, technology and enterprise change reporting to her. Jana and her teams will be focused on enabling accelerated growth by making Northern Trust more efficient and nimble.","Bill Morrison, our President since 2011, will continue to lead our wealth management, asset management and corporate and institutional services businesses as well as our corporate marketing and strategy efforts. We are very excited about the strategic and competitive positioning of Northern Trust across the markets and segments we serve.","Bill and the leaders reporting to him will be focused on maximizing our strong positioning and significant marketplace opportunities to accelerate growth. The leverage and further develop our leaders, Steve Fradkin will become Head of Wealth Management and replace Mike O'Grady will become Head of Corporate and Institutional Services.","Biff Bowman formally was Head of C&IS in both North America and in EMEA and most recently Head of our Human Resources Group will become Chief Financial Officer. These changes are a testament to the deep end -- to the depth and breadth of our leadership team at Northern Trust and will further our efforts to accelerate profitable growth.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust second quarter earnings conference call today. Mike and I would be happy to answer your questions. Joshua, would you please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. And Mike, congrats on the new role and new responsibilities. First question, I guess, around the expense program that I guess, you guys announced. I just want to make sure that I got the numbers right. So the savings that you expect to get are about $25 million on an annualized run rate basis. Do you guys think of that as a gross number or net number meaning that do you think that actually as an expense reduction, or just a way for you guys to reinvest in other areas of the firm?","Michael O'Grady","Two parts to that, Alex. The first part will be that we think about that number as a net number. So we will be reducing compensation related to the positions that we talked about, which is in excess of the $25 million. However, there are certain areas that we're reorganizing where we\u2019ll need to reinvest in people to take on some of those responsibilities. So that\u2019s a net number if you will.","More broadly speaking, as we've been doing with driving performance, all of the savings that we generate and pretax benefit that we generate from the various initiatives are used first to improve our profitability but then also to allow us to continue to invest in the business. So even with the over $250 million, if you recall that we generated on a run rate basis through 2013, a portion of that was redeployed back into growing the business and improving technology as well.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks. And then my follow-up question was around trends in foreign exchange during the quarter. As you pointed out, I mean, we think we\u2019ve all observed pain throughout the course of quarter volatility been quite well and volumes across many asset classes been low as well. So a little surprise to see, I guess, sequential growth in expense -- sorry in FX trading for you guys. And I know you spend some time trying to develop some new capabilities. So do you think it\u2019s more of a function of you getting new business from clients that just haven\u2019t traded with you in the past or something else that\u2019s driving the sequential increase in those revenues?","Michael O'Grady","Alex, it is a combination of factors, certainly, the broader market volatility level. Those certainly impact the broader market volume. And then more specifically as you know most of our activity is with our custody clients and those custody clients may or may not have consistent transaction and volume activity that the rest of the market does. The dynamic that we saw in the second quarter is that our client base, if you will, was more active. And so the volumes that we saw through our custody clients were higher on a sequential basis in contrast to market volumes overall which were lower. So that\u2019s one.","Two, as you mentioned, we have had a number of initiatives in the foreign exchange area particularly looking to transact with the broader group of clients and more third party FX that we call the non-custody clients. As I mentioned in previous calls, we've begun to see the benefit of that. I would say that we\u2019re seeing much more volume related to that activity and more recently, including in this quarter we\u2019ve seen the benefit of increased revenue from that as well. But it\u2019s still early days in the financial impact from that.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Within the wealth management divisions, the eastern region saw great growth this quarter. Is this really a function of New York gaining traction? And then if you step away and from a high level, how would you categorize the revenue potential here oh here both here and in Houston, what innings are we in?","Michael O'Grady","Sure. So the growth of the wealth management business has continued to be relatively broad based within the U.S. and across all three regions. And from quarter to quarter, as you would expect one region may do better than another. And interestingly where we\u2019ve even seen the central region for example, which as you would expect we have higher market shares if you will. It continued to grow at a nice rate.","At the same, we\u2019ve talked about increasing the investments that we make into certain markets where we have lower penetration or market share. And we\u2019re in the early innings of those strategies, if you will. You mentioned that couple of the markets, Ashley, there is certainly in the Texas market more broadly and Houston specifically. We\u2019re looking to expand the business more quickly but I would say that that\u2019s still in the early stages of that. And likewise in New York which clearly is the largest marketplace, as you\u2019ve identified, we\u2019ve had nice success but I would say it\u2019s still very early relative to the strategy that we have there.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then on other expenses, this is the second quarter in a row where numbers look good. And do you feel that you\u2019re in a spot where you somehow structurally lower these account servicing charges to process improvement because it feels like you are run rating a fair bit below last year's levels. Any color there would be appreciated?","Michael O'Grady","Sure. In the other categories, as you highlighted, there are a number of different items that fall into that category. And they can vary by quarter from quarter to quarter. We have had, I would say, very good experience in the last two quarters with regard to charges related to client activities there. That\u2019s not something that we\u2019re able to predict going forward. There's no question that we are focused on not only serving our clients very well but minimizing any type of errors that we may have that require financial renumeration that you would see there. But all the same, I can't by any means say that we can expect that we\u2019ll see these low levels going forward.","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","All right. Thanks for taking my questions.","Michael O'Grady","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Hi. Good afternoon. Good question on the timing of these savings. How should we think about that growing into results. Can you give us a sense about how these are going to phase-in?","Michael O'Grady","Some of the actions that we talked about today, we\u2019ve already begun to take. And so there will be some impact from that in the third quarter. But it will be very small. And even in the fourth quarter, we would expect the run rate to be very low as we begin to work through the plans that are related to the charges. For 2015, we would expect to see the majority of the $25 million that we talked about and beyond that 2016, we would be fully implemented.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. And then and so with the majority, we\u2019re talking about 20 of the 25 there by the time we get through and as you go through 15, would it continue to phase-in over the year. Is there any sort of additional sense you can give on, on that?","Michael O'Grady","Sure. It will phase-in over the year. Because the activities here are not in one particular area of the bank but across the company where we think we have opportunities to reorganize and become more efficient and how we execute in those areas. And so the implementation of that, takes time because the timelines are different for each of those areas. So the actual activities themselves will roll out over the next few quarters and as a result, the savings will phase in along with those.","And when I say majority, it\u2019s certainly over half, well over half but beyond what the amount is. There is not a specific number that I would get.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. That helps. Thanks. And then I guess question on capital. Can you -- do you, is it your sense that wealth management clients believe the capital strengths is an important differentiator for you. I\u2019m just trying to sort of get my head around why not return more capital, get closer to your regulatory capital minimums. Is it that you feel as though your compared with maybe some of the other trust banks and those firms are held to a higher standard. Therefore you have to be up at that level as well. Just can you maybe walk us through if there's a competitive factor coming in to play here?","Michael O'Grady","Sure. Capital strength is critical to our business and that through both with wealth management as well as our corporate institutional clients as well. We believe that our clients definitely take comfort in the fact that Northern currently is and has been very well capitalized whether that's on a standalone basis or in comparison to other competitors that they may be considering doing business with.","So that will continue to be a factor for us as we look at our capital level going forward. As to exactly where we are relative to a competitor, we don't necessarily determine our capital level based on anyone or even a small group of competitors. They are just relative data point that we take into account along with a number of other data point from our own internal analysis related to our own risk and certainly with regard to be a regulatory required level.","So that\u2019s a framework that we used. It\u2019s a broader framework of factors and the commercial aspect and competitive aspects are part of that. So last thing, I would say is certainly we\u2019re very focused on returning capital to our shareholders, which we've done an increasing amount over the last few years and yet that\u2019s also obviously an exercise that we go through with our regulators that have a clear say in the amount of capital that we can return.","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move next to Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Hi. Thanks. Maybe start with a quickie on capital ratios. I agree you got a ton of it. Just curious on how come it went down in the quarter and barely up on the year on a ratio basis. You\u2019re making a lot of money not buying back too much positive OCI benefit which is just logic?","Michael O'Grady","Yeah. I would say that for the most part, Glenn, we have returned this year basically what our net income has been. So we\u2019re much higher in the first quarter and a little bit lower in the second quarter with regard to share repurchase. Between the two quarters there plus the dividend, it largely offset the net income impact from that. And then I would say beyond that we\u2019re into a time period where the capital ratios depending on the methodology approach are being transitioned in.","So there is a number of factors that happen on a transition basis that I\u2019ll hit just a couple. But from a numerator perspective, we have trust preferreds for example. The equity credit for those are being phased out over a time period here. So, that\u2019s going to reduce our capital level.","And then on the denominator side, there's a transition period, essentially what our Basel I risk weight to the Basel III standardized risk weight. So you will see that impact on the ratios. And then certainly with the advanced methodologies, those are always subject to updated modeling and assumptions that go into that. That can affect either operational risk capital or credit risk capital or any other of the capital category.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Okay. That\u2019s definitely helpful. And then on the -- I guess these questions on both expenses and net interest income merged together in this where you mentioned most of the deposit, higher deposit funding was invested at the Fed. By the way I have the same problem, I don\u2019t know what to do with cash either. So I\u2019m just curious if that's a comment about what you think the duration of those deposits might be or an interest in not taking on too much credit risk, not expanding more on the duration side?","Michael O'Grady","Sure. Well, we would be glad to help you out with your problem if you would like to be a client of ours. So, we will talk about that separately. You're right that we have seen the balance sheet expand significantly more so over the last year and somewhat over the last quarter. And as you\u2019ve seen, we have increased the size of the securities portfolio. So, that is a way for us when to extend out the duration and get a higher yield on those investments.","I would say that we look very closely at the nature of the deposits that are coming in. As much as we would consider all of these client-related deposits as you know with the extreme amount of liquidity that\u2019s just in the system. What we don't know exactly is what the impact of behavior will be to the extent that interest rate head in the different direction. So we have to be careful just on how much duration we add to the portfolio. We\u2019ve been relatively constant on that front.","And then the last thing I would say is, as you saw in the quarter here, we actually had about $1 billion of growth in the loan portfolio. That's certainly a positive development. One, it indicates just the fact that in our view the economy is improving and our clients are positioned where they are taking on additional loans to expand their business or do other things, but that is an ideal way for us to deploy those assets because we\u2019re deploying them in client needs or for client needs.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","I think that\u2019s all completely reasonable. And to your point, when you -- you\u2019re clearly managing expenses a little bit more or getting us to focus more on fees to core revenues versus the ancillary revenues. If and when we ever live to see the higher rates, does that just imply the higher incremental margins as super high on NII?","Michael O'Grady","Very, very high, yeah.","Glenn Schorr - ISI","Awesome. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Thanks. I just had a follow-up on the last question where you\u2019re talking about what happen with NII increased. The one of the concerns that people had is that as interest rates have come down and soft dollar benefit has declined, you\u2019ve been able to -- the industry has been able to move more towards hard dollar as a percentage of total. As interest rates go up, does that cap ability to continue to grow the hard dollar fee side of the business as much? Will investors in a turnaround say I am giving you more soft dollar now so I can peel back hard dollar?","Michael O'Grady","I think Betsy that it\u2019s a very interesting question in the sense of that\u2019s very tactically close to the business. And we -- as you point out, we\u2019ve gone through a time period here where whether you want to characterize certain revenue streams as hard dollar or soft dollar, that\u2019s not the terminology we use. But so let me say it the way we would which would be the fee component of our service offerings versus some of the other services that we provide where the revenues come in the form of whether it\u2019s spread income, foreign exchange, securities lending, things like that. And so we've been on the downside, if you will, of those revenue stream coming down. I think that has had some impact on the fee side in the sense that just for the entire marketplace. If the ancillary side is lower, then that there's firmer pricing if you will.","To your point then the question is. To the extent rate turnaround, do we lose that? Hard to say, it all depends on the competitive dynamic. But my expectation is that some of that discipline that we've seen will be maintained in the marketplace as rates go up at least for some extended time period.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And the disclosures that you put up around benefit from rising rate environment into revenue stream, earnings stream in the Q. Are you anticipating that similar behavior of client as in past rate rise cycles? Are you assuming like a static balance sheet analysis? So I guess the basic question is, is that Q disclosure more of a minimum as opposed to in a dynamic environment, what you think you got?","Michael O'Grady","So it is a static balance sheet analysis. It is, as you point out, difficult at this point to have a very high level of confidence in all the assumptions that go into that analysis given that we haven't had this type of rate environment for this time period. And so predicting the behavior as rate increases particularly difficult and be more specific, particularly difficult on the deposit side of that calculation. And so what we\u2019ve had to do is look at both the nature of the deposit. So whether we think that those deposits are core if you will or are operational. But then also our ability to maintain the level that we\u2019re paying on those deposit as rate increase and as we see the benefit on the asset side of the equation. And so we try to incorporate the fact that we\u2019re in a unusual interest rate environment, but it is just that, it\u2019s a set of assumptions that we put in there and we\u2019ll obviously have to see how it plays out to the extent rates move up.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Right. And then again as rates do move up there will clearly be a benefit. The question is, how much do you and you have some room there to determine how much you\u2019re going to allow to fall to the bottomline or not, I would expect that at least some of that improvement in NII would be able to fall to the bottomline, is that fair?","Michael O'Grady","Absolutely.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Luke Montgomery from Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Hey, guys. Thanks. So just maybe some more thoughts on the management reshuffle. I know you've done this a lot over the last few years and I get that it\u2019s part of your management philosophy and maybe there is some succession planning here. But at the same time, I think Mike was only in the seat for a short time, he is a good communicator, and I do believe that investors value some consistency in the CFO seat. So maybe you could comment what the catalyst was here and why the objectives you listed are more importantly that maybe providing some continuity in the dialogue with the investment community?","Rick Waddell","Well, Luke, it\u2019s Rick and I appreciate the question. I would point out that Mike has been in the role for three years. So this is not what I would call just a quick change and I would also note that Mike is not leaving the company. He is still a very valuable member of our management team. The CFO role has quite frankly historically been one at Northern where we put high potential talented individuals who get to see the company with the different lens but across the corporation. And if you go back to Steve Fradkin and Bill Morrison, I would highlight two individuals who were in that role and have moved on into other role. So that really is the context with Mike, with Biff you are going to get an individual who has -- his entire career has been with Northern. He started at audit. He has been on the commercial banking side. He was part of our acquisition strategy in 2005. In Europe, he\u2019s ran Europe. He\u2019s run North America. And so he is a very seasoned talented leader with the terrific financial background. So I think I would say personally I have been spoiled by Mike. But Mike has a unique background. But I don\u2019t think investment community externally nor do I think internally from a financial leadership perspective that we are going to miss a beat when we\u2019ll make these changes.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Fair enough. I guess I have got someone new to try to pester into enhancing the organic growth disclosures?","Rick Waddell","Well, that\u2019s your job.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Maybe an update on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of regulatory expense trends. Are you comfortable maintaining the view that it\u2019s going to be in line with 2013, but with the mix shift that you stated way from outside services and towards permanent or maintenance spending? And was there anything that was pulled into Q2 or pushed out that might affect the run rate over the next two quarters?","Michael O'Grady","So on that front, Luke, I would say that so far this year it\u2019s been consistent with what our expectations were in the sense that we -- you\u2019ve seen for example that our comp and expenses have gone up. That\u2019s one of the areas where it\u2019s gone up. But we think that that\u2019s the most economical way for us to address the improvements that we\u2019re making within our control functions. And at the same time as you\u2019ve seen in outside services, it\u2019s not as much that you can see the detail per se that as you probably noted. I didn\u2019t talk about consulting expenses been higher either year-over-year or sequentially, and that\u2019s because we haven\u2019t successful in doing more or so and having less on the outside.","Now the trend from quarter-to-quarter can certainly. There does tend to be more activity on the regulatory front as we get into the back half of the year as there are number of items that we are trying to clear whether that\u2019s for the CCAR process or any one of the other, any number of regulatory initiatives that we do have. So it\u2019s not to say that we\u2019ve locked into a low level, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s been consistent with what our expectations were.","The other thing I would say is that one of the areas that has been our focus for us this year has been AIFMD over in Europe. So we\u2019ve incurred the cost and the investment to build that capability out in the first half of the year, that\u2019s all you\u2019ve had. It\u2019s just the cost and expense related to that. We will continue to have both some implementation costs and ongoing costs related to providing that service, but we will also have revenues in the latter part of the year as clients are using that service and compensating us for that. So that won\u2019t show up in the expense line as much, but it will show up on the revenue side.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken, your line is open. Go ahead, sir.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Hell, sorry about that. Hey, Mike, can you actually talk through about the net new business wins and the growth rates of the C&IS and FPS ex fee waivers have been at a pretty consistent rate both in upper single digit last year. So I was wondering if you could talk about the pace of new business wins and if either the size or constitution of what buckets that are coming from has changed at all?","Michael O'Grady","Sure. On the C&IS front, the business continues to have quite a bit of momentum. So, it\u2019s very positive and I would say it\u2019s also relatively broad-based. So both from a geographic perspective. Again there are certain areas where you might think the business is more mature and that\u2019s going to grow at lower rates in North America for example, but it continues to be very successful and both getting new additional business or revenue opportunities from existing clients but also winning new clients.","And then within GFS, success not only in North America but very much so in Europe. And that\u2019s after going through a time period when Europe had more difficult and we did see the new business levels go down in Europe. Now we\u2019ve had a number of quarters of very positive net new business in EMEA for us. And then you\u2019ve heard us talk about certainly our success in the APAC region broadly speaking and specifically in Australia. And I would say that that momentum continues as well. So all very good and we would expect that that continues in the sense that we\u2019re still very active in pursuing opportunities in all those regions in those businesses.","On the wealth management front, I talked about it a little bit previously just about the different regions. And I would say there that we\u2019re at a time period in the market where I sense that or I should say our wealth management professionals and experts see a certainly level of nervousness if you will on the part of clients given the high equity market levels. That can always cause fits and starts with moving business to new providers. We continue as you would expect at very high retention levels and are very focused on trying to increase the level of new business that comes into the company. And so at this point, I would characterize that as steady not as high as we\u2019ve seen in other time periods where there is just more activity in the marketplace.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","And Mike just on an on-boarding question, is Bridgewater still on track for coming on this quarter and presumably even again without the related AUC so we\u2019ll see that in the capture rate as well?","Michael O'Grady","Correct. So we are on track for Bridgewater to be online in the third quarter and their assets will be assets under administration.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And just Mike one question on that fees, that expenses, that fees number. If we presume that rates really don\u2019t change, how much more progress do you think you guys can make on that just from an organic growth and expense control relative to the 115 that you\u2019re at this quarter?","Michael O'Grady","Can we still think we have significant opportunity to improve that ratio and with the changes that Rick has talked about today, that\u2019s all an indication of our effort to try to do what it takes in order to continue to improve that ratio. This particular set of action happens to be around the structure of the organization. In my mind, it\u2019s a way for us to structure in a way that we think we\u2019ll create new opportunity to deliver efficiency. But that\u2019s on top of things that we've been doing for the last 2.5 years, which we will continue to do because we think it's important to our long-term success to be able to continue to drive that ratio down.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks a lot Mike.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe question for both Rick and Mike. As you think about the business realignment and the leadership changes and really trying to drive profitable growth over the longer term. Aside from the expense components of that, can you talk about profitable growth in the business mix perspective within the businesses? So what I\u2019m trying to get at is due to what extend would you prefer to invest in higher margin area within CI&S servicing such as hedge fund administration, alternative administration. And then similarly on the wealth management side, would you view as the more profitable components in the wealth management, higher end versus the medium area?","Rick Waddell","Brian, its Rick. I mean, our businesses fortunately present tremendous opportunities to grow. So as Mike has indicated and we\u2019ve been saying for sometime, we continue to invest in a variety of initiative to take advantage of growth opportunity. So for example, in Australia, that business continues to grow. We\u2019re adding headcount. We\u2019re putting more capabilities in there. Asia we\u2019re at large, we opened an office in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year.","There is just a number of markets on the institutional side where we\u2019re seeing strong client demand and therefore we need to invest in those market in order to grow them. On the well side, we talked about our mega market strategy. We\u2019re in the east coast, specifically North New York, our business in Texas and specifically in Houston. Those are markets were we are allocating more resources because growth opportunities, the margin, the revenues and the profitability are there.","We\u2019re also expanding in capability so our EPS strategy where we\u2019re north of $8 million and continue to add product, broaden our product, mix leveraging our mutual fund and pass of capability. That\u2019s an investment that we\u2019re making. So it\u2019s fairly broad based, it\u2019s in both businesses, each of them have different dynamic granted, but we\u2019re seeing very, very good investment opportunities to grow our businesses in geographies and in markets throughout our business.","Michael O'Grady","And I guess, Brian, the only thing I would add but Rick laid out there is to your question around the profitability of the service offering that we have for our client where we're doing and have been doing quite a bit of analysis as you would imagine around those product and services to determine where are the best opportunities for us to move that mix. And so you marry that up with the businesses and the growth opportunities we have to determine the best way to allocate capital and resources.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","And then just a follow-on for that, maybe your view of the alternative servicing business, though I\u2019m thinking really of the Omnium, the legacy Omnium businesses and we\u2019re bringing Bridgewater on. To what extent do you think you can leverage that to much stronger growth in that area? And do you view that as the more longer term profitable area than the legacy core pension custody assets and investment management businesses?","Michael O'Grady","So, we continue to think that area presents tremendous opportunity for us. And when we think about resource allocation, we would say that that\u2019s an area where we have invested in dedicated resources to over the last few years and that\u2019s because we do believe that it not only presents growth but presents attractive return to the extent that we grow that business out. And it\u2019s a situation where I would say at this point that we have had success there certainly adding large clients like Bridgewater, which will be onboard shortly here, changes the dynamic forces well as to the economic of the business, the ability to continue to invest in the business as well. So that is clearly one of the areas of opportunity.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Very clear. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks a lot. Most of my questions have been gone over, but just maybe circling back to the asset growth, it seem like this quarter there was a real disparity between the wealth management AUM up 3% and the corporate institutional, which was basically flat. So I think you mentioned that was a matter of cash outflows on the institutional side. I\u2019m just wondering if there was any other dynamic and put another way, whether it\u2019s focusing on the asset under management, what the pipeline is looking like?","Michael O'Grady","Sure. On the asset under management, I think, Cynthia, just to clarify, you said on a sequential basis?","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Michael O'Grady","Yeah. Sure. So on a sequential basis, part of it is that cash certainly does factor in from quarter-to-quarter and given the nature of our client base and what they look to us to provide, that is one of the key areas, which is liquidity and liquidity management and so that going to affect the numbers on assets under management.","The other part of it is that we do have some very large asset management client. And they do make allocation decisions from quarter-to-quarter. And on a sequential basis, we did have two very large clients who made reallocation decisions in the quarter. And so they allocated out of the product if you will that which was on the equity side into other categories and that was a drag if you will on the AUM growth on a sequential basis.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And looking forward any color?","Michael O'Grady","Difficult, other than just I would say, consistent with my broader commentary on the opportunities being relatively broad based in that business as well across both industry group as well as geography.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then maybe just a quick specific follow-up, the lack of provision this quarter. How do you think about that going forward, given that where the trends are?","Michael O'Grady","The trends continue to be very positive. We did see a nice decline, if you will, over 10% in our nonperforming loan. From quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019ll have to continue to see if we\u2019ll have to see if that continues going forward. And as you know, we\u2019re obviously resize the reserve to what the appropriate level is in the provision falls out of that. So you don\u2019t have a view as to where that would be necessarily, but we certainly do hope that we continue to see the positive credit quality trend.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Michael O'Grady","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Partners.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","I want to ask specific question on the write-off that you had in the securities portfolio with faster prepayment speeds, when the refi market has been flowing not accelerating us to have such a large adjustment this quarter, I just was curious what the catalyst for that was?","Michael O'Grady","Sure, Marty. And on the premium amortization, it is something where it\u2019s difficult likewise to predict exactly what is going to happen in the portfolio because it is a collection of a number of these mortgage-backed securities. And admittedly we've done analysis on our own looking to be able to better predict our forecast, what the adjustments will be from quarter-to-quarter.","And there isn\u2019t a single index if you will, whether that\u2019s the MVA purchase index or refi index or necessarily even interest rate level where the tenure is that will give you a clean read on what to expect as far as prepayment because there are just a number of drivers as to what can drive it in a particular MBS pool. So hard to necessarily give you a view on what to expect on that going forward other than the fact that the adjustment will move from quarter-to-quarter, but all the same our view is that on balance of course, it just a matter of ultimately amortizing all of the premium that is booked at the time of purchase. That doesn't change the ultimate return we\u2019ll receive on the security.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","Got you. And going to non-interest expense from some of the charges you had this quarter, the write-off that you had in the software, was that related to a system that was being replaced or is it an outdated system or was it a new system that just wasn\u2019t getting to the point where I can fulfill the -- what you thought the objective was?","Michael O'Grady","Sure. It\u2019s some collection of -- I don\u2019t say all of the things that you mentioned but a number of things that you mentioned there. So this was not one large system where we had a write-off that totals 9.5 million. It\u2019s a combination of a number of application that fits the profile that you talked about here where we no longer are using that or expect that we\u2019re going to sunset it in a short time period and therefore not appropriate to continue to amortize it over a longer time period.","Certainly, we have been and we will continue to be very focused on the IT capital investments we\u2019re making going forward and at time that does present, I call important financial decision to make because we may still have asset value on the book. And we have to determine whether it make sense to continue use that particular application or platform or to replace it write it off as we have on certain things here and then move forward with the new investment.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Partners","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. This management change is that a lot of change at one time. What was the catalyst for that? I guess you said to improve profitable growth, but was there any extra reason why it\u2019s now? And when you say to improve profitable growth to what sort of EPS growth \u2013ROE, efficiency pretax margin ratio are you seeking?","Rick Waddell","Mike, its Rick. Reason why now is lot of inputs into the decision, people's careers where they are and lengthen job and time to get them exposed, so lot of this is continuing to build out our leadership team and give people new roles. But really the impetus was as result of all the work that we've done over the last 2.5 plus years, beginning with our driving performance efforts and to leverage that, that [learning] that I call the muscle memory that we build up around in this environment, which we don\u2019t expect to dramatically improve to continue to drive efficiency, drive productivity, drive nimbleness throughout our organization in order to continue to grow profitably our businesses, which are well positioned, client franchise very, very strong brand, financial strength et cetera.","So it really is to take the last 2.5 years and what we\u2019ve done around driving performance and the strategy review we put in place for the Board last year around our businesses and what we felt if take in order to grow profitably -- in order to reach those are -- we've been -- we have said probably to get to the second part of your question.","We\u2019ve said we want a 10% to 15% ROE return and we have been inching our way along and doing all the right thing, but I think we\u2019ve got an opportunity to accelerate that and not just to get into the 10%, the lower end of that range, which we did in the second quarter, but get to the upper end of that range in the near-term.","And if we are going to do that, I feel we need a different organizational structure that brings the focus and the expertise and the talent that we have to bare on what Mike referred to is the things to enable this growth to grow -- these businesses to grow profitably.","And that was really [incident] and it is a good time. We had a Board meeting yesterday and I've been working with the Board and working with the management team over the last several months to put this in place and I\u2019d say everybody including me is extremely excited about their new roles and the opportunities that we have. Again, to leverage what we've been doing the last couple of years in order to accelerate the profitable growth for the company.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Is there a new name for the new program?","Rick Waddell","Stay tuned.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. I just have a follow up. Tell me, if I hear you correctly, you think you can get to the high-end of the ROE in the near-term without higher interest rates or is that a little too aggressive?","Michael O'Grady","Certainly, we wouldn't have a target range out there if we didn\u2019t think that we could ultimately get to it. And as Rick said, all the plans around this are to try to drive not only into the range and well under the range but ultimately get to that top end of the range and trying to do so without the assumptions that the microenvironment gets much better and that takes us there.","As far as the timing to you get there, very difficult, even the Chairman of the Fed had difficult time giving timeframe for things. I think it\u2019s difficult to say when that will be. It\u2019s more that we just need to make sure that we are on the path for getting there.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Let me ask it one way differently, the pre-tax margin was 28% this quarter, pre-crisis it was 35%? Can you get back to that pre-tax margin pre-crisis of 35% without higher interest rates?","Michael O'Grady","Yes. I would say, Mike, that, first of all, that framework and looking at the margin is a good framework to look at and some thing that we do as well. So we know that we need to get that pre-tax margin into the 30s in order to achieve the returns that we are targeting, whether it's exactly 34, 35, whatever it may be, it\u2019s -- there's more to the calculation than that, but that is what we are driving toward is to get to those types of margins absence just looking for the interest rate environment or the FX currency volatility environment to be down.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Actually, my last question, when should we get additional update on these initiatives that you're taking, I guess, you have several new people and new seats, and how long will it take to get their planned out to the investment community?","Michael O'Grady","I would say, at this point, Mike, there's no grand plan if you will or rollout of something, as Rick said, the businesses are extremely well-positioned, this is not a change in strategy, he is not looking to change the course of the strategy, this is an acceleration of what we have been doing.","Having said that, as far as, the checkups in the monitoring along the way, every quarter we\u2019ll certainly be back like we are now to talk about the progress we are making toward those financial goals.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right. Thank you.",".","Operator","And we will take our final question from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Hi. And the 20% year-on-year growth in assets under custody, if we strip out the market performance from that, is that kind of a sustainable pace of organic growth would be say, but there are some lumpy wins in there and obviously, the market performance is what it is, but if you take that out, all those is not making for these kind of on an underlying basis sustainable or was it written by lumpiness that will be difficult to maintain that?","Rick Waddell","Yes. Geoff, if I understood the question correctly, that growth rate if you will in AUC year-over-year so 20%. Definitely a high rate if you will in the sense that it\u2019s been driven by very strong market. And so markets are driving that more than half of that growth at least as best we can attribute the growth.","You also had a favorable foreign exchange impact to that, meaning just from a currency perspective, assets under custody that are denominated in pound, for example, were up significantly on a year-over-year basis, so that helps it.","And then the differential if you will is more towards the organic growth and I would say the organic growth once you peel those other factors back is consistent with both historical levels and also what we\u2019ve been talking about.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","And then one quick, second question, the ECB move to negative deposit rate, have you started challenging the deposits in Europe, have you seen any of your competitors doing that?","Rick Waddell","Yes. I can\u2019t speak to exactly what all the competitors are doing. From our perspective we are not charging client if you build for deposits. It is certainly something that we are monitoring very closely, given the fact that the ECB is at negative 10 basis point rate and that does certainly have an impact on the spreads that we can earn on euro deposits that we have, because to the extent we are at zero. We have to reinvest those in someway and as market rates come down, it squeezes the spread on those deposits. So we will continue to not only monitor the marketplace closely, but we've been in close communication with our client as well.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Great. Thanks very much.","Rick Waddell","Yeah.","Operator","And that conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Bev Fleming","Well, we like to thank everybody for joining us today, any follow-up questions, please contact myself, Bev Fleming or Allison Quaintance, otherwise we will look forward to updating you on our third quarter performance in October.

O'grady","Thanks, Bev. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This morning, we reported third quarter earnings per share of $0.73 and a return on equity of 9.6%. Our results were consistent with last quarter and improved over last year. We continue to see trends similar to previous quarters.","A few overview comments. First, the addition of new business is increasing our asset levels and trust fees. Winning mandates and gaining new clients is the primary driver of growth for Northern Trust over time and we continue to be successful at achieving this.","Second, the mixed macro environment continues to pose challenging operating conditions. The equity markets rebounded in the third quarter after having declined in the second quarter and are up strongly compared to this time last year. This benefited our client asset levels with assets under custody ending the third quarter at $4.8 trillion, up 4% sequentially and 14% year-over-year; and assets under management ending at $750 billion, up 6% sequentially and 16% year-over-year.","Given our trust and investment fees are generally calculated based on a lagged asset value, the weaker market performance in the second quarter generally had a dampening effect on third quarter fees. However, rising markets clearly impact us favorably over time.","Foreign exchange volatility and volumes deteriorated even further in the third quarter as evidenced by the significant drop in our foreign exchange trading income, which we'll discuss in more detail later.","Interest rates also declined further in the quarter with the European Central bank lowering its rates in July and the Federal Reserve announcing incremental quantitative easing initiatives in September, we saw short-term interest rates decrease in many markets around the world and across most currencies. Low short-term rates pressure our net interest margin and result in ongoing fee waivers in connection with our money market funds.","Third, through our Driving Performance initiative, we continue to focus on improving the profitability of our business and enhancing our capacity for investment in future growth regardless of the macro environment. We made further progress on this critical priority in the third quarter on both the revenue and expense fronts. By executing on our initiatives and managing costs closely, expense levels were lower both sequentially and year-over-year. As a result, our pretax margin increased to 28.2%, the highest level we have achieved since the second quarter of 2010.","Let's move to Page 2 and discuss the financial highlights of the third quarter. Net income of $179 million and earnings per share of $0.73 were unchanged sequentially and increased approximately 4% to 5% year-over-year. Compared to last quarter, revenues were down about 1% and expenses were down 3%.","Trust, investment and other servicing fees were down 1% for our Corporate & Institutional Services business due to the seasonal decline in securities lending and were flat to our -- for our Personal Financial Services business.","Lower foreign exchange trading income and net interest income were partially offset by higher other operating income, which included a $5.3 million gain related to hedges of certain investments in our foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries.","The 3% decline in expenses was primarily a result of lower outside services and the write-off of certain software in the previous quarter.","Our return on equity of 9.6% for the third quarter was lower than last quarter due to higher equity and was just below our long-term target range of 10% to 15%.","On a year-over-year basis, revenues were flat and expenses were down 1%. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues, increased 8%, but this growth was offset by lower foreign exchange trading income and net interest income. The decline in expenses was primarily the result of lower outside services.","I'll also note that we recorded restructuring, acquisition and integration charges of $2.9 million in the third quarter compared with $3.6 million last quarter and $4.2 million 1 year ago. We expect further charges in the fourth quarter as we complete the integration of the Bank of Ireland Securities Services and Omnium acquisitions and as we continue to execute on our Driving Performance initiatives.","With that background and summary, let me get into more details behind our third quarter results, beginning on Page 3.","Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $602 million in the quarter, down 1% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. As you can see, performance was relatively consistent across the businesses. The addition of new business drove the healthy year-over-year growth, but was muted sequentially by the impact of lower lag markets and other factors.","Looking first at C&IS. Fees totaled $334 million in the third quarter, which is also down 1% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year.","Let me explain some of the key drivers behind this performance. While equity markets were stronger in the third quarter with the S&P 500 up 6% and the EAFE up 4%, some of our custody and investment management fees are calculated based on a quarter lag methodology. Given that markets were down in the second quarter with the S&P 500 down 3% and the EAFE down 7%, sequential performance was dampened by the quarter lag markets.","Looking more closely at the components. Custody and fund administration fees for C&IS were $214 million in the third quarter, flat sequentially and up 4% year-over-year. In the sequential quarter comparison, new business was unable to offset the impact of lower second quarter equity markets and lower transaction volumes. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of new business, offset partially by the adverse impact of weaker quarter lag international markets and a stronger dollar.","Investment management fees for C&IS were $73 million in the third quarter, up 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. The sequential quarter increase reflects new business, primarily in index and mutual fund management. In the year-over-year comparison, new business and lower fee waivers drove the increase. Waived fees associated with institutional money market mutual funds and impacting C&IS were approximately $7 million in both the third and second quarters and $10 million in last year's third quarter. Lower fee waivers on our institutional money market mutual funds, primarily reflect higher gross yields achieved in the underlying funds.","Securities lending fees were $24 million in the third quarter, down 22% sequentially, reflecting the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads last quarter. Securities lending fees were up 15% versus last year as wider spreads more than offset continued weakness in borrower demand. Securities lending collateral of $98 billion decreased 2% versus last year, but was up 4% sequentially.","C&IS assets under custody were $4.3 trillion at quarter end, up 4% sequentially and 14% year-over-year while C&IS assets under management were $566 billion at quarter end, up 7% sequentially and 18% year-over-year.","We continue to be pleased to the pace of new business in C&IS with the results in the first 9 months of 2012 being our best ever.","Moving to our Personal business. PFS, trust, investment and other servicing fees were a record $267 million in the third quarter, up slightly on a sequential quarter basis and up 9% year-over-year. The slight sequential quarter increase primarily reflects new business having been offset by lower estate settlement and tax preparation fees, which tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. The 9% year-over-year increase primarily reflects strong new business, the impact of the January 1 change in our fee structure and lower fee waivers. Money market fund fee waivers in PFS were $10 million in the third quarter, essentially unchanged from the second quarter. Waivers in PFS were down from $19 million in the year-earlier quarter, reflecting higher gross yields achieved in the underlying funds and a lower fee rate in our retail money market family, which was effective on the first of the year.","Fees for the PFS regions were flat sequentially as new business and the modest market impact was essentially offset by the lower estate and tax preparation fees. Recall that our PFS regions use a 1-month lag methodology for fees, and on that basis, equity markets were up less than 1% on a sequential quarter basis.","Our global family office business, where we serve approximately 20% of the Forbes  400 most affluent families, reported a 1% sequential increase in fees with new business offsetting the adverse impact of lower equity markets at the end of the second quarter. Global family office fees are calculated based on a 1-quarter lag methodology.","PFS assets under management were $184 billion at quarter end, up 5% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity markets and new business.","Total revenues as summarized on Page 4 include trust, investment and other servicing fees, which were down 1% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. This growth was offset by declines in other revenue categories, particularly foreign exchange trading income, which was $44 million in the third quarter, down 26% compared with last quarter and 49% year-over-year. The 2 primary drivers of foreign exchange trading income, client volumes and currency volatility, continued to trend lower. Consistent with reported market volumes, our client volumes were lower in the quarter. Daily average FX volumes, as reported by ICAP, were 17% lower sequentially and 43% lower year-over-year and were lower than any quarter since before the financial crisis.","Likewise, volatility, whether measured for individual major currencies or by the broader VIX index, was lower by varying amounts sequentially and by over 30% year-over-year. Our analysis suggests that volatility across the major currencies is at the lowest level in 5 years.","Other operating income was $47 million for the quarter, which was up 36% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. This line includes several items and tends to fluctuate. The sequential quarter increase was primarily due to the $5 million gain on foreign exchange contracts related to certain hedges that I mentioned earlier as well as higher income on employee benefit assets held in trust and higher commercial banking fees. The year-over-year increase also reflects the gain.","All the other fee revenue categories, collectively, were down 1% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year.","Net interest income was $257 million in the third quarter, down 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $85 billion in the third quarter, up 2% sequentially and unchanged compared to last year.","The net interest margin was 1.21%, down from 1.28% last quarter and 1.25% last year. Excluding the $5 million adjustment for previously amortized premium on certain investment securities, the net interest margin would have been 1.19%. The lower margin primarily reflects declining spreads in the euro, sterling and Australian dollar. We also experienced lower yields on certain loan and lease categories as new loans and leases are coming on our balance sheet at lower yields than those rolling off. The decline in yields was slightly offset by a higher percentage of funding from non-interest-bearing demand deposits.","So in total, revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were $984 million, down 1% sequentially and were flat year-over-year.","Now let's look at third quarter expenses on Page 5. Total expenses in the third quarter were $696 million, 3% or $21 million lower than the prior quarter. Expenses were lower in equipment and software by 13%, outside services by 5% and employee benefits by 6%. Recall that equipment and software had a $10.5 million software write-off in the second quarter. Absent the write-down, equipment and software would have been down 3% sequentially, primarily due to lower computer maintenance and depreciation and lower software amortization.","Outside services reflect the decline in sub-custodian expense, primarily due to lower transaction volumes as well as lower technical services.","Partially offsetting these sequential declines was a 1% increase in compensation expense on a similar increase in staffing levels. Hiring in the third quarter was again concentrated in the Asia Pacific region.","Occupancy expense also increased by 3% sequentially due to higher international rent expense.","Expenses were down 1% year-over-year, primarily due to lower outside services and employee benefits expense. Good expense management resulted in an increase in our pretax margins to over 28%, and we remain focused on the expense-related goals outlined in our Driving Performance initiative.","Let's move to Page 6 for a brief update on Driving Performance. In January, we indicated our goal to improve pretax income by $250 million by the end of 2013, with over half the $250 million coming in 2012. In the third quarter, we produced approximately $45 million in pretax operating income improvement from Driving Performance initiatives. Increased benefits from revenue initiatives were primarily the result of successful pricing and cross-sell efforts in C&IS.","On expense initiatives, we achieved greater benefits from the continued implementation of a variety of corporate-wide initiatives. This brings our 2012 in-year total to over $100 million, split roughly 40-60 between revenue and expense items.","Overall, we are pleased with the progress of our Driving Performance efforts and its contributions to our 2012 financial goals. Based on the results achieved to date, we remain on track to meet our 2012 and 2013 targets for Driving Performance. We believe that we will continue to successfully implement the initiatives to enhance our revenue and improve our productivity.","Let me make a few comments on the strength of our balance sheet, which continues to differentiate Northern Trust through this challenging economic cycle. On Page 7, we outline the 3 key components of earning assets, all of which have been managed conservatively. Our lending strategy represents $30 billion in earning assets and is focused on our clients with the majority of loans to PFS clients. While loan growth has been moderate through this economic cycle, we did grow loans by over $800 million compared with last year. Nonperforming loans increased $29 million sequentially to $269 million at quarter end, but were down $39 million year-over-year. The sequential increase reflects continued weakness in the commercial and residential real estate markets. Nonperforming assets were 0.98% of total loans and Other Real Estate Owned, up from 0.89% in the second quarter.","Charge-offs were $16 million in both the third and second quarters. Recoveries, however, were $4 million in the third quarter compared with $13 million last quarter, reflecting the uneven nature of resolving troubled loans. As a result, net charge-offs were $12 million in the third quarter versus $3 million last quarter.","Our loan loss provision was $10 million in the third quarter, up from $5 million last quarter. As a result, the allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases was $299 million at quarter end, essentially flat with the prior quarter end and representing 1% of total loans and leases and 1.1x our nonperforming loans.","Our securities portfolio, which also has about $30 billion at quarter end, continues to be managed in high-quality fashion with 91% of the portfolio invested in U.S. Treasury, agency and AAA securities. The portfolio at quarter end had a maturity duration of a little over 2 years and repricing duration of about 1 year, up slightly from last quarter. Interest-bearing deposits with banks at $19 billion, our third largest earning asset category, continued to be managed conservatively as well. Duration remains short at less than 1 month on average. Eurozone exposures within this portfolio have been monitored and managed closely. At the end of the third quarter, we had less than $5 billion in exposure to banks in the Eurozone. We continue to place deposits with a select group of stronger banks at short tenures.","Capital, outlined on Page 8, remained very strong with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios at 12.8% and 12.3%, respectively. We estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III advance framework, as we currently understand the regulations including the impact of the proposed rules issued by the Federal Reserve on June 7, would equal 13.1% exceeding all anticipated requirements.","Under the common stock repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors in March, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for $50 million during the third quarter. Under our capital plan reviewed without objection by the Federal Reserve in March, Northern Trust may repurchase up to an additional $140 million through the first quarter of 2013.","I would like to close by reiterating a few key points made during today's call. Although our financial performance in any given time period will be affected by macro environmental factors, we aim to create long-term value for our clients, shareholders, partners and the communities we serve by staying focused on executing our strategy and remaining true to our enduring principles. Our third quarter financial performance was consistent with the prior quarter and an improvement over last year's third quarter. We continue to execute on our strategy of growing our business by building on existing client relationships and adding new clients while at the same time focusing on improving profitability and returns through Driving Performance.","More importantly, through the first 3 quarters of this year, we have made solid progress towards our financial goals. Trust, investment and other servicing fees are up 10%. Revenues are up 4% despite a 35% decrease in foreign exchange trading income. We are on track to meet our Driving Performance targets for 2012. Our pretax margin has improved 100 basis points. Earnings per share are up 10%. The return on equity is higher and approaching our long-term target of 10% to 15%. Our balance sheet and capital position remain strong. And we return an increasing amount of capital to our shareholders as the year has progressed.","Overall, thanks to the exceptional efforts of Northern Trust partners and support from our clients throughout the world, our core businesses, wealth management, asset management, asset servicing and banking are performing well and positioned to continue to do so.","Thank you again for participating in the Northern Trust Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","Tim, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to -- Mike, wanted to start off, I guess, by focusing on expenses a little bit here. It looks like clearly solid job this quarter with maintaining the dollar amount of expenses at a lower level. How, I guess, sustainable is that? I mean it sounds like there's still a good chunk of expense initiatives that are not in the run rate that we're going to get from you guys next year. So I guess if you look at the next few quarters and thinking about the absolute dollar of expenses weighing in against business initiatives, et cetera, is this a decent run rate, I guess, knowing what has still to, I guess, come through from the expense savings?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So on expenses, as you point out, Alex, we have been successful in managing our costs as we continue to drive the business. So as I talked about, our trust, investment and other fees up 8% year-over-year and yet our costs have been very much in line with where they were a year ago. And a lot of that is due to Driving Performance and executing on those initiatives. And as I mentioned, we're $100 million into that and that's a mix between revenue and expenses, but we still have a number of initiatives that will bear fruit in 2013 and beyond. So we do expect to see the positive impact of Driving Performance in our expense run rate as we go forward. Having said that, we also expect to continue to grow the business and there are costs that are associated with growing the business. So as the business grows, expense levels will grow. But on a relative basis, our goal certainly is to have them grow at a slower rate than our revenue growth. The other thing I would say as far as run rate, from any quarter-to-quarter comparison, there are various categories that do fluctuate. As I mentioned, outside service is a category that we had an improvement in this quarter and that included sub-custodian expenses. That's a category, for example, which can fluctuate with transaction levels and be seasonal. So it's not something where I would say quarter-to-quarter every line item is going to move exactly the same.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you, helpful. And then my second question was on how you guys are thinking about net interest income. And I know there's a few things that tend to move around between excess deposit, et cetera. But I guess, focusing on NII as opposed to the NIM, can you just give us your updated thoughts on when you're thinking potentially either extending duration or reshuffling some of the buckets. You guys do have 30% of your balance sheet basically in cash or with -- sitting with other banks. So when you think about NII and the outlook, knowing what you see with the interest rate backdrop, is there anything you could do or planning on doing, I guess, to protect just the actual NII as opposed to just thinking about the NIM?","Michael G. O'grady","So as you know, obviously, the net interest income is a product of the average earning assets and our NIM. And on the average earning asset side, you've seen that our level of assets has been relatively consistent over the last few quarters here. And that is because our balance sheet, as we talk about often, is driven by our clients and the deposits that they place with us and then we then turn around and try to deploy those on the asset side. And we've been in this environment where there just hasn't been much activity one direction or another. And I think that it's difficult at this point to really look out and determine what direction that could go. When you have situations such as the fiscal cliff, you have tag at the end of the year, which may or may not go away. It's difficult to determine whether our clients will place more deposits with us or if they'll look to do other things because they're more comfortable with the environment. So that's the first part of it. Now within that, the mix of earning assets and how we deploy those, certainly to the extent that we can provide credit to our customers, to our clients, that is a priority. It's a priority one because it is clearly a service and product that they value, but also just from an earnings standpoint with the yield on that overall being, in this quarter 2.85%, that's the highest earning category for us out of the 3. The securities portfolio is one where we have tried to maintain the yield on that portfolio through a very difficult and decreasing interest rate environment, and we saw further pressure on that in the quarter. Now we do try to manage it in a way to keep our income levels at where they've been. And you did see us extend our duration in the quarter. So at this quarter, our index duration was 1 year, which is up from about 10 or 11 months last quarter. And if you look back to last year, it was closer to 8 months. So we have been comfortable given the outlook for interest rates to extend our duration, but we're going to be prudent about how we continue to do that. But that's one thing that we can do and have done. And then finally, the last category is the one, frankly, where we probably have the least amount of control to manage what we're doing there and that is with our bank placements because those are so short term in nature where we're taking deposits primarily from our custody clients and then we're looking to place those with other institutions on a short-term basis. And there, the maturity of that, the average maturity is closer to a month. So it's very short and we are much more subject to short-term market rates. So what we saw in the quarter was clearly a decline in the spreads on those deposits. If you look at that, I'll call it deposit and placement portfolio, which is about $19 billion, $15 billion of that is in non-U.S. dollar currencies. And so if you just look at what happened to interest rates on some of those securities during the quarter, those currencies during the quarter, we saw the ECB take the overnight rate down to 0. That clearly put pressure on our ability to redeploy those in a short-term fashion and get spreads. So that's the part that we have the least control over and the one that created the most pressure.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then my last question is with respect to new business, clearly solid momentum this quarter. I think in the past you guys talked about the Omnium deal or, I guess, your new rebranded hedge fund solutions service performing a little bit better than you thought. I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on where you're seeing incremental benefits, how big are these fees for you guys nowadays, what that could do to the, I guess, overall fee rate on the whole institutional business and things of that nature.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So as you pointed out, the Omnium acquisition clearly had strategic value to us and we see that in the new business that we're winning. And it's -- the new business, itself, has been very robust and very diverse. And I say that in the sense of it has been a combination of what I would call midsized wins with midsized hedge funds, but then also we've been very successful with some of the largest hedge funds as well. So the key there has been that our technology solution for clients is one that we feel we clearly have a competitive advantage with in the marketplace. So we expect that to continue. The other aspect of it is that it does allow us to win additional business with some of these hedge fund clients. So given that Northern Trust has a much broader service offering than where Omnium was previously positioned, it's enabled them to expand the breadth of their business as well. So, so far the results have been excellent and I would say that we continue to be very optimistic about the growth there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","First one, I know these numbers jump around a little bit but the non-U.S. interest-bearing deposits both ticked up in size, but also in the average yield paid. Now we're coming off a quarter where it went down. But I'm just curious on what circumstances lead to a pickup in the average fee paid because I just haven't seen that in a while. I'm not used to it.","Michael G. O'grady","No need to ask for forgiveness on that. The reason for that is the mix of the currencies that are in there. And a portion of our deposits are from institutions in Australia and are in Australian dollars. So the Australian interest rates, as you know, are much higher than they are in other parts of the world. And so depending on that mix, we will see an impact on our cost of funds. So that's the driver. If you take out the impact of the Aussie dollar on that line on our non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, the costs would be flat quarter-over-quarter, which I think is more consistent with what you'd expect.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Perfect. Did you spell out the one and not yet funded number and I missed it? In terms of new business flows have been good, but I'm not sure what's in the run rate versus not yet.","Beverly J. Fleming","Glenn, that's not a number that we have disclosed.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, Bev. No problem. And then just last one. I think you pointed out all the areas where Northern's making progress, on the capital front, on the asset growth, on the new business front, on the expense initiatives. It all is executing on the plan. I think we're hanging out in that same earnings run rate because of the obvious, on the revenue headwinds. So it feels like we're biding time, but improving the operating leverage potential of the company. So I'm curious on how you think about incremental margins might be on new revenues if and when we ever get past some of these headwinds. So I guess it's a question of incremental margins and margin improvement as revenues pick up.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, maybe one way I can address that because I think you're right on with the way that we are looking to drive the financials for the business, which is control those things that we can control and try to manage the other areas as best we can. And so we have been successful in increasing our pretax margin despite the headwinds that we've talked about. And in trying to think about the type of leverage that might provide us though in a different environment, one of the things that we look at is our expense base relative to our trust, investment and other servicing fees. And if you look at that ratio, just over time we've made consistent improvement in that ratio. So if you look back in 2011, I think it's about 127%. And then consistently through the quarters, I think we went down to 125% in the first quarter, then 118% and then this quarter 115%. So we are consistently being down the costs relative to the major fees in our business. That doesn't mean that we're not looking to also optimize on the other revenues in our business. It just means that we think that we have a greater control over the relationship between those 2.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I appreciate that lens. Finally, the last one is no other way to ask it than just ask it. You got a ton of capital. If you took a very crude view of even if earnings hung out in this area, you can return a whole lot more than you're returning now without denting the industry-leading capital ratios. So just curious, do you feel like you're holding back on areas that you'd like to grow, or am I misreading this, that the capital return potential for Northern is a lot bigger than what's currently happening?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So on the capital front, you are correct that we feel very good about our capital position. And it certainly is adequate and more than adequate to support all of the capital needs that we have. And I mean that in a sense of all the growth that you're seeing in the business and other growth initiatives that we have. We have adequate capital to fund those. And as far as returning capital to shareholders, it is absolutely a priority for the management team and the board to do that. And as you've seen, we've looked to do an increasing amount of that within the context of the environment we're in and I say that with regard to not just the evolving capital standards, but also the interaction with the regulators and your ability to return capital. So we were able to repurchase $50 million of stock in this quarter. We still have another $140 million from our 2012 capital plan. We're approaching the 2013 capital plan, as I mentioned, in addition to just feeling good about our capital position. We'll get to the end of the year before we submit that, see what the environment looks like and look to put together a plan that we feel addresses both our desires, but also those of shareholders and also meets with what the regulators would expect and one that we believe they would not object to.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on the PFS business. Obviously, we knew about the pricing lag from last quarter as a drag on revenues. But I was just wondering if you can just talk about client flows and wins given that the overall revenue line was kind of flattish. So can you just walk -- kind of walk us through the net market impact versus what you're seeing and continuing to see on the client side and within the private bank?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. In PFS, Ken, I would say that the market impact in this quarter was relatively neutral. As you know, the global family office part of the business is on a quarter lag and markets were down. The regions are on a monthly lag and that was basically flat to up just a little bit. So overall, not much market impact. We continue to be very successful in winning new business. As you know, the nature of that business is it is more singles and doubles, if you will, so it's a very consistent growth rate and we continued to see that in the third quarter. Having said that, we think that we're also seeing the effects of the uncertain environment on PFS as well as far as prospective clients making decisions. So our pipeline is as strong as ever and we are winning new business, but the rate at which we're converting has slowed down a little bit here or slowed down, I should say, in the third quarter as a result in our view of elections, fiscal cliff, et cetera. So we still feel very good about the longer-term prospects, but it is one that I would say, in this environment, makes it a little more challenging.","Beverly J. Fleming","And Ken, the only thing that I would add to that to reiterate a point that Mike made during the prepared remarks is that we do have some fees that we earn in our personal business which are not tied to asset levels. And they can be either uneven from quarter-to-quarter, or in some cases seasonal. And the 2 that we highlighted were estate settlement and tax preparation. And those can have an impact on the overall numbers. So I just want to reiterate that as Mike said in the prepared comments.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I appreciate that. Great. And then, I just want to actually extend that conversation to the custody side. I know you hit on this a little bit in custody which is also a lag business. But pipelines also seem like they continue to be strong, and I know we talked recently about the elongation there, too. Can you give us a flavor for types of mandates that are in the pipeline, complexity and kind of time to sell, if anything's changed on that front?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So, as far as the types of wins that we're achieving here, I would say that they really do run across the institutional business. So as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing very nice new business in HFS, in our Hedge Funds Services business. But we're also seeing very nice wins in our more traditional large corporate area as well. And then as far as size, the size also -- very diversified but I would say that we do have certain wins which, given the larger size, have a longer time frame to get implemented. And so, if anything, I don't think it's changed as much on the decision-making time frame as much as we see some extension on the implementation front. So overall, good, very good. But as far as when they actually flow into revenue in certain cases, it's a little bit longer.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my last one is just, I know this gets brought up most quarters, but again just given what we've seen and what you think about volatilities and being low in the foreign exchange business, can you just talk about where FX is from a structural perspective, and if there isn't any change in flow activity that you're seeing better or worse from the custody base?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So overall, and I think this is consistent with what you can see in the observable markets, clearly, just flows are down in the market, generally speaking. And so our client flows or volumes have been down pretty consistent with that. As far as structural changes, Ken, I mean, what I would say on that front just for us is that we continue to execute foreign exchange for our core custody clients. But we certainly are looking to expand that business to non-custody clients as well, so third-party clients. And on that front, while we've begun to do it, I think that there's still much more opportunity for us. Like most things, we're approaching it in a very methodical way, trying to make sure that it's something that we do that is both -- provides growth to us, but also in a very profitable way and with the right amount of risk. So I would say that's the structural change. That, in addition to just the technological change in the business where certainly more of it is electronic and, likewise on that front, we are adapting our means of execution to match up with what clients prefer to do.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And does that take an element of investment or is this stuff that's already on the books from the cost perspective?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. It certainly requires investment. But it's investment that is part of, I would say, our normal capital expenditures. It's not something that's going to be incremental to that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just to tag onto Ken's question on the FX trading. I guess, going forward, if currency volatilities improve and generally client volumes improve over the next say, I don't know, you're looking out a couple years, would you expect your FX trading to move up in lockstep? Or do you think some of those sort of structural headwinds will potentially overcome that or at least slow down that normal cyclical pickup?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So to the extent that volumes and volatility improve, we certainly expect that we would see an improvement in our foreign exchange trading income in the same way that we've seen a decline as a result. Having said that, with the structural point that you make there, we look at that as an opportunity so not as a threat per se. So I don't -- whether things move in lockstep or not, hard to say. But it's an important area for us, one that we've been focused on making sure that we are well positioned vis-\u00e0-vis the marketplace. And so as the environment changes, we'd like to think that we're at least as well positioned, if not better positioned, as it goes forward.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on the -- just going over the average balance sheet, can you explain what you did in the government-sponsored agency portfolio to get the yield up to 74 basis points from 64 basis points? Was that purely a duration extension strategy or are there other elements of that?","Michael G. O'grady","No. As I mentioned in net interest income, we had $5 million in an adjustment for premium amortization in the quarter, and that relates to that particular line. Basically, as you know, within our investment portfolio, we have securities that have either premiums or discounts and those need to be amortized or accreted through net interest income over their estimated lives. And the estimated lives were revised due to our ability to better project out what the lives are on those types of securities so -- securities where you have variable cash flows. And so in doing so, we needed to essentially have a catch-up in the premium amortization that's in there and so it was lower during this time period. It is strictly a timing element. So it doesn't change the ultimate amount that goes through the income statement, and it's a, I would call it small portion of our overall total premium on our securities in the portfolio.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then what kind of duration are you -- or maturity profile are you looking for in that segment of the portfolio, the GSA part?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. In that part of the portfolio, that tends to be a little bit shorter than our average duration, where average duration I mentioned we're closer to 1 year right now. So it will be inside of that because a portion of that is for our liquidity profile. And so we want to have a shorter duration on that piece, given those types of securities.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just you described the Australian deposit mix shift impacting the non-U.S. office time deposits, how about the asset side of that? Is there a lag impact of that in terms of being able to realize a higher growth yield on that, that would be, I guess, laid off in interest-bearing deposits on the asset side?","Michael G. O'grady","There's no lag but there definitely is an effect. So we have both assets and liabilities that are denominated in Australian dollars. And the impact on that you see and, I would say, and somewhat makes it a little more difficult to understand some of the trends you see in the yields and the cost there. If you were to exclude the impact of the Australian dollar, what you would have seen in the quarter is that instead of our yields going down by 3 basis points, they would have gone down by 6 basis points. And that, again, is because Australian dollar rates are higher than rates around the world for the most part. Having said that, on the cost side, instead of the cost going up 6 basis points, they would have been flat. So the spread there would have been 6 instead of 9. So the decrease in Australian dollar spreads essentially accounted for 3 basis points of the decline in our net interest spread overall.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay, and there's no way to sort of mitigate that with investing in different types of, I guess, going out investing in securities in that part of the portfolio at all?","Michael G. O'grady","Well, the nature of what we're doing there right now is very short-term with regard to the clients. So that portfolio is similar to the rest of the bank placement profile which is about 1 month on average. So at this point, given the size of our Australian dollar portfolio and the need for liquidity, there really isn't much opportunity to significantly extend duration.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay, and then just last question, can you talk a little bit about the effort to reprice the core business up? I know it's a multi-year conversation that you have with clients. Maybe just update us on the progress and your ability to reprice the core fees up in lieu of the lower SEC lending and FX that you're getting from those clients.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So as I did mention, we did see incremental success in the third quarter with C&IS with regard to their Driving Performance initiatives on the revenue side. And it's come through a combination of, as you mentioned, repricing parts of the business, but also through improved cross-sell, so where we have, with the client, determined other opportunities for us which improves the overall client profitability. At this stage, we have gone through over half of all the clients in that business and had discussions with them with regard to the relationship, and where we see opportunities to work with them more and where we see opportunity just for us to \"do less\" in the sense of not provide certain, whether it's reports or services or whatever it may be that they don't value. So it's really -- it's all about aligning the value propositions we've talked about with them. And so as I mentioned, third quarter, we saw improved revenue as a result of that, and yet we're still in the early stages. As much as I say we've had conversations with over half of the clients on that front, we don't think that we're near halfway through what the revenue upside will be there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First one, maybe in terms of new business initiatives, a couple of your competitors have pointed to a collateral management. One's obviously in it, one's talked about building a capability. I mean, do you have any thoughts about that as a potential area for future growth for yourselves? Or any other kind of new businesses you maybe pondering?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I mean we do some collateral management, although it is not a large business for us, and I would not say this is an area that we would highlight as a strategic initiative to grow. But there are definitely areas that we have targeted. One area which we've talked about within our investments business is the ETFs. And with that, we have taken a very differentiated approach to the marketplace. We're not looking to compete with the more commoditized side of the ETF market but rather developing products that are customized for our client base, and we've seen significant growth in that from a standing start. So that would be an example of a new area or business that we've gotten into.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right. And maybe going back to thinking about the balance sheet a little bit, I mean, as pointed out earlier, maybe it was Glenn, I forget that, balance sheet has been kind of flattish, more or less, last year or so. And I'm just kind of curious, I mean, some of your peers have seen, I guess, fairly reasonable balance sheet growth and they tend to tie it oftentimes to growth in their underlying custody business just to the extent that they're expanding relationships and taking on new clients. And you guys certainly have had plenty of success in growing that part of your business. So is there something about kind of the mix of the clients you're bringing on that, for whatever reason, you're not seeing as much flow through in terms of deposits from them? Or is it just not a -- any color you could provide on that?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. We definitely see an increase in our balance sheet related to the growth of our business overall. However, it is not going to always be linear because we don't lead with the balance sheet, if you will. And so it has more to do with also what their behavior is or what their needs are. And let me break it down between the personal business and the institutional business. On the personal side, we have seen this increase in deposits, particularly demand deposits, over the last couple years. And then it stabilized. And much of that is more because of our clients' behavior, if you will, which is they were looking for safety. They wanted to have a higher proportion of their assets on the balance sheet in the form of cash. To the extent that, that changes over time and we have seen it change over time a little bit, they tend to then move those assets from our balance sheet into other products or services, often case, it can be some of our funds. So that's how that behavior works. But over time, if you looked at the deposits and the loans related to our personal business, you would see that it's increased over time as the business has grown, and as the fee part of the business has grown as well. On the institutional side, likewise in general, there clearly is the relationship between the growth of the business overall and the deposits. And even in this quarter, you did see a sequential increase in our non-U.S. office deposits. And that does relate to just the underlying growth of the business. But their cash needs and balance sheet needs also fluctuate depending on their own needs and their own perspectives on the marketplace. And I would say, the environment that we're in right now has been, for some time period, a relatively low-risk environment and we haven't seen that necessarily change. But when that does or if that does change to a different type of environment, it can affect not only the level of deposits they have with us. And it could even go down, but it usually results in some other type of activity that is favorable to us because, certainly, the securities lending part of our business benefits from greater activity and a greater risk appetite, and the same thing for the foreign exchange part of our business. So the balance sheet there is something that, in general, grows with it but I wouldn't say that it is something that's lockstep.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one more question, if I could, on the C&IS asset management business. You've touched on the ETF business but any color you could provide on new business flows? I'm assuming it's still clearly dominated by index. But any kind of change of the investor behavior or pipelines? And then maybe also a brief update on the manager of managers business, if you're seeing any traction there or improved traction?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So as far as the institutional business, again, we have seen nice growth there. And as you pointed out, and I mentioned in my earlier comments, we see nice growth in the index business. And we think that, that's consistent with the broader trends and that the indexing that we're providing is essentially customized indexing, if you will, where we are looking to not just provide a traditional or commoditized index product, but rather something where we create a proprietary index for a client and then provide the indexing for them. So that business has grown nicely, both equity index as well as fixed income index. We've also seen assets grow in the money market funds as well. And again I think that can fluctuate over time and depends on the profile, the investment profile of our clients, but we have seen growth there in the recent quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The pace of buyback accelerated to $50 million this quarter. But it still looks like that amount is a lag in the current capital plan. Is that consistent with the way you look at it, Mike? And if so, just what's the constraining factor to maybe not buying back faster right now?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. It's very -- it is higher than we were in previous quarters. So we've seen an increase each quarter. It was $15 million then $35 million and then $50 million and, as you mentioned, we have $140 million remaining. And our capital plan did break out the repurchases into quarters. And I would just say we are executing consistent with our capital plan.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then realizing credit quality is fairly de minimis in the context of your entire business. But was just hoping you can provide a bit more detail in the new NPA formation you felt there in the quarter. What's driving that? Is that focused on any specific geographic or customer segment?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So we did see an increase in our nonperforming assets. And the nature of our portfolio, as you would expect, is relatively granular, given both the size and the nature of the credits. And so what happened in, if you go back to first quarter versus second quarter where there was a decline there, that was a result of a couple large credits that previously were nonperforming and went back to performing or paid off. And in this quarter again it was a handful of credits that went from performing to nonperforming. And these were split between commercial real estate and residential real estate. So when these couple went nonperforming, you're going to see it in our numbers just given both the low number of credits that we have and the size of those credits. And as far as geographically, there's no area of concentration. Our footprint as you know in the U.S. and with our personal business West Coast, the Central region and East. And I would say it was a little bit of each of those that we saw in the quarter.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just a quick numbers one. With respect to the other income bucket, if you strip out this quarter's gain, you noted the higher income related to Employee Benefits held in trust and then some increased credit and leasing related revenues. Can you provide a sense of how significant those were and do those recur?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So those 3 items that you mentioned account for the vast majority of the remainder. There were a couple, as I mentioned, that category includes a number of items but the Employee Benefit related assets. So those are for nonqualified benefit plans which we hold on our balance sheet. But generally, they offset each other between other operating income and other expense, and it just depends on what happens to the assets in the portfolio during that time period relative to the liability in the plan. But those are generally correlated and so you see it in both line items. And then the higher credit-related fees, mostly in commercial, but that category also includes them in our personal business as well. As far as recurring, nonrecurring, certainly the credit-related service fees, I mean, that's a more recurring fee stream. It's included in that category, but it fluctuates less, whereas the Employee-Benefit related depends more on the market activity, Howard. And so it does tend to go up and go down and you'll see it on the revenue side, it's generally offset in the expense side but it can cause fluctuations in both line items.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just finally for me, as I imagine you're pretty deep in the budgeting process right now. I'm just trying to visualize the ultimate payoff of the Driving Performance program balanced with just ongoing franchise reinvestment over the next few years. So just maybe, as a rough benchmark, if revenues like were just flat from today, I mean, where do your expenses ultimately shake out? And what do expenses do, if maybe revenues are up or down 10% from just current overall levels?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So you're right. We're in the middle of -- in budgeting, certainly. It's difficult to deal with the hypothetical but let me try to address it this way which is even in a flat revenue environment, we are going to face, like most companies, natural expense headwinds. So there are just certain costs that are going to go up, whether that's because you have incremental depreciation from continued capital investment in your business, whether it's related to inflation for certain costs, whether it's related to transaction volume levels that don't necessarily translate into incremental revenues for you overall because we can have our fees up and our transaction levels up, but we are going to have FX or net income down like we did this quarter. So you still have that. What we're obviously attempting to do is to offset that with Driving Performance which is what you've seen and we've more than offset that. In this year, as I mentioned, we're over $100 million now. We'll see where we end up the fourth quarter but clearly, we will achieve over half of the $250 million we talked about. And then in next year, the incremental amount is going to be less than what we had. And that's just natural with some of this that, of course, we went after the larger dollars first. And so with each year, Howard, it gets more difficult to offset those, I'll call it, natural expense headwinds unless you get some revenue growth. Now the key is to the extent that you do get some revenue growth, that the expenses don't just go up with that at the same rate. But rather that we create some operating leverage with that. And so that is our objective, both with Driving Performance and in general, is to be able to offset this low to no revenue growth environment that we've been in because of the headwinds, but also then create operating leverage for when we think that those revenue headwinds subside.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So it's a pretty tough environment, I can imagine. You said you've had some success on repricing C&IS. But even with that repricing, the way we look at it, total processing fees to assets under custody are at a 7-year low in the third quarter. And you can slice and dice that in a lot of different ways, but it's tough. So one question is how much is structural and how much is cyclical? And I know it's a very difficult question, but you kind of need to have some answer for yourselves to determine how much you really want to cut. Or is my logic wrong here?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So a couple comments, Mike, which is I would agree that some of it is cyclical and some of it is structural. And as a result, we do not look at it and say, we're just at a time period where the cyclical piece is down, and we don't need to worry about that longer term, we do. Now apportioning the amount that should go to cyclical versus structural is more difficult. Clearly, the headwinds that we faced here with regard to the revenues are with regard to rates and FX. Structurally -- and I think you can also put in there, in general, securities lending. Structurally, I think that there are also aspects that have changed particularly with regard to FX and securities lending. So the expectations that we would have with regard to a client in the level of FX activity, securities lending activity and the profitability from that is reduced on a structural view going forward. We still think that, that is a service that clients are interested in, and that we are well positioned to provide to them, and as we can price very effectively for them and still be very profitable for us. But not necessarily expecting it to go back to the levels that it was before. So as a result, we have to look at how do we rationalize the expense side so that we maintain the level of profitability that we think is appropriate for the business and to have capacity to invest in it longer term. So that's everything where I talked about Driving Performance. Yes, it's to deal with the immediate impact of it. But it's also to have a longer-term approach to the business that is not just focused on the growth, but also focused on productivity. And when you say, \"How do you look at that longer term?\" I mentioned a little bit earlier in the call where we look at that expense base, not necessarily just to revenues, you have to look at that because that's the way the financial statements work. But also looking at that expense base relative to the fee lines that we think we have greater control in growing over time. And we've been successful over the last several quarters of bringing that ratio down, but we still have further to go with that ratio.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then to ask the same question a little bit differently, how much would you attribute to volume which you said was at a 5-year low or maybe more than 5 years? Volatility, which you also said is at a 5-year low and rates?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I mean, I would -- trying to think how to estimate between the 2 because they hit 2 different lines, if you will. But I would say the more immediate impact here -- we've been able to offset the rate part, Mike, more effectively than we have the reduction in volatility and volumes and FX. So right now the impact has been greater on that line.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And when you say offset the impact on rate, how so? Because you've waived some service charges and stuff like that.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So that has been one area that has come down. So in this quarter, for example, it's $17 million. That compares to $29 million a year-ago quarter. So we have in that way that, that's come down. But also I was focused a little more on net interest income where as much as it is down this quarter, we've been able to generally maintain about the same level of net interest income by trying to manage the balance sheet through that. And some of it just -- the balance sheet has increased as a result of more deposits on the balance sheet. But it's also how we manage the securities portfolio as well.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then last question. I mean, I guess 2 or 3 people asked this question but your Tier 1 Basel III ratio is 13%, you trade at 1.5x book value and you only bought back 1.1 million shares. Are you not allowed to buy back more? Or it seems to me that you'd want to buy back a whole lot of stock, are you constrained somehow? And if not, why not be more aggressive?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. We are clearly constrained by the capital plan that we submitted at the beginning of this year and was not objected to by the Federal Reserve. So we have to execute according to that. We will submit a new plan at the end of this year for 2013. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, we'll take a lot of things into account. But certainly, some of the comments that you mentioned there are things that we take into account about how we feel about our capital position as well, which is very good.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Lucas Montgomery","I know you discussed it a lot already, but I did want to try to take one more stab at FX. You came out of the industry litigation looking pretty smart. You appear to have kept your nose clean and as far as we know, you're not named in any lawsuits. But your FX results over the last year have been a lot weaker than your peers. So I'm just wondering, is there something structurally different about your FX business that's driving that result? I know you mentioned plans to grow at third party execution in your earlier comments, but I mean, is that the entire difference between you and peers? Any additional insight there would be really helpful.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So I would say that we didn't have what I would call a significant negative impact as a result of what's happened in the FX area over the last couple of years. But we haven't been able to, as you put it, take advantage of any dislocation there. Part of that is because our business has been focused on our custody clients. So we largely have been able to maintain those clients, grow clients over time but at the same time, the market has been down. But to the extent that a non-client has been interested in doing their FX elsewhere because we haven't been very active in third-party, we haven't been able to take advantage of that. And instead, where you would see it is a longer-term effect where if a client is upset about a different situation enough that they actually switch their custody business and their asset servicing business, and we win that business, then we would be in a position to do it. So it would have had a lag effect to it. Having said that, as I mentioned, that's one of the reasons why we are doing more in the third-party area and look to do more going forward so that not only we can just compete in that but take advantage of any opportunities that we should have.","Lucas Montgomery","Okay, that's very helpful. Second one is can you talk a little bit about where you are in terms of expanding back office support? I know there was some discussion a while back about being at capacity in Bangalore and you had plans to expand into other geographies. And there's been some anecdotal concern that you could use a little more scale just in terms of people or personnel, if you're going to win some of the larger deals particularly in middle office outsourcing. And I think that was also one of the reasons you didn't announce bigger targets on the efficiency program, the fact that you needed to add to back-office. So just where are we on that front?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So we have a global operating model that we utilize. And as you mentioned, Bangalore is one of the locations there and helps us serve clients in that region, as well as around the world. And we continue to look at how we would expand that. That does involve looking at our capacity levels in Bangalore, but it also looks at other markets where we can expand. We've expanded in Ireland more recently, and we are looking at new locations around the world as well. And the key to it is that we don't want to be overly concentrated in one region, and we want to be in a place where we can not only service clients in a particular geographical region, but that we can also continue to have the most efficient, around-the-clock processing for our clients. So I would say that, that global operating model is one that we feel good about right now, but at the same time, are constantly looking at how we would expand that.","Lucas Montgomery","Okay. And last one for me, I tried this question on one of your competitors, but I figured I'd try it with you. Is there any clarity around the potential capital impact under new regulations related to securities lending indemnifications? And could that be a big deal for you? I mean, I know you're an excess capital position but...","Michael G. O'grady","Sure, yes. Unfortunately, there is not clarity around that. It is something that we are focused on and others in the industry are focused on in order to get clarity. Depending on the final rule on that, it could definitely have an impact on securities lending. That's one of the categories. There are several others, but it's on our list. It would not change how we feel about our capital adequacy, though.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Beverly J. Fleming","Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you in January on our fourth quarter call.

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to Northern Trust fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $267 million. Earnings per share were $1.11, and our return on common equity was 11.9%. Our assets under custody administration and under management increased 11%, 10% and 8% respectively compared to the prior year, reflecting favorable markets and our continued success in winning new business. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients.","Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the fourth quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 9.5% year-over-year and up 3.3% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 2.3% year-over-year and up 6.7% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and third quarter markets were also up compared to the prior year, as well as sequentially.","In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was down four-tenths of a percent compared to last year, and down 3.8% sequentially. Currency volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was 8% higher than the fourth quarter of last year and six-tenths of a percent higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were mixed in the fourth quarter. As reported by one interbank broker, volumes were up 2% sequentially, but now 3% compared to one year ago. You\u2019ll recall that the currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income.","Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, while benefiting expense growth, both for the year-over-year and sequential comparisons. The British pound ended the third quarter 16.5% lower than one year ago and 5% lower sequentially. The euro ended the quarter 3.2% lower than one year ago and 5.8% lower sequentially.","U.S. short-term interest rates were higher during the quarter. Most evident in three-month LIBOR which averaged 92 basis points in the quarter compared to 79 basis points in the prior quarter, and 41 basis points one year ago. Elsewhere, after 25 basis points reduction during the third quarter, the Bank of England total official bank rate steady in the fourth quarter.","Let\u2019s move on to page three and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 7% with non-interest income up 6% and net interest income up 11%. Expenses increased 6%, producing 1.2 points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $22 million. Net income was 11% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison revenue was up 2% with non-interest income up 1%, and net interest income up 6%. Expenses were up 4% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 3% higher sequentially.","Return on average common equity was 11.9% for the quarter, up from the 11.1% reported one year ago, and up from the 11.7% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.7 trillion increased 11% compared to one year ago, and were flat on a sequential basis. In the year-over-year comparison, solid new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar.","For the sequential comparison, the impact of the stronger dollar fully offset the favorable impact of markets and new business. Assets under management were $942 billion, up 8% year-over-year and flat on a sequential basis. Favorable market impacts in new business throughout the year-over-year growth.","Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page four. Fourth quarter revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was approximately $1.2 billion, up 7% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $794 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter.","Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver of the performance compared to last year. Fee waivers were essentially zero in the fourth quarter compared to $20.5 million one year ago. Fee waivers were not a factor in the sequential comparison.","Foreign exchange trading income was $50 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. Both comparisons benefitted from higher client volumes, as well as higher volatility. Other non-interest income was $65 million in the fourth quarter, down 5% from last year and down 6% sequentially. Other operating income in the current quarter included charges of $8.1 million related to the decision to exit the portion of a non-strategic loan in this portfolio. The prior quarter\u2019s results included a charge of $5.4 million related to this portfolio.","The decline compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the $8.1 million charge in the current quarter, partially offset by growth relating to the Aviate acquisition, which closed during the second quarter. The decline, sequentially, was primarily due to the larger charge in the current quarter related to the loan and lease portfolio. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $329 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 11% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially.","Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $457 million in the fourth quarter, up 7% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody & Fund Administration fees, the largest component of C&ISs, were $303 million, up 6% compared to the prior and up 1% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons benefitted from new business and favorable equity markets, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates.","Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.2 trillion at quarter-end, up 11% year-over-year and flat sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the unfavorable currency exchange rates. Recall that land and market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund waivers. As was the case in the prior two quarters, fee waivers in C&IS were essentially zero during the fourth quarter compared to $8 million one year ago. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $694 billion, up 7% year-over-year but down 1% sequentially.","Securities lending fees were $25 million in the fourth quarter, 13% higher than one year ago and 9% higher sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by increased spreads, primarily relating to the widening of the spread between the LIBOR and overnight rates. The sequential growth was driven by improved spreads, as well as higher volumes. Security lending collateral was a $112 billion at quarter end, and averaged $119 billion across the quarter.","Average collateral levels decreased 4% year-over-year and were up 5% sequentially. The decline in volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. The sequential increase of volumes was influenced by market appreciation, increased demand for U.S. treasuries and a larger supply of securities available to lend. Securities lending activities has been impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage.","Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the fourth quarter, up 1% for both year-over-year and sequential comparisons, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services.","Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $338 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year but flat sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the global family office business had strong performance with fees increasing 19% year-over-year and 4% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers compared to one year ago, as well as favorable markets and new business.","Performance within the regions also benefited from lower money market fee waivers compared to last year, as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in the Wealth Management were essentially zero in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $13 million year-over-year. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $248 billion at quarter end, up 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.","Moving to page six, net interest income was $329 million in the fourth quarter, up 11% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $108 billion in the fourth quarter, up 3% versus last year, driven by higher level deposits and short-term borrowings. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, increased 1% year-over-year and non-U.S. office interest bearing deposits, which averaged $52 billion, were up 2% year-over-year.","Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the fourth quarter and were flat compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.2% in the fourth quarter and was up nine basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets due to higher short-term interest rates.","On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up 6% as average earning assets were up 1%, while the net interest margin increased 6 basis points sequentially, driven by lower premium amortization and higher short-term interest rates. Premium amortization was $10 million in the fourth quarter compared to less than $1 million one year ago, and $20 million in the third quarter.","Turning to page seven, expenses were $874 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Compensation expense of $391 million increased 7% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth was attributable to staff growth, base pay adjustments, which were effective October 1st, and higher performance based compensation, partially offset by favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick and Tempe, Arizona.","Employee benefit expense of $77 million included $4 million relating to non-U.S. pension settlements. Benefit expense, including this item, was up 12% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher medical cost, payroll taxes and pension related expense. On a sequential quarter basis, benefit expense was up 6%, driven by higher pension related expense, partially offset by lower medical costs.","Outside services expense of $161 million was up 4% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher market data costs within technical services. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense was up 2% primarily driven by higher consulting expense relating to regulatory work, as well as initiatives such as cyber security. This was partially offset by lower sub-custody costs.","Equipment and software expense of $121 million was up 3% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were primarily driven by increased software amortization, continuing our technology strategy as we invest to support clients, improve employee efficiency and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Occupancy expense of $47 million was up 7% from one year ago and up 6% sequentially. Growth in occupancy expense has been driven by higher rent, as well as $2 million early termination penalty recorded in the current quarter.","Other operating expense of $78 million increased 4% year-over-year, primarily related to higher FDIC costs and advertising. Sequentially, the category increased 9%, primarily due to increased business promotion and advertising expense. Advertising spend during the quarter was strategically focused on wealth management markets and our ETF FlexShare products. It is worth noting that on a full year basis our total business promotional spent was down 2% from the prior year.","Our loan loss provision was a credit of $22 million in the fourth quarter. The credit provision in the current quarter was primarily driven by improved credit quality in the underlying data used in the quantitative portion of the inherent allowance for credit losses that resulted in a reduction in the allowance described to the residential real-estate and private client portfolios. The credit provision was partially offset by an increase to a specific reserve in the commercial portfolio that was charged off during the current quarter.","Credit quality during the quarter remained strong with non-performing assets totaling $165 million compared to $181 million in the prior quarter, and $188 million one year ago. Non-performing loans to total loans equaled only 47 basis points at quarter end.","Turning to the full year, our results in 2016 are summarized on page eight. Net income was $1.03 billion, up 6% compared with 2015 and earnings per share were $4.32, up 8% compared with the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outline the non-recurring impacts that were called-out in our second quarter 2016 earnings release. The net revenue impact of these items was $96.6 million, while the expense related charges were $82.6 million. The page also outlines the non-recurring impact from the second quarter of 2015, which included net revenue impact of $82.1 million and an expense charge of $45.8 million.","We achieved a return on equity for the year of 11.9%. This performance was within our target range of 10% to 15%, and an improvement from our 2015 performance.","Full year revenue expense trends are outlined on page nine. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 4% in 2016. Lower fee waivers and new business across segments and geographies contributed to this result, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable equity markets and unfavorable currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange trading income declined 10%, primarily reflecting mixed volumes across the year compared to prior year.","Other non-interest income was down 2% from last year, and was down 3% if adjusted for the items I called out on the prior page. Net interest income increased 15%, and was up 13% if you exclude the items I called out on the prior page. The growth in net interest income was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates, coupled with earning asset growth. The net result was growth in overall revenue in 2016 both on a reported basis and also if you exclude the items I called out on the prior page.","On a reported basis, expenses were up 6% from the prior year, adjusting for the expenses charges, the expense charges in both 2015 and 2016 that I mentioned in the prior page. Expenses were up 5% from 2015, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of business, as well as to comply with the evolving regulatory requirements.","Turning to page 10, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we\u2019ve made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to Trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from what it was previously as high as 131 in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement and our return on equity.","This metric remains an important parameter of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward, from continuing to win new business to drive fee growth, and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, procurement and technology.","Turning to page 11, our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 12.4% and 11.8% respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.1% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 11.5%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conversation buffer.","The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.7% at the bank and 6% -- at the corporation with 6.7% and at the bank 6.0%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement, effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective on January 1, 2017.","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 823,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $65 million.","In closing, in 2016, we continue to grow the firm profitability for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients and improve our technology and infrastructures to ensure the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered return on average common equity of 11.9% for the full year, moving further into our target range of 10% to 15%. We produced $1.03 billion of net income, surpassing the $1 billion mark for the first time in our corporation\u2019s history. In addition, we returned $778 million to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital and liquidity ratios.","Our C&IS business continue to demonstrate strong growth in 2016. Total revenue grew 8% and trust fees grew 5%, even with the strong dollar hurting fees by 2%. We continue to build on our product solutions and capabilities evidenced by our Aviate acquisition. Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 6% year-over-year and continued to produce attractive margins, achieving 38% pre-tax margin for the year. Our focus on large markets pay dividends as we saw strong growth in location such as New York City and Houston. We were also pleased to be named best private bank by Professional Wealth Management and The Banker magazines.","Our asset management business had success as well as evidenced by the strong growth and reflects shares ETFs, with assets growing from $7.6 billion at year-end 2015 to almost $12 billion by the end of 2016. Lastly, we continue invest in innovation and technology. Our efforts around robotics, artificial intelligence, distributor ledger, cloud and others continue to advance and are set to help us operate more efficiently and create superior solutions for our clients.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I will be happy to answer your questions. Alicia, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll go first to Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Glenn. Hello?","Operator","Glenn, please check your mute function, you might be on mute.","Glenn Schorr","So I guess, I just want to talk about -- well it could be just some timing differences and some fee compression between AUC, AUM year-on-year and sequentially and in the fee rate. So it\u2019s the age old question of, if assets under custody and assets under management are up 11% and 8% year-on-year, Trust fees were like up maybe 6%. I\u2019m curious, if you could talk to just what\u2019s mix versus what\u2019s timing versus lag pricing?","Biff Bowman","So, we\u2019ll be composed that a bit. The first thing that I would say, overtime, the correlation between AUC and fees holds up, but in any given quarter, we could have large inflows or outflows that could skew that. So, that\u2019s one factor to start there, but more specific. As we\u2019ve grown our global fund services business over the past three to five years, the traditional lag that you\u2019ve seen in fees has actually start to migrate away from quarterly lags and more to a balanced or 50-50 type one-month versus three-month type lag overall on our fees. So, you need to consider perhaps a different lag impact in the market when we do that.","Also in this quarter, currency impacts were quite meaningful in the fourth quarter. So, that correlation between the assets under custodies and the fees were impacted meaningfully by the currency, particularly the Sterling weakening sequentially. So, combined all of those, explain what I think you\u2019re referring to as maybe disconnect between the AUC growth and the actual fee line. I would end with, in the wealth space too, there is still continued compression. So, the compression that you see, particularly in the wealth from migrations, from active to passive has helped mute some of the correlation between the AUC and the fees.","Mark Bette","Glenn, the other thing I would add to is with AUC and AUM, obviously, those were point in time. So they don\u2019t always think up with how fees might build or accrue for over the course of the quarter. But we have the C&IS side when we look at the fund or the custody in the fund number type revenues versus the AUC over a longer period. We\u2019ve seen what we think the fee rates there to hold up pretty well.","Glenn Schorr","And maybe just one purposely simple question on the expense side, I think each of the line items are a little higher than I thought than I think other people thought. Could you talk about what you think are good jumping-off point as we go forward versus not? Like, I know, we have the employee benefits special issue but\u2026","Biff Bowman","So, if I could, perhaps there is three items that I think are worthy of special mention in the quarter. The first is the $4 million pension settlement accounting issue that you see in benefits. It\u2019s a quite technical accounting issue, but it is, in essence, if there are departures and\/or outflows from our pension plans, and these were in the UK or Europe. It can trigger what is known as settlement accounting, which requires the booking if you will, the unrealized gains or losses in the portfolios. It\u2019s a relatively technical accounting issue that we saw happen in this quarter for the first time since I\u2019ve been CFO.","The second item that I think is worthy to call out is we did take an action on the occupancy line, a $2 million settlement to allow us for an early exit from space. So, we think it has a longer term benefit, but came with $2 million line item in occupancy. And there is a last item that I will call out is we had a significant sequential increase in business promotion that you would see approximately $5 million above what, if you look at historical run rates for us. And that was really an opportunistic business decision we took to add additional advertising and marketing in support of two of our very important growth initiatives, which is around our mega market strategy and in particular our flex share ETFs.","And the pricing in the market, the timing, was attractive and a decision was done to take that in the fourth quarter. So, that was $5 million increase that was within our control, the one that we felt would generate the right return for all involved. I would suggest those were items that are worthy of special mention for you to think about your models going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Brennan Hawken of UBS.","Brennan Hawken","So, wanted to touch-base, it seems like with the AUC movement in C&IS, I know, you touched on FX in your prepared remarks, Biff, but maybe unpacking that a little bit. Was that the driver of why we saw more or less flat sequential AUC, despite equity markets that were generally positive? Or was the headwind primarily given the rising yields, and therefore pressure on prices and bond markets?","Biff Bowman","No, the impact was almost all currency sequentially. In fact, I think, it was about 2 points sequentially for C&IS and that would have been a more normalized sequential growth rate historically. So, it was almost all explainable by currency sequentially for C&IS.","Brennan Hawken","Sequentially, 2 percentage points of growth, have you actually said?","Biff Bowman","That's correct.","Biff Bowman","And then next, second question here. Have you noticed any changes in risk appetite in your Wealth Management client base over the past few months given some of the significant moves we\u2019ve seen in the market? And how durable, if you\u2019re seeing any changes, how durable do you think those changes might be?","Biff Bowman","So I think there's been amongst our client base a bit of sense of optimism, if I could say that. Post election we have seen some positive flows into the equities in the fourth quarter. And we had slightly negative fixed income flows. So I would generally say that we have seen a positive demeanor towards risk, assets in the portfolio. And we think about the term money and motion. So, our wealth clients think about either investment or in their own businesses or opportunities to do more M&A.","We have just generally seen a tonal improvement, but not actual events happening at this point. But from an asset flow, we did see some move to equity some out of fixed income in the quarter, but a general tonally view from our wealth clients. Particularly given they also may be more optimistic about taxes which frees-up a disposable income as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Biff, maybe just focusing on the balance sheet., maybe if you can just review or refresh the leverage to LIBOR, say versus the 10 year in the loan and leases bucket in terms of getting through the 1% towards. How that might impact if we get commensurate move in LIBOR with the next debt hike?","Biff Bowman","I'll take a walk-through the balance sheet a little bit and the impacts from the rising rates, I think the best way to tackle. So if you look at our balance sheet, and I'm going to start with the securities portfolio and I know you talked long term leases, we'll get to that. If we look at the securities portfolio, roughly half of our securities portfolio, roughly half of the $45 billion, is what being the short-term portion of the portfolio. Those assets reprice relatively quickly and certainly under a year. And they are heavily impacted by one month and three months LIBOR movements, and more by one month than three month.","So the way we think about that is, over the fourth quarter, one month LIBOR averaged, I believe, 60 basis points. If you use a point in time today, I won't project the average for the first quarter. I'll let you do that in your models. But that's closer to 78 basis points today. We anticipate seeing the benefit of that flow-through in the securities portfolio, inside that year timeframe, we saw it relatively quickly. So, that's a positive, if you will, for the short-term portion of our securities portfolio. On the loan portfolio, we have a very short duration, if you will, as well on the loan portfolio with a meaningful portion. Mark, will get you the exact number here if we get through it. But a meaningful portion floating, I think, around 75% floating\u2026","Mark Bette","75% repricing within one year\u2026","Biff Bowman","Yes. So the benefits there are from three month LIBOR should flow through relatively quickly on that portion of the portfolio as well.","Brian Bedell","And are there floors to get through on those loans so that we should see more of the repricing in future quarters?","Biff Bowman","We'll get back to you on that. I don't believe so, but I want to confirm that when we follow back-up.","Brian Bedell","And then just on the core business in terms of, I guess, as we think of investment through going to next year. I know you want to keep that expense, because fee ratio improved upon that. But I would say how do you think about incremental margins to higher rates in terms of how you feel about project spend in building out the, mostly the assets servicing business, I guess, I would be thinking about?","Biff Bowman","Here\u2019s the way we think about that. And to improve the expense to fee ratio, we obviously have to drive fee operating leverage. So our fees have to grow faster than our expenses. In periods of time where net interest income or foreign exchange is constrained, we view that we need to widen out that fee operating leverage to produce the types of returns our shareholders expect. If net interest income and other items strengthen, then that, we still want to improve and maintain that fee operating leverage and improve it, as I said.","But the width of that or the amount of that operating leverage is something that we look at controlling, if I could. So, we still are absolutely committed to growing our fees faster than our expenses, and we did not achieve that for the full year last year. And I can assure you that that is something that is a focal point of the management team. If we do have the benefit of rising rates, we believe that they should widen out the total operating leverage for the firm, but we still want to see that expense to fees improved, even in improving rate environment, that's a key metric for us internally.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Just sticking up on that last point around the operating leverages, so to your point expenses to core fees were flattish, or that ratio didn\u2019t really improved in fact over the last two years, I guess now. Despite the fact that this year you guys did for coupon, 100% of money market fee waivers in equity markets were generally a little bit more supportive, bumpy but overall it's probably somewhat supportive. I guess what are the reasons why we haven\u2019t seen better operating leverage on sea side of the equitation in 2016? And since you think about 2017, what are some of the initiatives that you\u2019re trying to put into place to, just to your point, to still focus on improving it?","Biff Bowman","So, you\u2019re right, we had the benefit of fee waivers. Markets actually while up in absolute total the way they manifested themselves with the very rocky start, ended up not really being added and there were slight contractor year-over-year. And currency was also a meaningful contractor. So, they partially offset the waivers. So you\u2019re right in that comment. More importantly in the question is what are the initiatives, and we\u2019ve talked about many here. But let me try to give you something a little more tangible that we anticipate helping them.","We are in production now with three areas where we are relying or using robotics to improve our efficiency right now. In 2016, those were probably in proof-of-concept, and were probably accruing expenses to get ready in 2017 actually in the fourth quarter of 2016 late, we put those in, and we actually now have robotics working on three key functions. There is a pipeline of other areas inside of our enterprise enablement operation where we are looking at things like further robotics, artificial intelligence, and that pipeline will manifest during the course of the year.","But I hope it\u2019s a tangible example to show that maybe the expense accruing for those in 2016, we will start to get the operational benefits of those in 2017 as they go up in running in live. And we continue to look at things, like our procurement function. One of the larger drivers of our outside service ramp this year was in market data. We continue to look at ways to reduce our market data cost from a procurement perspective as well. And what I will say sort of a usage perspective, are we using it appropriately.","Alex Blostein","And then shifting gears, I wanted to touch on just the wealth management business. Again, it looks like outside of the global family office, revenues are down a little bit, kind of flattish over the last three quarters, or so. And I understand that the timing and certainly the mix-shift between active to passive is weighing on this. Can you help us dissect that a little bit more, just thinking through the movement from active to passive, what are the relevant fee rates within that revenue category that we need to think about, and either bucket? And what is the percentage, maybe elastics that are active versus passive, for you guys right now? Because it feels like that fee rate continues to drift lower?","Biff Bowman","Let me break the components down a little bit. The active to passive shift that we talk about, we\u2019ve absolutely seen that move up, but we don\u2019t give that number out. So we\u2019ve seen that move up from a modest percentage into something much more meaningful as we\u2019ve seen that shift each year. And so that is one of the drivers. But we break it down a little bit into, what I would say, are the asset management fees and the advisory fees that we charge our wealth clients.","The advisory fees has held relatively stable. We\u2019ve seen less of a compression in what we can charge on the advisory line. It\u2019s in the compression around the active to passive movement or other asset management products that has driven some of that flattening that you suggest you see in Wealth Management and we see as well in Wealth Management. So an example would be we\u2019ve seen flows out of our actively and actively priced multi-manager mutual fund family into more passive solutions. That is absolutely a fee compression issue along that change. Advisory fees, however, to our clients, while under constant competitive environment really been able to remain fairly flattish. So, you got to break it into two, it\u2019s really more of the asset management piece that\u2019s driving that compression as opposed to the fees in total.","Alex Blostein","But we don\u2019t know the relative sizing of the bucket range?","Biff Bowman","Actually, I don\u2019t have the breakdown. We\u2019ll think about that number.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Could you help us understand the magnitude in million dollars of the benefit from a 25 basis point increase in short-term rates? It just feels like from the disclosures in the 10-Q and so on, it\u2019s a little bit hard to get to a number. So can you help us to think about what sort of benefit we should see, and then how that breaks-down between what you\u2019ve already got in 4Q and what\u2019s still to come in 1Q?","Biff Bowman","So, we can\u2019t give the exact guidance. I\u2019m trying to repeat a little bit of what we said. If you look at our balance sheet and look at the pacing with which we would see the benefit of one month and three month LIBOR, largely impacting the short-end of the securities portfolio. And you can do your own calculations on that, and get to what the improvement in that is. The other exercise I would suggest that you look at is if you look at our improvement in net interest income year-over-year and take the balance sheet and make it comparable in size or look at any mix shifts, that\u2019s all information that you would have. You can see what that drove in terms of the year-over-year improvement from the first 25 basis point hike.","What I would suggest is that they just could be different with a second rate hike, and maybe that\u2019s another factor in there. Also, the other thing would be to look at what the premium amortization is year-over-year and the impact of that that potentially could have on that year-over-year. It depends on the data, but the 25 basis points that we just saw will definitely be beneficial to our net interest income. And we don\u2019t provide that guidance any further than that, we\u2019ll let you do that in your own model.","Geoffrey Elliott","I guess, maybe to focus on this a bit more. You gave some simulations, and the case and cues around for rates, 100 basis points higher, 200 basis points higher. But they don\u2019t really seem to marry up with what we see in the financials, and there actually is a moving rate, I mean, I think on the 200 basis points, you\u2019ve actually got a negative impact in there. So, is there anything you could do around the modeling assumptions on that sensitivity disclosure to get it a bit closer to what we see in reality, because otherwise it just feels like a disclosure that isn\u2019t of a lot of value because it doesn\u2019t seem to match up with what we have observed, in term the asset sensitivity seems to be a lot higher?","Biff Bowman","Well, first I would suggest that the disclosures that we put around our sensitivity of earnings are solely disclosure is done from a risk lens. It has above a projected curve, the returns above a projected curve. And the beta assumptions in there are derived from a risk lens from a conservative lens. So your assessment that it may or may not reflect exactly what would happen, it needs to be taken from an perspective of the risk disclosure. And I really can\u2019t say much more than that, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Just wondering, can you quantify for us, both on a fourth quarter and full year basis, what the impact of FX was on revenues and expenses?","Biff Bowman","Yes, we can. On revenues, for the full year, I believe it was 1% of an impact from foreign exchange drag on revenue, and similar on expenses.","Ken Usdin","And was it bigger, I meant year-over-year fourth quarter. I am just wondering if there was a bigger burden in the fourth.","Biff Bowman","Yes. So that was more on a full year basis. For the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, the total revenue impact was closer to 0.5% with Trust fees being almost 2 percentage points, and then expenses also being 2 percentage points. As we\u2019ve talked about before, we do have a natural hedge with revenue and expense coming through in the current season and we had a hedge, the difference in accordance with GAAP. So, we do see a net new pretax impact, generally. But it does impact, as you suspect, mostly the Trust fee and the expense growth. And then on a sequential basis, the Trust fee impact was almost 1 point of growth, which was also in line with what the expenses were as well.","Ken Usdin","So my follow-up is then just, if there was a 2% helper on the expense side then the fourth quarter even at some of the items, expense growth number was just really high. And just to your earlier point about managing expenses to Trust fees on a year-over-year basis, going forward, and now having that kind of nice helper on the NII side to alleviate some stress on that. I guess, the question is, you mentioned some of the initiative you\u2019ve been investing in. But I think you guys had also talked about some other regulatory stuff still catching up this year, whether it was living will and additional CCAR expenses. So, is there anything else that you can help us understand that just might allow an absolute number of expense growth to be under better control as we go ahead as opposed to just focusing on the leverage equation?","Biff Bowman","So let me start with the regulatory portion of it. We are another year or in our fourth year of CCAR, and we continue to mature and have the right maturity base around something like that. And that was a -- has been a meaningful ramp in expense in '15 and '16. We are anticipating that that, the steepness of that curve flattens out, and maybe completely flattens out around the cost there. We haven't gotten feedback on our resolution plan at this point. So, I'm hesitant to give you any kind of feedback on whether our regulatory spend will go up or down from that.","So that's an area in the regulatory spend where we certainly hope and particularly given maybe the regime with the new president elect. Perhaps, we could get some reprieve on the regulatory spend or certainly the trajectory slowing on that line item. And we continue to move on things like I said in procurement, particularly around market date and others, to help drive that expense growth rate that you\u2019re talking about further and further down.","Ken Usdin","And one last just quick one, could you just talk about the impact of rates on either the pension expense outlook and premium am?","Biff Bowman","Yes, I will start with pension. The rates that we would have, the discount rate would be down from 4.71% to 4.46%. So net of that plus our expected return on our portfolio coming down. The net impact is very-very modest expense increase year-over-year, very modest, I think.","Mark Bette","Yes, and you'll see that when we do our 10-K disclosures as well. And then there is one other part, Ken, I think.","Ken Usdin","Just on premium am, as you think, contemplating them?","Mark Bette","Yes, on premium am, if you believe that that will slow down the refinancing, that should be beneficial to the premium am in our portfolio, if we think that will slow down, again, the refinanciangs that you see, which intuitively makes sense, unless there's some type of rush before a rising rate environment that impacts that. But we had seen historically the fourth and first quarter are the more favorable, and then the second and the third are where we see more unfavorable impacts from that, just from a seasonal perspective. But the rest, I guess, would be based on what we're seeing in the markets from housing and refinance.","Operator","We'll go next to Betsy Grasic of Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Grasic","I just wanted to follow-up on one of the comments you made earlier around the project that you've got with robotics. And I wanted to understand what that was, what that kind of test phase is all about. And when and how you plan on rolling that out into production?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, we actually have three areas of production, but one I discussed with our Chief Operating Officer today is, if you think about a function, such as reconciliations they have a very automated component-tree to it. We have looked at certain elements of our reconciliations, and this proof-of-concept testing, if you will, in 2016 and are now actually utilizing certain elements of reconciliations with robotics type solution. So that's one example. There were actually two others in production, and I'll leave those to let you know in future quarters. But that's one that we were comfortable discussing here. So, we were in somewhat at expense mode and now we hope to start to see some of the economic benefits of those as they come online, if you will, during '17 and '18.","Betsy Grasic","Are these, like marginal benefits or are these more big enough to enable you to scale faster, or actually bring down costs?","Biff Bowman","So, in the early quarters, it would probably be incremental to what you said, and on the margin. But we believe that the portfolio of these opportunities is something that will be able to help us address the expense structures that you're talking about. Anyone individual may have some incremental approach, but we've got a portfolio that we're investing in over this year and next year. And we believe the combination is helpful to that expense, the fee [technical difficulty].","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I had a quick question on the tax. I know with the change in accounting now for compensation, there's lot more volatility in the tax line. But how should we think about that going forward now, especially with the ramp in the stock price? Does that impact as well, so that now we look out to '17 and '18, we should be lower than we are at least in the fourth quarter?","Biff Bowman","Sure. Yes, you're right. We did the early adoption ASU 2016-9, which is for share accounting. It was beneficial for the entire year, I think, to the tune of about $12 million of provision. And that was largely a factor as we saw larger equity transactions in the back half of the year. So, that helped improve that benefit. But another thing, perhaps more core to improving the tax rate too is, as we have greater earnings from abroad and we bring more legal entities into our APV23, which we look at from time-to-time and assert to, that too has the benefit of lowering the effective tax rate.","So, we worked pretty hard this year to work on those things that could help improve the effective tax rate. So, I think if we look, we don't give guidance. But some of those items produce permanent tax benefits or tax benefits if we accrue earnings in those entities.","Operator","We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","Question on broader picture, I think, this year you were going to start to see the baby-boom generation start to be forced to take money out of there, their defined contribution plans because of the age requirement. How do you guys look at that over the next three or four years affecting any of your businesses on the assets under custody in terms of having customers have to take money out from the funds that are managing that money?","Biff Bowman","That\u2019s a good question, I saw the same article. I think the first-generation of baby-boomers have reached that mandatory withdrawal age, right I think, this year. So, we think throughout that we bring a holistic capability. I mean, we really think about what I would say is a life-driven Wealth Management approach. And it recognizes that as you reach certain stages in your life, maybe this is the mandatory withdrawal stage. We got other products and capabilities and help them understand the tax consequences and the reinvestment of that, if you could, from a defined contribution or other plan into other assets that quite frankly marry with where they are in the stage of their lifecycle.","So, the question would be, I think, does it impact our AUC and our C&IS business, or does it impact our Wealth Management business. It\u2019s going to impact both, right. So, I can give you the wealth perspective. On the C&IS side, as those assets come out of defined contribution plans, we have a smaller book of business around defined contribution than we do define benefit in general. But we do have a meaningful defined contribution. The pension portion is not as driven by this as the mandatory withdrawals from defined contribution. So, I think, I want to make sure you were asking about it from a wealth perspective or from a AUC in our custody business perspective, to make sure I answered it the right way there.","Gerard Cassidy","No, you did. And thank you for addressing in both the areas, I appreciate that. And getting back to robotics, obviously, you talked about how it\u2019s going to maybe reduce expenses and be more efficient, especially in reconciliation and things like that. Is there any use. Because I know you\u2019re very high-touched in talking in Wealth Management. But is there any use of robo-advising for you guys at some point in the future, do you think?","Biff Bowman","So we certainly monitor that world. And as we think about inter-generational components to our existing wealth, many want to use something that looks that way. We would believe that our Goals Powered solution application is a form of a high technology, high touch component. It is a very sophisticated way using technology to address the holistic wealth needs of our clients. And so when we think of the assets we have that utilize Goals Powered solutions, it\u2019s quite frankly bigger than the sum of almost all the large robo-advisors you would think of. It's much larger than those in total.","We just haven\u2019t necessarily marketed it externally as a robo-advisor or a fin-tech solution. It very much is a high tech rolled-out solution in our wealth space, and has been very widely praised by advisors and widely praised by our clients in terms of its applicability to both, what I\u2019d say current generation and future generations that use it. So, it\u2019s a powerful and important tool.","Operator","And we have no further questions. That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.","Biff Bowman","Thank you all. Thanks Alicia."],"16413":["Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2018 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Mark Bette - Director, IR","Biff Bowman - CFO","Analysts","Mike Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Mike Mayo - Wells Fargo Securities","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to the Northern Trust Corporation Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations. Mark Bette for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead.","Mark Bette","Thank you, Hanna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Northern Trust Corporation's fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Biff Bowman, our Chief Financial officer; Aileen Blake, our Controller; and Kelly Moen Lernihan from our Investor Relations team.","For those of you who did not receive our fourth quarter earnings press release and financial trends report via email this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com.

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $356.6 million, earnings per share were $1.51, and our return on common equity was 15.1%.","As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter's results included a net $53.1 million tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a $12.9 million expense related to special onetime employee cash bonuses paid in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and $17.6 million charge associated with severance related and restructuring charges. This is also the first quarter which includes the impact from our acquisition of UBS Asset Management\u2019s, fund administration unit in Luxemburg and Switzerland. The quarter included $21.1 million in fee revenue and $24.2 million in expense, which was inclusive of integration and transaction expense.","In regards to our effective tax rate following tax reform, we currently expect our ongoing effective tax rate to be approximately 23% to 24%. Of course, it should be noted that a number of factors can and do impact our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter.","Before going through our results in detail, I would note that macro factors impacting our business and clients during the quarter were generally positive. Both domestic and global equity markets were favorable. Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter, driven by rate hikes from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, during the quarter. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro ended the quarter up 9% and 14%, respectively versus the prior year as compared to the U.S. dollar. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro also strengthened. The strengthening of these currencies compared to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue but had an unfavorable impact on our expense.","Let\u2019s move to page three and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 16% with non-interest income up 14% and net interest income up 20%. Expenses increased 15% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $13 million.","Net income including the tax benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was 34% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 6% with non-interest income up 5% and net interest income up 8%. Expenses were up 7% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 19% higher sequentially, including the tax benefit.","Return on average common equity was at 15.1% for the quarter, up from 11.9% one year ago and up from 12.2% in the prior quarter. The return on average common equity during the quarter benefited by approximately 1.5% from the tax benefit net of the expenses associated with severance and one-time bonuses.","Assets under custody\/administration of $10.7 trillion increased 26% compared to one year ago and 11% on a sequential basis. Included in assets under custody\/administration is $568 million relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Assets under custody of $8.1 trillion increased 20% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. For both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, favorable market impacts, strong new business and favorable moves and currency exchange rates were the drivers.","Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 23% year-over-year and up 3% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year and the sequential increases were primarily driven by favorable markets and net new business flows.","Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page four. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.4 billion, up a 16% from last year and up 6% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition, revenue was up 14% from last year and up 5% sequentially. The favorable translation impact of changes in the currency rates benefited year-over-year revenue growth by approximately 1%.","Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $910 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% year-over-year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Excluding the acquisition, fees were up 12% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially.","Foreign exchange trading income was $63 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year and up 28% sequentially. The increases were primarily due to higher volumes.","Other non-interest income was $72 million in the fourth quarter, up 11% compared to one year ago and down 3% sequentially. This increase from one year ago was primarily driven by a loss in our lease portfolio in last year\u2019s result. The sequential decline was primarily due to lower net hedge related income, partially offset by higher security commissions and trading income.","Net interested income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $396 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 20% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially.","Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $533 million in the fourth quarter, up 17% year-over-year and up 6% on sequential basis. The quarter included $21.1 million in fees relating to the acquisition UBS Asset Management's fund administration business in Luxemburg and Switzerland. Excluding the acquisition, C&IS fees were up 12% compared to the prior year and up 2% sequentially. ","Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $369 million, up 22% compared to the prior year and up 9% sequentially. This line does include the acquisition-related fees. Excluding the acquisitions, fees were up 15% compared to the prior year and up 3% sequentially. Both increases were driven by strong net new business, favorable markets and a benefit in currency exchange rates.","Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.1 trillion at quarter-end, up 26% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. These results include $568 billion relating to the UBS fund administration acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, the increases primarily reflect favorable markets, new business and the benefit of the moves in currency exchange rates.","Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $106 million in the fourth quarter were up 13% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were primarily driven by favorable markets and net new business flows. Assets under management of C&IS clients were $871 billion, up 26% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business were the drivers of the year-over-year growth while the sequential growth was driven by favorable markets.","Securities lending fees were $25 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior year and up 11% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, higher volumes were offset by lower spreads. For the sequential comparison, higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. Securities lending collateral was $168 billion at quarter-end and averaged $173 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 45% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. The growth in volumes compared to year ago was driven by demand for U.S. treasuries. The sequential volume increase was driven by U.S. treasuries and U.S. equities.","Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the fourth quarter, down 4% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects lower sub-advisor fees, partially offset by higher fees from investment risk and analytical services. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to lower sub-advisor fees. This decline in sub-advisor fees has corresponding impact within expenses and the outside services category.","Moving to our wealth management business. Trust investment and other servicing fees were $377 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Within wealth management, the global family office business had strong performance with fees increasing 17% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Each of the regions also performed well during the quarter. Across global family office and each of the regions, both the year-over-year and sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $290 billion at quarter-end, up 17% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially.","Moving to page six. Net interest income was $396 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $113 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% versus last year. Total deposits averaged $97 billion and were up 3% year-over-year. Interest bearing deposits increased 11% from one year ago to $76 billion. This growth was partially offset by an 18% decline in non-interest bearing deposits which averaged $21 billion during the fourth quarter. Loan balances averaged $33 billion in the fourth quarter and were down 2% compared to one year ago.","The net interest margin was 1.39% in the fourth quarter and was up 19 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by the change in mix of our balance sheet. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $30 million or 8%. Average earning assets increased 1% sequentially, funded by increases in interest bearing deposits and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a slight decline in non-interest bearing deposits.","On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 10 basis points with the benefit of higher short-term interest rates and lower premium amortization being partially offset by the change in mix of our balance sheet.","Net interest income for the quarter included $4 million sequential benefit due to the accounting for certain tax advantaged investments. This benefit was offset in the fully taxable equivalent line.","Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet. For the fourth quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 70% of our total deposits, this compared to 74% one year ago, but was in line with where we were in the prior quarter. Premium amortization was zero in the fourth quarter, compared to $10 million one year ago, and $19 million in the third quarter.","As we have discussed, previously beginning with 2018, we are shifting our remaining life assumption methodology for premium amortization, which will lead to a more consistent quarterly amount that we would expect to be within the $10 million to $12 million range. In this first quarter that we change over to the new method, there is a one-time true-up to align the remaining amortization. We currently expect this one-time true-up to result in additional amortization of $10 million to $13 million, bringing the overall expected premium amortization in the first quarter to a range of $20 million to $25 million.","Turning to page seven. Expenses were $1 billion in the fourth and were 15% higher than the prior year and 7% higher sequentially. As previously mentioned and as outlined on the second page of our earnings release, the current quarter included $24.2 million in expense associated with the acquisition. As outlined earlier, the current quarter also included $30.5 million in expense associated with severance and other charges, as well as the special one-time employee cash bonus. In the prior quarter, we had $7 million of severance and personnel charges. Excluding both the acquisition and called out expense items, expense for the quarter was 8% higher than a year ago and 2% higher sequentially.","Now, keeping to total non-interest expense, I would like to decompose those growth rates further. Starting with the adjusted 8% year-over-year increase, approximately 1.5 points of growth was from the unfavorable translation impact of changes in currency rates, primarily the British pound and euro, which strengthened versus the U.S. dollar by 9% and 14%, respectively. Excluding currency impact, therefore, our year-over-year expense growth rate was approximately 6.5%.","Of the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, following items were key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher, driven by staff growth, base pay adjustments from April of this year, and higher cash-based incentive accrual. Benefits was higher, primarily due to an increase in medical costs and higher payroll taxable withholding compared to the prior year. Occupancy-related costs were higher compared to the prior year, due to accelerated depreciation related to a previously announced facility exit in one of our Chicago locations and a onetime provision relating to our London location.","Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year due to the higher software amortization and equipment depreciation. Outside service costs were higher, driven primarily by sub-custody and technical services including market data costs, partially offset by lower consulting and sub-advisor expenses. And other operating expenses was higher due to increases in certain miscellaneous expense categories, partially offset by lower business promotion and staff-related costs.","Shifting to the sequential expense view. As I mentioned, excluding the acquisition, the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter and the impact of onetime bonuses, expenses increased 2% from the prior quarter with compensations, benefits and occupancy costs being the principal drivers. Compensation was higher due to the higher cash-based incentive accruals and higher salaries from staff growth; benefits were higher sequentially primarily due to higher medical costs; and occupancy related costs were higher sequentially primarily due to the Chicago and London occupancy actions I highlighted in the year-over-year explanation.","Elsewhere, outside service costs were down sequentially, primarily relating to the lower sub-advisor cost. The decline in these costs had a direct offset in lower C&IS other trust fees. Other operating expense declined from the prior period, primarily due to the lower business promotional spend due to the third quarter Northern Trust-sponsored golf event. This decline was partially offset by higher miscellaneous expense within the category. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The growth includes the addition of approximately 230 partners as a result of the acquisition. The remainder of the growth was all attributable staff increases and lower cost locations which include India; Manila; Limerick, Ireland; and Tempe, Arizona.","Turning to the full year, our results in 2017 are summarized on page eight. Net income was $1.2 billion, up 16% compared with 2016 and earnings per share were $4.92, up 14% compared with the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outlined the non-recurring impacts that were called out for both years. For 2017, this includes the fourth quarter net tax benefit of $53.1 million as well as $60.3 million in expense items, which includes the onetime employee bonuses and severance and restructuring charges. The third quarter also included a tax benefit of $17.6 million related to federal and state research tax credits. For 2016, this includes a net revenue impact of $96.6 million while the expense related charges were a total of $82.6 million. We achieved the return on equity for the year of 12.6%. This performance was within our target range of 10% to 15% and an improvement from our 2016 performance of 11.9%.","Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page nine. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 10% in 2017. Favorable markets and new business across segments and geographies contributed to this result. Foreign exchange trading income declined 11%, primarily reflecting lower volatility across the year compared to the prior year. Other non-interest income was down 21% from last year, but up 7% if adjusted for the items I called out on the prior page.","Net interest income increased 17%. The growth in net interest income was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates coupled with earnings asset growth. The net result was 9% growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2017 and 11% excluding the 2016 items I called out on the prior page. On a reported basis, expenses were up 9% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense charges in both 2016 and 2017 that I mentioned in the prior pages, expenses were also up 9% from 2016, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of the business, as well as to comply with evolving regulatory requirements.","Turning to page 10. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as a 131 in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity.","Turning to page 11. Our capital ratios remained very strong with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 13.5% and 12.6%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized approaches. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 13.3% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 12.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.8% and at the bank was 6.1%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which is applicable in Northern Trust in 2018.","With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement became effective at the start of 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $171 million.","We remain focused on our value for spend initiative. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, we are focused on realigning our expense base in the short-term. Expenses throughout the Company with an emphasis on non-client facing functions are under review. A portfolio of initiatives will support profitable growth by permanently taking expense out of our operating model. We expect to realize $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. Through these efforts, we expect to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. We will begin to provide more specific updates on our progress beginning with our first quarter earnings.","Let me provide you some examples of actions that we have been taking which demonstrate our commitment to the value for spend initiative. Over the last three quarters, we have taken severance and restructuring charges of $47 million. On a combined basis, these charges will create approximately $35 million in annualized net savings, and we expect these savings to be fully realized by the first quarter of 2019.","Within our technology group, we are in the process of moving to a managed services approach for certain technology services. Select support services are in the process of transitioning to new third-party vendors, while Northern Trust retains infrastructure engineering, application development and core architecture functions. Through these efforts, we will have enhanced alignment and flexibility for our global operating model as well as better optimized use to partner skills, knowledge and experience.","In closing, in 2017, we continued to grow the firm profitably for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients, and improve our technology and infrastructure to support the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered a return on average common equity of 12.6% for the full year, moving further into our target range of 10% to 15% and we produced a $1.2 billion of net income. In addition, we returned $196 million to our common shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital and liquidity ratios. Our C&IS business continued to demonstrate strong growth during the year. We closed on the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxemburg and Switzerland, which further underpins our growth strategy in Continental Europe.","In wealth management, we continued to grow the business and build out our goals-driven approach, while continuing to produce attractive margins, achieving a 40% pretax margin for the year. We were also pleased to be named the best private bank in the U.S. by the Financial Times Group for the 8th time in the last nine years.","In asset management, we surpassed $1 trillion in assets under management during the year. We continue to see significant growth in our strategic offerings such as FlexShares, our exchange traded fund family. FlexShares assets ended the year at $16 billion, representing growth of 37% for the year and a doubling of assets since the end of 2015.","As we move into 2018, we are confident in our competitive positioning and as well as our focus on profitably growing our business.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust fourth quarter earnings conference call, today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Hanna, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Mike Carrier of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Mike Carrier","Hi. Thanks guys. Hey, Biff. Maybe first question, just you mentioned the tax guidance. But, when we think about maybe uses whether it's from an expense standpoint or capital priorities, has anything changed given that you're operating at that lower rate? And on the flip side, you guys have been investing quite a bit over the past years and you\u2019re focused on the value for spend, but I just want to frame that dynamic with the lower tax benefit and how much you expect to drop to the bottom line?","Biff Bowman","Thanks. I appreciate it, Mike. Tax reform is expected to be meaningfully beneficial to our firm and its shareholders and that it will favorably impact our financial performance. It does allow us to grow, as you said, and it does allow us to reinvest in our business and our people and our communities in which we operate. What it doesn\u2019t do, what the tax change doesn\u2019t do is it doesn\u2019t alter our strategic focus on profitable growth, our value for spend initiative, and quite frankly, driving more leverage into our business. That is our focus; that is the strategy of the firm. If we accomplish that, if we continue to drive more leverage into our business and we increase the profitability as a result of that and we apply the lower tax rate you just cited, that should lead to much improved returns for our shareholders. But, all other constituent groups may benefit from that as well. But, certainly, as I outlined, it will drive more profitable growth for the firm.","Mike Carrier","And then, just follow-up on net interest income. You mentioned the benefit in the quarter in the lower premium amortization. Just when we think about going forward, given the organic growth of the Company, what you think you can kind of grow from the deposit coming in? And then, also, where you think about managing the capital ratios, how should we be thinking about that going into 2018-2019, like both those dynamics? Obviously, the rate environment is where it is and deposit betas seem like those have been trending in line with expectations. But just, how to be thinking about more the balance sheet growth with the capital ratios?","Biff Bowman","Sure. There is a couple of questions in there. One, if I look at the balance sheet and I look at the net interest income and the NIM as we exited the year, it is a reasonable basis to establish next year\u2019s thought process for all of you. But, I want to put a few caveats or a few explanations around that and both a balance of positive influencing factors and some that could be drags. You cited one and it\u2019s positive or a negative, it depends on how betas unfold during the course of the year. To your point, if we look at our betas over a 12-month period from sort of fourth quarter of 2016 to fourth quarter of 2017. On the institutional side, they\u2019re obviously a bit higher but in line with what competitors have talked about, generally. On the wealth side, they have been low over that period, but we did see with the most recent hike, some increase in the beta on the retail side, really for the first time.","So, how the betas unfold next year is important. We have seen some increase, but we have also seen some discipline in the rates of those increases. So, we\u2019ll have to observe how those unfold and make sure that our -- we\u2019re aligned with the competitive landscape.","As you also said the, right now, our betas, if you look across wealth and institutional combined, they\u2019re generally -- our beta for the last year is under 50%. So, there is still the ability for NIM expansion in the franchise, if that holds true and the betas rise at a regular type range. Obviously, the balance sheet size and the balance sheet mix are also key components of that factor that you just talked about.","We have had and if you\u2019ve seen, our organic growth rate is pretty high. That often comes with deposits, liabilities. And as such, you\u2019ve seen our balance sheet grow in that 4% to 5% range. So, we don\u2019t give forward guidance, but we do anticipate having 4% to 5% type organic growth rate, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve historically cited to you as our growth rate. That produces some balance sheet expansion. But, the mix could shift between non-interest bearing and interest bearing, and so we have to watch that and as we go forward.","So, I think there is a fair balance between positives and negatives on how the balance sheet could go, but we do think there is still the potential for NIM expansion and NII growth as we look at that.","The second part of your question was around capital and the current capital process. And I think it's fair to say right now that we're entering the CCAR cycle. We have a robust process to evaluate our capital position, what we need for growth, what we need to be safe under stress, and then what are the best uses of that capital; is it to return it our shareholders or to put it to work in other phases. We're in the early stages of that for CCAR right now. We've got that process. The only thing I would say is we have the flexibility to be thoughtful in that process, given our capital strength that we -- as measured by say CET1 right now. We've got that pretty good flexibility as we enter that cycle.","Operator","We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if we could talk about the acquired UBS business for a sec. I'm just curious what you can tell us about the mix of business and profitability thereof. I noticed on the revenue side, it looks like 1.5 basis points versus 2 basis points for Northern and overall, but I don't know if that's really a good apples-to-apples comparison. And then, of the $24 million in expenses this quarter, what would you consider ongoing versus integration-related, so we can just get a glimpse of profitability? Thank you.","Biff Bowman","Yes, sure. Let me take the mix question first and I'll let Mark talk to you about the ongoing expenses. But, if you think about that mix, the 1.5 basis points that you talked about, this is a pure fund administration type business and does not have a custody piece to it. So, comparing that to a more blended C&IS portfolio probably can produce different dynamics. There is obviously different product components in those items. And so, I would be hesitant to tell you that that's a perfect assessment. I think, you've got to do a little bit more of a blend across. And even that 1.5 basis points may not be indicative of other fund administration business in different geographies, because they have different dynamics in different regions. So, the way I think of that is the mix matters here and the business profile matters. And this is a pure fund administration capability here with no custody aligned to it. And Mark, if you want to add?","Mark Bette","Yes. On the expenses, the $24 million, about $7.5 million of that was integration. We would say though, as you look at the $21 million in fees and $24 million in expense as far as we enter 2018, there will be integration activities that are going on throughout 2018. So, both of those are probably fairly good run rates, as you think about building off of the fourth quarter.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, I appreciate that. One quickie on wealth management. There has been some changes to the broker protocol on the broker dealer side of wealth management. It usually wouldn't have much of an impact on Northern. But, I guess my question is, what are you doing to help drive organic growth in wealth management, both in your current client base and then in terms of attracting and growing new relationship managers? ","Biff Bowman","So, my first part of that is, you\u2019re right. We don\u2019t really have a brokerage-led model. So, some of the nuance that you discussed there is less applicable to us. We do have the capability but it\u2019s not the core, it's more of a fiduciary-led type model that we have in our wealth management front. In terms of growing that franchise, I think there has been significant investment in time in our goals driven investing, comprehensive approach to the wealth profile of our clients. And we\u2019ve seen tremendous growth and take up in that business or that capability and approach, if I could say that. And as you could see in the growth rates in our wealth management business with double-digit fee growth and double-digit fee growth for the year in that business, while maintaining 40% margins, we\u2019ve been very pleased with what we\u2019ve seen in that. And then, in terms of attracting talent, it is a competitive landscape but we do believe that the Northern Trust brand is an important differentiator in attracting that talent, as is the fiduciary kind of based model, I think in some cases versus a more transactional based model. So, it\u2019s competitive out there but we think the brand and the performance shows we're still very focused on that business, and it had a strong performance this year.","Operator","We will go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Couple of questions, one is on the acquisition. Was there any balance sheet impact from that?","Biff Bowman","No. There is none.","Betsy Graseck","And then, you did have end-of-period, noninterest bearing deposits grow up nicely. I think on average base, it was down but EOP was up. Is that something you think can persist as we go through the next couple of quarters here?","Biff Bowman","I would say unlikely. Our balance sheet end-of-period quite frankly can have very onetime or transactional oriented balances in that. I think it\u2019s probably better for you to look at the average balance sheet over the period. We did still see that noninterest bearing deposits essentially were flat sequentially, I think they were down $300 million. And as we tried to outline on the last call, if we look at that balance, about 21 billion, about three quarters of it we think is -- we've got pretty good line of sight and it\u2019s traditionally been fairly stable. It\u2019s that last order or about $5 billion that we keep regular tests on to see how interest rate sensitivity it is. It didn\u2019t move. So, we do think that it has a sticky component to it in a rate-sensitive environment but it\u2019s that quarter that we keep regular tabs on. This quarter, it remained fairly stable.","Betsy Graseck","Got it, okay. And then, you talked little bit about increasing the leverage in the business model over time and the funding side of that. Could you speak a little bit to how you're thinking about stack rank, any opportunities on the deployment side? ","Biff Bowman","On the capital deployment side?","Betsy Graseck","Correct.","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, we do look at a balance of dividend and stock buyback. We're in interesting period of time for that evaluation. If you look historically, our dividend payout ratio has been around the mid-30s with the reminder of our payout coming in the form traditionally in stock buybacks. We\u2019re in the process of evaluating the current environment we\u2019re in. We\u2019re looking at what we think is the maximum ability to -- excuse me, the maximum performance for our shareholders in that mix. And we\u2019re early start into the process of CCAR working with our Board and others. But, we do think about the dividend payout levels versus stock buyback in this environment very closely. And more to come on that as we go through our process and we get feedback from our Board and our regulator.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. I get that. It\u2019s -- and just kicking off CCAR period here. But when we think back, some this has been seen for a while, we think back to before the 2008, 2009 period, your dividend payout was 40% north of that. So, I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s at all in the mix on expectations over the next year or two. I know, you can\u2019t comment on that. But that\u2019s background to the question.","Biff Bowman","Thank you. Understood. Yes.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. And then, just lastly on the FX revenues, really strong quarter, especially relative to peers. I know you mentioned that you took share. Could you just give us a senses to drivers for that, especially given the volatility is relatively low?","Biff Bowman","Yes. Thank you. Our strong performance in FX trading was driven by higher volumes, which can be unique to a client base or a client portfolio versus other competitors in any period. But, it was also -- it included a higher level of swap activity. We have regular balance sheet management activities where we look at opportunities to place excess cash on a hedge basis. And in this quarter, as a part of that normal balance sheet management, we did see a greater level of benefit than we typically do from sort of this FX swap hedging that we do in our treasury balance sheet. That in any typical quarter can produce low to $4 million or so of FX of our total FX. This quarter, it was probably $4 million to $6 million higher than that normal run rate that I talked about because of those swap opportunities that we saw, that may continue into the quarter. There is a bit of an offset to that. So, that helped drive a little bit more than half of the sequential increase you saw in FX with sort of the normal balance sheet treasury activities. There is a bit of an offset of that, because we take cash out, in this case out of dollars and swap them into sterling and euro. And so, you would have had some reduction in net interest income as we were putting those in lower yielding central bank. But, the offset was the swap FX income in this, which ended up being a positive trade for the bank.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe to circle back on the deposit beta. I think you mentioned in the wealth management division, Biff, since the December hike, you did see an uptick. Can you quantify that as we move into the first quarter? I mean, obviously, your fourth quarter deposit betas were pretty low. But as we look at the trajectory coming into 1Q, can you give us a sort of a sense of maybe how much of those rates, deposit rates have gone up, I guess for January or the trajectory into 1Q?","Biff Bowman","Yes. On our wealth management side, the betas remain low. But we establish a review and we look at a certain subset of our competitors in the wealth space. We target to stay within a certain range of that competitive landscape for our depositors, maybe sometimes at a premium or a discount to that, but we got a set of competitors that we view. So that beta will depend to some degree on how the competitive landscape unfolds in that space. As you rightly said, throughout 2017 that beta remained low. We did see, again, in December, we did see some increase in the beta. But still -- if you looked at it on a yearly basis, at a really pretty low level in the wealth side. I don't know, I can't forecast how that will unfold during 2018 and kind of how that competitive landscape moves. But we've done very disciplined with that approach.","Brian Bedell","And these would be wealth management peers, other private banks plus the warehouses as well?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, broad based basket of competitors. Yes, absolutely.","Brian Bedell","And then, just back to the spending both the value and spend program. As you think about tax reform, as we sort of go through the year on tax reform and I guess, what would be your view on -- obviously, I heard you -- continue to focus on profitable growth. But, as you think about the timing of that and the willingness to spend on some initiatives that might have some upfront expenses for some very strong long-term benefits. How do you think about that as we move to 2018 and what we should be thinking about for the expense to trust fee ratio, which did come down nicely this quarter, down to the 107 or 106 ex the bonus? Maybe some color on that.","Biff Bowman","Yes. As you said, we are focused on driving that expense to fee ratio further down. But not completely -- if there are opportunities out there to actually improve that ratio, but require expense but can improve the expense to fee ratio by driving the fee line harder or faster, we obviously evaluate those on a regular basis. And I'm not really sure that the tax reform is going to impact how we think about that. Those are decisions that we think about in our business at its core. We do and we talked to you with our value for spend, we are striving and working hard to improve the expense to fee ratio during the course of the year. That doesn't mean that our normal business model does produce enough internal income, if you will, to reinvest in our business. And it doesn't always require additional returns from taxes or whatever to do that. It's a business model that produces enough to invest internally. So, that's how we think about it.","I think if we were sitting around the table, we would say that the tax reform is beneficial in the sense that we\u2019re going to pay 7, 8 points, based on the range I gave you, less than our current effective tax rate, and that\u2019s a benefit at all levels. But we still need to drive more leverage into the business, strategically and from an execution standpoint and we\u2019re committed to it.","Brian Bedell","And longer term, do you see the competitive environment changing because of tax reform outside of you in terms of pricing and other companies\u2019 willingness to spend. ","Biff Bowman","That\u2019s a good point. The one -- we\u2019re in the early innings of tax reform. I think we have to assess what others do with the financial benefits. And if pricing changes in our industry or investment changes in our industry, we will absorb that. That\u2019s why the view of probably early into this that in -- the returns from the tax benefit will probably flow -- will increase profitability. But boy, the competitive landscape, we have to see how it unfolds. We\u2019re three weeks into tax reform right now and have to see how the discipline and approach is taken by other institutions.","Operator","We will go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Biff, if I could be more little more technical on the expense question. So, if you had 6.5% kind of core expense growth this year, what would you say the organic fee growth was this year?","Biff Bowman","So, we had 10% fee growth and I think the range was probably about half was organic. So, the way we think about it is, if we're 5% organic, our organic expenses were probably like you said close to 6.5%, we\u2019re not generating positive organic fee leverage. And that\u2019s why value for spend and still continued focus on expense discipline.","Ken Usdin","And that\u2019s really my question, then. So, accepting that as yesteryear and now moving forward, if you expect organic fee growth to still be in that four to five range as you expected before, is that where we should expect the range of core expense growth to be and would that be inclusive of any incremental restructuring charges you take?","Biff Bowman","So, I think that we've said last time that we\u2019re trying to drive positive fee, organic fee leverage. So that\u2019s where we're trying to get. So, what you just describe is what we publically said we want to try to drive organic fee leverage. And we remain focused on that.","The second part again\u2026","Mark Bette","Is that inclusive of charges? ","Biff Bowman","Is that inclusive of charges? As it relates to charges, I would say it is not inclusive of charges in our 2018 thinking. And while we don\u2019t give guidance, right now there will be the need for some charges. We think they are largely in line with the magnitude of the charges you saw in 2017. They might fluctuate a little bit from that. So, on a year on year basis that won\u2019t create much of the growth that you just described. But, we're in a process here where that could change, if we see the right opportunities, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re right now.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So, I'm still just trying to get to the can you commit to that fee operating leverage, regardless? But then also can you help us understand next year\u2019s growth rate also will have the full year of UBS and can you help us understand what that would be plus the Omnium purchase? So, the rest of the tech would -- how much of that would add incrementally, if separate from the organic growth?","Mark Bette","Well, this is Mark, Ken. On the Omnium tech acquisition, at this point, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily view as layering on additional expense, and we\u2019ll share more on that as we work through that. On the -- when we do look at our organic growth rate, we do on an internal basis, we do acquisition kind of out of that picture. So, as we look at let\u2019s say the first quarter of 2018 versus the first quarter of 2017, we would be looking to kind of strip back the expense growth and the organic fee growth excluding the acquisition. Obviously, eventually, it becomes part of your business, once it\u2019s fully integrated. But, when you have those periods when there\u2019s a year-over-year issue, we do adjust for those.","Ken Usdin","Right. And UBS already came on slightly positive on that front. So, hopefully on a full year basis, we would get that as an increment?","Mark Bette","Yes. I mean, about 3 -- on a pre-tax, including integration about 3 million drag on pre-tax.","Ken Usdin","Okay. I mean, on a non -- on a go forward basis, right. Because if you said 8 million was the non-organic part of that and you\u2019re bringing on 21 against 16ish, and that would be kind of organic positive leverage onto its own, just presuming that carries forward?","Mark Bette","Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","So, sorry to go back to this, but I guess just a follow-up to Ken\u2019s point and the discussion there. I guess, 2017 was a pretty noisy year for you guys in terms of expenses, numerous charges, you kind of outlined some of the severance related activity, but there is also some others. You kind of -- and then there is UBS. So, if you strip all that out, it feels like the core expense base, I\u2019m excluding UBS here, is a little under $3.7 billion. Is that the right way to think about it, as we\u2019re kind of contemplating, kind of layering on more normal kind of 4% to 5% organic expense growth or I guess what would you consider to be the baseline for expenses? Again, keeping UBS aside because you gave a lot of useful color on that one.","Mark Bette","Yes. And this is Mark, Alex. I would say that if you took the charges out and you adjusted for the fourth quarter acquisition, that 3.7 is about the right number. I mean, I would also say that -- and again, we don\u2019t give specific guidance, but the value for spend program, the intention is that to get to that point where we have that neutral to positive organic fee operating leverage by 2020. So, as far as -- if you look at 2018 on its own, there is work obviously we have to do. And the goal is, by the time we get to 2020, we\u2019ll have that expense growth in line with the organic. And there might quarters before then where we are able to achieve it. But by 2020, we want to be able to consistently deliver that.","Alex Blostein","And then, the strategic question for you guys just around the Omnium tech transaction. So, it\u2019s a bit of a wash on the expense side, sounds like. But any incremental opportunities that gives you on the revenue side? I mean I know that's been a pretty successful partnership for you guys in the past. That\u2019s kind of how you got into the hedge fund administration business and that's been a big driver of servicing growth for you. But, as I think about it you\u2019re now doing that in-house. Any revenue implications that are sort of tangible you can point over the next 12 to 18 months?","Biff Bowman","Yes. I think when we announced the agreement, as you've pointed out, we basically -- with Citadel, we're bringing the technology in-house and the flexibility that gives us and the talent quite frankly that it brings with it is powerful for us to think about how we go out and compete. And if you think about that in some competitive environments not having that in-house could be a detriment in a competitive environment, if they say who owns the technology and who supports the technology in certain competitive environments. Having that being able to be in-house, I think will allow them in that competitive environment to not face that hurdle in certain parts of the discussion. And then, we also think we get the benefit of bringing that in and fitting that into our IT infrastructure and understanding the benefits and a bigger and broader set of IT infrastructures that it can sit within. And again, we get some very talented individuals who we think can benefit, not just the Omnium platforms but some of ours as they look at some of the Northern Trust platforms as well. So, we're quite positive on the transaction. And again, it's unfolding as we speak here in the first three or four months of the year.","Mark Bette","Yes. And I would also add that over time, we do expect this transaction to be cost beneficial to us. And like Biff said, be able to create greater efficiencies in the future. But, we will share what we can with you as we work through the process of closing.","Operator","We'll go next to Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","So, quick follow-up on capital. In past, you guys -- I totally appreciate that you're going through the process and it certainly seems like very -- front and center in your minds is shareholder returns and returning capital to shareholders. I just wanted to clarify something. In the past, you've talked about how staying close to competitors and keeping capital ratios close to competitors is a key consideration competitively, which is fair. We've heard that in the press more and more attention to relief for on the leverage ratio upfront. So, if we end up seeing that relief for peers and if it is only focused on SIFIs not directly on you, won't that also benefit you all and provide some relief on a measure that has in the past constrained you to some degree?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, if you look this quarter, while our capital ratios are still strong as is our leverage ratio, our binding constraint would be the leverage ratio not supplementary but the leverage ratio. So, the relief that's been proposed or the reaction to price share quarrels, reports are earlier this week or late last week are positive directionally for us. And if those come to being, they do give us even greater flexibility in our capital thinking and returns than we already have, which is like I said in a position great opportunity, given the strength of where we are and our capital ratios. I'm not sure how fast those will come. They were thoughtfully put in. And I'm not sure how fast we will be able to change those, but if they do, we would benefit. I think some of our peers have supplementary leverage ratio concerns that\u2019s less impactful for us, but the leverage ratio is absolutely impactful for us and would again give us even greater capital flexibility in our thinking. And you\u2019re right to say, it is front and center in our thinking right now.","Brennan Hawken","Great, thanks for that. And then, following up on your NIM outlook comments, Biff. Respectfully, just a little push back here, like, why so caveat it, right? They deserve pretty low in your deposit base, as you walk through still. And even if they go up, they are still going to be at a level that\u2019s manageable. And when you look at the asset side, you guys are more levered to the front end of the curve, you guys have now -- I think a great move to get rid of the premium amortization noise. So, we don\u2019t have that to worry about. So, why not a more confident outlook in the rate leverage for you guys as you move into 2018, particularly given the market is now looking for three hikes. And by the way, all that\u2019s before even considering the Bank of England, where we could see higher rates there too which matter to you guys.","Biff Bowman","So, Brennan, without giving guidance, we think our NIM can expand. Okay? We think it will expand. Just we're cautious in the sense of if betas move to 1 with the next hike in a competitive landscape, an unlikely scenario, I might add. If we come on here and told you that the NIM would be meaningfully expand, that may not be the case. If we see the NIMs expand at what we project and what we think and what we\u2019ve observed -- excuse me, the betas expand, what we have seen here, our NIM will expand and it will. If you\u2019ve seen the trajectory of our net interest income and our NI, it\u2019s moved I think quite nicely, relative to the industry, given the disciplines we deploy on that beta. And I think it\u2019s been beneficial to the firm. So, I think we will but we have a degree of caution there.","Brennan Hawken","That\u2019s totally fair, and I completely agree, like especially now that you guys have the balance sheet stable, I would think it\u2019d be a pretty nice positive for you. But thanks for clarifying that, appreciate it.","Operator","We will go next to Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","On wealth management, some of your discount guys have pointed to significant activity pick up among retail investors, obviously not necessarily you're same. The high net worth space is not as a different customer base. But, if you\u2019ve seen sort of the animal spirits getting better with your wealth management high net worth customers, you\u2019ve seen flows improve. Just trying to get sense of how to think about organic growth, what you\u2019re seeing in flows and activity levels among your wealth management client base?","Biff Bowman","So, the answer to that is yes, we did see a strong year-end flows. And I think our clientele which tends to be at the higher end of the network spectrum is reacting to a very successful or high returning equity markets. They are looking at lower, perhaps personal income taxes, depends on what state you're in probably. They are looking at -- to your phrase, maybe a little bit more in the animal spirits, which allows them to invest in their own company businesses, allows them to perhaps take those businesses public or to sell those business. And so, we have seen that flow and new business pick up. There was a meaningful improvement in our organic growth rates from \u201816 to \u201817 in our wealth management franchise. And I think you see that in the fee growth line and you see that in the overall performance of our wealth management business. Again, with tax perform starting this year and the market that\u2019s starting, healthily we think those animal spirits are still intact and long may they last.","Jim Mitchell","And are cash balances at low points still reasonably usually high? I mean, what\u2019s sort of the dry powder?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, they\u2019re not at low points, they\u2019re actually still high. So, I think you\u2019ve got people that are looking at where those opportunity sets are. And our cash balances inside of our firm increased across our asset management portfolios nicely year-over-year, both institutionally and on the personal site. But, we are seeing -- I think when I looked -- if you looked at our traditional wealth portfolio, we were at the highest level of equity as a component of that portfolio since 2009 when we kind of bottomed out. So, people existing equity investment in their portfolio were back to the high at the low-50% range across the average portfolio.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just one question on clarification. Your tax rate guidance of 24 to 25, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s FTE?","Biff Bowman","23 to 24.","Jim Mitchell","I\u2019m so sorry. Is that FTE or GAAP?","Mark Bette","That\u2019s on GAAP.","Biff Bowman","GAAP.","Jim Mitchell","That\u2019s GAAP? Okay. All right. Thanks for that.","Mark Bette","Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Look, I\u2019m going to give a little windup to my question. So, on the positive side, look, Northern had the best top-line growth among peer in 2017. You guys played the long game, you did very well through the crisis. So, I don\u2019t want to take anything away from you guys. But, did I hear it correctly that you\u2019re not committing to positive fee operating leverage until 2020. In other words, I think you said, you did not get it on a core basis in 2017 and you\u2019re not planning on that for either this year or next year because it\u2019ll take time for the $250 million of savings to come through?","Biff Bowman","No. That isn\u2019t what we said. So, we\u2019re going to work hard to do what we can on that front over the next 12 months to get to that level. Obviously, the organic fee part of that equation requires a lot execution. But, I can tell you that we\u2019re committed to getting to that before 2020, all things being equal.","Mark Bette","And Mike, when I was comment earlier, I was focused on the organic leverage. So, we\u2019ve been running at about 6.5, even if you adjust for things on expenses, our organic fees or let\u2019s say 4.5 to 5. And the value for spend initiative has the intention of closing that GAAP.","Mike Mayo","Okay. I\u2019m glad I asked the question. And as it relates to the pre-tax margin, it\u2019s another way to ask this question a little bit differently. Again, notwithstanding the strong top-line last year, the pre-tax margin was flat and still down a little bit from a couple of years ago. Your peers tend to highlight that in the first few slides and you guys have it in the appendix. Do you have a target for the pretax margin for the firm? Do you expect that to increase? And just more generally, it goes to the question, how much are you willing to sacrifice the pretax margin to have better performance in the future.","Biff Bowman","Mike, we focus on the expense to fees more than we do to pretax margin piece of that. But, pretax margin is I can tell you internally something that we look at. And as you know we've historically and I think our competitors all are able to drive something in that low30s. And we think it's important to be in that range as well. Now, we've got a wealth business that does better than that. And so, we're trying to get I think that blended rate and improve that pretax margin along with all other expense initiatives we talked about. We just don't call that out as something that we set an established target for. But, I think our pretax margin actually improved during the course of the year. And I can tell you that we continue to focus on, not just giving up margin to get the profitability you described.","Mike Mayo","And if I could squeeze one more in. I guess, what I'm getting to, it just seems like you're increasing some investment spending to somewhere. And it might be logical, some of your peers are increasing their tax spending. Are you increasing spending in certain areas, again with an eye for that payback and you're a lot more conscious to this profitable growth and getting more leverage through the franchise. But, if you're increasing investment spending, what areas are you focused on?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, we obviously -- you can see it in the equipment software line, if you look at the depreciation growth rate. We absolutely are making investments in our business. And we hope many of those generate the returns that you would expect to drive that expense to fees down further. The areas in many cases, I took the wealth side, there is investment in Goals Driven investment, capability and product that drives both revenue and operating efficiencies. But, a lot of that investment is in our core operating platform to support our C&IS business, so that we can produce and perform at as what you described the better margins and the better returns. And that's a technology intensive business, and we need to continue to invest. Our business generates I think enough to make that investment. But that's where we've seen that. And then there has been investment also in things like robotics and others that are largely in place for driving operating efficiencies. So, it's combination of all those.","Operator","We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","I got a question for you. You guys have done a very good job of driving that return on equity higher, not return on tangible common equity. And I think you have right now the goal to keep that number -- the range is 10% to 15%. And I go back and I think back to your old days before all the banks had to air all that capital and you had a long term target for ROE of 16% to 18%. And I understand, we\u2019re probably not going to get there. But with the tax rates now coming down, and your profitability and your peers' profitability going higher as a result of that. Should we see this range increase or how are you guys looking at pushing that higher as your profitability goes higher?","Biff Bowman","Thanks, Gerard for the question. If we think back to when we established the range originally, the 10 to 15, the industry had kind of gone through -- I guess you described it as a secular change. We had all been asked to put more capital on the balance sheet and we all had to look at how we could return across the cycle, and that\u2019s when we established the 10% to15% range. What I would suggest is at this point, if the tax reform is indeed the secular change, we think it is, that we have to think about that and what that is to our targeted range and how the reform itself will impact us and move this up. So, this type of secular change will prompt that type of evaluation inside the firm.","Gerard Cassidy","And then, second sticking with taxes, obviously, we all know about the SALT part of the new federal tax code. In your state, your home state, Illinois is one of the higher tax states. At what point -- I know it\u2019s only a couple of weeks into the new tax bill, so we don\u2019t have the answers yet. But, will you guys take a look at what that might mean in terms of the cost to your operations of -- for your employees and other factors in the state of Illinois because of the higher cost of doing business there versus other states and possibly shifting to lower cost areas, should that make sense?","Biff Bowman","I'm going to tell you that I think that it\u2019s early in the stages and I probably don\u2019t have a much more detailed answer for you on that right now. We obviously conduct and do business around the globe. We have a global franchise, we have operating centers and offices around the globe. And we\u2019ll have to take a look and see how this unfolds and what the impacts to our people et cetera. We\u2019d certainly let that unfold over the next period of time while we absorb this.","Operator","We will go next to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Just a quick clarification. Firstly, On MBS premium amortization, you said have a onetime charge which gets you to 20 to 25, so the charge -- the increase is 10 to 13, so the rest would imply what 10 million to 12 million. And since you said you\u2019re going to make it pretty similar quarter-over-quarter, so is that to say that you\u2019re expecting that 10 million to 12 million to continue on a quarterly basis through the rest of the year?","Biff Bowman","Yes.","Vivek Juneja","Even though the long end has gone up so much?","Biff Bowman","Yes. As we sit here today, that\u2019s our expectation. Yes. ","Vivek Juneja","Secondly, consulting service costs did decline, are you done with pulling pack on all the increase it had in consulting fees and projects for the living will or is there still more to come out of that? ","Biff Bowman","We submitted our 165, at the end of the year. We believe in that that we\u2019ve addressed regulator\u2019s concerns but we will get that feedback from them in short order. So, the expenses we needed to do that work. Right now, we were able to have some of the consulting spend associated with that pull back and in other areas too. I wouldn\u2019t say just related to that but in other consulting spend as we discussed, the spend pulled back. And then, we have to observe our feedback and we\u2019ll go from there. But, yes, as of today. We also have to submit our CIDI plan by July 1st. But, we\u2019re well underway on that front.","Vivek Juneja","And lastly, going back to, I think Gerard\u2019s question earlier, which was the ROE goals. I mean, from what I can see, the guidance that you\u2019re giving on taxes, ongoing taxes should add a good 1.5 points to your ROE levels. So, at the very least, shouldn\u2019t we expect that 10 to 15 to go up by that 1.5 percentage points?","Biff Bowman","So, we will evaluate that as we said on the call in terms of -- this is the type of secular change that promotes that. I think, the math you\u2019ve done is something we can all do and that\u2019s a reasonable mathematical equation, but we\u2019ve got a balance that across the series of other strategic factors, and that\u2019s where we are.","Vivek Juneja","Meaning you might use some of this for something else? Any color on what you might be thinking?","Biff Bowman","Yes. That\u2019s not what we were trying to say there. We\u2019re just saying, we\u2019ve got process, we\u2019ve got reviews and other things that we\u2019ve got to look at and we\u2019re going to let that process unfold.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Just a quick question. Can you maybe just outline the strategy behind using the wholesale funding that kind of help fund the balance sheet growth? I mean, are you seeing suitable yields? On the earning asset side to make -- improve the margin still with that strategy?","Biff Bowman","Yes. Sure. So, as you saw, we did do some discretionary leveraging and used some wholesale funding. With our strong capital positions, we felt that we could put the balance sheet to work with discretionary leveraging and\/or other kind of wholesale funding sources, as you described. But the nature of those is obviously very short. We\u2019re generally putting those at central banks. Because, as we look at the flexibility we would like in the deployment of that capital, we\u2019re not looking to lock those up into longer term assets. So, whether those are loans or something else as you described. Right now, we like that short-term flexibility around using that wholesale funding for, call it discretionary leveraging and the likes. It was additive to the quarter. And then, also to give you some idea, roughly for every 1 billion of discretionary leveraging, it\u2019s about a 1 basis-point of a drag on the NIM. But we still felt that driving the NII was important.","Mark Bette","And Brian to give you some color as far as volumes go. There was about 8 billion of leveraging during the current quarter compared to about 5.5 to 6 last quarter and 3 a year ago. So, at this point, when you think about the basis point impact on NIM, that gives you some color on that.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And could you just give what the duration of the securities book is now? Have you had to extend duration at all?","Mark Bette","We\u2019ve not. The total securities -- still remains 1.2, 1.1 years.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions in queue at this time. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.","Biff Bowman","Thank you."],"16618":["Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 22, 2014 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Beverly J.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations Bev Fleming for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beverly J. Fleming","Thank you, Aaron. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'Grady, Northern Trust's Chief Financial Officer; Jane Karpinski, our Controller; and Allison Quaintance from our investor relations team.","For those of you who did not receive our fourth quarter earnings press release or financial trends report via email this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. In addition and also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation which we will use to guide today's conference call.","This January 22 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. The only authorized rebroadcast of this call is the replay that will be available through February 20. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.","Now for our Safe Harbor statement.

Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those indicated by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties. I urge you to read our 2012 annual report and our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.","[Operator Instructions]","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.","Michael G. O'Grady","Thank you, Bev. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, I'll review both our fourth quarter and full year results. Bev and I will then be pleased to answer your questions.","Starting on Page 2. This morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $170 million and earnings per share of $0.70. Our reported results included a charge of $19 million in connection with an agreement to resolve certain long-standing class action litigation related to our securities lending program. The settlement is not final as it requires further documentation, signed agreements and court approval. The settlement will not resolve all security funding litigation involving Northern Trust but will resolve the majority of the pending claims, those involving Northern Trust index funds. We intend to continue to vigorously defend the remaining securities lending cases.","Excluding this charge, net income would have been $182 million and earnings per share would have been $0.75. For the full year, net income was $731 million and earnings per share were $2.99.","The operating environment in the fourth quarter continued to be mixed, with both positive and negative implications for our business. Equity markets in the U.S. and Europe were higher, which supplemented our strong new business results, while fixed income markets were a modest headwind. The S&P 500 was up 30% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, while the EAFE Index was up 19% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was down 5% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially.","Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $5.6 trillion, up 16% over last year. And assets under management ended at $885 billion, up 17%. On a sequential basis, client custody and managed asset levels were up 6% and 5%, respectively.","Currency volatility and client trading volumes, both of which influence foreign exchange trading income, were lower in the fourth quarter but higher year-over-year. Short-term interest rates remained at very low levels. 3-month LIBOR and fed funds were 8 and 7 basis points lower, respectively, than the year-earlier quarter, and 3-month LIBOR was 2 basis points lower sequentially, placing continued pressure on our net interest margin. Average overnight repo was 16 basis points lower compared to the prior year, resulting in higher waivers year-over-year in connection with our money market mutual funds and similar to last quarter.","We continued to successfully execute on the Driving Performance initiatives announced in early 2012, enhancing our capacity for investment in growth and improving our financial performance despite the macro environment. The net effect of all these factors was a reported return on equity of 8.7% in the fourth quarter, or 9.3% excluding the charge, and 9.5% for the full year, which while higher than last year's return, was still below our target range of 10% to 15%.","Let's move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the fourth quarter.","Starting with the year-over-year comparison, revenues were up 8% and expenses, when adjusted for charges in both quarters, were up 6%. Revenue growth was a result of trust, investment and other servicing fees increasing 8%, net interest income increasing 7% and foreign exchange trading income increasing 25%. Expenses were up due to higher compensation, outside services and equipment and software expenses. As a result, net income, excluding the special items, was 5% higher than last year's fourth quarter.","Compared to last quarter, revenues, excluding the third quarter gain, were up 3%. And expenses, excluding the fourth quarter settlement charge, were up 5%. Higher trust investment and other servicing fees and net interest income were partially offset by lower foreign exchange trading income. Expense growth on a sequential basis, similar to the year-over-year comparison, reflects higher compensation, outside services and equipment and software expenses, as well as higher other operating expense. As a result, net income, excluding the special items, would have been 2% lower sequentially.","Earnings per share was $0.70 on a reported basis and $0.75 excluding the charge. Our return on equity of 8.7% for the fourth quarter would have been 9.3% excluding the charge. With that background and summary, let's get into more details behind our fourth quarter results.","Turning to Page 4. Fourth quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were approximately $1.05 billion, up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially when adjusted for the third quarter gain. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues, were $674 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Higher equity markets and new business were both drivers of growth, with higher money market fund fee waivers offsetting in the year-over-year comparison. Money market mutual fund fee waivers were approximately $31 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $16 million over last year and $1 million lower sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the gross yield of the funds declining by approximately 9 basis points on average from the prior year. I'll go into further detail on trustees shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was $51 million in the fourth quarter, up 25% year-over-year and down 19% sequentially. Higher currency market volatility and higher trading volumes both drove the improved results year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, both volatility and volumes were lower.","Other noninterest income was $70 million in the fourth quarter, down 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower securities commissions and trading income. Excluding the third quarter gain, other noninterest income was up 5% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher income on employee benefit assets held in trust.","Net interest income, which I will also discuss in more detail later, was $259 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and sequentially.","With that backdrop, let's look at the components of our fee revenues on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $371 million in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $251 million in the fourth quarter, up 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, while assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.1 trillion at year end, up 17% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflects higher equity markets and new business. Fee growth, like asset growth, however, as a higher proportion of our fees, are based on transactions rather than asset values given the growth in our Global Fund Services business, as well as the impact of the timing of new business installations and lagged pricing.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $75 million in the fourth quarter were up 1% year-over-year, and assets under management for C&IS clients increased 18%, both reflecting new business in mutual funds and index management and higher equity markets. Fee growth was dampened on a year-over-year basis by higher waivers on institutional money market mutual funds. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equaled $15 million in the fourth quarter, $9 million higher year-over-year, primarily reflecting the lower gross yields achieved in the underlying funds that I've previously mentioned. Investment management fee growth in C&IS, excluding waivers, would have been 12% year-over-year. Additionally, the mix of AUM in passive equity strategies, which carry lower fees relative to active strategies, increased during the year.","On a sequential basis, C&IS investment management fees were up 5% and assets under management were up 4%.","Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, up 7% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volumes, as securities lending collateral increased 16% to $102 billion, offset partially by lower spreads. The sequential quarter decline primarily reflects lower collateral levels.","Other fees in C&IS were $23 million in the fourth quarter, down $2 million year-over-year and the $3 million sequentially.","Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $303 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were 202 -- $222 billion at year end, up 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. And assets under custody were $496 billion at year end, up 11% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. This growth reflects higher equity markets and strong new business. The year-over-year fee comparison was dampened by higher money market fund fee waivers, which were $16 million in the fourth quarter, $7 million higher year-over-year. Excluding the waivers, Wealth Management fees would have been up 11% year-over-year.","Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $259 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and sequentially. Growth in net interest income was driven by a larger balance sheet as client interest-bearing deposits averaged $64 billion in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, short-term borrowings were also higher. This higher level of funding was primarily invested on the asset side in Federal Reserve deposits at 25 basis points.","Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin which, at 1.12% in the fourth quarter, was down 5 basis points year-over-year and 2 basis points sequentially. The lower margin reflects the mix shift in earning assets resulting from the higher level of Federal Reserve deposits, as well as lower yields on the loan portfolio, which declined 17 basis points year-over-year and 3 basis points sequentially. Over half of the loan portfolio is floating rate, and new fixed-rate loans and leases are coming onto our balance sheet at lower yields than those rolling off.","The yield on the securities portfolio increased 12 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting adjustments to premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio due to changes in prepayment speed assumptions. Adjustments to premium amortizations were approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter and $3 million in the third quarter. The adjustments in the fourth quarter increased the net interest margin by approximately 4 basis points.","Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $794 million in the fourth quarter, up 7% both year-over-year and sequentially. Excluding charges recorded in the fourth quarter of each year, expenses would have increased 6% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Across all the categories, expense growth is being driven primarily by the costs in investments to support the growth of the business and meet higher risk management compliance and regulatory requirements.","Compensation and benefits expense increased 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting staff growth. The year-over-year increase also reflects annual merit increases. Staff increased 4% in 2013 and was primarily focused in 2 areas. First, approximately half of our net new hires in 2013 support the growth of Global Fund Services in C&IS, a business in which we are investing for our clients and for future growth across traditional hedge and other fund structures. Second, about 15% of our new hires during 2013 joined our corporate functions, the majority in our risk management group.","Outside services increased 8% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher consulting and technical services expense related to heightened regulatory efforts, as previously mentioned. The sequential increase reflects higher legal and sub-custodian expense.","Equipment and software expense was higher by 9% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. This growth reflects the higher level of investment we are making in our technology platform both for our clients and risk-related initiatives. Occupancy expense was down 5% versus the prior year and up 1% sequentially.","Other operating expense, excluding the litigation settlement charge, decreased 5% year-over-year and increased 17% sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher charges associated with account servicing activities and seasonally higher business promotion and marketing costs.","Turning to the full year. Our results in 2013 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $731 million and earnings per share were $2.99, both up 6% compared with 2012. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 9.5%, better than 9.3% in 2012 and 8.6% in 2011 but still short of our target range of 10% to 15%.","Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 8% in 2013 and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10% since 2011. New business across segments and geographies, and higher equity markets both contributed to these results.","Foreign exchange trading income was up 19% on higher volatility and volume, particularly in the first half of the year. This revenue growth was offset by a 6% decline in net interest income as low short-term interest rates continued to pressure net interest margin. The net result was 5% growth in overall revenue in 2013. Excluding the third quarter gain on a sale an office building, revenue growth would have been 4%.","Expenses were 4% higher in 2013 than 2012, reflecting investments in people, outside services and technology to support the growth of the business and risk management and compliance requirements. Although we saw a meaningful increase in costs related to these activities in 2013 and many requirements were met, some of the expenses are permanent and there will continue to be additional work on these fronts required in 2014.","Let's move to Page 10 for an update on our Driving Performance effort. In January of 2012, we indicated our goal to improve pretax operating income by $250 million in 2013. In the fourth quarter, we produced over $80 million in pretax operating income improvement from Driving Performance initiatives. This brings the 2013 benefit to approximately $270 million. Driving Performance has added about 1 percentage point to the revenue growth rate and reduced our expense growth rate by approximately 3 percentage points, with approximately 60% of expense savings achieved through compensation and benefits and about 15% through procurement initiatives.","Driving Performance efforts have contributed to the continued improvement in the level of noninterest expenses as a percentage of core trust and investment fees. However, the decline in net interest income and foreign exchange trading income over the last 2 years has muted the impact on our pretax margin, which has only improved from about 24% to about 27%.","While we believe the Driving Performance has created sustainable improvements to our operating model and is embedded in the ongoing management of our business, we continue to pursue meaningful additional efforts to improve productivity and deliver financial benefits beyond our original targets. In 2014, for example, we have established internal productivity targets on both the revenue and expense side. We have developed these targets using the same approach we used for Driving Performance and have included these targets in our 2014 financial plans and expectations. We expect that this next round of productivity efforts will continue to improve our financial performance in a sustainable way, holding other factors constant. The ultimate measure of the success of our efforts will be our ability to consistently achieve our financial target of a return on equity between 10% and 15%.","Capital, outlined on Page 11, remained very strong, with tier 1 common and tier 1 capital ratios of 12.9% and 13.4%, respectively. Based on our interpretation of the final Basel III rules released by the Federal Reserve, our tier 1 common capital ratio, based on the standardized approach on a fully phased-in basis, will be approximately 11%. Under the advanced approach, our tier 1 common capital ratio will be approximately 12%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The sequential decline in the tier 1 common capital ratio calculated under the advanced approach was mainly related to an increase in operational risk-weighted assets given some refinements to our modeling approach and the fourth quarter litigation settlement.","The supplementary leverage ratio is estimated to be approximately 5% at the holding company, which is above the requirement applicable to Northern Trust. As Northern Trust progresses towards fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of $123 million. Combined with dividends, Northern Trust returned $609 million in capital to our shareholders in 2013, an increase of 35% over 2012. Our 2013 capital plan provided for the repurchase of up to $400 million in common stock, of which $164 million remains for repurchase through March 2014.","In closing, 2013 was another successful year for enhancing our ability to serve our clients. We are offering our Wealth Management clients several new asset management products, like FlexShares ETFs, a new way to think about their wealth through goals-driven investing; and new technology to utilize, like mobile capabilities. For our institutional clients, we expanded our geographic presence by opening offices in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Frankfurt, Germany; and added depository capabilities in Europe to help clients meet new AIFMD requirements. We also made meaningful investments in our technology in order to be a secure, stable, efficient partner for all our clients.","From a financial perspective, 2013 was an improvement over 2012 but fell short of our plans and goals. We were not able to meet the challenges presented to effectively grow our revenues and manage our expenses efficiently to achieve the returns on capital expected by our shareholders. We were able to make significant returns of capital during the year, providing our shareholders with over $600 million through dividends and share repurchases. We're already hard at work this year, determined to make 2014 even more successful for our clients, shareholders and partners.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call today.","Aaron, please open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just in terms of the regulatory compliance spending. You indicated that should have peaked in the second half of 2013. Just wondering if you have any more clarity around how much and how quickly some of that could fall off in 2014.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. I think that I -- in looking at the increased cost for the regulatory initiatives and compliance initiatives, that we did see the ramp. And that came in the form both of additional personnel, so you saw that through the comp and ben line, particularly in this quarter. I -- and then also through outside services, which increased 9% this quarter year-over-year. And I think, going forward, I -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks there, we continue to have a number of these initiatives that we're working on, albeit that the portfolio mix changes as we go forward. So for example, things like CCAR, we definitely had a big step-up this year and, as a result, had to bolster our teams but also to use outside consultants in order to help us get to what we thought was the appropriate level for the 2014 capital plan. As we move forward into 2014 and prepare for our 2015 capital plan, we're going to continue to make improvements on that front, but the incremental increase won't be as much. And I would expect that the use of outside consultants to help us get there will also be lower. So you have things like that where the trajectory, I would expect, would go down. At the same time, we have initiatives like AIFMD over in Europe where we did incur expenses in 2013 and again particularly in the second half, but I would say, in 2014, the costs related to that will go up relative to 2013. Now in certain situations, like in AIFMD, that's a new service that we're also providing to our clients, so there are revenues that come along with the incremental costs. So I take all of that together from an expense perspective, what we're looking at is that the expense levels we experienced in 2013, relative to these risks and regulatory initiatives, will be approximately the same, albeit that the mix between what I'll call the permanent costs will go up a little bit from where we are now, where I would expect from the outside costs to begin to come down.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just more broadly, would you agree that some of the difficulty with operating leverage over the last few years is that you've been adding clients and mandates and, with that, I think, more support costs, while relationship revenues have obviously been falling? I guess I'm aiming at whether you've attempted to isolate the impact of organic growth on your expense and margin trends.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, we absolutely look at the impact of organic growth on operating leverage. And I would say, we further break it down or the way, I would say, we think about it is looking at that ratio of expenses to trust fees, and we brought that down over the last couple of years, as we've talked about. Now we have benefited in that from the fact that equity markets have been strong. So that's raised that growth rate. And as again we talked about in the call, it's 8% this year and it's been a compound annual growth rate of 10% relative to expense growth of 4%. So between those 2, clearly a lot of operating leverage, but we're recognizing the fact that we're getting the benefit of the markets in that. I will say, at the same time, even within that line, we've had the detraction as a result of money market fee waivers being up, which detracts from our ability to improve on that. And then outside of that ratio to true operating leverage, meaning revenues versus the expenses, we've seen headwinds, as we've talked about many times on some of the other revenue line items, that has caused us essentially to be basically flat when it comes to operating leverage over the last couple of years.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just picking up on the last question, Mike. Clearly, 2013, pretty nice tow-in from the market perspective, and it feels like the NII headwinds that you have experienced for the last 1.5 years-plus are at least starting to subside a little bit. So maybe help us understand a little bit more on the type of operating leverage you guys could get from just the market performance and better NII, because it feels like those are obviously 2 pretty high-margin revenue streams for you guys. And any -- and if you could provide any specifics around the type of expenses that would move up along with those 2 kind of line items would be helpful.","Michael G. O'Grady","Okay. I think I have it there, Alex. So I would say that the way we look at the positive operating leverage is to first look at the areas that we can drive and control the most. So it's looking at that organic fee growth rates and the expectations that we have there and then the related expense growth to that, and we want to ensure that we are achieving positive operating leverage based on that. To the extent that the, I'm going to say, operating environment is more favorable, so whether it's positive equity markets, interest rates, FX, et cetera, that should only accelerate or expand the positive operating leverage for us. To your point, not all of that incremental revenue growth necessarily drops down without incurring some expenses to it. So to your point specifically, when the equity markets go up, we have higher sub-custodian expenses, we have higher market data costs, we have higher third-party adviser fees. So there are a number of line items that also increase with the increase in equity markets, albeit the total amount that derives from those is less than certainly what we pick up on the revenue side. So it is a detractor. And we saw some of that in the fourth quarter where sub-custodian expenses, as you saw, were up a couple million dollars both year-over-year and sequentially. Likewise, I -- when we say that tech services or technical services are higher, that includes our market data costs in there. And so again, I -- generally speaking, those also have gone up with the markets and something that we essentially have to make up for in other areas that are not linked to market growth.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then the second question is just on the balance sheet. Clearly, a big move up on -- in deposits. How much of that do you guys think is seasonal or are sort of temporary in nature versus maybe a little bit more sticky? And if it is a portion and if there's a portion that is stickier, how do you think about starting to move some of the balances away from the fed into the securities portfolio or something like that? Because it does seem like fed has -- fed balances is closer to 14% or something close to that as a percentage of earning asset, and that feels like on the higher side of things.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, I think your observation is correct, Alex, just in the sense that it was higher. And looking at that increase in deposits and a little bit in borrowings as well there, I would say that I -- our view is that about half of that is -- looks to be just increased client deposit levels. Now the nature of the deposits that we have for our clients on the custody side tends to go up and down over time, but as you know, as we grow the business, it generally increases. So just as you pointed out, when we get new deposit levels in or they begin to go up for some level, we don't immediately move them to longer-term investments on the asset side and we want to make sure that we have essentially established new levels of ongoing operational deposits, if you will. And so that's where we saw it. And as I said, about half of that looks to be, at this point, longer term, which would give us the opportunity to increase the size of the securities portfolio a little bit, as well as some of the other money market investments that really fall in between just being overnight at the fed or being in our securities portfolio which has just a little bit longer duration.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ashley Serrao with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Mike, as you look out over the next 2 to 3 years, like how would you rank order all the organic revenue opportunities in front of you across your business? And then how should we think about the payoff there versus the incremental investment spend?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So let me try to do it by our primary businesses. And I would say, as we have discussed and invested in the last couple of years in our Global Fund Services business within C&IS, that continues to be an area that we see out over the next, as you said, 2 to 3 years, if not longer, as that continues to be an opportunity for accelerated growth. I -- and that comes in a number of different forms. So in other words, that can be traditional fund managers, but as we've talked about within that, we've also been very successful in growing our Hedge Fund Services business within that. So that would be an area, along with just the whole investment outsourcing business that we have there, where we continue to see good growth. Now even having said that, in 2013, that portion of the C&IS business grew well. The traditional part of our business also grew very well. So it's not to say that we only see growth opportunity in Global Fund Services, it's just at a higher rate on that side. Within Wealth Management, we continue to believe that, just within our current footprint, we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow. When you think about the areas where we probably have the greatest area for opportunity, it's going to be areas like the East Coast and the West Coast where we don't have the same penetration that we do in the Central region. And frankly, that's an area where it does require some investment in people, expertise, in marketing in order to continue to develop what are some very large markets. And what we have been trying to do through Driving Performance and otherwise is really to be able to create the capacity to spend more in those areas. We've been reticent to spend aggressively to grow the Wealth Management business in some of those markets until we felt like we have the overall returns for the company at the places where we talk about as far as our targets. And then within asset management, we talked about ETFs, I would say that ETFs right now are close to $7 billion, so that's been very successful for us. And yet at $7 billion, we still think we have significant headroom to continue to grow the ETF business. So those will give you 3 areas, I would say, that not only are they near term but they fit into your 2- or 3-year time frame as well.","Ashley N. Serrao - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess, maybe shifting gears to just expenses. Towards the -- I guess you've, more or less, concluded the Driving Performance program, but you've always talked about the cultural shift with respect to expenses. So like maybe, can you give us some examples of what you're working on today? And how should we think about any potential savings above and beyond this program?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. So with Driving Performance, if you went back 2 years ago and just if we talked about the 4 primary categories that we had for opportunity, they were revenue, process optimization, technology and then corporate. I -- and I would say, within each of those areas, we've -- again, we're successful in executing on the initiatives that we've discussed. Those are the same 4 primary areas that we see going forward and, as I mentioned, continue to have new initiatives which we put in place and then measure our performance against those initiatives. So for example, on the revenue front, for Driving Performance, it was focused, with the Wealth Management business, around essentially our pricing structure, which we changed 2 years ago. We don't anticipate changing that pricing structure going forward. However, we still, within that pricing structure, discount our fees for various clients across the business. We have opportunities to continue to align the discounting mechanics, if you will, and process around that, which we think will achieve revenue for us going forward. And there's other very high-value-added services within Wealth Management that we either don't charge for or that we think that are not appropriately aligned with the value that's being delivered. So there continue to be opportunities on the revenue side. On the process optimization front, if you recall, that was all about trying to look at different activities that run across the bank and make those more efficient. So for example, client administration. And going forward, there are still more opportunities essentially to centralize additional functions into more shared service type opportunities. We also talk about our global operating model and the fact that we look to put the right activity in the right place. As much as we've been very successful in that, there certainly are more opportunities to expand how we do that, and we'll be doing some of that in 2014 globally as we expand our operational footprint. Within technology, on the technology front, we were able to essentially shift our development mix. And what I mean by that is trying to optimize the balance between onshore and offshore, as well as when we develop something whereas we otherwise could outsource the development. And achieved gains there, there are some opportunity there, but then going forward, we see further opportunity on the efficiency front in further essentially simplifying our portfolio of applications. So these are areas that do require some investments, but we see the returns both in the sense of a more simplified operating platform for our clients and our partners but also of efficiency and savings. And then just finally, on the corporate front, we essentially looked at realigning the organization a couple of years ago, realigning the benefit structure that we had in place, and that definitely produced some significant savings for us. There's probably additional opportunities on the organizational front to continue to ensure that we have the most efficient organizational structure kind of across-the-board. And then also, we've been very successful in procurement. And I -- as much as that, likewise, has delivered significant savings for the company in the last 2 years, we still see more opportunities in procurement, broadly speaking, in just the way in which we manage our vendors. So Driving Performance, very successful so far, we see more opportunity for us. The incremental improvements are more difficult to get but all the same critical for us to be able to deliver on our ultimate financial performance.","Operator","And we'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions, one just again on the operating leverage. I heard you indicate that some of the external fees that you're paying for, CCAR-related work, will come internal in the coming year. And at that, swap external\/internal should be positive to the operating leverage. In addition, beyond that, you got a little bit more work to do on the regulatory front and the CCAR front, but all in on just that line item, should I expect that you're going to be having a reduction in expenses year-on-year and that, that's one of its drivers of positive operating leverage into '14?","Michael G. O'Grady","Just to be clear, when you say on that line, do you mean on, for example, outside services?","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","No, just all-in expenses associated with the regulatory performance.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. No, I would say, for 2014, it's likely to be pretty consistent. And the reason why I say that, Betsy, is we really ramped up in those expenses more into the second half. And I would say we're kind of essentially at that level, the mix is changing. We'd like to think that it stabilizes out and starts to go down in 2014, but it's hard to say. And so certainly from a year-over-year basis, we would think that we'll be basically in the same neighborhood.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I have a question [indiscernible]. There was a little bit of a step-up in comp and benefits in 4Q. And I was wondering if that was at all a function of moving in-house people that were out of house, but maybe you can give some color on why that line item went up.","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So comp and ben went up about 6% year-over-year, as you mentioned there. About half of that relates to more hires that we had during the year in the areas that we've talked about. So that's just the -- approximately, we said 4% increase in staff growth, and here, the hires and salary was an increase of about 3 -- a little over 3% there. The other half of it, part of it, we actually had a restructuring charge in the prior year that went the opposite direction. And then we also have some base pay adjustment, about 1%, that's in there as well. And then currency, given that a number of our partners are outside the U.S., particularly in the U.K. and other parts of Europe, were from a currency impact standpoint, that was about another percentage point increase year-over-year in those quarters. And just to be clear, we get the benefit of currency impacts like that on the revenue side as well, but it does hit different line items differently.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the revenue side, 2 questions. One is on, the Wealth Management fees have a component that is backward looking. Since we ended the year in 4Q at an S&P high, I would expect that, that's pretty much a high for the [ph] Wealth Management fee base for 1Q '14. Is that fair?","Michael G. O'Grady","Right. As we talked about, there are certain lags that are in the business, one of them is with our Wealth Management regions where we have the 1-month lag.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then on the securities portfolio, you've had some nice step-ups in yields over the past couple of quarters [indiscernible] durational [indiscernible] like you mentioned 2 quarters back. Are you pretty much done with the securities duration extension that you had talked about or is there anymore of that you're likely to be doing?","Michael G. O'Grady","I would say that we're pretty much in a balanced position, if you will, as far as the duration. So the duration of the portfolio was about 1 year and 2 months, 14 months as of the end of the year. We've been a little bit below that before. But at this point, we're not necessarily expecting to extend that duration further. And at this point, we're largely increasing -- we're largely matching the yield on the portfolio as it rolls over and we reinvest. So it's a relative [indiscernible]. And I should say as far as the actual yield on the securities portfolio, if you went back and just backed out the premium amortization over the last 4 quarters, for example, the yield on the portfolio, absent that, is very stable.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Do you think you will achieve your key financial target ROE of 10% or more in 2014? And the reason I asked that on the downside, you missed it in 2013, you're done with the main part of Driving Performance, the regulatory cost stay elevated. And as the company has said, you're still investing in technology, risk location and capabilities. I guess on the other hand though and this is really my question, you highlight the pretax margin on Slide 10, which you hadn't done before, and you had as you mentioned 24% to 26% to 27% the last 3 years. So where do you think the pretax margin will go or should go? And can you give us some color on the new expense plans for 2014 that you say are in the internal plans? And just more generally, where are you in the investing curve? You're investing a lot, when do we get to that crossover point where the payoff net investing offsets the expenses?","Michael G. O'Grady","Okay. Let me try to recall all those, Mike, and address them. So to the first one, yes, we expect to achieve a return on equity in our range, in other words, above 10% in 2014. I think that was the first question. The second question with regard to the margin, the first -- the answer to the first question essentially answers the second one in the sense that we need to increase our pretax margin, essentially, in order to achieve the return on equity target that we want. So we're at about 27%. In order to get into the range, we're going to need to be closer to 28%, 29%. So that's certainly our objective to do that. Underlying that is the other part of that page that we showed there which is we need to continue to bring down the expenses relative to the fees because we don't necessarily know what's going to happen with some of the other revenue lines, but we don't want to necessarily plan around those in order to get our margin improvement. And that largely leads, I think, to your third question about how we think and plan around expenses. And if you take the last couple of years, our fees have grown, as we've talked about, let's say, 8% to 10% and our expenses have grown about 4%. Now going forward, that is what we look at. And our expectation is to have a similar-type relationship. So when we develop our plans, we're very focused on how can we drive the fee line there, and that's not with the expectation that markets go up, but rather from an organic perspective, how can we grow that fee line. And as much as we grew at 8% in 2013, we didn't grow it quite as much as we expected to and that we planned to. And then what's the relationship because there is a relationship there as you grow those fees and add clients with regard to the expenses required to do that and just other things that are happening, like the regulatory cost that you have to take into account as you do that. And we're looking for a similar-type relationship, and again I would say in 2013, while 4% gave us that difference between our fees and our expenses, it wasn't as much as likewise that we targeted. And so 2014, the expectation is pretty similar in the sense of looking to grow those fees at about that rate and from an expense perspective, we're essentially in the same neighborhood as well, given the considerations that we've discussed. As far as your last question about the investment curve, the way I would think about it is that there are many investment curves within the overall investment curve. So there's not one just Northern Trust is a company on a particular singular investment curve, and we very much do look at our initiatives and what curves they're on. So more specifically, when I talk about Global Fund Services and within that, just to give a better example, Hedge Fund Services, we made a true investment in that business a couple of years ago. And when we think about the returns that it's generating to the extent that it's not generating the corporate return, then it's in the investment stage. So it's been in the investment stage. But the payoff for that is in front of us right now in the sense of being not only profitable, but also earning the return that adds to the company's overall return. So that's an example of where we are in that investment stage. I would say, when we talked about Wealth Management and I've talked a little bit earlier on the call here about investing in some of these larger markets, for example, on the East or West Coast, those are markets where right now we really haven't truly invested much in those. Instead, they've been more in a growth mode, but we'd like to invest in those. So those would be earlier into the investment cycle. But then pulling up and just to give one more example, on the ETFs, that's something again that would be similar to what I just said with Hedge Fund Services, which is a couple of years ago when we started, clearly, we were not only -- do we have operating losses there, but also there's capital invested that you're not getting the return. We're now at the point where in 2014, that won't necessarily be contributing to the overall value add, if you will, even though it will be positive, but then in the next year, it is. So it's much closer to the payoff part of that curve. So now if you do pull back and say, that's interesting that you have individual initiatives and curves, but what is it for the company overall? Frankly, our view is we need to get to within our range before we can invest significantly in any of these areas. And so it's critical for us to get above that 10%, so that we -- it gives us a little more capacity to invest in some of these things that have curves that are in the investment stage earlier on, but then produce the higher returns for us longer-term.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","By the way, what's the name of the Driving Performance Part 2? Do we have a name for that?","Michael G. O'Grady","We don't have a name per se, so I'll leave it at that. It's really -- as we've talked about, Mike, Driving Performance, one of the key objectives really was to just ingrain it in what we're doing. And so it's not viewed as an initiative that ended per se. But it's also not saying that the only time you have to think about either improving revenues or bringing down expenses is if you use the term Driving Performance. These are things we should be thinking about all the time and I think that people do that. At the same time, it did allow us to develop a discipline around certain initiatives and that discipline really paid off for us to be able to stay on track and make sure that we delivered on some of these plans, so we want to keep that type of Driving Performance structure in place.","Operator","We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Do you guys think that you'll finish the rest of your share repurchase this remaining in the calendar first quarter of 2014? I think you said it was about 168 million shares maybe -- might be remaining. And second as part of that, is there ever a point where the stock price gets too high to repurchase or the valuation is too high and if you think -- and that's a nice problem to have, of course, but if that is ever reached, would you use a special dividend as an alternative to return capital?","Michael G. O'Grady","So on your first question, Gerard, there's $164 million remaining on the 2013 capital plan and our intention still is to fully execute on that. On your second question, we've talked before about the framework in which we think about capital returns and how share repurchases play into that. And to your point, a special dividend is something that it is certainly a consideration for us. Having said that, that needs to be a part of our capital plan and our capital management policies and things like that. And so in order to have that type of flexibility, it needs to be a part of the broader capital management that ultimately is reviewed by the Federal Reserve that's part of your capital plan.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, coming back to your comments about your deposit growth on your average balance sheet year-over-year are very strong as you pointed out, and on the corresponding side of the balance sheet deposits that the Fed, of course, were up quite dramatically. If you're confident that about half of them are sticky deposits, what was the thinking not to grow the securities book year-over-year? I think it was actually down a little bit and then the loan portfolio, of course, was about flat with those deposits that you grew in 2013?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. Part of it, as I mentioned are those custody deposits definitely tend to move around and vary over time. And so just -- so it's different I would say than if you think about a retail deposit or deposits we may get in Wealth Management where we have some early indication that, that deposit makes it with us for a long time. Some of these deposits are very large and their needs can change relatively quickly over time. So that's why from our perspective on how that gets invested, we'd like to see what the behavior of the higher level of deposit is because before we necessarily think about extending on the asset side. As I did mention, it does appear that a reasonable portion, about half of that looks like it is just higher levels by clients. And what we do with that is, in addition to just getting invested at the Fed, we also looked invested in money markets which can have a longer-term maturity, if you will, than just overnight. It's still counted in days, so it's, as a portfolio, it's less than 1 month. But depending on market rates and depending on the currency, we're going to get a different spread on that. So for example, we talked about 25 basis points at the Fed, if that deposit is in euro and the marketplace we're getting less than that 25 basis points pretty significantly, it's going to be single digits. Whereas if it's in sterling, we're going to get about 50 basis points right now. So it depends on factors like that. And then just to your last part on the securities portfolio, we really use that then. Once we do see the overall balance sheet growing to a size and expect that there's a certain level of stability to think about increasing the amount that we would invest in the securities portfolio. And we've done some of that over time then we certainly will look at the current size of the balance sheet and to the extent that we do think that it is going to remain stable at this level, look to potentially increase the securities portfolio.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just quickly on the LCR, I assume your -- with the liquidity that you have at the Fed, the LCR ratio is not an issue for you guys?","Michael G. O'Grady","That's right. We're obviously, closely watching all the developments with the LCR and making sure that in fact, we think it does meet with what the appropriate way is to measure and when not, to try to be a part of that dialogue. But as it's currently stated, we would be very comfortable at our current ratio.","Operator","We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Mike, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about business wins and pipelines? Specifically did ADT on board this quarter and for how much of the quarter was it on board to start?","Michael G. O'Grady","So first, just a general comment which is with regards to new business, it continues to be what I would consider relatively broad based. So that's true both geographically, where North America, we had a very strong year, and then in EMEA where it had dropped off more, we've seen a nice pick up in momentum over there and ATP would be a good example of that. So ATP, a very large client and large win for us, we did on board that during the quarter and was successfully on boarded, but you won't really see the financial impact of that until the first quarter. And I would say, on that front as well, with ATP, a very large client. At this point, we are providing custody and other safekeeping services. So it's a relatively straightforward service offering. And so the fees related to that are not going to be as high as some of the other clients that we have. The pipeline, likewise I would say in general, continues to be very good within C&IS, I gave it geographically there, but also from a product perspective, fund administration and our investment operations outsourcing also continuing to see nice opportunities, both that we've won recently, but I would also say, opportunities to pitch on, if you will, are also high. And on the Wealth Management front, 2012, so going back a little bit over 1 year ago, if you recall, was very, very strong because of some of the changes in tax laws and that rolled over into the first quarter of 2013. It did slow down as we went through the year and I think that's just as far as levels of market activity just slowed down. So we've seen that stabilize here, but all the same, I would say not as strong as it was as we are speaking 1 year ago.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then -- so we'll get the follow-through from ATP. And then is Bridgewater still on track for somewhere in midyear?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. I would say with Bridgewater, again another very large, complex situation and the implementation there is ongoing and it's going well. But I would say, given that we are in that case a shadow administrator, that does mean that not only do we have to coordinate with the client, but we have to coordinate with the other administrators. So it's just a more complex proposition to do that. And that is going well. And the expectation now would be that we would have that on board in the third quarter.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then 2 just balance sheet-related questions. First of all, just on the premium am side, I know it's a $7 million incremental helper this quarter. Can you just remind us on what you have left in unamortized premium? And then your mechanism, I believe, is some blend of lag versus current. Can you just walk us through that?","Michael G. O'Grady","So we have approximately $100 million in premium that needs to be amortized over what is about, I believe, approximately a $5.5 billion MBS portfolio. And right now, that's amortizing at basically $8 million a quarter. But as prepayments speeds change just due to interest rates, that needs to get adjusted and we're on a 3-month lag in looking at prepayment speeds in order to adjust that. So the adjustment in the quarter essentially gets it to the same effective yield over the new estimated life of the portfolio. I will say though, we do this security by security, so it's literally hundreds of mortgage-backed securities and it's each individual one that you do that calculation and then just overall you have the impact, so that we don't do it at a portfolio level.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then my last one is I noticed that period-end loans were decently above the average, which is the first time in a while you've seen that period end loan growth shoot up. I was just wondering if you could talk through, have you seen any change in either the C&IS side or the Wealth Management side? And do you expect that any incremental growth opportunities there at this point?","Michael G. O'Grady","I would say that we continued to see loan growth very difficult. And so as much as they were a little bit higher, it's still is an area that on both fronts, as you mentioned, both the commercial front and the personal front, that we think it's going to be low or slow growth for some time period because one of the things as to whether it can be higher or lower in any particular point in time is that a portfolio is turning. So it's really just the net effect of what you're replacing or as a certain amount rolls off every quarter, are you more than replacing that or not? And we've been largely running in place on the portfolio side as I think the industry has for some time period. And I would say, we continue to essentially be at about that level.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess a question on asset management fee rates. I think you mentioned that the few rates were affected by a mix shift to passive, which I guess I can see on the fund and ETF flows for the industry and for you guys. But then you're also mentioning an initiative to maybe restore some of the fees and Wealth Management, which is discount or charge for services which are free right now, so where are those shakeout? Would you expect the fee rate, assuming no change to the mix of equity to stabilize here, go a little bit higher? Or is passive going to push that down?","Michael G. O'Grady","As you point out, Cynthia, there's a number of factors that impact that yield, if you will. And if you look over the last several quarters, but frankly over the last several years, our overall fee levels have been relatively stable. Even when we changed the fee structure, they largely remain stable. And yet underneath that, you have factors, which I'll get to, but one of them that you didn't mention is you also have money market fee waivers, which is a detractor certainly from that fee level. I think that as we go forward, it's difficult to predict overall where it's going to be, certainly to the extent money market fee waivers come off. You heard some of the numbers that I gave on the asset growth relative to fee growth, you come much more in line when you adjust for those money market fee waivers. I do think that the product mix will continue to experience some dilution as a result of active to passive. I think that, that trend, if you will, as you mentioned, it's not just for us but is broader to the industry. And that happens at what I would call the product level for us, whereas the account management fee, because we broke apart our fee, that part of it and when I talk about Driving Performance opportunities there, that's where I would think that, that remains stable, if not improves a little bit to the extent that we decrease some of the discounting that we've done on that portion of the fees. Because again we've separated what I would call an account management fee from a product fee.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Yes, I was speaking apart from money market. And then just a really specific one, it looks like commissions and trading income dropped pretty severely. So they got 27%. So that's more than what we saw elsewhere. Was that just market volumes? Or was there something else driving that?","Beverly J. Fleming","Well, part of that, Cynthia, would be the fact that last year, we would have seen a higher level of activity because of the same reasons that Mike talked about in terms of the new business opportunities there. And there were just a lot going on in the marketplace in the fourth quarter of last year that led to higher trading volumes, especially in the equities arena.","Michael G. O'Grady","And I would just add to that, that on the institutional side, that also includes our transition management business. And those transitions can definitely move up and down quarter-to-quarter. They're relatively large transaction volumes, but they're also inconsistent.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So that doesn't necessarily mean we should think of it as coming in at a new, low level for this quarter, it's just going to be lumpy every quarter?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","I hate to beat the dead horse of the ROE range, the 10% to 15% range, but it's easy for me to see what gets you to 10%. It's harder for me to see what gets you sort of to the upper end of that range. And if you could just talk about that and when getting to the upper end of that range might be a realistic expectation?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So as you point out, to get to the 10% side of that range, we're on a path, granted that it's taking us longer than we wanted to get to that path, but we're going to continue to drive towards that. And frankly, absent things that happen in the market, if they don't dramatically impact us, we expect to get into that range. And we expect that, again absent the macro environment changing dramatically, that we also have the ability to move within that range and move towards the middle part of that range. So the 11%, 12% into that neighborhood, doing the same types of things. To your point, to get to the higher end, if you really just said, put all the macro factors aside, we could get there, but it would take a certain amount of time to get there. And so really to get to the high end, that's where if we do have some positive impact from interest rates, FX volatility, those are the type of things that we can get there very quickly because with interest rates, just to give the magnitude of the impact with those money market fee waivers, they're over $100 million this year. And as you would imagine, there's no to very little expenses that are related to that. So those types of revenue streams have relatively high margins. And so it's those types of impact that can quickly get you towards the high end.","Nancy A. Bush - NAB Research, LLC, Research Division","Okay. On another note, could you just speak to sort of the risk appetite of your Wealth Management clients right now, whether you've seen any changes there in light of the fact that the market was up quite dramatically last year? And whether you're doing any kind of significant mix shift in their assets?","Michael G. O'Grady","I would say, as far as our perspective and what we're doing with them, I think the first part, which is critical, is just that our approach to Wealth Management is much more around goals-driven investing, if you will. So less about pure return and less about asset allocation per se. Having said that, as far as risk appetite and the allocations that underlie meeting those objectives, we have been advising our clients to essentially move towards riskier assets for some time period here. And that's a much broader and in-depth view that's developed by our CIO, and the office of the CIO. And we've seen them progress towards that, frankly, more slowly last year that we necessarily were advising. And that's just I think investor or human behavior, it just takes longer to follow up on the advice and to actually execute on that. What we're seeing is that it is continuing now. And so you have seen the equity allocation, for example, in our Wealth Management business continue to go up and is now at a level that's close to some of the highest levels that we've seen. Now part of that, of course, is because the market has performed, but this is on top of the market where we have seen them shift assets from fixed income into equities. And I would say, as to why they're doing that we think overall, it's the direction of the advice, if you will. But we think underlying that, as well, it doesn't hurt that equities are performing well, that's certainly a positive. And I think there's also still the expectation that there's clearly risk in fixed income to the extent that we have expectations that tapering will continue and that interest rates are going to be going up over the next several years.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Most of my question have been asked and answered. I just want to make sure I have this crystal clear, on the premium amortization question, which was very helpful but I just want to make sure when you think about that $10 million benefit this quarter versus the $3 million last quarter, all else being equal if rates stay flat and that's a big statement, all else being equal. But that would mean that, that the $10 million would come back out or wouldn't recur, I guess would be the point, all else being equal.","Michael G. O'Grady","That's correct. If you truly say, all else equal, no adjustments, et cetera, you would be $10 million lower.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right, but as rate, but we should kind of keep an eye on rates and if they start to move higher that, that you could still see more adjustments going forward.","Michael G. O'Grady","Correct, in the opposite direction, correct.","James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Fair enough. And I guess just on the compensation side, I want to make sure I hear what you're saying on the expense front. Outside services was elevated, could come down. But in compensation, the current run rate reflects new hires and that we should probably think about that as the base into next year and then some growth with revenues on top of that. Is that a fair statement on the compensation cost side?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. I think that's -- overall, that's a fair statement.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeffrey Harte with Sandler O'Neill.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Question on capital levels and your thinking there. I mean, the buyback has really accelerated the last couple of quarters. And if you actually execute on the whole authorization from or approval from the Fed, it's going to step up again in the first quarter. Have you guys changed your thinking as far as the willingness to return capital to shareholders or that is an attractive alternative because it still seems like there's a lot of capital in there?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. So as I mentioned, we feel very good about our capital levels. We feel good about being able to return over $600 million in 2013. We'd like to return more capital to our shareholders going forward. So of course, that whole process, not only has to do with us, but also the process with the Federal Reserve and our regulators. And so we go through that trying to make sure that not only are we comfortable with our capital levels, but all the processes around determining their capital adequacy and being in a position to handle stress situations, et cetera, and making sure that they're comfortable with that as well.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. But this is a recent acceleration, I mean, it seems like the approval spend there, it almost suggests that kind of management's willingness to return capital has improved as opposed to getting approval to necessarily do more.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, I would say from quarter-to-quarter, it can change for any number of reasons. But within the capital plans, we've used our capital plans or what we've been allowed to use over the last several years.","Jeffrey Harte - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And on expenses, kind of going forward, I mean that's been asked a lot and who knows with the activity levels. But I want to make sure I'm clear, when you were talking about hitting the ROE target next year, you mentioned kind of getting the pretax margin to 28% or 29%. As you think of the pretax margin expanding by 100 basis points maybe 200 basis points, is that revenue driven? Or should we be thinking of kind of a flat revenue environment and you think expenses are actually going to be potentially declining quite a bit?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. We are expecting to grow our revenues and as I mentioned before, particularly driven through our trust fees. And expenses will go up, as I said, over the last couple of years, the way that we've both planned and then executed has resulted in about 4% growth in that. That's allowed us to improve that ratio between our expenses and our trust fees. We're looking to continue to stay on that line. And absent what happens in the macro environment, that's going to result in improving our in pretax margin.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked. I just have a very simple one. I mean, the last several quarters, tax rates kind of drifted down a bit. How much, if at all, is your tax rate being affected by a changing mix, maybe greater non-U.S. business? And any color on what we -- how should we expect that to migrate in the coming year?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. So it does change with the global mix of our business and we continue to expand globally. And so, you have seen some improvement as a result of that. So with lower tax rates outside of the U.S., we've seen our effective tax rate come down a little bit as a result. There's also always from quarter-to-quarter just various aspects within taxes that can move it up or down a little bit. So we're largely speaking in the same range that we've been. But I think that over time, we try to be as efficient on that line item as well.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Was there anything worth calling out in this quarter that may have driven the tax rate down a little bit or just kind of a unreasonable time going forward?","Michael G. O'Grady","I would say that, Robert, that this quarter was a little bit lower on the tax rate. It was not any one individual item that affected that. As you can imagine, you're constantly looking at the adequacy of your reserves, your tax reserves to determine if they are appropriate. And as a result of that, you have to look at potential situations that can happen and make sure that the levels are appropriate. And those always get adjusted over time. But there was nothing significant that happened, it's just that the reserve levels and the adjustment made the rate a little bit lower. For the full year, we're at about 32%. That's definitely within the appropriate neighborhood for us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Also, mostly have asked and answered, but a couple of ticky-tack questions, if you don't mind. Just to be clear on the expenses, I hear you on the 4% kind of ongoing growth rate we should generally expect. But should we think about it on a full year versus '13 base or kind of a 4Q run rate just because to factor in maybe the higher run rate on regulatory compliance cost that maybe were not fully baked in?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, Andrew, I would think about my comments there about growth more on an ongoing basis, meaning kind of multiple quarters year-over-year, if you will, as opposed to necessarily saying, every particular quarter that we're going to achieve a particular growth rate, whether that's revenues or expenses. And I hope that helps it.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just a reminder that, that typically seasonally higher expenses still to be expected in the first quarter, is that fair because of the Open?","Michael G. O'Grady","Correct. So that dynamic will still play out this quarter.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then in terms of -- can you just remind us where you stand in terms of capital targets that you have internally for Tier 1 common Basel III, I guess, or is it PCE, good old-fashioned PCE? Or how do you think about what's appropriate for you guys?","Michael G. O'Grady","We think that in the current regulatory environment, it's important to look at a number of the ratios. So certainly Tier 1 common capital is an important ratio for us. Tier 1 ratio, we have internal levels that we look at for that as well. And then total capital, it's important to the regulators, it's also important to us. You saw us issue $750 million of subordinated debt in the fourth quarter. That was to bolster our total capital levels. And then the leverage ratio, also the supplementary leverage ratio, is an important focus, more recently, of the regulators. And so it's important that we feel comfortable with all our levels there, too. So overall, it requires us to look at a number of ratios. I will say that, that's going to get easier going forward with Basel I essentially going away and really being able to focus primarily just on Basel III ratios. That will actually seem easier than where we've been.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that's because that is really the constraining factor? Is that fair?","Michael G. O'Grady","It's not as much the constraining factor per se, although we have very high Basel I ratios. But I would say, it's because that's what the regulators -- that's where they're focused, those are the effective regulations, so that's where we need to be primarily focused.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","You guys are already at a fairly healthy combined payout ratio, is it fair to assume that you could do more than that in the upcoming CCAR? Or maybe you don't want to trigger them all again and -- how should we think about it?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. Don't know how they would think about it. And so all I can really say at this point, Andrew, given that we've submitted our capital plan, is we feel very good about our capital levels. We've put a tremendous amount of work into the CCAR process this year and that's been submitted. And we're working through the -- I'll call it diligence process with the regulators right now and we look forward to hearing back where they are when it comes down in March.","Beverly J. Fleming","And with that, we will end our fourth quarter call today. We look forward to talking to everybody in the middle of April when we will hold our Annual Meeting and also release first quarter earnings.

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call.","Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported third quarter net income of $374.5 million. Earnings per share were $1.58 and our return on common equity was 15.1%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter\u2019s results included $8.1 million community development investment impairment within other operating income, $2.7 million of severance-related and restructuring charges within expenses, a $5.5 million tax benefit relating to adjustments recorded in the current quarter associated with IRS guidance issued with respect to the Tax Cuts and Job Act.","Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets had a favorable impact on us during the quarter. End-of-period markets were favorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indices increasing 15.7% and 2.3% respectively. On a sequential basis, both indices also increased with the S&P 500 up 7.2% and the EAFE up 1.8%. Also on a sequential basis, the average daily market value of the S&P 500 was up 5.4%, while the EAFE declined 0.2%. As you will recall, some of our fees are also based on lagged pricing and in the prior quarter, the S&P 500 was up 2.9%, while the EAFE was up 2.5%. Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve as well as for the Bank of England. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter down 3% and 2% respectively compared to the prior year. The British pound and euro also declined sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines for the pound and euro against the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact of revenue and a favorable impact to expense.","Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 9% with non-interest income up 8% and net interest income up 14%. Expenses increased 7% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $9 million compared to a credit of $7 million 1 year ago. Net income was 26% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue declined 2% with non-interest income down 2% and net interest income down 1%. Expenses increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Net income declined 4% sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 15.1% for the quarter, up from 12.2% 1 year ago, but down from 16.5% in the prior quarter.","Assets under custody and administration of $10.8 trillion increased 12% compared to 1 year ago and increased 1% on a sequential basis. Approximately half of the year-over-year growth was driven by the acquisition of UBS Asset Management\u2019s fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Assets under custody of $8.2 trillion increased 6% compared to 1 year ago and were up 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable market impacts and new business partially offset by unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates.","The sequential growth was primarily due to favorable markets partially offset by unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 4% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business flows while the sequential increase was primarily related to favorable markets, partially offset by lower end of period securities lending collateral levels as well as unfavorable moves in currency exchange rate.","Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 9% from last year and down 2% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition revenue was up approximately 8% from last year. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $939 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down slightly from the prior quarter. Excluding the UBS acquisition, fees were up approximately 6% on a year-over-year basis. Foreign exchange trading income was $72 million in the third quarter, up 46% year-over-year and down 9% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function as well as higher client volumes. The sequential decline was driven by lower client volumes.","Other non-interest income was $55 million in the third quarter, down 25% compared to 1 year ago and down 22% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the previously mentioned investment impairment, lower impacts from net hedge activity, a decline relating to the valuation of existing swap agreements related to the Visa Class B common shares and lower banking and credit related service charges. The sequential decline was also impacted by the investment impairment and the Visa swap valuations as well as lower security commissions and trading income, lower treasury management fees and lower banking and credit related service charges. Net interest income which I will discuss in more detail later was $418 million in the third quarter, increasing 14% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially.","Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled $541 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year, but down 2% on a sequential basis. Approximately one half of the year-over-year growth was due to the UBS acquisition. The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fee growth by approximately one half of a point. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees was $375 million, up 11% compared to the prior year and down 1% sequentially. The slowing does include the UBS acquisition related fees. Excluding these fees custody and fund administration fees were up approximately 4% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business and the impact of favorable markets, partially offset by currency translation. The sequential decline was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of currency translation and lower transaction volumes, partially offset by favorable markets.","Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.2 trillion at quarter end, up 12% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Approximately half of the year-over-year growth was attributable to the UBS fund administration acquisition. Excluding the acquisition the year-over-year increases primarily reflect favorable markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Sequentially, the benefit of markets were partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fee with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $109 million in the third quarter were up 4% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily due to favorable markets and a change to gross revenue presentation for certain clients. The sequential decline was primarily due to outflows and adjustments made in the prior quarter due to a change to gross revenue presentation for certain clients.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $876 billion, up 4% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business were the drivers of the year-over-year growth. The sequential performance was driven by favorable market impacts, partially offset by a lower level of end of period securities lending collateral as well as unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.","Securities lending fees were $24 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year, but down 20% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. The sequential quarter decline reflects the typical season pattern with the international dividend season driving wider spreads in the second quarter of each year. Securities lending collateral was $167 billion at quarter-end and averaged $170 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 14% year-over-year, but declined 8% sequentially.","Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the third quarter, down 7% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects lower sub-advisor fees. The lower income associated with sub-advisor fees has an associated lower expense in the outside services category. This decline in sub-advisor fees is consistent with the prior three quarters when we discontinued our service offering. The decline in sub-advisor fees was partially offset by higher fees associated with other ancillary services such as risk and analytics services. The sequential growth was also driven by higher fees associated with ancillary services.","Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $398 million in the third quarter, up 9% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Within wealth management, the Global Family Office business fees increased 9% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business and favorable markets. Sequential performance reflects new business and favorable markets partially offset by a decline in transaction volumes.","Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, higher fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and new business. Sequential performance benefited from favorable markets and new business as well as higher service-related fees. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $296 billion at quarter-end, up 4% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Moving to page six, net interest income was $418 million in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $113 billion in the third quarter, essentially flat with the prior year.","Total deposits averaged $94 billion and were down 4% year-over-year. Interest-bearing deposits declined 2% from one year ago to $74 billion. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $19 billion during the third quarter were down 11% from one year ago. Loan balances averaged $32 billion in the third quarter and were down 5% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.47% in the third quarter and was up 18 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates and lower premium amortization, partially offset by a balance sheet mix shift.","On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down $4 million or 1%. Average earning assets declined 2% sequentially, driven by decreases in deposits. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin decreased 1 basis point as the favorable impact of higher short-term rates was offset by balance sheet mix and day count. As we've discussed in our most recent quarters, we did continue to see the opportunity for foreign exchange swap activity with our treasury function. This activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to Central Bank deposits as we swap out of U.S. dollars, but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income. For this quarter, we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of $19 million, offset by $17 million less in net interest income. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the third quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposits. This compared to 70% 1 year ago and is unchanged from the prior quarter.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were $1 billion in the third quarter and were 7% higher than the prior year and up 1% on a sequential basis. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $2.7 million in expenses associated with severance and other charges. For comparison purposes, note that 1 year ago, our results included severance and other charges of $7 million, while the prior quarter included $6.6 million in severance and other related charges. The UBS acquisition contributed just under 2.5 points of year-over-year growth. Excluding both the UBS acquisition as the called out charges, expense for the current quarter was just over 5% higher than a year ago.","With respect to the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, the following items were key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher driven by increased incentive compensation in this year\u2019s base pay adjustments which were effective in April. The impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Benefits were higher primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses, medical costs and higher payroll tax withholding compared to the prior year. Outside service costs were higher driven primarily by higher technical services expense and third-party advisor fees partially offset by lower consulting, legal and sub-advisor expenses. There was a corresponding increase to Trust Investment and other servicing fees as a result of the higher third-party advisor fees due to the change to gross revenue presentation. Equipment software expenses, was up year-over-year due to higher software amortization and disposition charges. Occupancy-related costs were higher compared to the prior year primarily relating to higher building operation costs, real estate taxes and rent expense. Other operating expenses were up slightly from the prior year due primarily to higher business promotion and other miscellaneous expense.","Shifting to the sequential expense view, excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses were up 1% primarily reflecting higher other operating expense partially offset by a decline in compensation expense. Compensation expense declined sequentially due to lower equity and cash-based incentives. The decline in equity incentives was driven by lower expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive compensation resulting from higher charges recorded in the prior quarter associated with grants to retirement eligible employees. Other operating expense increased 29% from the prior period driven by higher business promotional spend, primarily associated with the Northern Trust golf tournament, which was held during the quarter as well as other miscellaneous expense. Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year and less than 2% sequentially. Approximately one half of the year-over-year staff growth was the impact of the UBS acquisition. The remainder of the growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona partially offset by reductions in our higher cost locations.","Turning to Page 8, as we have discussed on previous calls through our value per spend initiative we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run-rate savings by 2020. Concurrently, we are embedding a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our third quarter results reflect approximately $28 million in expense savings reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately by 3 points. This would equate to approximately $114 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities.","Turning to Page 9, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pre-tax margins and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity.","Turning to Page 10, our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.4% under the advanced approach and 12.9% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.9% and at the bank was 6.4%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement that became applicable to Northern Trust effective at the start of the year. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective at the start of 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models of further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the third quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $236 million. We also increased our dividend 31% to $0.55 per quarter. These two actions combined represent a payout ratio of just over 100% for the quarter.","In closing, Northern Trust continued to deliver solid financial results in the quarter, growing earnings per share of 32% over the prior year and achieving return on average common equity of 15.1%. Importantly, as we seek to drive profitable growth, we delivered positive fee operating leverage and positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. As compared to the prior year, our organic fee and expense growth rates were better aligned. Performance has also been strong on a year-to-date basis with earnings per share growth of 42% and return on average common equity of 15.9%. Through three quarters, we have achieved 4.4 points of positive operating leverage and 3.5 points of positive fee operating leverage. Profitability continues to be strong in each of our businesses. On a year-to-date basis, our wealth management business grew pre-tax income by 18% versus 1 year ago, while improving the pre-tax margin from 39% to 42%. Our C&IS business similarly drove strong year-over-year performance with pre-tax income growing 33% and pre-tax margin improving from 30% to 33%. Both businesses delivered strong year-over-year fee operating leverage and total operating leverage. The consistency of our relationship focused strategies positions us as a leader in attractive markets. We are focused on continuing to invest for the future to accelerate our growth and improve our profitability.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Todd, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Mike.","Michael Carrier","Good morning. Biff, first question, just on the C&IS, I guess the assets and then the fund administration and the investment management revenues, when I look sequentially just seems like when we look at the market trends, whether it\u2019s end-of-period, average and lag, it still seems like the growth rates, there is something else that\u2019s off and I understand the FX too, but when we look at the markets we usually include those in the market returns. So, I am just trying to understand on a sequential basis, was there anything else that was impacting the growth rates both in the custody and fund administration investment management because both came in lighter relative to sort of the market expectations?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, let me walk you through that. There was a sequential decline as you pointed out and I will try to add color to that. If we look, we were down about $11 million sequentially. About half of that, about $6 million of that was securities lending fees, which have as you know some sequential between the second and third quarter, some seasonality. That was driven really by lower volumes, lower borrower demand, particularly in global equities and the spreads tightened as we saw versus LIBOR in that. Then you get to investment management fees. They were also down sequentially, about a little over $4 million. About half of that decline was driven by what I would say there were some outflows and modest re-pricing captured in that line. So, that drove some of that along with we had about half of that $4 million was from a net to gross true-up in the second quarter, so couple of million dollars from that, that we \u2013 when we lap it sequentially it could create some of the variance. And then you get to the custody and fund administration fees and the growth rate there or lack of growth rate there, there was some currency translation as you put out, but I think it\u2019s important to remember the transaction volumes are also a factor in this line item and somewhere between 20% to 25% of our C&IS custody and fund administration fees are really driven by transaction volumes, they are not driven by market levels. So, that was an important driver in the decline there.","As it relates to growth in the business or organic growth in the business, I would like to bring this point out. I think that when we look at organic growth in our businesses, we like to look at it on a year-to-date or over longer periods of time. And when we look at where we are through three quarters of this year, we are in the range that we have discussed with you around the organic growth rates in our businesses and we have talked about that being in the 4% to 5% range as a firm. We are in that year-to-date. In any given quarter, we could be slightly lower than that. In this quarter, we were slightly lower than that and particularly in the C&IS business, we were below their trend rate. That being said, as we look out into the fourth quarter, where we have known new business implementations both in our pipeline and known new business implementations, we still feel very good about getting to that historical organic growth rate that we have talked to you about in any given quarter that could potentially drive the fees going directionally at different ways, but we feel good about what we know. In the fourth quarter, some implementations, particularly in the C&IS business can be pushed from quarter-to-quarter and that can cause a little bit of fluctuation in any one given quarter, but still like I said feel good about the year\u2019s view of the organic growth rate in both of our businesses quite frankly.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow-up, just on the net interest revenue, you mentioned the $17 million, I think that was included as a headwind given the swap activity. I guess just when we think about going forward anyway to think about how much of that activity will continue and then given the reduction that you saw on the deposit side, your comments on the growth organically, just any kind of outlook in terms of how we should be thinking about the balance sheet going forward?","Biff Bowman","Okay. So, couple of questions in there, right. I got a balance sheet question and then the FX trade. On the FX trade as we pointed out, it was $19 million of additional FX in the quarter, but with a $17 million net interest income give up in the quarter. One of the ways to look at this is the\u2026","Mark Bette","3-month cross currency U.S. dollar euro swap is one that you can look at, because euro is an area where we have been doing these trades during this quarter.","Biff Bowman","So, if you go on to Bloomberg, you can look at that and pull that up and if that spread narrows, that trade becomes with there is more NII give up and less FX spread over that. So, that\u2019s one way on that line item. We will continue to look at that and determine if it\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders to leave that trade on or not and we just have to look at market trends and where we are so far in the quarter that trade particularly euros versus dollars is still profitable for our shareholders and that\u2019s what you would see if you looked at it on the Bloomberg terminal.","Mark Bette","And that\u2019s something Mike that we will look to give an update on as we get later into the quarter and we have an opportunity.","Biff Bowman","In terms of the second part of your question, which is probably get into what others, let\u2019s say around the balance sheet. What I would say on the balance sheet is this, we certainly continue to monitor the non-interest bearing deposit and have regular dialogs with our clients, you saw the $2 billion or so that came off of our balance sheet in non-interest bearing deposits. In the quarter, we provide them with a number of solutions for their liquidity needs whether that\u2019s on balance sheet off balance sheet etcetera. As far as the declines we saw this quarter on that $2 billion. About 40% of that decline was within the category that we have discussed before here which represents mainly from our fund services business and these would be asset managers and hedge funds, etcetera. This is also the category that we saw the most declines in when you think back to the second quarter and third quarter of 2017. What we do believe is that most of what remains within that category is now just under $5 billion, which is now just under $5 billion is that there is \u2013 they are there for day-to-day operational needs that we are actually seeing the interest rate sensitivity in that bucket. Most of those clients we think the balances are that stay with us are there for operational needs. So i.e., we have seen much of the rundown in that buckets that we think we would see. If you look at the remainder of where that $2 billion went, the other part of the $2 billion was split really between two categories. The first was what I would say is our global institutional asset servicing business or kind of BAU custody business. And I think those deposits can ebb and flow from a quarter-to-quarter basis depending on our clients cash and capital deployments, that\u2019s putting it to work as a part of their regular BAU business as usual dealings. We see this kind of fluctuation on a regular basis. And then the last portion of that $2 billion was really more around our treasury management, our commercial DDA type accounts. And it\u2019s quite transactional in nature and so we can see that kind of volatility to that was a little bit more pronounced than we would normally see, but was a little bit more in the commercial DDA bucket. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Hey Biff. Thanks for all that color you just gave. On the outflows, I guess the bigger question is, is that \u2013 it\u2019s really tough to this game just the size of the balance sheet moving forward and I guess I wanted to ask you underneath all of that, do you still see or expect to see deposit growth from core customers as the business grows, are we still at the point where we are just going to be sun-setting the proportion the non-interest bearing directionally and we might not see the overall balance sheet grow that much from here, how do you guys think about that big picture?","Biff Bowman","Yes, we do. Ken we think we will still get that growth from the core custody business and we do a lot of modeling around that as we need to do understand for instance our liquidity coverage ratio and others. But there is significant correlation between our growth in AUC and other things that absolutely drive the balance sheet larger, but we got to continue to grow the core business. But we do believe that the balance sheet will grow from core asset servicing wins over time. There could be some bumpiness in that as we look at the balance sheet and it seeks certain yield. But I think over long periods of time if we continue to grow the franchise with the organic growth rates we have talked about here, we will see the balance sheet respond with that type of growth as well.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then within the buckets, can you just talk about just deposit pricing, interesting we saw not unexpected faster deposit pricing we see in terms of the rates paid, sequentially even with some of the declines shown in the savings money and other, so can you just talk us about the trajectory there and split it across the businesses like you have done in the past when have you gotten to in terms of those betas and how are deposits continuing to act in that regard?","Biff Bowman","Yes. Sure. I will start off by saying I think we have a very disciplined process when it comes to our deposit pricing and \u2013 but we got to be competitive. So if I look at deposit betas that offer you some of the following color it\u2019s a little difficult to just look at one quarter, but I am going to try to break this apart for you. I am sorry if we look at just one quarter we can have catch-ups and I think you need to look at the deposit betas over a longer period of time, perhaps looking at it on a couple of quarters or a year. So if you look our betas over the last couple of quarters, here is what I would say. For the U.S. dollar portion of our non-U.S. office deposits were probably between a 65% and a 75% beta. The vast majority of these deposits as you know are institutional type deposits. Roughly 55% of our non-U.S. deposits are U.S. dollar and there is also some wholesale deposits within that mix. If you look at the savings, money market and other line, I think of that as largely our wealth management deposits or a portion of them, we\u2019re probably in the 50% to 60% range for betas over the last couple of quarters in aggregate. I think that line includes our retail wealth management deposits as I just said, which are a little bit below that range, but there\u2019s also some institutional deposits in the savings, money market and other line, which are above that range, which brings the blend somewhere into that 50% to 60% range. And I\u2019d just add that we continue to monitor what money funds and other alternatives bring in terms of the viability of those inside and the competitiveness of those as we think about the betas going forward. So hopefully that\u2019s enough color. Mark?","Mark Bette","And then Ken I think you had also asked about the decline that we saw in savings, money market and other, and within that bucket about 75% of that is wealth management deposits and that is where we saw declines during this quarter, was on the wealth management side, and we did see of that about half of that would have moved into off-balance sheet funds and then what\u2019s left with kind of split between whether there was deployment from clients whether it was investments or debt pay-downs, and then there were some that we would have seen of that other bucket that would have just left our balance sheet or balances were pulled down by clients.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Hey good morning, guys. Actually I just \u2013 I want to follow up on that last comment. I believe Mark that you made about the proportion of the decline in the non-interest bearers rolling on to the balance sheet. Given those dynamics, does that result in a bit of a catch-up on the deposit cost when you see those wealth management clients roll into interest-bearing and can that put some temporary upward pressure on what would look like a single quarter beta, which I think Biff you referenced earlier?","Biff Bowman","Yes, one thing I would say Brennan, so the decline that we saw in wealth management deposits, the non-interest part of wealth management deposits was actually pretty stable in the quarter. The decline that we saw was in the interest-bearing side for the wealth management deposit.","Mark Bette","That was already in there.","Biff Bowman","But Brennan to the larger point you brought up there that\u2019s why I try to say in any given quarter, the beta is going to look large if there\u2019s catch-up from either being slightly lagging markets and disciplined, and we really do try to look at them over a year or some longer period of time to understand how the beta has actually moved. In any given quarter there could be pricing catch-up, sometimes there can be pricing slowdown if we\u2019ve gotten ahead in any quarters. This quarter would look like more like pricing catch-up in some of the lines.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then when we think about the transactional volumes which you referenced having an impact on the C&IS rate so to speak, the way kind of have to model it from the outside. Was that transactional weakness fairly consistent through the quarter or was September particularly weak and then I\u2019m guessing when you think about fourth quarter given your comments about looking at the pipeline and your outlook and expectation of rebound that would suggest that fourth quarter volumes look like a return to a more normal pace. Is that fair?","Biff Bowman","Yes. They were slower in the early part of the quarter and certainly slowest in August with some pick up a little bit in September, particularly as we got near the end of September. And I don\u2019t have the numbers through October, we\u2019ll give you some color on that in December, but I would say the earlier quarter was the slower periods from transactions.","Brennan Hawken","Okay Thanks for clarifying that.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Brian.","Brian Bedell","Hi, great, thanks \u2013 hi, good morning. Not to beat the dead horse on the deposit beta, but maybe just come out from one different angle on the non-interest-bearing side, just looking at the last tightening cycle in \u201804-\u201906, and I appreciate the company is structured a little bit different, but just looking at non-interest-bearing versus total deposits, I think that came down from something like 20% or 21% at the start of that cycle down to about 11% to 12% by the end of the cycle. This cycle so far you are starting in at around 28% and now you are down to about 21%, so just \u2013 and again that\u2019s the non-interest bearing deposits divided by the total deposits. So just wanted to understand the nature of the structural difference and thinking about that bucket going forward from here? Sorry if I missed to breakout of the total balance between wealth management and CINF, but if you could bifurcate that just so we could understand maybe some of the risks to that on at least the wealth side and of course you mentioned money market products being another substitute, how do you view clients switching into those types of products?","Biff Bowman","Okay. Here is what I would say. I think we have a fairly significant different business mix between 2004 and 2006 when you look at the construct of the balance sheet. There are more institutional, large institutional asset management type clients that exist on the balance sheet for that period of time. So, that measure you had of it moving from 20 to let\u2019s call it 12 over that period of time may not necessarily translate to now, because the mix of clients on the balance sheet could be fairly meaningfully different. We did our largest acquisition in the GFS space in 2005 and it\u2019s moved to be a much different proportionality of our business. If I look at that mix though of the 19, the second part of your question was sort of how is that $19 billion mix today. First, let me start off about 90% of that is in dollars, just under 90% of it is in \u2013 about 87%, and then about 30% of that is in wealth management deposits, 20% is what I would say are in support of our treasury cash management business and then the remaining 50% is really attributable to what I just described the C&IS business, some core and some supporting asset managers in there. So, that\u2019s kind of the breakdown of that $19 billion to $20 billion. But I wouldn\u2019t want to pre-suppose that it moves back down to 11% or 12% as a percent of the balance sheet, because our mix is different. I don\u2019t have that answer, but I don\u2019t think that you can make that assumption correctly given the different specs for the company and that need to be passed to be there to support large asset managers\u2019 activities.","Brian Bedell","Great. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks. And then just a follow-up, I guess just on the expense side is how should we think about your target on that expense to trust fee ratio and bringing that down? How should we think about that behaving if we get more pressure on the equity markets that would obviously reduce the denominator of that or do you feel that you can be responsive on the expense side to downturns in market-based fees or should we just think of that as sort of a natural outcome of any pressure in the market that that expense to trust fee ratio may drift back up?","Biff Bowman","So, I would say, let me give you a longer term view first is we absolutely think that we can continue to drive that lower with things like value for spend and a lot of initiatives that we have going on. In the short-term to be able to react to market volatility or down perhaps in the market in any given quarter that maybe difficult. Remember that some proportionality of our expenses, are going to move with that same market decline. So, they move directionally with that, so we get that benefit, but there are others that are more fixed or not directly tied to that market level and we are getting after those. We think though over quarters that we can have an expense discipline that\u2019s more closely aligned with the revenue fees that we are seeing. That\u2019s why I would just add that we talked on these calls a lot about continuing to do what we can to drive the organic fee leverage into our business, meaning the things that we can most control are how much fast we grow it organically and how much expense we need to support that growth. And as long as we get those in line with some leverage, the markets over long periods of time will likely be upward sloping and be our friend. So, hopefully that answers your question.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Alex.","Alex Blostein","Hi, guys. Good morning. So maybe just to wrap up the NII conversation, couple of things I wanted to follow up on. I guess one thing in the past, you talked about just the overall size of non-interest bearing deposit, would you guys consider sort of at-risk around off, I think was in about $5 billion to $6 billion range and now if you gave us budget, you can\u2019t break it down by bucket now is helpful, but is the total 5 to 6 still the right number. So you kind of said look too left. So we are still dealing with like maybe 4ish or so at risk, is that sort of the right framework still or is the 5 to 6 maybe a higher number? That\u2019s part one. And then I had a quick follow-up on the deposit beta. I\u2019ll just ask that after.","Biff Bowman","Alex, I think that, that number is actually smaller than 5 to 6. Now, I think that where the rate moves we have seen with what eight hikes I think we have had now, we actually think that the rate sensitive money in there has probably already in our discussions with that pool, we think that the rate sensitive portions of that have started to move or have already moved, I should say have already moved. So, it\u2019s smaller, it\u2019s not zero, I should be clear, but I think it\u2019s smaller than the 5 to 6 that we talked about. So I think we are seeing some of that rate sensitivity money already of taking action. So I would size that little smaller than that. I can\u2019t give you the exact number, but I think we have seen a lot of that action. Some of what you saw in this quarter as I tried to describe earlier, there was some that moved from that bucket I think we said about 40%, so I think that part. The others, I would say, was more what I would say BAU kind of moves that we could see from normal transactional volume, they could leave and come in any given quarter of that. Hopefully that helps give a little more color.","Alex Blostein","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then with respect to deposit betas, so I know you guys said I think like 55% or 60% deposit betas, I wasn\u2019t sure what you are talking about kind of over the course of the year, because if I look at Q3, it seems a bit higher than that especially when you consider a portion of deposits outside the U.S. So was there any particular catch-up. I know you said occasionally there might be one or two over there and outsized catch-up in deposit pricing this quarter. So again kind of looking out into Q4 perhaps we are not going to see us making the move?","Biff Bowman","I think it would be fair to assume that the outsized or the larger beta that you saw in the quarter would have some competitive catch-up in it where we have to evaluate where we are and we may have had the benefit in Q2 and we have to assess where we are on the competitive landscape. We get some of that data at the end of quarters as you may know from others and it provides us with the opportunity to price competitively. So, that\u2019s an assumption and let you go from there.","Alex Blostein","Yes. That\u2019s what it sounded like. Alright, last one, promise. So you said that you guys made some pricing adjustments in C&IS on the investment management side, can you expand on that? I know it sounded like there was maybe a little bit of a drag on investment management fees and C&IS this quarter? And then just bigger picture, when you guys talking about 4% to 5% organic growth over time obviously not quarter-to-quarter, but kind of on an annual basis maybe you guys are thinking about in terms of organic fee growth correct, not organic asset growth was just sort of taken into account any sort of price degradation we might see?","Biff Bowman","So yes, it\u2019s organic fee growth. It\u2019s exactly right. And the first part of the question was around, sorry repeat\u2026","Alex Blostein","The re-pricing within\u2026","Biff Bowman","Re-pricing with within asset management was I would say it was along the lines of we have a large passive franchise inside of our C&IS business in particular and as you know the competitive nature of that is very much in the press and we are not immune to that either and we have important clients and we have dialogs with them on a regular basis around the pricing and we have some of that in the period. It has a negative impact on our fees.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Geoff.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe more on the custody fund administration side, could you talk there about what you are seeing in terms of competition and fee pressure? It feels like all of the industry you are serving is under pressure, so how is that translating into pressure on the fee rates you can generate there?","Biff Bowman","Yes, it certainly continues to remain competitive in that space and it really has more nuance than just for me to just say that broad-brush. In certain markets, we could see very highly competitive pricing, parts of Asia or we could see it in other parts of the world. In other parts where we see what I would say is more measured and pragmatic pricing. So I\u2019m hesitant to give you anything other than it\u2019s a really competitive landscape for pricing. We feel pretty good about our ability to compete and still drive margins. We talked about the margins in our C&IS business continue to expand in the quarter, so they are able to win without margin erosion in that space. So we feel pretty good, but it is still a very competitive landscape in that space. I do think in the macro environment, we are able if you can bring value proposition, you can still get paid for it in this space, but you have to demonstrate the value you are creating for the marketplace in which we compete, particularly in the institutional side of the business, which is what I think you are referencing. I think on the wealth side we demonstrate that value proposition very effectively and we have seen really very strong growth on the fee side on the wealth management business.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you. And just a quick one on the deposit side, what gives you confidence that those outflows you saw in DDAs and in the custody business are just kind of normal ebbs and flows, because I guess if we look across the banks that have been reporting has a pretty clear mixture of non-interest bearing deposits flowing out across the board. So what kind of gives you confidence that those might be back again in a quarter or two?","Biff Bowman","So, let me break them apart, because I think you said on the wealth side, I don\u2019t know that\u2026.","Geoffrey Elliott","On the casualty side and the commercial DDA\u2026","Biff Bowman","Yes, well, we track the trends client by client over time. We do that and we have seen these types of things before. I guess I can\u2019t guarantee that they come back, but we have seen these types of ebbs and flows in the past from those clients that we tracked at a client level that drove some of this in the quarter. I can\u2019t guarantee that they come back, they could have excess cash, but we are tracking it at a client level and we have seen these types of moves before from those in which clients we had. So we will continue to track that and you are absolutely right, it could be something that was more permanent in nature, but that\u2019s our current and most informed view.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. Couple of questions. One in the prepared remarks, Biff, I think you discussed a little bit about the risk and analytics services that we are adding to one of the fee rate lines and just wanted to dig in a little bit and understand some of the drivers there and opportunity set, I know also you put out press release recently about the integrated trading solutions product and wanted to see if that was at all driving the forward look on what risk and analytics services could do for you?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, the two separate services, so I will go first to risk and analytics services, we have for a long time provided what I will call the analytics and analysis of particularly fund performance of pension fund or whatever. So when a pension fund board or a public fund board is evaluating how their assets have performed and their managers have performed, we provide very detailed analytics and it\u2019s another way for us to use the data we have and work with them to provide what I call very high value-added services. They continue to do great work and have been able to grow that business and it\u2019s been a very value-added part of the relationship. I will let Mark give you an update on ITS.","Mark Bette","Hi, Betsy. Yes. So, really, the ITS is kind of a bit of an offshoot from in 2016 when we acquired Aviate Global to kind of strengthen our global brokerage business. So, really those \u2013 it\u2019s a solutions for our asset owners and asset managers. It\u2019s really that I would say is more in the security commissions and trading space than it would be within the trust fee categories and we have seen good growth in that area. I would say that for this quarter, the security commissions and trading performance was impacted by transition management activity being lower and as well as interest rate swap activity being lower and those do tend to be more volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but when we look at the underlying like core brokerage trends, including ITS, we see some good growth there.","Betsy Graseck","And this ITS announcement looked like it was aimed at Europe, is that accurate or is there something here to for U.S. as well?","Biff Bowman","Yes. I think it certainly is being primarily run through Europe right now, because that\u2019s where the predominance of the Aviate acquisition was. And I think we will look to see if there is availability in the U.S. or applicability in the U.S. or Asia.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Great. Thanks. Good morning. So, just a quick question on the comp expense, I want to make sure that the third quarter is a good jumping off point when we think about where we are going in the fourth quarter. I think you mentioned that there were some impacts on incentive comps in the quarter from previous quarters. Was there an accrual reversal in the quarter or was this the number that you posted a clean number to think about for fourth quarter?","Mark Bette","Brian, hi, it\u2019s Mark. Yes, I would say that it\u2019s a fairly clean number. I mean the decline that we would have had for the equity incentive compensation really relates to when we issue the grants in the first quarter for retirement eligible expense that gets recognized over the first two quarters, most of it in the first and then $11 million of it was in the second quarter. So that would have rolled off in the third quarter. So what\u2019s left I would say is a pretty probably good solid starting point as far as compensation goes.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. And then on the outside services it looks like it was about a year ago you mentioned that there was some ability to maybe manage that number down, but it seems that just keep going up, how do you think about that going forward, I mean is there an opportunity to manage those expenses lower in \u201819 or \u201820?","Biff Bowman","Yes. I would say when we look at the year-over-year growth in outside services we are looking at about 6% to 7%. There is probably about 3 points of that would have been from the acquisition. And then when you look at what\u2019s left about 3% of growth. There is the impact of the higher third-party advisor fees for revenue recognition and net to gross accounting slightly offset by lower sub-advisor costs, but we would say that you are probably looking at when you adjust for those things a pretty modest amount of growth, really driven by technical services, which includes market data, but offset by we are seeing lower consulting and legal expense on a year-over-year basis. So, that\u2019s outside services on a year-over-year basis.","Mark Bette","Yes. And I will add one piece to that too there. There can be you have seen some improvement I think in the trajectory of the compensation line in some cases where we have chosen to outsource the outside service line picks up the expense, but the comp line should come down commensurately. So, we have some \u2013 we have talked about some of our managed services around their technology that we have done. That\u2019s another underlying driver of that as well.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hello, there. Two quick summary questions. One on you gave us pieces of revenue and expense ex-UBS, ex-FX ex-charges. Can I just pull it together just to show and make sure what the change \u2013 what you think the clear growth of revenue expense and operating leverage was ex all those pieces?","Biff Bowman","Sure, yes. That is the way we look at it. That\u2019s good. I would say if you pull ex-currency, ex-acquisition, ex-charges, we would say that trust fees were probably up 5.5% or so and we would look at our expense to be in the 5% to 5.5% range excluding all of those items too. That\u2019s not organic, that\u2019s just sort of at the core if we pull all those things out. So that\u2019s how we would look at fees and expenses and core revenue they would be about 8%. Core revenue ex all of the items that we talked about would be 8%.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. And then that maybe the final one, just to title together on net interest income, I heard the whole thing about each of the pieces, but I am sure people looking at is balance sheet didn\u2019t grow much, NIM was down 1 basis point sequentially, then we have a mix shift issues and the deposit beta issues. When you pull it altogether it sounds like net interest income would never grow, no matter what rates do and what customer balances do, but that doesn\u2019t make sense meaning as your business grows as customers grows as you are \u2013 you win new business, the question I have is do you have a ballpark idea range of what you would think over a years period time, what if your organic growth is 4% or 5% what net interest income should accompany with it over time?","Biff Bowman","Yes. I won\u2019t give that range, but I will say this. We absolutely think that the NIM can expand and the balance sheet can grow and the NIM can expand. As long as we continue to see the deposit betas move sort of at where we are seeing industry levels and again not just looking at one quarter, but looking at trends in the deposit betas we think it can expand and we think the balance sheet can get bigger with the organic growth trajectory that we have talked about before. This quarter had some movement in it. We had mix shift in the balance sheet. We had some runoff of the non-interest bearing deposits. But we absolutely think that it can expand particularly if you think rates are going to rise in that environment the value of the non-interest bearing deposits that exist on our balance sheet are even greater in terms of expansiveness of that NIM. So we do believe that it\u2019s just this quarter it kind of flattened out. I think you need to look at the trajectory of our NIM and its migration more than just one quarter. I know that\u2019s what you do, but we need to look at it over longer periods of times it may have some stair stepping to it over time.","Glenn Schorr","And certainly the sequential LIBOR moves were muted this quarter versus what we saw in the first two quarters of the year, so on the asset side that would have translated with less upside sequentially for the assets\u2026?","Biff Bowman","Yes. I mean we looked \u2013 we have a shorter duration balance sheet as you know I think the three months LIBOR averaged 2.34 for both the second and third quarters. So essentially no movement from what we saw in the second quarter. One month LIBOR did expand that was about 14 basis points, about half of what we saw in the previous quarter. One month LIBOR is our largest impactful and three months LIBOR is the second, so they both were muted relative to the rate move. I don\u2019t know how long that \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that trend will be in this quarter.","Glenn Schorr","Got it. One last cleanup, on the other operating income line you gave us all the reasons on why it was lower, I guess my only question is what is the right jumping off point where we go forward, in other words it was 20 this quarter, is was 30 the quarter before, it was 40 a year ago, you had a bunch of things that impacted it, is 30 to 40 the right kind of hang out range?","Biff Bowman","I think if you look at this quarter, certainly in the other operating income we hope we won\u2019t have any community investment breakdowns of 8 million. So I would certainly not consider that recurring investment. In our Visa derivative, Mark this quarter was $5 million higher than it was a year ago. So if you back those two out, let you then figure out a range and Mark I don\u2019t know if you have any color you want to add. But I think those are two. The rest of those items in that bucket moved in somewhere around a more consistent pattern, but those two were somewhat extraordinary on the\u2026","Mark Bette","And the one thing that does get volatile within that category sometimes is the hedge. The hedge \u2013 the true up of the hedging, the net revenue hedging that we are doing which is off of a slight drag on a year-over-year basis. But that the overall impact of currency is kind of netted across the income statement and that\u2019s where some of those impacts.","Operator","Thank you. We will take the next question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Hey good morning.","Biff Bowman","Hi Jim.","Jim Mitchell","Hi, most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe quickly on deposits again just what have you seen I guess so far in October, have you seen kind of the typical runoff from period end, are you seeing any stickiness or a lack thereof, I guess just how we are thinking about what you have seen so far?","Biff Bowman","Yes. We will give you an update on that in December when we have had a chance to look at two months and give you some color on that. And as you see in our end of period balance sheet it can get quite large at the end of a period. And some of that can stick around for a week until it sort of gets displaced or put back into the market and so I would be uncomfortable giving you any view of that, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a better average and moving average by mid-December when we are in the public forum, we will be able to give you a much cleaner look.","Jim Mitchell","Right. But overall, you feel like most of the hot money has mostly gone and we can hopefully start to see some growth from here.","Biff Bowman","Yes.","Jim Mitchell","Okay. And then maybe on just the NIM, I have noticed LIBOR move too, I mean, if that is sustained, should be looking more at 1 month or 3 months for the balance sheet and all else equal, it seems like that should help into 4Q, right. Is there anything else if call out in terms of maybe in the securities portfolio you might have more turnover in the fourth quarter versus the third, how do we think about reinvestment yields there?","Biff Bowman","So the 1-month LIBOR spread movement and be an important item for you to track. So with 3 months but 1 month would be the primary in that. And then, you are right, as we look at assets maturing and the chance to reinvest in that, we do have a reasonable book of that business in the fourth quarter, slightly larger than a normal average, but I would focus more on the 1 month and 3 month LIBOR spreads in that space.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Can you remind us on your financial targets, I will tell you what I think I have I am not sure it\u2019s right. One is the ROE target of 10% to 15%, did you ever update that, will you update that? Two would be you are looking for organic fee growth in the 4% to 5% range as you said? Three, you look for organic fee growth to outpace core expense growth and then four you have value for spend looking for $250 million of savings by 2020 and also how much of that have you achieved?","Biff Bowman","So our one stated public external target, you are absolutely right is a 10% to 15% ROE. We have not updated that at this point. We have regular reviews to establish if that\u2019s the right range and we look at that. I think we have that range to be something that goes through cycles. Obviously, tax reform was a secular change that we have to think about contemplate what its impact should be particularly if it looks like tax reform is actually going to flow through the financials and not be priced away and that\u2019s why we have waited some period of time to assess just how the world would react to that. The other targets are items we talk about on the phone, they are not formal specifically given targets, but your thought process on all those is right, 250 for value for spend, trying to get to a positive organic tight view of fees to expenses and on organic growth rate over a longer period in the 4 to 5 range as we have talked about.","Mike Mayo","And your answer to Glenn\u2019s question earlier, you said that ex all the noise charges, the deal currency you have had what 8% core revenue growth, 5.5% core trust fee growth and 5% to 5.5% core expense growth. Was that year-over-year third quarter?","Biff Bowman","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right","Mike Mayo","And what are those same numbers?","Biff Bowman","I am sorry that was, that was the third quarter. Year-to-date, if you want it year-to-date, I would say our trust fees were 8%, our total revenue was 10% and our expense is 5% on a year-to-date. So a lot of leverage year-to-date. The quarter was a little bit tighter, but we are managing it more than just one quarter. So, that\u2019s the year-to-date performance.","Mike Mayo","And what I think I hear you saying several times is judge Northern by the year is not by every quarter, is that what I should be hearing?","Biff Bowman","I think what you are hearing is that in any given quarter and in particular in our C&IS business, which has very lumpy sized wins, you can see that move a little bit in any given quarter and you can see that net interest income with some nuances, some beta catch-ups and others have some slight pressures to it. I hope that we are judged on those metrics in longer periods than just 90 days, but that\u2019s where we are at.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Good morning. Well, if you will be patient with me. I have been putting a giant matrix together to look at all these different pieces and I think it\u2019s pretty interesting. If you look at year-over-year like you said, revenues are growing, NII is up double-digits, fee income is up higher single-digits. So, it\u2019s not the momentum you have had over the year, it\u2019s just the sequential quarter. If you look at the sequential quarter, expenses are up, but I imagine the golf tournament refracts most of that increased expenses from second quarter to third quarter. Am I about right on that?","Biff Bowman","So, there certainly is a sequential impact from the Northern Trust Open. There is also an offset to that that partially offsets that is we have some equity incentives that run down, but we have I believe we called it out last quarter the impact of the Northern Trust Open sequentially in\u2026","Mark Bette","In business promo about $17 million sequential increase and you will see when the 10-Q is filed we are right in that range.","Marty Mosby","So you can understand that that\u2019s more seasonal. If you look at the revenues and you get the NII going down in this particular quarter about $5 million, but am I hearing this correctly, $17 million impact from this FX swap income in NII. So, instead of a $5 million drop, do you take that $17 million and add it back that would be a $12 million increase in NII. Net-net, if you take out what\u2019s happening in fee income?","Biff Bowman","Weather was also a drag in the prior quarter of $14 million, so there is a $3 million decline from the FX swap activity here, so you guys do apples-to-apples, Marty, I think it would have been down 1ish.","Marty Mosby","Okay. So that\u2019s what I was trying to get out in the sense that you kept on about incremental really it\u2019s about know $3 millionish between quarters. So NII was relatively flat this particular quarter. If you look at the fee income, yes, so if you take that impact out, NII was relatively flat, you then flip over and look at your fee income and look at the actual components of the fee income between second quarter and third quarter. You actually had above $4 million of pricing impacts, you had $6 million of seasonality and you had then growth in the core. So, if you look at the actual core business, it\u2019s still up seasonality and then one pricing decision that you make is what basically brings your core down a couple of million dollars, but again that\u2019s two different things that are very understandable. FX is actually down 7%, but that\u2019s very noisy, it kind of comes in and out, so that\u2019s a very kind of quarter-to-quarter, you just got to see where that ends up.","Biff Bowman","Also seasonal. The third quarter is seasonally slow. There is a lot of holiday in July and August in Europe, particularly where we drive a lot of that.","Marty Mosby","And then if we look at the $8 million in other decline, you start looking at that number it\u2019s going to be the swap thing that\u2019s going on with the Visa Class B already taken out the $8 million related to the unusual item and then you got some basically security commissions and training this down $4 million.","So, I mean that\u2019s driving that. So, in other words, we got an unusual sitting down here. We have got some noise and trading that\u2019s from quarter-to-quarter. So if I back through this instead of seeing a decline of something like $25 million to $27 million in revenue, you really have core revenues that are up and then you have got seasonality hitting a couple of spots, you have got a price one pricing decision and you have got some noise and other. So when you start looking at it that way and say well, year-over-year we are still growing revenues 10% and in this particular quarter, it\u2019s just got a litany of things once you start looking at it cause everything to kind of round to the for the negative, which is what I am hearing you in your conversation trying to say, but the noise really covers that up this particular quarter. So I just wanted to kind of make sure I was walking through all that correctly?","Biff Bowman","Well, I think all of your \u2013 I was following all of your mental calculations there. I think they are all accurate, but that\u2019s what happens in a quarter, right, those are the kinds of moves that could happen, the sequential impacts that you talked about and others. I think you have accurately portrayed how they moved in the quarter and we continue to make decisions that are longer focused to that and we think are the right decisions and these things sort themselves out in more than 90 days sometimes. So we will continue to make those calls. And we believe that at a 15.1% ROE with all those things going your way, that\u2019s still a pretty attractive return in terms of an ROE and I would say it\u2019s also a pretty strong return when you consider that we are sitting on a 12.9% common equity Tier 1 ratio, so it\u2019s a well-capitalized franchise that can still generate pretty strong returns.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning.","Biff Bowman","Thank you. How are you, Gerard?","Gerard Cassidy","Good. Thank you. Biff, you just talked about that Visa differential in the quarter being $5 million greater this quarter, what was the total amount of the Visa mark in the other income this quarter?","Biff Bowman","It was. If we add all of the components together it was a little over $8.8 million in the quarter, so it was a large number, but again a year ago that was closer to 3.5 to 4. And that Visa mark is driven by a series of factors we look at the equity price of Visa, we look at our expected duration of the litigation, we look at the conversion ratio of our B shares to A shares. And that\u2019s driven many cases by any contributions made to settlement funds. So, all of those kind of in any given quarter be valued and come out, the Visa stock price has moved. Our thinking around the duration of the litigation can change in any given period and all of those ended up being a quite significant move this quarter. You can calculate it. It\u2019s in our queue. It\u2019s in our Visa Class B shareholdings are somewhere in the $900 million to $1 billion range right now depending on the Visa stock price as we sit here today, I don\u2019t know where it is, but somewhere in that range. So, it\u2019s a substantial off balance sheet, it\u2019s not off balance sheet, it\u2019s on the balance sheet at zero. So, it\u2019s on, but it is zero valuation.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Thank you for the color. Can you also share with us, I think you said that 20% to 25% of [C&IS] custody administration fees come from transaction volumes, what transaction volume should we monitor from the outside to see what type of activity may show up in a quarter in this area?","Mark Bette","Yes, Gerard, it\u2019s hard. I mean you could look at overall global market volumes of the driver. There is sometimes with through the sub-custodian network, there might be different timings of recoveries when those types of billings come through and then they come into the fees as well, but in general, I think looking at overall market volumes is a good way to probably try to judge that.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Hello, Vivek. Your line is live.","Vivek Juneja","Can you hear me?","Biff Bowman","Yes, yes.","Vivek Juneja","I am sorry. So, my question, thank you for taking it, your CET1 ratio, it\u2019s grown pretty sharply in the quarter to 12.9%. Firstly, what drove that 50 basis point increase? And secondly what is your plan with that since you are \u2013 it\u2019s so far above your targets, what do you \u2013 if especially with balance sheet growth being slower, do you accelerate your buybacks even more significantly over time?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, the drivers of that in this quarter were really a decline in the risk weighted assets, because as we said earlier, our total payout ratio in the quarter was a little bit north of 100, so we didn\u2019t really add anything to the equity portion, but we did have lower risk weighted assets in the quarter. The drivers of that lower risk weighted assets were lower foreign exchange exposures, lower securities lending exposures, lower what I will call other and we can have things like client settlement securities, client overdrafts and others. All of those quite frankly kind of win in our favor at period end and they helped drive the risk weighted asset out down, which drove CET1 up about 50 basis points. So that was the driver in the quarter. Those can have some end-of-period volatility to them. The second part of your question was, was really more around the how do we think about that. Look, we increased our dividend 31% starting in the third quarter and we bought or we were approved, we were not objected to by the Federal Reserve to buy up to $1 billion worth of stock in the quarter, we executed on that in this quarter as you can see from the buyback and we continue to look at that. We will look at that on our evaluation with our board and others in coming quarters and in the spirit of the next year\u2019s CCAR and capital ask with the board to see what the right return levels of capital are, but it\u2019s a strong position and we take all the factors you mentioned into consideration as we look at that capital return.","Vivek Juneja","And how are you thinking about dividend payout in this because your payout ratio has been below where it used to be several years ago. You are now depending on quarter-to-quarter anywhere with this increase this quarter you are still only at about 34%, 35%. So, do you think about where do you see that going longer term?","Biff Bowman","Yes. We do think about that and we think about that how that dividend payout ratio would be able to sustain itself and stress, we take great consideration of and we want great deal of certainty around the ability to pay that dividend. And so when we do our stress testing, we want to make sure that we have a dividend payout ratio that can sustain itself in stress when the earnings and other things are in stress. We have I think publicly said that we think being in that 30% to 40% range from a dividend payout ratio is an area where we feel comfortable with that over time and we will continue to evaluate that, but I think that\u2019s the reasonable range with the rest of our total payout ratio obviously being in the form of stock buyback, but we think that gives us the right mix and the right comfort around the importance of that dividend to our board and others.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone.","As you know, Jason Tyler became our CFO as of January 1st as Biff Bowman will be retiring after 35 years at Northern Trust. We're grateful to Biff for his many contributions as a trusted colleague and thoughtful leader throughout his time and especially for his significant contributions as CFO for the previous five years. I welcome Jason to the CFO role. He brings deep financial expertise and leadership experience and I am confident he will be very successful in the role.","Before Jason goes through our results in detail, I'd like to comment on some of the trends we're seeing in our businesses. Our performance for 2019 continued to exhibit foundational strength, as we executed on a number of growth strategies while continuing to advance our digital efforts and improve our productivity.","Our results for the year generated a return on average common equity of 14.9%. We also returned a record $1.7 billion to our common shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 11.8 million shares.","In our Wealth Management business, our capabilities and positioning continue to resonate in the marketplace. On a year-over-year basis, assets under management grew 13% to $314 billion and assets under custody grew 18% to $736 billion.","On the capability front, spurring some of this growth, we continue to invest in our data, digital, and analytics capabilities as well as in innovation around the delivery of goals-driven holistic advice.","We also closed out the year with the opening of a new office in Philadelphia, and we were named the Best Private Bank by the Financial Times Group for the 9th time out of the last 11 years. In sum, for Wealth Management, it was a very solid year performance and momentum.","Our Corporate & Institutional Services business remains focused on executing its growth strategies, digitalizing the business and innovating for the future to enable scalable growth. Assets under custody and administration ended the year at $11.3 trillion, up 19% from the prior year. We continued to achieve healthy organic growth in our core asset servicing fees within both the asset manager and asset owner segments, driven by our strong positioning.","We are also making targeted investments that are expected to continue to fuel growth in areas like front and middle-office outsourcing and capital markets. For example, we launched new capabilities in front-office solutions, integrated trading solutions, and currency management in 2019. Finally, C&IS is executing a multi-year strategy to digitize the business to drive more profitable, scalable, and sustainable growth into the future.","In Asset Management, we ended the year with $1.2 trillion in assets under management, an increase of 15% from the prior year. As the industry transitions through key secular shifts, we are delivering long-term value to stakeholders through, first, strengthening our areas of competitive advantage such as portfolio construction, quantitative research, and liquidity management.","Second, prioritizing investment in growth markets and growth segments such as financial intermediaries and family offices, and third, shifting our business mix to higher value-add products such as quant active, ETF, ESG and multi-asset.","As we enter 2020, we are excited about the competitive positioning within each of our businesses. We remain focused on providing our clients with exceptional service and expertise, driving efficiencies into our business and driving profitable growth.","Let me turn the call over to Jason to walk you through the details of our performance.","Jason Tyler","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone.","Let me join Mike and Mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning, we reported fourth quarter net income of $371.1 million.","Earnings per share were $1.70 and our return on common equity was 14.8%. The current quarter's results included a $20.8 million charge recorded in other operating income related to the decision to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio and a $6.8 million software disposition charge recorded within equipment and software expense.","As you can see on the bottom of Page 2, the macroeconomic environment was mixed. While equity markets were strong, short-term interest rates in the US declined both on a sequential as well as a year-over-year basis.","So through to Page 3 and a review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 3% with non-interest income up 4% from one year ago and net interest income flat. Expenses increased 5% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $1 million in the current quarter compared to a credit of $4 million one year ago. Net income was down 9% year-over-year.","In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 1% with both non-interest income and net interest income up 1%. Expenses increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Net income declined 3% sequentially. Return on average common equity was 14.8% for the quarter, down from 17% one year ago and 14.9% in the prior quarter.","Assets under custody\/administration of $12.1 trillion increased 19% compared to one year ago and were up 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $9.2 trillion were up 22% compared to one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis and up 2% on a sequential basis.","Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.6 billion, up 3% compared to last year and up 1% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $992 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% from last year and up 2% sequentially.","Foreign exchange trading income was $65 million in the fourth quarter, down 17% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function.","Other non-interest income was $70 million in the fourth quarter, down 6% compared to one year ago and down 17% sequentially. Other operating income included the aforementioned $20.8 million loss relating to the lease portfolio.","Excluding the lease related loss, the year-over-year growth was driven by implementation of a bank-owned life insurance program during 2019 and strong security commissions and trading income. The sequential growth excluding the lease portfolio loss was primarily driven by favorability in the Visa related swap.","Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $430 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the other period - flat with the prior period, and up 1% sequentially.","Now let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $567 million in the fourth quarter and were up 6% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis.","Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $397 million and up 6% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by new business and favorable equity markets. Performance on a sequential basis was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and favorable markets.","Assets under custody\/administration for C&IS clients were $11.3 trillion at quarter-end, up 19% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was primarily driven by higher markets, new business, and favorable currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $116 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business and favorable markets. The sequential performance was primarily due to favorable markets.","Assets under management for C&IS were $917 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business as well as an increase in end-of-period securities lending collateral levels.","We've had strong success within our liquidity products with significant growth in our institutional cash funds. The sequential increase was primarily driven by markets, partially offset by a decline in period-end securities lending collateral levels.","Securities lending fees were $23 million in the fourth quarter, up 4% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher volumes, while the sequential increase was primarily driven by higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $153 billion at quarter-end and averaged $164 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 4% year-over-year and were down 7% sequentially.","Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $425 million in the fourth quarter, were up 7% compared to the prior quarter and up 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under management were $314 billion at quarter-end, up 13% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The increases were primarily driven by favorable markets.","Moving on to Page 6, net interest income was $430 million in the fourth quarter and flat compared to the prior year. Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $89 billion and were down 4% versus the prior year.","The net interest margin was 1.59% in the fourth quarter and was up 7 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a balance sheet mix shift and the impact of lower foreign exchange swap volume, particularly - partially offset by lower short-term interest rates versus one year ago. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up 1%. Average earning assets increased 2% on a sequential basis, while the net interest margin declined 2 basis points.","It's worth noting that net interest income result for the quarter did include approximately $6 million in various one-time non-repeating items. During the quarter, we also added to our bank-owned life insurance program that was first put in place during the second quarter.","Compared to the prior quarter, this quarter's net interest income declined by approximately $900,000 as a result of the additional BOLI, while other operating income benefited by $1.5 million. The full quarterly run rate will be reached in the first quarter of 2020 with an additional net interest income decline of approximately $2.3 million and other operating income increase of $2.7 million on a sequential basis.","Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter, US dollar deposits represented 68% of our total deposits. This is down from 70% one year ago and 69% in the prior quarter.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 5% higher than the prior year and 3% higher versus the prior quarter. Compensation expense totaled $463 million and was up 4% compared to one year ago. The year-over-year growth was primarily related to higher salaries driven by base pay adjustments and staff growth, partially offset by lower incentive expense.","On a sequential basis, compensation was up 1%. The sequential increase was partially due to higher salary expense, driven by staff growth and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by lower cash-based incentive pools.","Employee benefit expense of $93 million was up 2% from one year ago and was up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher payroll taxes, while the sequential growth was primarily due to increased medical costs.","As it pertains to our benefits expense in 2020, due to changes in underlying assumptions, we expect to see an increase in full-year pension expense of just over $30 million, which represents a 0.7% increase in our overall total 2019 expense base.","Outside services cost of $206 million were up 5% on a year-over-year basis and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by higher technical services, consulting, and legal expense. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher legal and consulting services as well as costs related to increased business volumes, including brokerage clearing, market data, sub-custody and third-party adviser fees.","Equipment and software expense of $165 million was up 8% from one year ago and up 9% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were impacted by the previously mentioned software disposition charge of $6.8 million. The year-over-year growth also reflects higher depreciation and amortization, while higher software amortization costs contributed to the sequential increase.","Occupancy expense of $57 million was up 15% from one year ago and up 8% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were driven by higher rents and building operation costs related to our workplace real estate strategies.","Other operating expense of $88 million was down 1% from one year ago and down 4% sequentially. The sequential decrease was driven primarily by the Northern Trust sponsored golf tournament in the prior quarter, partially offset by increases in advertising, staff-related, and other operating expense categories.","As we've discussed on previous calls, through our Value for Spend initiative, which - that we started in 2017, we've been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense, run rate savings by 2020. Our current quarter results reflect approximately $60 million in expense savings or $240 million in annualized run rate savings.","Our efforts around Value for Spend and productivity more broadly will not cease as we further embed a culture of sustainable expense management across the company. Expense management is a core emphasis and we continue to focus on striking the right balance between productivity growth and investing in the business.","Now turning to full year, our results in 2019 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $1.5 billion, down 4% compared with 2018, and earnings per share were $6.63, flat with the prior year. On the right margin of this page, we outline the non-recurring impact that were called out for both years. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 14.9% compared to 16.2% in 2018.","The full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 3% in 2019. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation.","Foreign exchange trading income declined 18%, driven by a decrease in foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function as well as decreases in market volatility and lower client volumes. Net interest income increased 3%. Average earning assets during the year declined by 6% while net interest margin increased 14 basis points.","The net result was 2% growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2019. On a reported basis, expenses were up 3% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense charges in both 2018 and 2019 that are on the prior page, expenses were also up 3% from 2018.","Now turning to Page 10, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.7% under the standardized approach and 13.3% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7.6% and at the bank was 6.4%, both of which achieved 3% minimum requirement.","During the fourth quarter, we declared cash dividends totaling $150 million to common stockholders and repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of $264 million. These two factors combined represent a payout ratio of approximately 113% for the quarter.","Also during the fourth quarter, Northern Trust issued $400 million in perpetual preferred stock at a fixed for life dividend rate of 4.7%, callable in five years. Fixed rate dividends through this new issuance are expected to be paid on a quarterly basis with the first dividend declared at our Board of Directors meeting earlier this week and to be paid April 1st of 2020.","Given the November issuance, the initial preferred dividend payment will cover approximately five months and therefore is expected to equal $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2020. Going forward, these fixed rate dividends are expected to be $4.7 million a quarter.","The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C preferred stock in January - on January 2nd of 2020. First quarter 2020 results will include $11.5 million in accelerated Series C related costs.","Now let me turn the call back over to Mike for closing comments.","Mike O'Grady","Before we open up the call for Q&A, I wanted to close by talking about our key financial objectives and our performance against these in 2019. Our primary financial target is to achieve a return on average common equity of between 10% to 15%. For 2019, our ROE of 14.9% was at the high end of that range. This was the sixth consecutive year we have achieved our targeted ROE.","We are also focused on driving profitable growth and have objectives to achieve both fee operating leverage and positive operating leverage. Although we have achieved positive fee operating leverage in eight of the last 10 years and positive operating leverage in seven of the last 10 years, we did not achieve those for 2019.","As we enter 2020, we are continuing to rapidly evolve the company by providing differentiated services and experiences to our clients and investing in innovative capabilities to do more for our existing clients and gain new clients. We combine this with our intense focus on improving our productivity to profitably grow the company and create value for our stakeholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's fourth quarter earnings conference call today. Jason, Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. David, could you please open the line?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Mike, picking up on the last point, I guess when you talk about operating leverage, I guess over the last few quarters, you guys talked about getting organic expense growth to be in line with organic fee growth, not just total fee growth. I guess, question number one there, is the organic fee growth still in the 3% to 4% kind of range as you look out into 2020?","And then secondly, should we expect you to achieve this level of expense growth for the full year sort of despite the fact that markets are starting off on a very strong point and that should naturally create more kind of pressure or more tailwinds rather to fees? And I'm just wondering whether or not the sort of level of expense growth could be sustainable into 2020.","Mike O'Grady","So Alex, I think you're thinking about the framework the right way, which is, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused on the objective of generating positive fee operating leverage, and underneath that is the goal to achieve that on an organic basis as well, knowing that that is a higher bar, if you well.","But the reason why we focus on an organic basis is because, just as you indicated, when markets are stronger, we expect that we'll get more positive fee operating leverage from that.","It's more challenging to achieve that in, I'll call it, lower growth environments than when we do have the tailwinds, but that's why it's important to have that primary objective around organic. In 2019, we did not achieve the organic fee operating leverage.","And that's something that, certainly as far as what we're shooting for, we're trying to get that so that if we would have achieved it, we would had positive fee operating leverage here for the year. And going into 2020, it's the same objective.","Now, as Jason talked about and can go into more detail, there are certain aspects of the expense base that roll in. In this case, pension, as he mentioned for example, $30 million increase for the year. We still look to cover that, if you will, and try to just focus on the productivity objectives to try to overcome things like that as well. So the goals haven't changed from year to year. We can have different challenges to achieve it, but as far as what we're trying to achieve, it's the same objective.","Alex Blostein","And then Jason, one cleanup for you for an IR. It sounded like there were $6 million of one-time. I believe it was a benefit in Q4. Can you flesh that out a little bit to what are those benefits and maybe help us bridge the kind of the right jumping-off point for Q1 '20 in IR as we zone anything out on the quarter here. Thanks.","Jason Tyler","Yes. You've got the headline number right. It's about $6 million. It's a combination of a couple of different items. There is some premium am and then one thing we didn't headline much, but we did have a pay-off of a non - the loan that was on non-accrual, we picked up another $2 million in interest on that. And then the FTE adjustment was a little - was a couple of million dollars higher. So you add those factors together and you get to the $6 million.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","James Mitchell","Can we just talk a little bit about the period-end balance sheet? It really kind of spiked. Is that - should we take that as a sort of transitory because if you look at average balances, they weren't up that much, or is there something that's continuing into 1Q that we should maybe up our assumptions around deposit growth given Fed actions et cetera?","Jason Tyler","Yes, you're right. It was high. I actually looked back to see if this is a record high. It wasn't, but it was close, but more importantly, it did come - it has come back down there. Obviously, as you know, the balance sheet tends to spike at the end of the quarters and particularly the end of the years. This was higher than normal, not a record, but already we've seen more normalization as some of the large clients have put money back to work into the market in different ways.","James Mitchell","And then maybe just a follow-up on the comp line and expenses going forward. Just on the - you had a headcount growth of 5%. So how do you - how do we think about that kind of upward pressure from headcount growth versus your desire to kind of - the scalable digitization, trying to keep core expense growth below organic growth, but we're kind of starting off with much higher employee base. How do we think about the comp line specifically?","Jason Tyler","Well, a couple of things. There may be - you might be looking at Page 7 of the press release and you get the comp line there, and I look at it more on Q4 '18 versus Q4 '19 and you've got a 4% growth rate there. So the first thing from my lens is to say, what was the revenue growth, what was really trust fee growth over that time frame. And it was about 6.25%.","So first of all, on that comp line, even though it's a tiny bit higher than we'd like to see, we did get leverage in that, which is good. And we're - in a year where we've got revenue up, a lot of our expenses are going to bring - a lot of our revenue growth is going to bring with it expense growth and it's going to hit in just about every one of the key expense line items including comp.","The second thing to - for us to think about is that, in general, we've got the technology investment that we're making. And so that - part of the reason that number may be a little higher is that some of the tech investments that we're making in the business are coming through in that comp line.","And third, just so you guys are thinking about it the right way coming into the next year, we're always going to have effectively, call it, $30 million to $40 million base pay adjustments for the comp line. And so you think about that on the base of business that we have here, that's going to lead to almost a point in and of itself in the growth. So those are just a couple of ways different lenses to think about that line item.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on that regarding just technology in general. I know in the past you've given some insight on what your tech budget is. Maybe you could give us a little sense as to how you see that trajecting over time. I know you don't give guidance, but just understand, do you think that trajectory is accelerating, decelerating, and then how you see that shifting over time comp versus non-comp as it relates to tech? Thanks.","Jason Tyler","Yes. So it's obviously, we've got a high sense of urgency as we think about expenses in general and tech is where it is outsized relative to the other areas, and so you're right to horn in on it. A couple of data points as you think about next year.","One is, as I take a step back, we thought about what we wanted to convey that we know about. We don't want to give guidance on expenses, but we do want to tell you what we know at this point. And there are some things that we have high degree of certainty of, as we said, at this point coming into 2020.","So I'm going to deal with those in three buckets, just to put those out. One, I hinted to a couple of minutes ago and that comes down to the compensation line. We know that we're going to see, in general, about - somewhere between $35 million, $40 million just in base pay adjustments based on the business that we have.","Secondly, we talked about pension being a little over $30 million higher, and then third is we have a sense right now of what IT depreciation is going to look like, and that's about $40 million higher for the year in 2020 than it was - than it will be as we look back on 2019.","Now, some of that is reflected in the fourth quarter and so we can - it's hard for us to develop much of it, but we do know that on a year-over [Technical Difficulty] higher. So those are three key items that I think everybody - we want to make sure everybody is aware of, that we've got clear line of sight on at this point.","Now, second, more broadly as we think about how do we depict the IT budget and the IT increase, it is actually hitting in a lot of different line items. So just we were talking about Page 7 on the press release a minute ago, stay there for a second.","And if you look at these different line items, I actually went back and pulled out IT from each of the different components that you can see externally to get a sense of how much they're impacting those growth areas because I do look at, not just comp, which we were talking about a second ago, but all of those line items to try and get a sense of whether we're getting leverage there.","And obviously the biggest - it hits very heavily in equipment and software, which is why you'll see that line item be pretty elevated, but there is also smaller, but still meaningful impacts that will hit in - obviously compensation, employee benefits and outside services.","Betsy Graseck","And is it still around $1 billion that you're thinking the tech budget was in 2019? I recall that was the estimate that was given most recently.","Mark Bette","Yes. Betsy, this is Mark. Yeah, about a - we look at it kind of in a three-year rolling average, so 2019, 2020, 2021; a little bit over $1 billion per year and that includes both operating expense as well as capital investments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just a question on NII. Is there any impact on future net interest income from the sale of the leasing portfolio? And if so, if you can quantify that, and then also if you can talk about what you're seeing for deposit trends into 1Q so far.","Jason Tyler","So on - I just want to write down deposit trends. On the impact of Norlease on NIM, very de minimis increase, nothing to really think about, that pretty clean accounting perspective on how that was hit. And then secondly, on deposit trends coming in more broadly, I know that it's - first of all it's a strategic focus for us across the business in both - on both the Wealth side and on the C&IS side.","And we've talked about, on the Wealth side in particular, we've told you about some strategic initiatives we had there to bring - that brought some money out of the 2a7 funds on to the balance sheet. That's held in pretty well. And then I'd say on the institutional side of the business, it's more volatile and there is no - the initiatives that we have there aren't as aggressive as what we've been thinking about on the Wealth side, but we're still doing everything we can to make sure we're getting a good share of our deposits - of the deposits coming in from clients as the custody book grows and as we're talking to clients across the globe.","Brian Bedell","Just doing an averaging basis, is that - you're expecting growth in 1Q based on those initiatives? I know the end-of-period was elevated, of course, but if we think about average to average.","Jason Tyler","No, I think there was - if you think about the asset side and then the funding side, if you think about NIM, the only other item there of note, there was a little bit, a couple of billion dollars higher on that, but that didn't really come more from the deposit side. It came more from trading related activity. And so there's nothing I'd call out at this point that would lead you to say that deposits would be moderately or significantly different.","Brian Bedell","And then on organic growth, I think you commented on Wealth Management AUM being up mostly from the markets. Just wanted to get a sense, that's been a strong driver of organic growth for you guys for a while. I just wanted to get a sense of the cadence of the organic growth trends in Wealth Management versus the asset servicing business. And as you think about expenses, are we still thinking about a comparable growth rate in expense growth? Even with those headwinds that you've mentioned on the comp pension and the IT side, is that still reasonable to think of the rate of growth that would be similar to the organic growth, if that's still like trending towards the mid-single digits?","Jason Tyler","Let me hit the top side first on the growth side and the trends within the Wealth business. The business is continuing to do well, and Mike touched on it earlier this year and some really nice differentiated approaches that that business has or with the market was goals driven, Wealth Management resonates very well, and the trend there that continues to be seen and come through on the financials and you guys are able to see this actually is that, that we're doing well at the very top end of the market.","So the family office business is growing faster. We can see that the numbers we report on both a sequential basis and a year-over-year basis. That trend has been going on for a while and it's attractive.","And then the second component there is how we'll see the expenses align differently between the business. I am going to separate it in a couple of ways. One is that the tech-related expenses apply a little bit more towards the C&IS side of the business. As we think about things like metrics in our strategic operating model, those things are going to be allocated a little bit more for the C&IS side of the business.","That said, the Wealth side of the business is also investing in different ways. And they are working hard on digitizing the business. Mike talked about that earlier that we're probably a little ahead in our investments there on the C&IS side.","Wealth is starting to think more about how to reflect the digital transformations that we've seen across the marketplace and how we can take our position with things like goals-driven Wealth Management, make it even more accessible to clients, have even better interactions and have better foundational technology.","Brian Bedell","And we're still thinking about organic growth in that sort of mid-single digit area on a go-forward basis level of single digit?","Mike O'Grady","Brian, just to confirm, are you talking about Wealth or the corporation as a whole?","Brian Bedell","The company as a whole.","Mike O'Grady","Yes. So maybe just to address that, Brian, kind of across the businesses, so Jason talked about Wealth Management. We continue to see, as you mentioned, healthy solid growth in that business. That's the nature of it. And again, our strategic imperative in that business is to increase or accelerate that growth even more.","We're still seeing a higher growth rate in our asset servicing business. And so that continues. It's at the lower end of its range, but it continues to grow at a healthy rate. And the strategic imperative for that business is, yes, to continue that growth, but we want to see that growth be more scalable.","And then I would just also add, with our asset management business, we're all well aware of the secular trends in the industry there. And I would say that's certainly impacted our asset management business, although comparatively the business is performing well. And so it's experiencing positive organic growth, just meaning they are able to increase the flows, but also then change the mix in such a way that is offsetting the fee compression that you're seeing across the industry. So it's positive.","Having said that, it is at a lower rate than the other two businesses. So you put that all together, to your point, we've talked about the organic growth rate for our fees at the company level kind of being mid-single digits. That's still the case. We're at the lower end of that right now.","So what does that mean? Well, that's why we're focused on our growth strategies and executing on those, but that's why one of our other key priorities for the company is on continually improving our productivity. And when we are at the lower end of the growth side, we have to work just that much harder on the expense side to get more savings, if you will, on the expense side. So that's the strategy, if you will, and again, focused on trying to execute that so that we can deliver the positive fee operating leverage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Jason, could you expand a little bit more on - underneath the fact that you said that some of the balances might have gone off the balance sheet, can you help us understand either how much you saw as like over-growth in the earning assets this quarter? And then secondarily, if rates stay stable from here, can you talk us through the dynamics of NIM in terms of how much asset repricing has to come through and how much deposit repricing you could still see happen now that we've gone to a more stable level? Thanks.","Jason Tyler","Sure. So on the first, I think it's - as these spikes happen late in the quarter, it's frankly a relatively short period of time that these spikes are on the balance sheet. And so it comes in late and it leaves pretty early. And so - and we're not doing anything fancy when those dollars come in, and so it frankly just doesn't impact the overall NIM very much. It does spike - we're obviously looking through the balance sheet on a daily basis. It spikes it and - but it doesn't - I don't think it really drives NIM that much at the end of the day.","And then as we look out into next quarter, I don't think that spike should necessarily be reflected in your thought process as you think about. So that's more from a volume perspective. As you think about - although I did hint earlier that, kind of that $2 billion increase in the securities portfolio, I do think that's likely to come down.","And that had more to do with, I think more idiosyncratic trading that was happening at the time, nothing abnormal. We just were trading some more longer-dated securities and the security settlement process led to higher securities being on. That's really what led to that little bit of an average increase, and I think that will abate.","As we think about the rates going forward into first quarter, the thing that we can all see that will have maybe more of an impact than what people realize is that fed funds to LIBOR spread. And that did have an impact in fourth quarter. And when we talked to everyone at the conference we attended and then on the last call, we were looking at a spread there that is more probably 13 or 14 basis points, and we thought that was going to go away. It actually held in.","It even expanded a little bit, but now that compression that we anticipated has actually come to fruition. And if you look at that delta right now, it's more on the 9, 10 basis point land, and so that is the factor that, if that holds in, that would have an impact on what we would think about for NIM for next quarter.","Ken Usdin","And then do you have the ability to reprice much on the right side of the balance sheet? You could just talk us about customer dynamics outside of just your market index type of deposits. Like, how is the discussion going with clients and what opportunities do you still have to reduce rate?","Jason Tyler","Yes. It's just so incredibly different between the businesses. And so on the institutional side, first of all, the deposits there are driven a lot more by our EMEA clients. And then in that book, those clients are shopping in real time. And so we're making very tight decisions on those and we can only - we're going to get what the market gives us frankly. And so - and we're not in a position to be a price leader there.","And on the other side of the business, the wealth business, very different dynamics, and there we talk again about the fact that we sunsetted in anchor suit product and we brought assets from the 2a7 funds out of the balance sheet. We're looking much more there and can think about what we want to be strategically in the marketplace.","And to give you some headlines on how we talk about it, we do want to - we want to be very attractive for large depositors. And so that's where we're going to be much more competitive. And for more of the retail client base, we're going to be less competitive and - but at the top end of the market there, we're always trying to figure out how to attract and be extremely aggressive about retaining our top depositors.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","So just wanted to start off with a question on capital. I know that in the past, you've discussed the business need to manage to higher ratios to ensure you don't deviate meaningfully at least from some of your G-SIB peers are running closer to 12% plus, given that you're competing with some of these firms for RFPs. And could you - I was hoping you can maybe just unpack or speak to some of the competitive considerations such as RFPs versus regulatory constraints. It looks like the regulatory changes are swinging in the right way in terms of SLR relief, potential for the elimination of leverage constraints and CCAR. I'm just wondering if some of those changes come through, how that informs your willingness or appetite to manage to a lower target over time.","Mike O'Grady","It's Mike. Why don't I start off? So first of all, as you would expect, we feel very good about our capital levels and our flexibility with regards to capital. As you've highlighted, we are always cognizant and focused on what the implications would be on the business for our capital levels and that can play into formalized RFP processes where, yes, we want to compare favorably to some of our competitors, but also just more broadly, and I'll say even subjectively, with our Wealth Management business, dealing with large family offices, they are looking for safety and security, conservative strong balance sheet. And so it's a part of the business strategy for us.","Having said that, like any resource, it needs to be balanced. And so we're comfortable with where we are. To your point, we're cognizant of where our competitor capital levels are, and to the extent that those move, that gives us more flexibility on that front.","And then the last thing I would add is from a regulatory lens. As you've talked about, there are changes on the regulatory front. Having said that, they've also recently re-categorized banks. We are a Category 2 bank. We happen to be the only Category 2 bank, which we take as a compliment, reflecting the unique nature of our business model.","But it also does mean, once again, we have to work our way through whatever changes that may mean as far as capital management for us. We're not concerned about anything per se, but there just is some uncertainty until they fully roll out the implications of Category 2 on capital management expectations.","Steven Chubak","No, very helpful color. And just one follow-up from me. Just a cleanup question on the other income line. Even when we adjust for the one-timers in the quarter, it looks like that was a source of revenue strength, and I was hoping to gauge the sustainability of some of that strength versus the $50 million core level in 4Q. And just given some of the guidance on BOLI related impacts, how we should think about what could be a reasonable or appropriate run rate for that line in 2020 recognizing there's always mark-to-market and other noise.","Mark Bette","Steven, hi, it's Mark. As you said, if you adjust for the lease, we would have been at closer to the $50 million mark. There was - the BOLI benefit came into that line that will continue to have a little bit of a bump up in the first quarter, like Jason said. I would say that the mark-to-market adjustment on the Visa was favorable this quarter, about a $5 million sequential benefit, which - there was more of a negative drag on that last quarter for some of the adjustments that we made there. This quarter, when you take that into account as well as the BOLI, we did have a little bit higher miscellaneous income and credit and bank related fees, probably higher than normal.","One way that I would say that you can look at that line because it does move around is if you do strip out some of the non-recurring items that we've had in that line, you're probably looking at an average of about $35 million over the last several quarters. And then in theory you could layer BOLI on top of that. That would be one way to look at it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","I just had a follow-up from a few of the questions that have been asked so far, and just wanted to try and frame it in the best way to think about 1Q NII. And Jason, I know - welcome to the circus, our quarterly circus here with your conference call. I know your predecessor had started to help us think about one quarter out NII. I know that was a departure from Northern's normal course of business. I don't know what your plan is going forward, but it does seem like there is a lot of noise. So if you could help us frame how to think about 1Q, you guys sold some of the lease portfolio, so I'm guessing we need to shrink that average earning asset bucket a bit. We've got an over-earning of about $6 million. You've got the tighter fed fund to LIBOR. How should we think about how all this will weigh on NII as we go into 1Q based on what you've seen so far?","Jason Tyler","Well, I think you - Brennan, I think you got all the pieces. The way I think about leading into it, another couple of items. One, you talked about the one-timers, those - it's really $5 million, $6 million.","Secondly, I mentioned the LIBOR-fed fund spread. I think that's a very important one, as you think about how to this out. And then you mentioned BOLI, which, having that in place now for a full quarter, because remember, we didn't have it in place last year. The benefit of that, even if you just assume the same type of economics that we experienced this time, should be a positive $5 million.","And then lastly, we haven't talked about day count. It is going to work against us, if you're thinking about it on a sequential basis. We'll go from 92, not to 90, but to 91 with leap year, and so those are the - in my mind, those are the big four buckets to use as a starting point.","Brennan Hawken","And then when we think about the average balance sheet, it looked like there was a big - a bit of a jump in the other liabilities this quarter and it's at the highest level that it's been in a couple of years by about $1 billion. Should we - is that temporary? Obviously it was enough to skew the average balance for the fourth quarter. So is there something unusual happening that will prove sustainable or should we just expect that to wind down in 1Q?","Jason Tyler","No, I was hinting at earlier that had to do with more of the nature of the securities that were trading that had more time and were in settlement mode for longer. And so that's what I think will drive, bring that - the securities portfolio down to a more normalized level.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. Like TBAs or something?","Jason Tyler","Mortgage - yeah, TBA mortgages, just some - nothing that we don't normally do. Just a little higher mix of those items that led to higher level of security sitting. And obviously we're not getting the yield on those as they're sitting and settle up. The other thing I just mentioned, I think it's - you're right, there is kind of a lot of question about where NIM is going, and we had gotten in a mode of talking about what we expect in effectively providing guidance.","And I'll say at this point, we do think NIM will be down 2% to 4% - NII will be down 2% to 4%. And so it's not to say that every quarter we're going to give that, but I do think - we gave you guys a handful of different items that you had to square off to get a good launch point. And so I think putting it out there this quarter is fair.","Brennan Hawken","And that's off the reported number in 4Q, right? The 107, what we should base that minus 2% to 4%?","Jason Tyler","The - off of the reported net interest income of $430 million.","Brennan Hawken","Sorry. Yes. Thank you.","Jason Tyler","And so that's not indicating - just to be super-fair, it's not indicating the 159 is going to be down 2% to 4%. Just that the 430 million in dollars, we'd expect to be down about 2% to 4% based on the items I walked through.","Brennan Hawken","Got it. NII, not NIM.","Jason Tyler","Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","I don't want to focus too much on one year, but when you look at the - like not hitting the op leverage target, was that more of a function of higher necessary investments that came up during the year or was it lighter organic growth than maybe expected? And since you mentioned some of the expense items heading into 2020 on comp, pension and tech, are there any areas like maybe real estate that you could see some savings, given some of the repositioning that you guys have been working on?","Jason Tyler","Yes. I'll start with the second, which we have mentioned that we expect occupancy to be higher in the short run as we've got some double - double rent payments that we have effectively. So those have been close to it where we're going through a transition of a very large number of sheets from a building we've been in for a long time in Chicago to a new building.","We're starting to move people in this month, a lot of the move is going to take place next month. And so we're right in the midst of that. And so you can imagine we're still obviously paying rent in the old facility and also we've started the new facility. There is a lot of work that goes around, making sure that move is taking place.","And there are other areas around the footprint overall from a real estate perspective that's going to lead to a higher level of rent in the first half of this year. Now, in the second half of the year, we should get some benefit from that. And so that's something that we'll actually see come down. We'll eventually grow into that run rate, but we are expecting to actually see that line items come down second half of the year. Mike, anything you want to add to that?","Mike O'Grady","Yes, just to the first part of your question there about the year, and again, it is a year, but part of the trend there and so what came out of that. One, much broader perspective pulling back from it is if you look at our expense base overall, the - I'm going to comment technology expenses, so this is the expenses for our technology group and the IT depreciation and amortization, represents about 20% of our cost base and that grew at 8%.","If you look at the other 80% of our cost base, it grew at about 2%. And so I would say across that 80%, for the most part, we hit on the costs related to the business, to bringing on new clients, and importantly, hitting on our Value for Spend initiatives and the objectives there. So it's not that we didn't achieve those.","And then you say, well, on the technology side, what happened there, and there if you think about technology or as I think about technology, there's three primary things that we're trying to achieve there. One is security; two is stability, and three is scalability within our technology.","And if you look at the costs that were related to that in the year, there were costs that we had on the safety and stability part, which ended up being higher than we would have expected going into the year, but I think that you absolutely do in order to make sure that you are being able to provide the value proposition, if you will, for your clients.","And then likewise on the scalability, there are certain aspects of that where the greater demand for, I'll call it, just computing power, if you will, on the part of our large asset manager clients on some of the asset owner clients, we're just in an environment where there is greater activity and we didn't achieve the level of, I would say, scalability on our platform that we need to be able to achieve.","So with each of those three, not only are we trying to ensure we have a strong, safe, stable, secure platform, but we want to increase the scalability on that. So a lot of the focus of our technology strategy beyond kind of digitizing the business and providing new capabilities for our clients is also saying, how do we also get greater productivity out of that platform.","Michael Carrier","And just a quick follow-up. Tax rate was a little bit lower. You guys mentioned some of the drivers. Jason, I just - any, like, change in terms of the range that you guys typically expect when we think about going forward?","Jason Tyler","I'll start. This quarter had some impact even from Norlease, some other small items, none of which in and of themselves worth calling out, but I don't think you should expect us to be at the 22% level. And we talked - I think Biff mentioned last time on the call, going to something in the 24. I do think 24% is a better longer term assumption at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.","Robert Wildhack","On the C&IS business, can you give us an update on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape and on the pricing front? And then maybe more broadly, when you think about the conversations you're having with clients, have those discussions changed in tone or content at all recently? And how would you expect them to evolve going forward?","Mike O'Grady","Sure, I'd be glad to talk about it. So there is a tremendous amount of activity in C&IS broadly, and specifically, I would say, asset servicing. And I would say a lot of these changes, well, certainly they create challenges. We're very optimistic about the growth opportunities that are out there.","So if you just give me a minute to run across, I think I can address some of these trends that you're looking for. So if we think about asset owners, even in the parts of the asset owner space that you might think about as being more stable in just their operating models, they have greater needs and greater needs certainly lead to more opportunities for us.","So if you think about the not-for-profit sector, healthcare is an area that continues to grow and presents opportunities for us to manage the assets of large healthcare organizations. Universities, where you have endowments and also the foundation space, they've increased the mix on the investment side to greater use of alternatives.","And as a result, they have greater needs for how they manage those portfolios and those managers. And that's why we've invested in and are rolling out what we call front-office solutions because that gives them the capability to do that.","If you look in Australia, for example, some of the large superannuation funds, not only has that been a great growth opportunity for us over the last decade, but likewise, you're seeing consolidation within the superannuation complex, which again presents changes in the marketplace and opportunities for us.","And the last thing I would say in the asset owner space is, more of the very large sophisticated clients, so if you think about the sovereign wealth funds, are actually in-sourcing some of the asset management as opposed to allocating a lot to asset managers. What that requires is then they need to have the capabilities to operate as asset managers.","So they have greater data needs and the nature and timing of what they need is greater. And so that provides opportunities for us. That drives a lot of the investments that you hear about because it's now putting them in a different position.","And then if I shift to the asset management space, we talk a lot about the pressure of the secular trends and we feel that in our asset management business as well, but it does create opportunities for us on the asset servicing side because it causes these asset managers to look at every aspect of their business, including the operations side. And so that presents opportunities for us where they're looking to outsource more activities.","Now, historically, as you know, that's meant mostly middle-office and what we do in IOO. We are seeing more of those types of opportunities in the marketplace, but there are also some new activities that previously were just largely done in-house by everybody that they are now saying, why should they do those and should it be a part of their outsourcing solutions.","So if you think about the trading side where we have integrated trading solutions, that's really an outsource trading service that we would provide to them that enables them to essentially move something that's not core to them and that we can do it better and more efficiently for them, and there are other opportunities like that.","I would also just continue with the asset managers to the alternative space where, for years, the hedge fund space has presented growth opportunities for us. Our hedge fund services business continues to grow nicely, win large mandates, as you saw this last year.","But then also, for us, in the other parts of the alternative space, so thinking private equity, infrastructure, real estate, those are areas where we've had less of a market share or market position there, but it presents larger growth opportunities for us going forward.","So overall, a high level of activity and that's why when we talk about the growth, we are optimistic about the growth and we just want to make sure that we're able to bring that on in a scalable way so that we get very profitable growth in the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","A couple of questions. Mike, just following up on that last question, so you talk comprehensively about a lot of the volume related opportunities. How about pricing? What are you seeing as you continue to expand into all of these new areas?","Mike O'Grady","Sure. Good point. And there is no doubt clients want more for less, and that cuts across all parts of that sector there. So we look at the fee pressure in the asset servicing business as just ongoing. So we don't necessarily see, I would say, a repricing cycle per se that starts and then ends and then we don't do anything. It's ongoing for us, and that's part of the organic growth equation. So we're always netting out the - not only if we lose a client or they drop of service, but also if there is repricing that happens in order to maintain the client.","Now, the other aspect of that, which is just a dynamic with that business is, because large portions of it are based on the asset levels, the pricing is based on the asset levels. And so as you see greater appreciation in the markets, then that does mean, yes, we get the benefit where the fees go up, but that's then when you see greater fee pressure.","So it's terrific for us that the markets are going up. It does then create more focus on the parts of the client base to look at their fees. And that's why overall what we're trying to do is balance that, but also broaden these relationships, do more for them so that they're still very profitable relationships overall.","Vivek Juneja","And as you're trying to build all of these areas, and as you said, you need the tech capabilities for that, is there room to bend the growth rate of that tech spend a little bit or not quite yet?","Mike O'Grady","We believe that there is. Mark talked earlier about, when we think about our tech spends, you have the expense side of it, which we focus a lot on here, we talk a lot, and Jason has mentioned the increased amortization cost that comes through. Well, the other piece of that is that CapEx piece that Mark mentioned, which is the capitalization of those costs happen now, they manifest themselves in expenses later, and that's an area where, not only we've been focused, but I think there is much more opportunity when you think about how technology has developed these days, to be able to do it in a more cost-efficient way. I think they're all familiar with agile and other methodologies.","Well, we're deploying those, but it's still in the earlier stages. That, in my mind, will produce savings that first hit through more efficient capital spend, and then later over time, it results in lower amortization.","Vivek Juneja","One more if I may on the funding side. Your non-interest bearing deposits did pretty well. They actually turned around and grew again in the fourth quarter. And conversely, your short-term borrowings have been shrinking over the course of 2019. So can you comment on both those? Is - have non-interest bearing deposits basically turned and should be growing or what's your outlook of that and what do you plan to do with short-term borrowings?","Jason Tyler","You want to start, Mark?","Mark Bette","Yes. On the demand deposits, we did see an increase sequentially, Vivek. I don't think that we're calling this an inflection point. We've talked before over the last several quarters, we do have, especially I would say on the institutional side, fluctuations that occur quarter-to-quarter with clients either positioning their assets on or off balance sheet depending on what they might be doing with their own capital investing. So I don't know that we would call out a specific new trend on demand deposits here, starting with what we just saw in the fourth quarter. We'll have to see how that plays out over several quarters.","And on the short-term borrowing side, I would say there that is a - if you look back a year ago, three, four, five quarters ago, I would say that some of the discretionary leveraging that we are doing within the treasury area was running at a higher level. And now, at this point, over the last couple of quarters, we've kind of had that down to a lower level. And that manifests itself both in wholesale deposits on the non-US office line, but also on those short-term borrowings.","So that - it's really just a function of the leveraging opportunity to kind of gross up the balance sheet. The trade there isn't at the tripping point where we would actually go through with that. So we've kind of reduced some of that discretionary leveraging that we do.","Jason Tyler","It's not to say we wouldn't do it again. Just the rate environment today just isn't providing that trade for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Mr. Harte...","Jeffery Harte","Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?","Operator","Yes.","Jeffery Harte","So let's talk about expenses, but kind of with the growth you guys can deliver on the top line, I tend to think a little more of kind of margins. In 2019, ex-items saw kind of our first pre-tax margin compression in what's been a number of years. Looking to 2020 and given that you need to keep investing and the current rate environment and with kind of organic fee growth that's near the bottom end of the kind of range, should we expect a return to margin expansion in 2020 even with those kind of things facing us?","Mike O'Grady","Yes. I'll start. Before we get to pre-tax margin, we're looking at our expenses relative to our fees. And the reason why we do that is just the nature of the expenses and how they are lined up against the different revenue streams. And so there is no question we're focused on positive fee operating leverage. That's because we're saying we want to bring down that ratio first. And on that front, again, it's affected by markets and other things, but that's why we focus on the organic part because we want to be able to drive that down.","Then if you go to the pre-tax margin, yes, some of that flows through, but as you know then, it gets much more impacted by what's happening with the other revenues; to some extent, things like FX and the other income lines, but mostly net interest income.","And we're trying to provide what we see in the marketplace as far as deposits and deposits pricing and things like that in - quarter-by-quarter, but that gives you some indication of, as we know, from not only last year, but every year, it's really hard to project interest rate and that's a big factor that drives in it and it's also tough at times to predict client deposit activity and that drives in it.","So that's just saying, it's not that we aren't focused on positive fee - positive operating leverage as well. It's just there are more factors that frankly are out of our control and it is difficult to forecast, to be able to answer your question of, like, well, then, are your - is your pre-tax margin going to go up or down. We certainly are aiming for it to go up, but there are things that are out of our control.","Jeffery Harte","So when you think of kind of the interest rate environment holding stable and some of that market stuff like FX trading, that really declining, this pre-tax margin kind of expansion should - is potentially attainable.","Mike O'Grady","Yes, it - depending on the environment, you're right, it can make it more difficult or it can give us a tailwind.","Jeffery Harte","And secondly, with the preferred issuance and redemption, can you just review what kind of we should be thinking about the net impact on preferred dividends next year? I know there's some weird stuff in the first quarter, but then even after that, what kind of run rate we should be looking at?","Mark Bette","Jeff, it's Mark. Yeah. So when you look at - if you look back at what our prepared remarks were, the new Series E will have essentially, call it, a five-month dividend in the first quarter, which would be $7.6 million. There is also some costs from Series C that we would also need to recognize upon redeeming it in the first quarter. So that's $11.5 million. And then we have the Series D, which you see, in the first and third quarter of each year.","So if you take all that into consideration, at this point, our expectation is, you're probably looking at a preferred dividend right around $30 million, $30.5 million in the first quarter, and then in the second quarter, you come down to the normal new dividend for Series E, which is $4.7 million. And that would be the new run rate in the quarter where we don't have the Series C. Hopefully that helps. We could talk through it if - offline, if you'd like.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Just a quick question on all these expenses. I mean, you have a normal expense investment that you're doing. Was the three items that you laid out, the pension expense, the base pay adjustment, the IT depreciation included in that growth rate already? Are you saying that you're investing and then you have to still consider these three additional items that are going to be on top of it?","Jason Tyler","Portion of it. So the base pay adjustments are always - that's always factored into how we think about our expectations for expense growth. The pension is obviously anomalous, and that's one that - it's not forecast, and Mike mentioned earlier, we're not ignoring it. We're still - we still want to do everything we can to get leverage in that.","And then the depreciation increase, we've known that we're going to be leaning into more IT spend in the short run at least, and so I'd say, the base pay adjustments fully factored into our long-term assumptions. The pension not, but we're still working hard to try to even cover that. And then the third element of IT depreciation, part of that's already in the run rate.","And so that's the key element there, but the increase itself is one we have to own it. And we've got it - there is a high sense of urgency about making sure we get leverage across each of the key expense items including equipment and software. At some point that's going to be difficult to do in the near term, given we're trying to do it strategically, but certainly the BTA and a portion of the depreciation reflected in our long-term expectations.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then separately, in the asset management, I hear again that the organic growth not kind of where you want it to be. I mean, at what point do you need to do something bigger with regards to restructuring the unit or taking more strategic actions there? Thanks.","Mike O'Grady","I think within the asset management sector that our asset management business is performing very well. We talk about the environment a lot just because it is going through a secular change, but if you just looked at the competitive positioning, if you looked at the growth relative to others and then you look at the profitability, it's performing well. And I would say strategically, we feel very good about how the business is repositioning itself.","And what I mean by that is, we've been strong and had scale in certain areas like liquidity, like index for a long time, and what we've been doing though over the last few years is repositioning towards some of the higher growth, but also more value-added areas, which I talked about. So quant, ESG, things like that. And so - those areas, although they represent a smaller portion of the pie, if you will, they are growing, they are resonating, but like any longer-term strategy, it takes time before you see the impact of that from a financial perspective.","But as far as thinking bigger, if you will, I would say we are - and I just talked about, I'll call it, the product side of that. We're also looking - not looking at, but have been executing on our strategy on the distribution side as well, and it's going well, I would say, on the institutional side. You saw that not only in the fourth quarter, but the second half of the year where that's gone well.","But then you also saw last year that we acquired a business that is very small, but - Emotomy, which is essentially a technology platform, which we are utilizing in the intermediary space. And we think, again, that's the type of capability that will enable us to accelerate the growth rate that we already have within there. So, yes, secular change, but we feel very good about our strategic positioning there.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we have no further questions.

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $381.6 million. Earnings per share were $1.58, and our return on common equity was 16%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter's results included a net $6.8 million tax benefit associated with the true up relating to the Tax Cuts and Job Act, and a change in accounting method for software development-related expense deductions and $8.6 million charge associated with severance-related and restructuring charges.","The quarter also included $23.9 million in fee revenue and $23.7 million in expense related to our acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland, which closed at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the $23.7 million in expense was $4.1 million relating to integration activities. Additionally, the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard resulted in an $8 million increase in both wealth management fees and outside services expense.","Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets were mixed during the quarter. Markets were favorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE indices increasing 11.8 and 2.5 respectively. But on a sequential basis, both indices declined with the S&P 500 down 1.2% and the EAFE down 5.1%.","Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar, and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro ended the quarter up 12% and 16% respectively versus the prior year as compared to the U.S. dollar. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro also strengthened. The strengthening of these currencies compared to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted revenue, but had an unfavorable impact on expenses.","Let's move to page three and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 15% with non-interest income up 17%, and net interest income up 8%. Expenses increased to 11% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million. Net income was 38% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 3% with non-interest income up 5%, and net interest income down 1%. The expenses were down 1% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 7% higher sequentially.","Return on average common equity was at 16% for the quarter, up from 11.6% one year ago, and up from 15.1% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody\/Administration of $10.8 trillion, increased 21% compared to one year ago, and 1% on a sequential basis. Included in assets under custody and administration is $607 billion relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland.","Assets under custody of $8.1 trillion, increased 14% compared to one year ago, and was up slightly on a sequential basis. For the year-over-year comparison, favorable market impacts, new business, and favorable movements in foreign exchange rates were the drivers. For the sequential comparison the favorable moves in currency exchange rates and new business were mostly offset by unfavorable market impacts.","Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 16% year-over-year and up slightly on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business flows, while sequentially a negative market impact was offset by new business flows.","Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 15% from last year, and up 3% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition, revenue was up 13% from last year. The favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates benefited year-over-year revenue growth by approximately 1.5%.","Trust, Investment & Other Servicing Fees represent the largest component of our revenue, and were $938 million in the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year, and up 3% from the prior quarter. Excluding the UBS acquisition fees were up 13% on a year-over-year basis. A change in presentation of certain fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard increased fees by $8 million during the quarter within our wealth management business. There was a corresponding increase of $8 million within the outside services component of expense.","Foreign Exchange Trading Income was $78 million in the first quarter, up 63% year-over-year, and up 25% sequentially. The increases were primarily due to higher volumes and increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury department. Volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was up sequentially, but down from one year ago.","Other non-interest income was $76 million in the first quarter, up 2% compared to one year ago, and up 6% sequentially. This increase from one year ago was primarily driven by higher security commissions and trading income, partially offset by foreign currency adjustments within other operating income. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher transition management and core brokerage revenue.","Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $393 million in the first quarter, increasing 8% year-over-year, and down 1% sequentially. Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our Corporate and Institutional Services business fees totaled $544 million in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, and up 2% on a sequential basis. The quarter included $23.9 million in fees relating to the acquisition of UBS' Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Excluding these fees, C&IS fees were up 12% compared to the prior year.","The favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates benefited year-over-year C&IS fees by approximately 3%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $374 million, up 22% compared to the prior year and up 1% sequentially. This line does include the UBS acquisition-related fees. Excluding these fees, Custody and fund administration fees were up 14% compared to the prior year.","The year-over-year growth was driven by new business, favorable currency translation and market. The sequential increase was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and markets. Assets under custody\/administration for C&IS clients were $10.1 trillion at quarter-end, up 22% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. These results include $607 billion relating to the UBS fund administration acquisition. ","Year-over-year excluding the acquisition, the increases primarily reflects favorable markets, new business and the benefit of movements in foreign exchange rates. Sequentially, the benefit of movements in foreign exchange rates and new business were offset by unfavorable markets. Recall that lag market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $110 billion in the first quarter were up 17% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily due to favorable markets, new business, and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates while sequential comparison was primarily due to favorable markets.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $878 billion, up 19% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business were the drivers of the year-over-year growth while the sequential growth was driven by new business flows partially offset by unfavorable markets. Securities lending fees were $26 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.","On a year-over-year basis, higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. For the sequential comparison, the slight increase was driven by higher volumes. Securities lending collateral was $187 billion at quarter-end and averaged to $182 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 48% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.","The growth in volumes was driven by demand for U.S. treasuries. Other fees in C&IS were $35 million in the first quarter, down 9% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects lower sub-advisor fees. The income associated with sub-advisor fees has an associated lower expense in the outside services category. This decline in sub-advisor fees is consistent with the prior quarter we discontinued a service offering. The sequential increase was primarily attributable to seasonally higher benefit payment fees in the current quarter.","Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $393 million in the first quarter, up 14% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Within wealth management, the global family office business had strong performance with fees increasing 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Both increases were primarily attributable to new business and favorable markets. Each of the regions also performed well during the quarter. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth in the regions were driven by favorable markets, higher fees resulting from the adoption of new revenue recognition standard of $8 million and new business. There is a corresponding increase to outside service expense as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $287 billion at quarter-end, up 10% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially.","Moving to page six; net interest income was $393 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $116 billion in the first quarter, up 6% versus last year. Total deposits averaged $98 billion and were up 3% year-over-year. Interest bearing deposits increased 10% from one year ago to $76 billion. This growth was partially offset by a 14% decline in non-interest bearing deposits, which averaged $22 billion during the first quarter.","Loan balances averaged $32 billion in the first quarter and were down 4% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.38% in the first quarter, and was up three basis points from a year-ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates partially offset by higher premium and amortization due to a change in estimation methodology and the balance sheet mix shift.","On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down $3 million or 1%. Average earning assets increased 2% sequentially funded by increases in interest bearing deposits, short-term borrowings and non-interest bearing deposits. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin decreased one basis point with the benefit of higher short-term interest rates offset by higher premium amortization due to a change in estimation methodology, and a balance sheet mix shift.","Net interest income for the quarter included a $7 million sequential decline due to the accounting for certain tax advantaged investments. This decline was fully offset on the fully taxable equivalent line. Premium amortization totaled $19 million in the first quarter, compared to $1 million one year ago, and zero in the fourth quarter. As we have discussed previously, beginning with this quarter, we are shifting our remaining life assumption estimation methodology for premium amortization, which will lead to a more consistent quarterly amount that we expect to be within the $10 million to $12 million range going forward. In the first quarter, there was a one-time $7 million true up adjustment to align the remaining amortization. This was included in the total amortization amount of $19 million.","Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the first quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposits. This compared to 74% one year ago and 70% during the prior quarter.","Turning to page seven, expenses were $995 million in the first quarter, and were 11% higher than the prior year, and 1% lower sequentially. As previously mentioned, and as outlined in the second page of our earnings release, the current quarter included $23.7 million in expense associated with the UBS acquisition. The current quarter also included $8.6 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. In the prior quarter, we had $30.5 million of severance and other charges, as well as a special one-time employee cash bonus paid in connection with the adoption of U.S. Tax Reform. Excluding both the UBS acquisition and called out expense items, expense for the quarter was 8% higher than a year ago. Excluding charges in both the current and prior quarters, expense was 2% higher sequentially.","Now keeping to total non-interest expense, I would like to break down those growth rates further. Starting with the adjusted 8% year-over-year increase, approximately two points of growth was from the unfavorable translation impact of changes in currency rates, primarily the British pound and euro. Excluding currency impact, therefore our year-over-year expense growth rate was approximately 6%. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard added expense of $8 million, but was partially offset by lower sub-advisor costs due to the discontinuance of a product line. Both of these items were within outside services, and had corresponding fee revenue impacts. Combined these two items drove just under one-half of a point in expense growth, bringing our core expense growth rate to approximately 5.5%.","With respect to the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, the following items are key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher driven by increased incentive compensation and base pay adjustments from April of last year. The impact of staff growth on salaries was offset by staff actions and location strategy efforts. Benefits were higher primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses, medical costs, and higher payroll tax withholding compared to the prior year. Outside service costs were higher driven primarily by higher sub-custodian and technical services including market data costs. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year due to higher software amortization and equipment depreciation. Occupancy-related costs were higher compared to the prior year, primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to a previously-announced facility exit in one of our Chicago locations.","Shifting to the sequential expense view, excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses increased 2% from the prior quarter. Compensation expense increased primarily reflecting higher expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive compensation due to divesting provisions associated with the grants to retirement eligible employees in the current quarter. This quarter's compensation included 32 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff.","As a reminder, similar to last year, there were also be approximately $11 million in expense associated with the retirement eligible employees in the second quarter. Additionally, next quarter's compensation will also be impacted by base pay adjustments of approximately $8 million, which were effective on April 1. Outside services costs were down sequentially, primarily relating to lower consulting, legal, and technical services expense, partially offset by higher third-party advisor costs resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. There is a corresponding increase to trust investment and other servicing fees as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, as I mentioned earlier.","Equipment and software expenses were higher sequentially primarily due to increased software amortization and software support cost. Elsewhere, other operating expense declined from the prior period primarily due to a lower business promotional spend, staff-related costs, and lower miscellaneous expenses within the category.","Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The growth year-over-year includes the addition of approximately 240 partners as a result of the UBS acquisition; the remainder of the growth was all attributable staff increases and lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland, and Tempe, Arizona partially offset by reductions in our higher cost locations.","Turning to page eight, as we have discussed on previous calls through our value per spend initiative, we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. Concurrently, we are embedding a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be being more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our first quarter results reflect approximately $14 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth by approximately 1.5 points. This would equate to approximately 55 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal.","I would like to highlight a few examples of our progress to date for you. We have focused on eliminating redundancy by strategically realigning employees and leveraging our location strategy. We continue to drive improvement and vendor pricing across multiple areas, and remain focused on reducing our consulting spend. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities that we expect to discuss in future quarters.","Turning to page nine, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability in returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expenses to fee ratio, pre-tax margin, and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as of 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today as a key contributor for the improvement in our pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity.","Turning to page 10, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.1% under the advanced approach, and 12.4% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.7% and at the bank was 6.1%; both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which became applicable to Northern Trust effective at the start of this year.","With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective at the start of 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock at a cost of $263 million.","In closing, Northern Trust delivered strong financial results in the quarter, growing earnings per share by 45% over the prior year. Our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up 21% and 16% respectively versus the prior year. Our return on average common equity, up 16%, expense to trust investment and other servicing fees of 106 were our best performance since the financial crisis. As we seek to drive profitable growth we were pleased to deliver strong positive operating leverage of 3.6 points and positive fee operating leverage of 4.7 points. On an organic basis our fee and expense growth rates were better aligned.","While growth across our segments were strong, so too was the profitability of each business. Our wealth management business grew pretax income by 24% versus the prior year while improving the pretax margin from 37% to 41% and driving the expense-to-fee ratio down to 93%. Our C&IS business similarly drove strong year-over-year performance with pretax income growing 42% versus the prior year, and the pretax margin improving from 29% to 34%, and driving the expense-to-fee ratio down to 108. We are confident in our competitive positioning within growth markets and our ability to continue profitably growing our business.","Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call a bit earlier than in other quarters to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10:30 A.M. Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions.","Paula, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks, good morning folks.","Mark Bette","Hi, Brian.","Brian Bedell","Hi, good morning. Maybe just to start off with FX trading, obviously another strong result, can you talk about the portion that you think is due from the FX swap activity in the treasury business, and it looks like even adjusting for currency volatility, we\u2019re -- in the last two quarters, now we're seeing a big step up in that run rate, so just like to sort of think about that going forward.","Biff Bowman","Yes, thanks, Brian. So we had really solid growth both sequentially and year-over-year in foreign exchange, as you highlighted. And that was really driven by two key factors. The first was that in our core trading, if you will, our core trading business volumes were higher, and we did see some higher volatility. And so that produced approximately $63 million to $64 million of the FX volume you see, which is above our traditional run rate there. The remainder, approximately $15 million, is from the treasury swap activity that we called out. And if I could I'd like to give a little bit of an explanation on that. As a part of our normal balance sheet management we manage our currency and put it in the most effective currency. We have been able to, because of a demand for dollars from certain institutions, take dollars from our Fed balances, swap them into sterling and euro and place them with the ECB or the Bank of England.","So when we've done that the resulting benefit from the currency swap flows through the FX line. As you would understand, we gave up some net interest income to get that. So the $15 million improvement you have seen in the FX line that's attributable to treasury trades was there was about $10 million of net interest income give-up to do that, but that's still a good economic trade for our shareholders if you think about that. And right now that's because of the widening we've seen in that swap trade because of the demand for dollars. So it's hard to project where that trade and that spread will go, but we've taken the right currency decisions and the right balance sheet decisions in the first quarter of this year, and even a bit of the tail end of 2017.","So about $63 million to $64 million was core FX and $15 million was driven by the treasury swaps. You'll be able to see that in the 10-Q as well that shows up under the treasury trading line in the segment reporting.","Brian Bedell","Great, and that's fantastic color, thank you. And then maybe just to follow up on expenses. Obviously, a very good expenses controlled quarter. And you've achieved a little over 25% of the 250 programs so far on a run rate basis. So could you just talk about the trend going into 2Q and into the rest of this year, if 1Q was a sort of a high achievement for the year or do you see this continuing into the year? And then I think that you did mention something about -- talking about reinvestment in other growth initiatives on some of that, if you can detail that as well.","Biff Bowman","Let me talk on the expense side around it. So our core expense growth rate that we highlighted for you, at about 5.5%, we think that's what our core actually was in the quarter. If I look at any individual lines there I would call out perhaps in the other operating expense line, there can be some seasonality, some lower seasonality in that because our business promotion tends to be a little lower in the first quarter, and staff-related expenses which generally are attributed to ex-pat hypothetical tax or hypo tax can also have some episodic nature in the first quarter and be a little bit lower. But the trend along the other expense lines is generally, as you would've seen, historically unfold, that\u2019s the only line item I would say is lower than maybe a traditional run rate.","I think it's probably better to look at other operating expense over a year -- over a calendar year because we'll have the Northern Trust open in the third quarter and others. I'd look at that expense line over a year, and it could have a little seasonality. The other line items, obviously there's equity compensation in the first quarter that is traditionally larger than it would be in subsequent quarters. So you, I'm sure, can adjust for that in your models as you go forward. And I'm not sure where we talked about investments. I'm not sure where we said that, but we continue to reinvest in our business where the opportunity is there, but we continue to execute on value for spend as you saw the highlights in this quarter. That execution needs to continue throughout the year and that helps provide for that investment opportunities in the company.","Operator","And moving on, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Alex.","Alex Blostein","Hi, guys. Good morning, and thanks. So first question is around the NIR and some of the funding dynamics we saw from you guys in the quarter. I guess two questions there. First on the balance sheet side itself, so continued nice growth in average earning assets up 2-ish percent I think quarter-over-quarter. How much of that is due to new customer business versus some of the discretionary leveraging you've done in the past?","Biff Bowman","Yes, it's a bit of both. So we have continued to see the strong new business, but there was also some increased discretionary leverage.","Mark Bette","So, yes, Alex, the discretionary leveraging was actually down about $1 billion sequentially, on a year-over-year basis though it was about $3 billion last year and closer to $7 billion this year.","Alex Blostein","Got you. And then I guess on the -- yes, go ahead.","Biff Bowman","I'll just say it's a bit of both.","Alex Blostein","Yes, got you. And then I guess on the, more importantly, on the funding side. So if we look at the deposit betas and just the level of non-interest bearing deposits, so maybe we can unpack both of those. But I guess on the deposit beta side, looks like costs are up only three-ish basis points sequentially, which again is kind of nice to see given the fact that rates continue to move higher. So maybe help us unpack what's going on there.","And then on the non-interest bearing deposit side again went up nicely. The balance went up nicely sequentially for the first time in a while, so maybe speak to kind of what drove that, how sustainable do you think that is, and do you guys think there might actually be an opportunity to reduce some of the short-term borrowings you had to put into place given the fact that the deposits seem to be holding up better. I know there's a bunch of stuff in there, but all kind of funded [ph] related.","Biff Bowman","Yes, let me start on the -- yes, we'll go to the liabilities, so -- but on the betas. I think it's probably easier to look at the betas over a longer period than any one quarter because, Alex, we can have period where it seems like our betas lower than you may think but we may have been ahead of the market in some periods. And there's other periods where maybe there's catch-up in any one given period, but if you look over time it's probably a better measure. The second part of that, I would say, is we really do follow the markets both for our retail deposits and for our institutional deposits. And particularly on the institutional side it's a competitive marketplace. We've got rate environment to look and see what our competitors are doing, and we try to match that in the marketplace or move with that in the marketplace and keep track of it.","On the retail side or on the wealth management deposit side we have seen some increased competition in that marketplace or some increased rate from some of the peer competitors that we would have in the wealth space. And we've got a process, a disciplined process to look at our rate environment and pass those betas on. So, so far, the betas are what you see in there, and we'll probably continue to move in lockstep with where you anticipate markets going.","In terms of the non-interest bearing deposits you're right. They had a slight increase in the quarter, a modest increase. I would be hesitant to tell you that I think that is the new flat level. We saw some monies come in that could be rate sensitive in the quarter. But that's three quarters in a row that it's been around the $21 billion to $22 billion level. We track that very closely, particularly the piece of that which is about a quarter of that or $5 billion to $6 billion of that, that we would deem to be the most rate sensitive. The remainder of that is wealth deposits and other things that are traditionally supporting what I would say core operating businesses. But we continue to have regular dialogues with that sort of $5 billion to see the sustainability of that and the long-term rate sensitivity of that. So far it's held up for three quarters.","Operator","And moving on, we'll go to Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to circle back to, I believe you highlighted in your commentary, Biff, about a balance sheet mix shift on the NIM front. And I know that you had talked a little bit about the FX swap. Was that what you were referring to? Was there something else? Could you maybe provide a little bit of additional clarity on what was behind that, and what was behind that comment?","Biff Bowman","Sure. That is one piece of it. And as you've also seen the loan portfolio as a portion of the balance sheet has gone down over time as our loan growth has flattened out or even gone slightly negative. So if you look at those two items. Plus, there's also some currency mix shift, some of that was caused by the swap as we moved out of dollars into other currencies. But the combination of those two essentially was the mix shift that I was talking about in the earlier question.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, got it. And then thinking about loan book and the proportion, can you remind us and maybe update us in so far as how things have changed. How much of that book re-prices in the beginning of the year. How show we think about re-pricing of the loan book as rates continue to -- or assuming rates continue to rise as they are, as the forward curve would suggest, and the potential for that to work its way through, just in thinking about sort of the blocking and tackling of bottling that book for you guys? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","Yes, so in terms of the seasonality component you asked first, it's really very modest. I think you're probably better off not thinking about it being that seasonal based on the current loan portfolio as our portfolio has changed over time. I think probably your better indicator is to look at where the loan yields moved sequentially between December and March of this year. And you saw pretty meaningful pickup from the spreads. As you might imagine, our funding for those loans is shorter in nature, kind of overnight to one month kind of LIBOR. And the asset spread has been able to move a little bit faster with some of the widening you've seen based on our funding levels. So I think we -- I would focus more on what you saw sequentially here and think about that as a better indicator of the yield pickups across those loan instruments.","The other thing I would say to remember is we have a portfolio where the residential real estate has been in decline now for some time. And it's being replaced by what I would say, or we would call, investment management account secured loans, secured by your portfolio. Those tend to have lower yields. They also have lower credit risks associated with them. So that part needs to be factored into as you think about pricing.","Operator","And next from Autonomous Research we'll go to Jeffrey Elliott.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Jeffery.","Jeffrey Elliott","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Thank you for giving that 5.5% figure for core expense growth. Can you help us think about organic revenue growth, clearly an important target for you to run with that in line with or above expense growth, but what do you think that is right now?","Biff Bowman","Yes, in the quarter, we would say it was approximately 5%. And in relations to that 5.5% core that I gave you, remember in that 5.5% core there are some inflationary or inorganic factors, right, our sub custody fees are tied to -- our expenses are tied to market levels. And there are other factors in those expense bases that are -- so we would say our organic expense growth rate is probably a little lower than the 5.5% that I quoted you. But the 5.5% is a good core sort of expense growth rate from our view. And then whatever you want to adjust out of that from your own organic or inorganic. And then on the organic revenue side or fee side -- on the organic fee side, let me be clear, we would say was about 5% in the quarter.","Jeffrey Elliott","Thanks very much. And then on the target ROCC range of 10 to 15, clearly this quarter you came ahead of the top end of that range. I mean, how do you think about that in an environment where the tax rate is lower? Is it time to think about moving the 10 to 15 up?","Biff Bowman","Yes, I think the change that's happened with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act has caused us to look at target range. And we will go through that process and look at that. We also want to see that unfold for a bit though, right. We're one quarter in. We want to see how the markets react. It is one quarter, as you saw in this quarter. The benefit of that tax cut flowed largely through to our shareholders in this quarter. But I think we'd like to observe the behavior of the competitive landscape for some time. But we are taking all of those factors into play. I do believe this is the kind of secular change, much like when we all had to add capital coming out of the crisis when we revisited our ROE target. This is the type of secular change that causes that revisitation. But we'd like to have some observation of the marketplace to help inform that process.","Operator","And next we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey, Biff, how are you doing? Biff, on the capital front you've mentioned the willingness to leverage the balance sheet a little bit more. And then also, given that we've got this notice of proposed rule-making and that you're not a GSIB, can you talk about just how you think that might change your view of what's binding and how much excess capital you truly have to hold versus minimums and versus peers? Does it give you any flexibility upon first glance?","Biff Bowman","If I look at the NPR, is it related to, first was the CCAR when that came out, I would say that was largely as we expected. And it basically, I think, is what Governor Tarullo had largely highlighted before. And I would say from our standpoint we're supportive of it. It does increase our flexibility as we think about it around our capital planning. But I don't know that it has a material financial impact to us at all in terms of how we run our business, because we've been operating under the capital rules for a while.","In terms of flexibility as I think about leverage and some of the commentary that's come out from the supplementary leverage ratio, we're not bound by that. And that was really something that I think was more impactful to the GSIBs than it was for us. So if they change tier 1 leverage that is currently our binding constraint. So you ask about our capital levels, we would be bound by tier 1 leverage, although not terrible bound by that as you can see from our capital levels.","And lastly, Ken, I would end by -- we've just submitted our capital plan, we await the feedback that we will get in June, but we entered that from a position of strength and as we think about the uses of our capital, we can either deploy it on the balance sheet and put it to work or we can return it. We've made an ask to our regulator and we will see how that is opined on.","Ken Usdin","Understood. And to that last point, Biff, can you just help us understand how you think about those two factors, the decision tree to use a little bit more leverage and get some NII versus the decision tree to put it into an extra ask if you had extra flexibility.","Biff Bowman","Yes, sure. So the first thing we look at is if we're contemplating return, if you think about that we've got a dividend range that we've been comfortable, if you look historically, we talk about in our dividend returns and it's been somewhere in the 30% to 40% dividend payout ratio over time.","Then we think about the rest of that return in the form of buyback. When we think about it in the form of buyback, we first look at -- to make sure we offset dilution. As you saw in this quarter, we did a little bit of larger amount of buyback particularly because we've had shareholder dilution that we wanted to offset, but then the second part I think that gets to your question is we look at the return to shareholders. And so if there are internal uses or external uses for that capital to drive a higher shareholder return than a buyback, that's something we contemplate as management do. If we think the buying of shares back is the maximum return, we do that.","If we think not buying the shares back and using it as a leverage on the balance sheet is the maximum return, we do that and we weigh all three of those and end up choosing the one that we think is the best return path for our shareholders.","Operator","And moving on we'll go to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Glenn Schorr","The all-in yield on the securities book came down and governments moving up and everything else moving down, it's a little counterintuitive as people think of high rates and also how much of your business is growing. So maybe we can just get an update on pictures floating in the securities book, what does it float off of, and just if we should expect it to move up from here?","Biff Bowman","Yes, so let me walk you through the securities portfolio, because it is an intuitive that it would've gone down, but it'll be, I hope, more intuitive when we walk you through that. First of all, in the securities portfolio, about 16 basis points was premium amortization. So that in itself would've started to move the securities yield to where you wanted. We also had about 5 basis points of drag from FTE, which is offset in the FTE line. But we had about five basis points of drag from that. And then we had about five basis points of drag from the mix shift that I talked about earlier. That was really then offset by about 20 basis points for rates and offset by day count, because obviously we had fewer days, so that improved the securities yield.","I hope that's better color, because if you add all of that together, that securities yield very much moved the way you would've thought. In fact, it would've been one of the biggest moves we've seen in the securities yield sequentially. It just was masked somewhat particularly by the premium amortization in the quarter. So I think that's a pretty good walk.","Mark Bette","And Glenn, as far as the mix, we would still look at it -- if you look at the portfolio, roughly, half and half the shorter portfolio versus the longer and the shorter would move with both one-month and three-month, with one-month a little bit more weighted than the three-month and then for the longer portfolio, you're looking at two, three, five-year type of maturities overall kind of weighted slightly above one year for the whole portfolio. So hopefully that helps.","Operator","And moving on we'll go to Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Maybe just one follow-up on the asset yields and then the overall NIM, if I put everything together and just think of a starting point for Q2, is it really just the premium amortization change and I think you mentioned it might've been 7 million yield increase in the first quarter. So should we normalize for that or are there other components you mean that we should be normalizing and thinking about it like a starting point for this second quarter?","Mark Bette","Yes, I would say if you think about the NIM sequentially from fourth quarter to the first quarter, the things that impacted it, that you could factor in as the NIM benefited by day count. So there could be some drag, if you will, because the day count will be higher in the second quarter, but that was about 1 basis point.","Premium amortization was about seven points of NIM drag in the quarter and then you can subtract what you think is a normalized impact. That's the total impact, but I'll let you do that and then there was some from the FTE adjustment, about two bips of drag and then there was about 5 basis points of that currency and mix shift that I talked about on the balance sheet. But rates themselves probably would've added about 12 bips. If you do all of that math and you go back, I think you can get to probably a NIM that's a better launch point mark. I don't know if you got anything to do with that.","Biff Bowman","No, I don't think so. But in reiterating the point that Biff made about the FX trading line, which we had 15 million of benefit there from our treasury swap activity that actually -- if that had not occurred, we estimate we would've had about 10 million more of NIM or net interest income in the quarter, so that was part of that mix change that this highlighted sequentially.","Operator","And moving on, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me?","Biff Bowman","Yes. Hello.","Vivek Juneja","A couple of quick questions, the $250 million cost cuts, Biff, can you give a little more color on it, what are we going to be getting this from, timing, when should we start to -- we were expecting you'll start to give more granularity around this, so\u2026","Biff Bowman","Yes, so as we said in our prepared remarks, in-quarter we had $14 million of savings, which on a run rate basis would be approximately 55. The categories that those savings would've come from were in some cases what we would call \"Organizational alignment,\" that's things like aligning our staff to the right locations, aligning our staff from eliminating redundancy, et cetera. So those programs are under way and they're producing the savings we see. But we also have savings in areas like procurement where we negotiated different contract arrangement with a variety of vendors that also provided some of that $14 million in savings in-quarter.","And then we are continuing to get what I would call, \"Process optimization opportunities,\" where we are utilizing robotics and other artificial intelligence opportunities on things like document ingestion et cetera. All of those are starting to contribute to that, and we have a portfolio of opportunities that on a regular basis we will update you with how they help drive those savings. As we said consistently, we anticipate that that savings will be roughly evenly distributed across the 3 years, and as you can see we're off to a pretty good start with $55 million in the first quarter this year.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, so when you're saying evenly distributed over three years, let me just clarify, the 250 -- let's say, I'm going to round the number $80-ish million, we should see this year, so it's 14. It's not taking the 55 annualized it's actually 14 plus whatever you get additional in the next quarter and the following three quarters and all of that adding up to 80 or are you talking about some kind of annualized run rate?","Mark Bette","Vivek, this is Mark. I think the way you're thinking about it would probably be the right way where you would add up the quarters and the impacts. Again, it's still early in this, it's not going to be a smooth straight line and to the extent that we get more visibility around that as we go, we'll update you, but we do think at this point we're looking at -- the way you outlined it for now is the best way to think about it.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, because what I'm trying to understand is how much more incremental this year, given that you are already at annualized 55?","Mark Bette","Right.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Secondly, what's your -- go ahead.","Mark Bette","Yes, I mean we have planned so far in year saving, so yes, but\u2026","Vivek Juneja","No, no. My point is that the 14 or 15 whatever you want to use it, the annualized is 55 already. So if you were to let say so you have got 25 left, if you were to achieve a little more in the second quarter, you could be done. So is it really just 1\/3rd each year, or is that not much this year and therefore the rest there is some -- I am trying to understand is there like a something going on that pushes some of the savings to year two? Or, the interpretation should be more that even if you just simply add $5 million or so per quarter incremental, you could actually be a -- we may be running little bit ahead of the 1\/3rd?","Biff Bowman","Vivek, I think we have got a portfolio that will unfold over quarters and over years. And we are going to continue to execute on it. I don't think you should interpret that we are largely done for the year because we are at 55. I think you should anticipate that we will give you updates. And we are continuing to progress on our portfolio of opportunities.","Operator","And moving on, we will go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi, just following up on the last question. So, your pre-tax margin of 33% is the highest in several years. Do you expect the pre-tax margin to stay at that level? Or, is there more investment spending that we should expect going forward?","Biff Bowman","We are going to continue to try to drive the profitability in the firm in all of the key metrics. If we continue we think to drive that expense to fee ratio even harder that we think we can improve that pre-tax margin over time. But -- and we think our current plans we have -- we can both execute on value per spend and have investment opportunities inside of our business. So, we do think there is still some opportunities to improve both. We moved meaningfully this quarter as you saw in that expense to fees, but we do think there is opportunities. As you saw in our wealth business actually improved its margin meaningfully in the quarter as did our C&IS business. So, yes, we do. We think there is opportunities.","Mike Mayo","And is the expense to fee ratio is still the right measure has opposed to expenses to total revenues? I mean you get paid in compensating balances and a period of higher rates. I mean at some point do you want to look at that more holistically? And then one of your competitors recently said let's look at performance excluding the market impact. Just questioning whether you are exploring some alternative ratios to evaluate your performance?","Biff Bowman","Yes. Good question. So, I would say there's not one absolute perfect ratio. But given that fees are our largest revenue line, we've kind of anchored to the expense to fees as an important ratio. We absolutely though care about operating leverage to your point as well because obviously we saw the power of net interest income and foreign exchange flowing through the revenues. And we are not dismissive of that.","So we do look at operating leverage. But we look at core fee operating leverage because FX and to some degree net interest income can have a bit more volatility to those earnings stream. In terms of the second part of the question around the organic, we've been talking for several years now about how important we think the organic growth rate is in the firm. And so, we do internally look to at what type of leverage we are getting organically. So how are we growing our fees versus our expenses on a more organic basis, we have not published anything about that externally. But I would say that is absolutely internally one of our key drivers and metrics. It's something that I can tell you that management team and our board look at not only our absolute financial performance, but they look at the organic performance on a regular basis. And that's the way we report it to them so they can understand what management drove versus what the macro environment drove. And under consideration, they both are impactful to our business.","Operator","And our final question will come from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Hi, Biff, thanks for taking the question. I want to drill in on this premium amortization and think of a more as you roll forward because when rates are low, you have to buy securities that have premiums and not just because rates are rolling lower. So, it kind of just creates that phenomenon.","Now, rates are going higher so those securities you can buy really won't have that kind of premium. So, as you are thinking of this rolling off, you have such a short duration, this premium amortization while a new setup in a negative to net interest income has a finite life and should be kind of replaced with bonds that don't have as much premium on them. So, you could think of this in a year all of sudden this $19 million that goes to 12 goes to 0 in a reasonable period of time. So, just want to see what you thought about that?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, as we said it was 19 in the quarter because to the tru-up it was we think we 10 to 12 going forward. To your point, it depends on where we are buying those instruments. If your premise which is right quantitatively if that continues, then we could potentially be buying in that lower premiums which could move that 10 to 12 and will give you updates if we think it moves off of that.","I would also say though another factor, Marty, is if we change the total amount of those securities that we hold on our portfolio, so even though it may be a lower amortized amount, it's on a bigger balance that could indeed create that still $10 million to $12 million range. We will give updates. But, right now our best thinking on that based on the current environment is in that $10 million to $12 million range for premium amortization.","Marty Mosby","And the securities that you are buying now, do they still have like you said the securities get bigger but they will have significant less premium than what you bought over the last couple of years I would think.","Biff Bowman","I don't know that for certain that would make intuitive sense to me, but we would have to confirm that you after the point because I don't -- it makes sense from where you describe it from the rate environment. That makes sense. Mathematically, I don't know if the team is buying portfolio -- if the team is buying instruments that have some different kind of premium amortization profile than what markets would suggest. I would guess not. My guess is your premise would be right.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session as well as our conference.

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to the Northern Trust's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning, we reported second quarter net income of $261 million. Earnings per share were $1.09, and our return on common equity was 12.2%. As outlined in our press release, our results for the second quarter included five items, which I would like to highlight for you today.","First, we reported a pre-tax gain of $118.2 million on the sale of $1.1 million Class B Visa shares net of swap expense. This gain is reflected on our income statement in the other operating income line. The sale reduces our ownership position in Visa Class B shares to 4.13 million shares as of the end of the second quarter. At the current conversion rate, that is the equivalent two 6.81 million Class A shares of Visa. These shares are recorded on our balance sheet at their original cost basis of zero. The $118.2 million net gain included $5 million in costs relating to the mark-to-market of the swap on last year's sale of 1 million Class B shares.","Second, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement subject to court approval to certain longstanding securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line of our income statement. The charge covers settlements and cases related to client losses from the 2008 financial crisis. With this agreement, we are pleased to have resolved the most significant litigation against Northern Trust related to the financial crisis.","Third, we recognized $21.6 million in losses associated with our loan and lease portfolio. This included $14.1 million in impairment charges and the loss on sale related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, as well as a $7.5 million impairment charge related to the residual value of certain aircraft and railcars. Of these $21.6 million in losses, $18.9 million is reflected on the other operating income line, while the remaining $2.7 million reflected within net interest income.","Fourth, we recorded an $18.6 million charge relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients. The impact of this charge is reflected on the other operating expense line on our income statement.","Lastly, we recorded $17.5 million in expense related to severance and personnel-related charges. I will discuss both of these last two items in further detail later in the call when we review our expenses for the quarter.","Excluding these five items, second quarter net income was $253 million, earnings per share were $1.06, and our return on common equity was 11.7%. Recall that our results in the second quarter of 2015 included a pre-tax gain of $99.9 million relating to the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares, voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar, net asset value funds of $45.8 million, and the impairment of the residual value of certain aircraft lease agreements of $17.8 million.","A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the second quarter. Equity markets have been mixed during 2016. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 1.7% year-over-year and up 1.9% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was down 12.7% year-over-year and down 2.6% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and first quarter markets were generally lower. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was higher for both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons.","Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 10.5% higher than the second quarter of last year and 5% higher sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were down in the second quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 9% to 13% year-over-year and down 9% to 12% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income.","Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Dollar strength, particularly in the year-over-year comparison, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, while benefiting expense growth.","U.S. short-term interest rates were higher compared to last year following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December but flat sequentially. Three-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged to 64 basis points and 37 basis points, respectively. The overnight repo rate was also higher compared to last year, but flat sequentially averaging 45 basis points in the quarter.","Let's move to page three and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. My comments are on the adjusted basis which excludes the prior year and current quarter items I mentioned in my opening comments. Year-over-year, revenue increased 4% with non-interest income up 1% and net interest income up 12%. Expenses also increased 4%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $3 million reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Net income was 2% higher year-over-year.","In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 3%, while non-interest income was up 4% and net interest income down 2%. Expenses increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 5% higher sequentially.","Return on average common equity was at 11.7% for the quarter, down slightly from one year ago but up from 11.4% in the prior quarter. Client assets under custody of $6.4 trillion increased 3% compared to one year ago and 2% on a sequential basis. In both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar.","Assets under management were $906 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets. In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of one passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned during our third quarter call. Assets under management increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by higher fixed income and equity balances partially offset by lower cash balances.","Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.3 billion. Adjusted for the items I mentioned in my opening, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, up 4% from last year and up 3% sequentially.","Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $777 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were essentially zero in the second quarter compared to $28 million one year ago and $8 million in the first quarter. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was $64 million in the second quarter, down 14% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline while the sequential improvement mainly reflects higher volatility.","Other non-interest income was $76 million in the second quarter, up 4% from last year and up 4% sequentially. The current quarter's results include $2.6 million in revenue associated with the Aviate acquisition, which closed on May 1. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by other operating income, partially offset by a net investment security loss of $2 million in the current quarter due to an other than temporary impairment of certain Community Reinvestment Act eligible securities. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher securities commission and trading income primarily due to the Aviate acquisition, and higher other operating income partially offset by the investment security loss.","Please note that as referred to in our call last quarter, the first quarter results included a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. The primary driver of the remaining sequential increase in other operating income was higher income associated with the supplemental compensation plans that have an associated expense within other operating expense.","Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $309 million in the second quarter, increasing 12% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $447 million in the second quarter, up 3% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Custody & Fund Administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $293 million, unchanged from one year ago and up 2% sequentially.","Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.8 trillion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Recall that lag market values factor into the quarter's fees, with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS, Custody & Fund Administration fees. Unfavorable currency translation impacted the year-over-year comparison.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the second quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were essentially zero during the second quarter, lower by $14 million year-over-year and $2 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds.","Beyond fee waivers, the favorable impact of new business was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $672 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier and flat sequentially.","Securities lending fees were $27 million in the second quarter, flat with the prior year and 18% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. The sequential performance primarily reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads. Securities lending collateral was $108 billion at the quarter end and averaged $117 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 7% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially. The decline in loan volumes compared to the prior year was across most asset classes. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business.","Other fees in C&IS were $33 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were down 8%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.","Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $330 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the global family office business had strong performance, with fees increasing 14% year-over-year and 6% sequentially due to lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business.","Performance in the regions was lower on a year-over-year basis as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lag markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. On a sequential basis, fees within the regions benefited from lower money market fee waivers and favorable lag markets.","Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management were essentially zero in the current quarter, down $14 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $234 billion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially.","Moving to page six, net interest income was $307 million in the second quarter, up 19% year-over-year, and down 2% compared to the first quarter. $2.7 million of the $7.5 million impairment on certain aircraft and railcars from my opening comments was included in this quarter's net interest income. Also, recall that the prior year's results included $17.8 million lease impairment. Excluding these two items, net interest income was up 12% compared to one year ago, driven by a higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin.","Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the second quarter, up 3% versus last year, driven by a higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $27 billion, increased 5% year-over-year, and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $50 billion, were up 2% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balances averaged $34 billion in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year.","On a sequential quarter basis, excluding the previously mentioned $2.7 million impairment, net interest income declined 2%, primarily driven by a lower net interest margin as average earning assets were up 2% sequentially. When adjusted for the impairment, net interest margin was 1.17% in the second quarter, up 11 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points sequentially.","The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed's move in December. In the sequential quarter comparison, the lower margin was driven by higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $20 million in the second quarter, up from $6 million in the first quarter.","Turning to page seven, expenses were $925 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded three expense-related charges in the quarter. First, as described in my opening remarks, we recorded a $46.5 million charge in connection with an agreement to settle certain securities lending litigation. This charge is reflected within the other operating expense line.","Second, an $18.6 million charge related to contractual modifications associated with the existing C&IS asset servicing clients. These were previously incurred implementation costs that were being deferred over the life of the client contracts. As a result of the contractual modifications, these costs are no longer considered recoverable and had been brought forward into the current period. The expense associated with this charge would have been amortized into expense over the next two years to three years. This $18.6 million charge is reflected in other operating expense.","Third, we recorded a charge of $17.5 million related to severance and other personnel-related costs. Of that, $15.2 million relates to severance and other costs associated with the elimination of approximately 150 positions. As outlined in our earnings release, $13 million of that charge appears in the compensation line, $1.5 million in employee benefit expense and $0.7 million in outside service expense.","Our actions taken this quarter reflect a continued focus on improving profitability and returns, and we expect the charges to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $15 million once fully implemented. The remaining $2.3 million of personnel-related charges reflected in other operating expense.","Recall that one year ago, other operating expense included a $45.8 million charge associated with our voluntary cash contributions to four constant dollar NAV funds. Adjusting for these second quarter items, both in this year and last, expenses were 4% higher year-over-year and 2% higher sequentially.","It is also worth noting that the current quarter included $3.4 million of expense associated with our acquisition of the Aviate business, which closed on May 1.","Now, let's go through the remaining components of expense. My comments going forward will exclude the three current year charges totaling $82.6 million and last year charge of $485.8 million. Compensation expense of $377 million increased 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with approximately 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in India, Manila and Limerick.","On a sequential basis, compensation expense declined 1% as the impact of staff growth and higher current year cash-based incentive accruals was more than offset by the decline in stock-based incentives stood at the first quarter, including the impact of options granted to retirement-eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stock units awarded during the quarter. Employee benefit expense of $71 million was down 3% year-over-year primarily reflecting lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was flat as higher medical costs were offset by lower payroll taxes.","Outside service expense of $158 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense increased 6%, primarily reflecting higher consulting and sub-custodian expense.","Equipment software expense of $118 million was up 3% both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software-related costs and support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. Occupancy expense of $45 million was up 5% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. The increases primarily reflected higher rent expense with the sequential comparison also impacted by a lease adjustment reflected in the prior quarter.","Other operating expense of $74 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily related to higher costs associated with account servicing activities, higher supplemental compensation plan expense and increased FDIC costs, partially offset by lower costs associated with the timing of charitable contributions.","Sequentially, other operating expense declined 1% due to lower business promotion expense as the Northern Trust Open was during the first quarter offset by increases in various other costs, including higher supplemental compensation plan expense and higher staff-related expense. It is worth noting that, as mentioned, when I reviewed other operating income, the increase in supplemental compensation plan expense has an associated increase in revenue.","Our loan loss provision was a credit of $3 million in the second quarter. This compares to a provision expense of $2 million in the prior quarter and a credit of $10 million in the prior year. The credit in the current quarter was driven by improved credit quality in the commercial real estate portfolio and a reduction in outstanding loans and improved credit quality in the residential real estate portfolio.","Loan quality remains very strong, with non-performing assets of $166 million at quarter end, down 5% versus the prior quarter and the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans equal to only 44 basis points at quarter-end. The effective income tax rate in the quarter was 33.9%.","Turning to page eight, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control.","Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity. As you can see on this page after adjusting for the items noted in my opening comments, we have been able to continue our trend of improving this ratio. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business, to drive fee growth and drive productivity within our expense base by our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, procurement and technology.","Turning to page nine, our capital ratios remain solid with Common Equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.5% and 10.6% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.3% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirements of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer.","The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.1% and at the bank was 5.8%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017.","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","As we announced in June, our 2016 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.38 per share and the repurchase up to $275 million of common stock through June 2017. In the second quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $141 million. Yesterday, our board of directors formally approved the planned dividend increase, which will be payable on October 1.","When we consider our strategy for capital actions, we take into consideration the level of retained capital to facilitate our continued growth, our level of capital to absorb significant stress scenarios and to enable us to continue to hold top tier credit ratings. We also look at our capital level structure compared to our peers, as our clients entrust us with the safekeeping of their assets and it is important for us to demonstrate competitive capital strength.","Our growth, as measured by assets, earnings assets and risk-weighted assets, has grown at a rate about double that of our common equity since 2012 and we expect to remain focused on growth. We will continue to evaluate our capital structure as it relates to regulatory requirements and look to optimize the cost of our capital for the firm, not only in the short term, but importantly, over the long term as well.","In closing, the second quarter of 2016 was characterized by continued market volatility, low and even negative interest rates around the globe and geopolitical uncertainty highlighted by the Brexit vote.","Despite that challenging backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results, growing our earnings per share 5% both year-over-year and sequentially adjusting for the items noted at the beginning of our prepared remarks. Our adjusted return on common equity was 11.7%, improving 30 basis points sequentially. We also achieved sequential operating leverage of 1 point as we continue to strive to produce even greater operating efficiency.","We also returned $230 million to our shareholders while retaining enough capital to fund our growth and maintain high quality credit ratings. In the quarter, we were also pleased to receive no objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2016 capital plan submission.","Our Wealth Management business grew revenues 5% year-over-year, grew fees 5% sequentially and produced a 38.2% pre-tax margin. All of this was accomplished against a challenging economic backdrop.","C&IS continued to grow as well. In the second quarter, we had good success in growing our business organically with such wins as Ariel Investments and RECM Global Fund Limited and Guernsey. We also formally closed our Aviate transaction, allowing us to expand our brokerage capabilities into EMEA and APAC.","I would also like to mention that our team handled the Brexit situation effectively as they enacted their contingency plans in light of the leave vote. Our efforts around Brexit remains focused, first and foremost, on our clients' needs, and we are communicating frequently as the situation clarifies.","Lastly, Northern Trust has been named as a recipient of the 2016 CIO 100, an annual award program recognizing organizations around the world that exemplify the highest level of operational and strategic excellence in information technology. Technological solutions remain a vital part of our value proposition to our clients and this external validation of our efforts was an important indicator of the value of our investment.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions.","Derek, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Our first question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, folks.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Biff, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the \u2013 on the balance sheet the factors behind the premium amortization and the second quarter average rates going down, but in terms of just looking out into the third quarter, how you run those calculations if they're based on actual experience, or just models on the fact that the tenure has come in and then if you can talk about what do you view on deposit beta will be with the next rate hike?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So two parts to that. The first is around the premium amortization. When we consider sort of the outlook for premium amortization, we consider the drivers in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and there are several as you cited. First is our expectations around the rate environment. The second is obviously the pace at which refinances happen and we model all of that in. And there is also third, a seasonality to it.","If you look historically at our prepayment amortization, it tends to be at its highest in the second and third quarters with some relief in the fourth quarter and first quarter, absent any unique rate environment that we're in. So we factor all of that in, and we've seen that play out over previous cycles. This was larger than we've seen historically, and I think it's probably driven by the rate of refinancing in the markets.","The last element in the premium amortization is the characteristics of the portfolio we're invested in ourselves, how much time is left to maturity and what is the underlying construct of the portfolios we're invested in. So when we weigh all of those out, we do tend to see a tick-up in second and third quarters' seasonality normally and then lower in the fourth and first quarters. Again, the rate movements can also impact that as well.","The second part of your question was around deposit betas, I believe, with a second rate hike. When and if a second rate hike occurs, obviously, the first rate hike produced close to a zero. Deposit beta not much was passed on in that. We think even in the second deposit beta, while observing it for the first time that we would continue to see that sharing, while it would move up, still be relatively favorable for financial institutions and us as well.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then, just to follow up on the \u2013 maybe if you could talk a little bit about the decision on exiting the non-strategic loan portfolio, maybe just describe in terms of what the portfolio was, is there still a large portion that you might exit? Is there a remaining credit risk from that? Sort of just little bit deeper discussion of it, I guess?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So we, approximately a year ago, made a decision to exit our loan and lease portfolio, particularly, our leasing portfolio given the relationship nature of that portfolio. We are approximately half way through the execution of that, perhaps, slightly more. The leases are still of good quality, but we are selling them in the marketplace as we find the appropriate buyers. So that will continue to progress in future quarters as well.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Any net interest revenue impact from the downsizing of that portfolio on a go-forward basis?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Relatively modest at this point. As you've seen, our loan growth in other categories has more than offset what is the reduction in this category that you've seen. So our residential real estate and this leasing portfolio have shrunk. We're still at a 5% loan growth rate.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Good morning or good afternoon, I guess. Question around the expenses and the whole expense to fee ratio. So I guess, when we look at the first half of 2015, you guys were kind of 1.07, 1.08 range. Ex all the noise this quarter, it looks like the first half of 2016 is a little bit above that 1.08, 1.09, despite the fact assets under custody are up quite nicely and obviously you've recouped almost all of the fee waivers.","So just help us frame on a go-forward basis, given that some of these revenue tailwinds are behind you guys, what needs to happen over the next 12 months for this ratio to decline?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So, Alex, we need to continue to focus on the items we talked about, which is driving through our location strategy, i.e., relocating our employees to where they can, A, best serve the client; B, do that where we can pick up talent; and third, do that in a cost-efficient manner. That program continues in earnest, and that is a meaningful driver of our improvement in that expense-to-fee ratio.","But there are others, too. Efforts around procurement, where we have used our leverage, if you will, to purchase things like market data, things to use purchase business promotion items, travel, and use our leverage to drive those down. And then, third is technological spend where we can consolidate things like storage, we can consolidate items like data centers, et cetera, where we can actually improve that ratio. And it continues to be an important driver, and an important internal measure of our productivity.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got you. But I guess, as we look out into the back half of the year, is there anything from a seasonal perspective that could drive that ratio a little bit more in the near term? I know you announced some severance and head count reductions, so I don't know if that's back-end of the year loaded, which could help that ratio over the next couple of quarters, because it feels like we've been a little more range-bound recently.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So, Alex, the actions and the charges that we described earlier were management decisions that we took to help future run rate, absolutely. And so those could benefit potentially the less depreciation that we talked about in the client contract, write down the asset from implementations, and secondly was the severance.","Those are items, particularly the severance that we anticipate receiving about a $15 million benefit within 12 months.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. It's $15 million on an annualized fully phased-in run rate basis, right?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We won't realize that potentially for the first \u2013 for 12 months as they phase in, but in the run rate when they are, it's $15 million.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hello, there. Quickie on sec lending. First, you got your 18% bump-up quarter-on-quarter, but I think that's a little less than it used to be. I'm just curious on \u2013 you've mentioned higher spreads in the quarter, but are less clients participating in div-arb season, are more countries cracking down on it? Just curious to get some thoughts on the seasonal piece.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So you're right. The sequential last year was up 24% and only up 18% this year, and most of that was probably a more moderated div-arb season this year. Relatively modest, as you saw, our year-on-year was basically flat. But, essentially, there was a modest tightening, if you will, in the div-arb season, so we've experienced slightly less. And I would say, the volumes were down, spreads up, made that difference, but the combination of those really led to sort of flat year-over-year, but a little bit less of a bump than we saw in the previous first quarter to second quarter.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Okay. It sounds like there might be a little bit of a trend there where \u2013 if we were modeling the next couple of years, we might want to gradually bring it down, because you can't always count on the spreads to bail you out on volume?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","I only have one \u2013 we only have one year as a trend, so I'll (41:18). Yeah. It certainly felt I think that there was some of that in this year's cycle, and that could be different tax rules.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","No problem. No problem. And then, a quickie on CCAR. I know we all individually did this, but I figure this is a good venue to do it. The CCAR ask was down a lot as a percentage \u2013 if you look at it as a payout. I know you partially addressed this on your comments. But you got a lot of capital and you make a lot of money, and you don't have big capital-intensive businesses. Just curious, again, to have the conversation of why would you be the only one to have a dramatic decrease in the ask?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So when we look at our strategy for capital actions and what levels of capital we retain, we really do focus in on four things, Glenn. First is growth and we have growth plans, and do we really have the right level of capital to facilitate that growth? We've had three consecutive years of very high payout, as you know. An example would be our balance sheet has grown almost twice the growth in our common equity over the last three years.","And additionally, if you look from 2013 to now, our assets are up almost at a CAGR of 5.6%, and our common equity is only up 2.7%. So we look at sort of the ratio or the relationship between the growth that we want in our plans and the capital we need to retain to fund that growth.","The second issue we look at is how does our business perform under stress and do we have enough capital to deal with whether it's a Fed-mandated stress scenario or our own idiosyncratic, and we look at the proper level of capital to absorb that.","Third is credit ratings. As you see, at a 10.6 Common Equity Tier 1 standardized ratio, we're mid-table, maybe even slightly below on a point times. So we're not at the top, but we worry about what that would mean from a credit ratings we want and need to maintain high credit ratings. And then third is \u2013 or fourth is around our clients. In the marketplace, our clients do evaluate what our capital levels look like vis-\u00e0-vis others and they can use things like the ratios that we're talking about now to measure that.","And so being in the vicinity of our close-in competitors, we think it's a competitive factor. It doesn't mean we have to be exactly there, but we have to be within the area code to make sure that that's appropriate. We weigh all of those and we come up with an ask. I will say if the retention of that is not generating ROEs that we think if it's supporting risk-weighted asset growth that is not generating the 10% to 15% ROEs, we will revisit that in our next submission.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Perfect answer. I appreciate it. Thanks, Biff.","Operator","And next we have Ashley Serrao of Credit Suisse.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Ashley.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning, Biff. So just first question is just on Brexit. Can you just quantify the revenue and expense exposure here to the pound? And I know the situation is fluid, but in the event the UK is siloed from the EU, do you anticipate any operational changes that you need to make to conduct business in the region?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So first, Ashley, we don't provide the revenue breakdown and expense breakdown by the regions. But let me give you a proxy, perhaps. If you look at \u2013 we do provide the assets under custody in certain regions that can give you some indication of the relative importance in size in the marketplace.","If I could answer a little bit more the question around Brexit and its impact, I'd just start by saying that the good news is, is the team was ready and executed very well on the immediate impacts of Brexit, which was most important for our clients and that it was relatively seamless and the client was largely unimpacted by that while a lot of volatility was going on.","In terms of impact to us, I think it's very early to make a comment on what that would be as we're still watching the situation unfold. But I think it is important to highlight exactly our business mix in Europe. We are largely a C&IS institution, corporate and institutional businesses in EMEA. We have a small wealth business, but largely it's corporate and institutional business that does both administration for pensions and also asset managers.","The important characteristics there, particularly, for the fund administration is \u2013 or excuse me \u2013 for all the custody and asset servicing is the right to do that across Europe. Our banking entity is based in the UK today. So if that passport doesn't get negotiated as potentially could happen, we have to look at where we could also conduct businesses. We have large fund administration businesses in Ireland and Luxembourg which we think, their or others, we could leverage to re-domicile or domicile a bank to allow us to conduct our business, and I promise there's working teams actively engaged in that right now.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. I appreciate all the color there. And just a quick follow-up. Are you able to provide just what constant currency revenue and expense growth was this quarter?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","The impact on revenue expense from currencies?","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So on a year-over-year basis, the impact to revenue was about 1% drag on revenue, $8 million or so, and the impact on expenses was about $8 million. So it was a 1% benefit. And sequentially, quite frankly, it was immaterial.","Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Brennan.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks for the question. So the amortization changes that you made and the charge you took on the C&IS servicing contracts, thanks for providing the additional information on that, Biff. So does that eliminate all of that amortization, or is that just a subset? And I believe that you had mentioned in your prepared remarks, Biff, that it was because you didn't expect to recover that any longer, and could you just explain why that would be and what happened?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So it does not reflect all of the asset that's held. There are other clients where this contractual right is still in place. But for certain clients, the situation was this. When we take on their piece of business, we're able to capitalize it and create an asset. The contract language typically had the right for us to claw back the implementation fees and the client had the right, if you will, to terminate the agreement.","We negotiated a mutually agreed change to that where we gave up the right to claw back based on our understanding of the relationship at that time, and they gave something back as well. And when we gave up that ability to claw back, we were able to write the asset off and then obviously have the depreciation benefit in future run rates.","It does not represent the totality of the asset. It's not every contract did we renegotiate those terms. But, in these cases, we did. I do want to make it clear. These are important ongoing relationships where, quite frankly, the willingness to do that, the claw-back was something we were willing to do. So there's a favorable positioning there.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for clarifying that, Biff. And then, following up on Glenn's question, how do you rank M&A in your capital priorities? And if you're going to think about M&A as a use of capital, which side of the business would you want to grow on?","And when we look \u2013 I get that the balance sheet's grown versus equity, but you also ran through all your capital metrics and you're very, very strong on all those metrics on an absolute basis, much less versus your meaningfully lower requirements. And so it did create a little bit of confusion. So was the idea that you wanted to keep optionality for M&A part of the consideration on holding back, too?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Brennan, when we submit our plan, we absolutely think about organic and inorganic growth. And those opportunities are considered by our board and by our committees and we look at both opportunities. And the consideration of flexibility in a volatile market period is something that we weigh in our capital plan submission. And we do that on an annual basis. And I can't really say much more than that.","Our M&A strategy has not changed as a firm. We have typically and will continue it for the foreseeable future to focus in on acquisitions that either add a client capability that we don't have a geographic region where we need scale or a talent source or a technology source where the acquisition provides us with that. But we do consider it in our capital plan submission.","Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I appreciate that the commentary could be limited and certainly helpful color, Biff. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Hey, Biff. How are you doing?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Good.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Biff, can you talk to us a little bit through to some of the dynamics underneath the core trust fees? Obviously, you've got the rest of the fee waivers in both sides, which is really positive. But if we exclude that, the growth rate has slowed. I think in part to your earlier point about the markets starting to comp better \u2013 comp harder, but can you just walk us through the dynamics between core growth rates, fee compression and activity?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So let me start with activity, if I can take your last. In both of our primary businesses, we continue to see strong new business and wins in both Wealth and C&IS. So I would say organic growth rates in both businesses continues to be high. We don't publish that, but it's at or near normal levels that we've seen or if not slightly higher than that, and that pipeline remains strong. So on the fee growth side, organically, we feel it remains strong.","If you look at the actual fee growth that you're reconciling, there are some headwinds in there. There was some currency negativity in the comparison, particularly, for the C&IS business, so it was hurt by the stronger dollar. That was one factor. And in the C&IS business, there can also be some lumpiness to that as the wins tend to be very large, but we feel very good about the pipeline and the growth rate.","On the Wealth side, the new business flows and, in fact, in the second quarter were very strong, very robust, but they do still have the issues that we've talked about on previous calls, which are around fee compression as we have seen, for instance, the migration from, say, active to passive, particularly, true in the Wealth Management business. So that has created fee compression, which is somewhat offset by growth in new business.","So across both, we still feel pretty good about our growth rates in those businesses. And I think particular this quarter if we looked at it, even excluding the benefit of fee waivers, Wealth Management across its regions still had mid- to high-single-digit growth rates, which I think is pretty good, particularly relative to the industry.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Understood. Thanks. And just one follow-up on a separate thing, just if you normalized the premium amortization quarter-to-quarter, the core underlying NIM looks like it would have been about flat. Given the changes to the rate environments that we've seen in the last couple of months, how are you just looking at the balancing act of net interest income growth with balance sheet versus the spread compression, how you're adjusting to that?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. You're right, Ken. When we adjust for the premium amortization, we actually think the NIM probably would have been up 1 basis point, taking that out. I know we can't, but if you did, that explains the sequential decline.","In terms of forward thinking on the portfolio, if the rates stay at the levels we're at today and the low end of the curve doesn't move, we'll have to think about the delicacy with which we manage that. As you know, we're significantly impacted by the short end of the curve, which has remained relatively flat, if not even slightly up. I think three-month LIBOR has actually moved up just a tick or two. The longer flattening impact has a much more modest impact to us. So we continue to look at that, look at where our runoff in our portfolio is and how we can reinvest that.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, Biff.","Operator","And Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line has been opened.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Marty,","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Good morning, Biff.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","How are you?","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Doing well. I wanted to ask you about the outside services. It's been episodic in the past as you had to either go through CCAR or some regulatory pressures. It jumped up almost, I think, around $10 million this quarter. Is there anything in that is like you've given some glide path in the past of some pressures or a project that's going to come off the books and you'll have it come back down to a more normal range anytime soon.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Let me walk through that line item \u2013 the important line item. So roughly, Marty, one-third of that line item is directly related to revenue. It's sub-custodian expense, it's third party adviser fees, it's brokerage clearing. It's really tied to revenue. About half is, I would say, directly or indirectly tied as well. Things like market data that we have to pay to other vendors. Some of our offshoring work that has \u2013 that's volume-driven, et cetera, is tied to market levels and revenue performance. And then, that's about 80%.","About 20% then gets down to what I would say more discretionary spend in that line item, that things like consulting that you've highlighted where perhaps it can move and ramp if we need to take on special initiatives around regulatory environment, or if Jana Schreuder, our Chief Operating Officer, has programs of work around digitization or improvement to lower future run rate, we can, from time to time, see that move.","I will say that if you take just the consulting spend portion of that, the rate has actually slowed from the second half of last year. I know you see this number spike. It has slowed. It meaningfully went up in the second half of last year as we ramped up for CCAR and other regulatory. We have seen that start to slow in this quarter, but it's still at elevated levels versus year-on-year. And there is also in there some expense associated with the severance that I talked about and some expense in there that's associated with Aviate, our acquisition. So when you pull all of those down, the growth rate was more modest than the absolute year-on-year or sequential comparison.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Got it. And you had a big gain from Visa and then you had all the charges. I'm trying to just dive a little bit into your psyche about how you're doing that, because you have further gains in Visa that you can use. Did the charges start to evolve as settlements were coming through so then you harvested the gain to help fund some of that? Or did you think it was time to take a gain and move into while looking for ways to invest it and take care of some overhang issues?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So they are separate and distinct decisions. And, for instance, the decision to monetize a portion of our Visa is, quite frankly, driven where we think from a risk perspective, we have significant exposure \u2013 as I highlighted at the beginning of the call, we have significant exposure there. And we make decisions on when we think are the right times to monetize that investment.","Separate and distinct were charges where we think the right thing to do was address those issues and, quite frankly, change the trajectory of either our expense run rate going forward in some cases or take risk off the table in other cases where we were settling legal concerns. So they are separate and distinct. It does help. The one thing is we do look and care about where our capital ratios are, and it is a way to not degrade our capital ratios if that's something that we view as important.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And then, any appetite still to extend the duration slightly? Like you say, when the premium amortization's taken out, your margin actually improved by 1 basis point. So it looks like you're at least maybe pushing that out slightly still.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So we do look at that every month in our ALCO committee and take feedback from our economist and our asset management professionals and make decisions around the duration of the portfolio every month.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks.","Operator","And next we have Brian Kleinhanzl with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey, Biff. How's it going?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Good.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","So I have just two quick questions, I guess. One, on occupancy, I'm trying just to reconcile what you're saying with what the numbers are doing here. So you're saying you have the location strategy plus the people on severance being let go, but yet occupancy is up. Was there a new building that came online or what was driving that? And the rent increase, but it seems bigger than that.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Two things. In the first quarter of this year, we had a $3.5 million lease credit. So I would say the run rate in the first quarter if you look historically or look backwards was higher than what you saw. So that growth rate is artificially high. And then, we did also put on Pune, a second site in India. So we do have a second site in India. And third was Aviate. We have some space that we took on from the acquisition. So the increase, first of all, is much more modest if you take the $3.5 million out. And then, if you add in Pune and the Aviate, it explains the more modest increase in occupancy.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, did I also hear you say you had $2 million of losses on OTTI? I just want to make sure that those are distinct from what was listed on the cover of the press release and not included within some of those charges.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So they are not included in those charges, and there was $2.4 million of OTTI related to our Community Reinvestment Act investments. And the securities were purchased to help with our CRA efforts and we have to mark those from time to time, and we took a charge as our generally residential mortgage-backed securities.","Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. You mentioned \u2013 hi. How are you doing? You mentioned fee waivers a few times, so how much in fee waivers are still in place, if any, and can you just repeat the decline of fee waivers to the whole firm year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Year-over-year, fee waivers declined $28 million, and quarter-over-quarter, they declined $8 million, and lastly, they're effectively at zero in the quarter. I think we weighed $200,000 in the quarter.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. So that's \u2013 you got it all back with the first rate hike?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","So there's \u2013 okay, so that's a long time in waiting. So that's good news, I guess, from a profitability standpoint.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","It is. It is good news.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So we've been able to recoup (01:05:03) that with one hike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Was that faster than you had expected? And what's been the customer feedback?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","It appears to be in line with what the rest of the industry has done, and we had concerns that there would either be a sharing on that way up or that the pricing would change. And it appears that the industry largely has been able to recoup that on the way up much. (01:05:34).","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","The next question we'll take from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. A couple of questions for you. One is going back to the capital question that's come up a couple of times. When I look at your balance sheet, year-on-year, just going back a year ago compared to your CCAR a year ago, just use 2Q 2015 as example versus 2Q 2016, your deposits have grown roughly $1 billion whereas your borrowings have grown more than $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So walk me through \u2013 could you walk me through why you would be leveraging up as opposed to doing a bigger ask for share buyback?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So the growth in loans that you see there often, in our case, helps us drive other fee-related businesses. And those \u2013 the combination of the credit plus the fee-based business that helps us or enables us to win, we think, can drive north of the 10% to 15% ROE. So in some cases, we have the leverage. To your point, we have to buy the loan or others to get the fee-based business. That's why we think the combination of funding those risk-weighted assets and growth through the retention of earnings can produce an overall ROE that's in our targeted range.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","But, Biff, why \u2013 okay, I see the loans have grown. Why not slow the growth in securities? Does securities provide enough \u2013 a better return longer term given the interest rate volatility that occurs?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Vivek, I think the securities growth is probably more a function of our foreign office time deposits and the growth in that line, which is more driven by our C&IS custody business, drags big deposits there where, quite frankly, the opportunity to place those is better suited for a securities portfolio than to use it for loan funding.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Another quick one. You mentioned something about, and I didn't quite catch it, is it the lease portfolio that you're shrinking, the aircraft lease portfolio? Is that something else that you're halfway through?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","No. It was our leasing portfolio.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And do you still have the aircraft leasing portfolio or are you planning to \u2013 are you shrinking that too, because you had charges a year ago also in the second quarter when you had big Visa gains?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. It's across \u2013 it's the entirety of the portfolio that we're considering. We have not put all out for sale and marketed at this point, but we are looking at the entirety of the portfolio, which would include the airline leases as well, aircraft.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, Biff. How are you?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Good.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","As a follow-up to the last question, what's remaining in the leasing portfolio in terms of dollar amount that you will eventually sell off? And second, would there be marks associated with that when you do actually execute a sale of what's remaining?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So we're certainly rounded to less than $1 billion. How's that if we interpret what's that in the portfolio. I think rounded down, it would be under $1 billion when we round well under $1 billion. I think it's approximately \u2013 it would round closer to zero than it would $1 billion. How's that? We'll go with that...","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Sure.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","...That number. And then \u2013 I'm sorry the second part was...","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Second part was you took some marks this quarter in the sales of loans and leases. Are there marks remaining \u2013 if you were to sell that, what's remaining upwards to $1 billion, or whatever it is, will we see more marks to do that?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So, let me be clear. There's not $1 billion left to sell, so I will make sure...","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, sure. Okay.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","It rounds closer to zero than it does $1 billion. The second item would be in terms of the marks, we look at the residual values and other values of that and lower cost to market for items that are for sale, that are held in a held-for-sale category every quarter. So there could potentially be movement there and there could potentially be gains and losses on the actual sale of those in subsequent quarters. But as we said earlier, the total amount left to sell would round to closer to zero than it would $1 billion.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So it's a relatively modest impact.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. In this quarter, the marks that we're taking were they much driven by credit or interest rate or some other factors that you needed to take?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","So, the marks, I think, were taken by certain types of leases where, for instance, aircraft and\/or other types have seen some degradation in their values. And so we have to take residual charges even if we're going to sell them at some point in the future, we have to mark them appropriately.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then, just as a separate question, on the drop in the yield in your GSC portfolio, the government-sponsored agency portfolio, was that primarily due to the premium amortizations that you referenced or was there another issue?","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","That was about 24 basis points of the 31-basis-point yield drop was from the premium amortization. And then the other was just a security \u2013 certain higher yielding agency securities ran off in the quarter that replacement on those was at a lower rate, but the majority \u2013 the significant majority was from the premium amortization.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Appreciate it. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our final question for today comes from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Adam.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. First, a question about flows in both in Wealth Management and in C&IS investment management. I recognize that you don't give those amounts. From a qualitative drivers and the information you provided, it looks a little bit like maybe inflows on the C&IS side and outflows in Wealth Management. But my question is what trends are you seeing in terms of asset allocation, equity versus fixed income or certain products? And on one hand, what were you seeing in 2Q, and then has Brexit affected that? Thank you.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, interesting, Adam. Let me take our Wealth Management business. In the first quarter of this year, we saw cash as an asset class with inflows in most of the risk-seeking assets, equities and even in a little bit fixed income instruments with outflows. We saw that trend reverse in our Wealth Management business in the first quarter where we actually saw risk being put on the table at least certainly early in the quarter where we saw our cash balances actually coming down. And we saw increases, particularly in our case, in fixed income. But I think we saw some risk on in the quarter. So interesting.","On the C&IS side, our flows tend to be more passive mandates, so S&P 500 and other types. That's not our only, but our biggest flows tend to be there. And we've seen those move around from time to time. Particularly as we cited in certain large sovereign wealth pools, they've actually had to monetize some of those index mandates to deal with local requirements, if you will, in their regions.","I think we saw that slow a bit in the second quarter, perhaps, as the price of oil or other factors stabilized to some degree. So we saw that pace slow. But I think that's the color I would say around where we saw flows in the quarter.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's very helpful. And then, just quickly on Aviate, you gave the number for the balance of the quarter after the May 1 close, should we assume a run rate on that? Or if not, what are the factors that might move that around? Thanks.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think for your models, I'll let you do the modeling. But those numbers are reasonable item to model in.","Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sounds good. Thanks again.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.","S. Biff Bowman - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks."],"16624":["Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 22, 2015 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Bev Fleming - IR","Biff Bowman - CFO","Jane Karpinski - Controller","Allison Quaintance - IR Team","Analysts","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Jeffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Adam Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Operator","Good day everyone and welcome to the Northern Trust Corporation's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Bev Fleming for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead ma'am.","Bev Fleming","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Northern Trust Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Biff Bowman, our Chief Financial Officer; Jane Karpinski, our Controller and Allison Quaintance from our Investor Relations team.","For those of you who did not receive our second quarter earnings press release and financial trends report by e-mail this morning, they are both available on our Web site at northerntrust.com. Also on our Web site, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation which we will use to guide today\u2019s conference call. This July 22nd call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com, the only authorized rebroadcast of this call is a replay. It will be available on our Web site through August 20th. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.","Now for our Safe Harbor statement, what we say during today\u2019s conference call may include forward looking statements which are Northern Trust\u2019s current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results of course could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements because the realization of those [results] subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.","During today\u2019s question-and-answer session please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.","So, thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Thanks Bev. Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today I will review our results for the quarter after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions.","Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported second quarter net income of $269 million, earnings per share were $1.10 and our return on common equity was 12.8%. As outlined in our press release, our results in the second quarter included three items, which I would like to highlight for you today.","First we recorded a pre-tax gain of 99.9 million on the sale of 1 million Class B Visa shares. This gain is reflected on our income statement in the other operating income line. The sale reduces our ownership position in Visa Class B shares to 5.23 million shares as of the end of the second quarter. At the current conversion rate, this is equivalent to 8.62 million Class A shares of Visa. These shares are recorded on our balance sheet at the original cost basis of zero.","Second we recorded a pre-tax charge of 45.8 million related to voluntary cash contributions to four constant dollar net asset value funds. This charge is reflected our income statement and the other operating expense line. While the market base net asset values of the four funds were well above the prescribed threshold for transactions to occur at $1. This voluntary action offsets legacy losses realized by the funds during the financial crisis. The market base NAV's now approximate one across all four funds.","Third, we recorded a 17.8 million impairment of the residual value of eight aircraft under leverage lease arrangements. This impairment charge is reflected on our income statement in net interest income. Excluding these three items, second quarter net income was $247 million, earnings per share were $1.01 and our return on common equity was 11.8%. Recall that our results in the second quarter of 2014 included pre-tax charges and write-offs of 42.3 million excluding both the current quarter and prior year quarter's items that I just mentioned earnings per share increased a strong 16% year-over-year.","Let me also review environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients. U.S. equity markets were higher year-over-year with the S&P 500 up 5% yet international equities as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index were down 6.6% year-over-year impacted by stronger U.S. dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison both U.S. and international equities were down modestly. In bond market, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was lower by 1.5% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially.","Currency market had mixed impacts in the quarter. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 62% higher than the second quarter of last year yet was 3% lower the last quarter. Currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity, currency rates which influence the translation of non U.S currencies to the U.S dollar impact client assets and our revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger year-over-year which tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, but benefited expense growth sequentially the dollar weakened particularly versus the sterling and euro.","U.S. short-term interest rates rose slightly yet remained at very low levels continuing to pressure our net interest margin and resulting in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate both increased 2 basis points sequentially to 28 and 13 basis points respectively and the overnight repo rate increased 3 basis points to 18 basis points.","Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. My comments are on an adjusted basis which excludes the prior year and currency quarter's item I mentioned in my opening comments. On an adjusted basis year-over-year revenue increased 8% with non-interest income up 8% and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 10 million in the quarter primarily reflecting ongoing improvement in credit quality. Adjusted net income was 18% higher year-over-year.","On an adjusted basis compared to last quarter, revenue increased 3% with non-interest income up 4% and net interest income up 3%. Expenses increased 3%. Adjusted net income was 7% higher sequentially. Client assets under custody of 6.2 trillion increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison strong new business was partially offset by the currency impact of a strong dollar as I mentioned earlier as well as lower bond markets. In the sequential quarter comparison, the positive impact of new business and currency translation was partially offset by lower international equity markets and lower global bond markets.","Assets under management were 946 billion, up 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially versus last year higher fixed income cash and securities lending collateral were partially offset by lower equity assets driven in part by the stronger dollar versus last quarter cash and securities lending collateral were both down modestly and decline in equity assets resulted from certain clients rebalancing out of equity index mandates.","Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.3 billion, adjusted for the gain I mentioned earlier revenue was approximately 1.2 billion up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees the largest component of revenue were 757 million up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 9% year-over-year and 6% sequentially while fees in our wealth management business grew 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.","New business and higher equity markets were drivers of growth but currency translation as I mentioned earlier detracted from overall fee growth in the year-over-year comparison by approximately 2 percentage points. Lower money market mutual fund waivers also contributed to growth this quarter. Fee waivers were approximately 28 million in the second quarter down 2.5 million year-over-year and 5 million sequentially. I will go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was $75 million in the second quarter, up 41% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Currency volatility and client trading volumes were higher versus last year but were muted versus last quarter. Other non-interest income excluding the Visa gain was 73 million in the second quarter down 3% from last year and 2% sequentially. Within other non-interest income securities commission and trading income was $20 million up 12% year-over-year due to higher referral fees and income on interest rate protection products used by our personal clients.","Sequentially, security commissions and trading income increased 2% primarily due to higher referral fees. Excluding the Visa gain other operating income of 38 million in the quarter decreased 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting a number of miscellaneous income categories including for example lower loan and banking related fees and currency hedges. Net interest income, which I will also discuss in more detail later, was 275 million in the second quarter when adjusted for the lease impairment increasing 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.","Let\u2019s look at the components of our fee revenues on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $432 million in the second quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $294 million in the second quarter, up 12% year-over-year and 6% sequentially while assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.7 trillion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison strong growth primarily reflects new business and higher equity markets, partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In the sequential comparison, new business was again a primary driver of growth.","Recall too that some custody and fund administration fees in C&IS are based on one quarter lag asset values. Higher first quarter markets therefore helped second quarter fee growth while lower current period equity and bond markets negatively impacted client asset values. Investment management fees in C&IS of 81 million in the second quarter were up 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily due to new business and lower fee waivers. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in C&IS were 14 million, 8% lower year-over-year and 11% lower sequentially driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $714 billion, up 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. As I alluded to earlier, a small number of clients specifically sovereign wealth funds rebalanced their portfolios in the second quarter moving out of equity index mandates. Securities lending fees were 27 million in the second quarter, 11% lower than last year and 24% higher sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower fee splits in spreads, partially offset by higher volumes. The sequential quarter increase primarily reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads.","Securities lending collateral was 120 billion at quarter end, up 3% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were 31 million in the second quarter, up 16% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects a number of items including higher fees from benefit payments and investment risk and analytical services. The sequential quarter decrease primarily reflects seasonally higher revenue for benefit payment services typically seen in the first quarter.","Moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were $325 million in the second quarter, up 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher equity markets and new business. Growth was relatively consistent across the regions and particularly strong in the global family office. Wealth management fees increased 1% sequentially. Recall that wealth management fees are based primarily on month or quarter lag asset values. Thus higher equity markets in the first quarter resulted in a favorable sequential fee comparison. In addition, weight, fees and money market mutual funds were lower. Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management totaled $15 million in the current quarter, down 8% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. Assets under management for wealth management clients were 232 billion at quarter end, up 4% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially.","Moving to Page 6, net interest income was 258 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and down 3% compared to the first quarter. Recall from my opening comments that the 17.8 million lease impairment is reflected in net interest income. Excluding that item, net interest income was $275 million, up 9% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. A larger balance sheet was a primary driver of growth in net interest income. Earning assets averaged 104 billion in the quarter, up 9% versus last year and 5% versus last quarter. Total deposits averaged 92 billion in the quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially with strong growth in non-interest bearing demand deposits.","We also saw solid loan growth this quarter particularly in private client and commercial real-estate lending. Loan balances averaged 33 billion in the second quarter up 10% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The net interest margin was 1.06% when adjusted for the lease impairment, flat compared to the prior year second quarter and down 4 basis points sequentially.","The sequential decline in the net interest margin primarily reflects a lower yield on the loan portfolio as mix shifts to lower yielding products and a lower yield on the securities portfolio due to higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization in the second quarter was 15 million compared to 10 million in the first quarter.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were $855 million in the second quarter, up 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Adjusting for the second quarter items both this year and last year expenses were 5% higher year-over-year and 2% higher sequentially. Compensation expense adjusted for the prior year's charges increased 4% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher incentive comp. The impact of annual merit increases and staff growth partially offset by the favorable impact of movements in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year with more than 80% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis compensation expense increased 2% due primarily to annual merit increases and staff growth was 1%.","Employee benefit expense increased 10% year-over-year when adjusted for prior year charges, primarily driven by higher pension and employee medical expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense was essentially flat. Outside service expense was 3% higher year-over-year adjusted for prior year charges and 9% higher sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher technical service expense. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher expenditures for consultants, sub-custodians and legal.","Equipment and software expense was up 7% year-over-year while adjusted for the prior year software right-offs and 4% sequentially reflecting ongoing support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. Other operating expense includes the $45.8 million charge associated with our voluntary cash contributions to four constant dollar NAV funds. Excluding that item, other operating expense increased 11% year-over-year primarily driven by higher charitable donations and higher charges associated with account servicing activities.","In the sequential comparison other operating expense decreased 6%, reflecting seasonally lower business promotion and marketing costs.","Turning to Page 8, we continue to make progress on our goal to improve core profitability and returns. We closely track the ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees and remain focused on driving that ratio lower. As shown on Page 8, this important parameter of our progress improved to 107% in the second quarter on an adjusted basis excluding charges. This combined with the growth in other revenue categories produced meaningful operating leverage again this quarter, resulting in improvement in our adjusted pre-tax margin to 32% and in our adjusted return on equity to 11.8%.","Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios up 12% and 10.7% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.7% and under the standardized approach will be approximately 10.4%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.3% and at the bank was 5.6% both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.","With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 80% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2015 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1st, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses to fully phased-in Basel III implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of $97 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 578 million of common stock through June of 2016.","In closing, Northern Trust continued to perform well this quarter. Disciplined execution around both growth and productivity priorities remain solid as evidenced by over strong operating leverage and our expense the trust and investment fee ratio of 107%. As I mentioned earlier when adjusted for this quarter's items our pre-tax margin was 32% and our return on common equity was 11.8% both reaching 5 year highs.","In our institutional business, C&IS continues to perform well with growth coming from both existing and new clients. For example, we recently began providing global custodies at Queensland Investment Corporation, a client for whom we first began providing fund administration in 2011. The third and second Swedish National Pension Funds or AP3 and AP2 as they are known recently announced they have each appointed Northern Trust as the Global Custodian. This is a reappointment from AP3 a long time client and the beginning of a new relationship with AP2.","Other announced wins include RPMI Railpen in the United Kingdom and the University System of Maryland Foundation. These wins signify the momentum in our institutional business as well as the diversity of new business globally across products and by client segments.","In our personal business, wealth management remains well positioned in the affluent market offering comprehensive solutions to our clients. For example, solid loan growth of 7% demonstrates the success of our customized lending strategy as we support client demand while maintaining excellent credit quality. Wealth management also continues to manage expenses very well, driving further growth and pre-tax profit margins which have consistently exceeded that of peers. Our commitment to returning capital shareholders continues, as we increased our common dividend by 9% and returned a 182 million to common shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. This was accomplished while continuing to maintain strong capital ratios that support our growing business.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Lisa please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Sir. [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions, just one -- kind of clean-up question, I know you mentioned the one-time charge for the NAVs -- stable NAV product. I guess I just wanted to understand -- make sure I understood why that was happening now?","Biff Bowman","Sure, Betsy. We constantly evaluate our liquidity products and suite of products that we provide to our clients. And as you are well aware there is a lot of SEC reform and other items that have been appearing. So as we went through the evaluation process, we looked at some of the legacy issues that existed in four funds and make the determination as a management team that the right time to address the legacy issues losses and there it was -- was now. I'll be clear, all four funds traded above the $0.995 NAV price that is required. These top-ups will bring them to $1.","Betsy Graseck","And is that all in preparation for the money market reform that\u2019s going to be coming into effect next year in October?","Biff Bowman","That is a part of it, but it was also as we're looking at our array of liquidity products and offerings to our clients in conjunction with that reform. We felt that this was the right time.","Betsy Graseck","And then just separately on Omnium, I'm sure if you mentioned it too much during this conference call. But I just wanted to get a sense as to how important that platform is for some of the wins that you mentioned just now as well and the trajectory and accelerated ASD growth that you've been having?","Biff Bowman","It is very important to some of the wins that we've talked about. The platform and the capabilities there has first of all allowed us to have meaningful dialogues with significant hedge funds and other large asset managers. Equally important is the capability is very attracted to very large for instance sovereign wealth funds, large foundations or endowments, particularly around its capabilities to handle complex and alternative investments instruments. So it's been powerful not only the hedge fund clients but to other more traditional type clients as well.","Betsy Graseck","And then its more product and services you'll be able to layer into that platform over time?","Biff Bowman","So we continually look at its applicability and its functionality to integrate into the broader Northern Trust offering and that's ongoing and something that we are clearly investing in right now.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Question for your guys in operating leverage clearly really nice job so far in driving that ratio lower year-over-year basis. Two part question I guess A. Bigger picture, how should we think about that heading into back half of the year. And I guess it's my follow-up was one that you guys could address a little bit more with some of the specific items that expanses a) outside services and equipment and software could be a little bit more elevated on this quarter, so I am not sure if you can give us a little more color on whether anything kind of one-off drove it in of course the quarter particularly maybe related to some the investments with regard to the business wins?","Biff Bowman","Sure. First we would say that the 8% revenue growth that you saw it requires some investment and some expense to grow with it, but as you pointed out maintaining that leverage as we grow is very important to us, so we're focused on that and continue as you saw drive the expense to trust fees ratio down and produce this quarter 300 points of operating leverage. But specifically around some of the expense line items, let me talk about outside services. What I want to highlight here is that much of the sequential growth that was seen was really directly attributable to the revenue growth that you saw. So for instance sequentially on our outside services line you saw that it grew about 19.7 million.","More than half of that is directly attributable to growth for instance in lines like sub-custodian expense, depository expense those are directly related to the revenue growth that you see above. I would also suggest that other lines in there are also attributable to growth for instance we produce consulting or legal spend to help that new products and capabilities. So much of that growth is directly attributable to the revenue lines you see above. On the compensation line and expenses, much of that is supporting that growth that you see and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks we're able to do that in the appropriate type cost centers with over 80% of our hires being in Manila, Bangalore and Limerick, and we've also announced now a new operating center that we're starting in Tempe. So we're getting the cost to serve those in the right locations.","Alex Blostein","Just in equipment and software?","Biff Bowman","So the equipment and software line reflects the investment we've made, we have, we do need to and we do invest in technology and capital, it's an important part of our value proposition to our clients and that investment as we have previously said led to 7-ish or higher expense growth rate which is higher than the rest of the expense growth rate, but it reflects the investment in our platforms.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken from UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Quick one on FX, remarkably strong here quarter-over-quarter actually sort of a standout and being up sequentially versus some others who reported. Can you speak to what drove that strength and whether or not we should view that as sustainable?","Biff Bowman","I would highlight two items around that, the first is our trading results, they don\u2019t always exactly align with the broader market trends as our business is focused on trustee clients and their needs and their unique trading patterns in the quarter. I would also say that we talked about in previous quarters our development and our utilization of FX e-commerce capabilities to provide excellent execution for those clients, but it also allowed us to enhance our efficiencies through more automation. So we believe that led to some of the performance that you saw in the second quarter.","Brennan Hawken","Fee waivers came down here which certainly encouraging, I know you all have expressed some concerns about the ability to fully recapture fee waivers now that we're getting closer to the fed actually providing lift-off here on the short-term rates. Can you provide an update with your view on fee waivers and what you think about the potential risks to any recoveries there?","Biff Bowman","Sure there are several factors that way in recovery of fee waivers, first will be any pricing that goes on in that market and our competitive ability to match or the need to compete in that marketplace. The second is if you will is there a sharing with the clients that will go on or how will that unfold in terms of as the rates rise, how will we discuss that rise with the clients and share on the rate up. Obviously the amount and the size of the balances in our accounts will also impact the fee waivers as we move forward.","We're still waiting for some of that to unfold, I hope you're right that the rate rises on the horizon, but we're taking proactive actions to look at this, to model this out and as we've said we still think that we will be able to recruit a majority of those fee waivers in a rising rate environment.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Biff I was wondering, can you talk a little bit about the really big growth in the balance sheet especially on the -- led by the deposit side, non-interest bearing and then your non-U.S. offices. Can you characterize the sources of that, whether it\u2019s coming from other large institutions, or its client driven, and any color on geographic orientation?","Biff Bowman","It is client driven, and it\u2019s large deposits held by what you consider to be large asset holders. So, our sovereign wealth funds, central banks -- type of pension client types. It was meaningfully focused in Europe as you saw on the balance presented, some of their activities is as they went through the quarter and looking at they\u2019re bouncing but it also reflects just growth in our core business where we\u2019ve had tremendous success particularly\u2026","Ken Usdin","So if you\u2019re presuming that this is mostly client oriented and sticky, can you also then give us an update on reinvestment strategy, where you\u2019ve taken duration to and what type of investment yields are you getting on new investments versus what\u2019s still running off?","Biff Bowman","So Ken if you look at the balance sheet and other items, you can see that we moved some into interest bearing deposits with banks. So, a slightly longer duration has been an overnight if they\u2019re shorter term CDs. And those moneys in there that we felt weren\u2019t operational deposits but were in effect some type of excess deposit we kept in very short type Bank of England or other type investments in the marketplace. So, we put it to work a little longer for those that we viewed was core operational deposits, what we just described in any of those others that we felt were shorter term in nature we\u2019ve applied appropriately into more Central Bank type deposits.","Ken Usdin","And just within the securities portfolio, any changes in terms of your strategy, your reinvestment interest?","Biff Bowman","I would spare asset sensitivity did not change much sequentially and it remains the duration in the portfolio remains very short around one year, so hope that changes there.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Ashley Serrao from Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao","So, first question just on NII. Curious if you expect some of the drag from the premium amortization to abate in 3Q. I am just trying to get a sense of any lags here that we should be mindful of?","Biff Bowman","As well as I will highlight here for you, we had about 2 basis point drag to the NIM in the second quarter. And traditionally in the third quarter we\u2019ve seen that improve. However it is really tied to the underlying mortgages and assets that we hold in that portfolio. It\u2019s going to be much more impacted by where the rate environment moves in the quarter. And right now last quarter we were in the third quarter as you would have seen in ours, it was flattish. We\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. I think there is other factors too, there is a housing market, there is seasonality and other items that we think about. The second quarter traditionally has a little bit more premium amortization and then others.","Ashley Serrao","And then just on FX, can you just give us some sort of sense of the penetration of your ecommerce FX capabilities. I am just trying to ultimately understand like how much of this year-over-year improvement is driven by greater penetration or was this some of your unique client trading behavior?","Biff Bowman","So we continue to try to capture more and more share by bringing the right products and services to our clients. So, whether those are electronic solutions or other automated solutions, and we have been successful in that. It\u2019s hard for me to attribute exactly how much of the FX performance you saw this quarter was due to that. We have continued to improve our market share with our clients and we think some of those products and capabilities we\u2019re investing in are helping make that difference.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Luke Montgomery from Bernstein Research.","Luke Montgomery","So, on the expense the core fees ratio that is down a little bit this quarter, you put a goal out there of 100% but I think you also recently said that progress gets harder we achieve from here. When you think about what inning you were in with various revenue expense initiatives you have in place, whether that\u2019s location strategy driving down legal and consulting expense, or capturing more third party FX. Do you have a strong sense of the pace and path to getting to that 100% target? And if you assume for example there is no change in the environment, could you do it in the year, two years?","Biff Bowman","So, I\u2019ll start with this, we haven't put 100% target out there for number of reasons; first of all is if we get to a 100% that may not be enough with all of the investment that we\u2019re making and all of the productivity that we\u2019re trying to drive. So, we have not stated a public target of 100%. But we\u2019re in 107 today and we have said we want to continue to drive that down, so I\u2019ll answer your question in that frame work. It does get a little more difficult and you need a balance of revenue growth and expense growth as you have seen with the leverage we've demonstrated here to help to achieve that. That being said, we do think, there are number of initiatives that are ongoing and still in the side innings of the game, where we can make more progress. And while we talk about location strategy, there is still a lot of meaningful effort that the bank can do around looking at where it provides services, that's one example of where we can do that. Consolidating platforms in systems using fewer pricing vendors, there are numerous examples of where we've made progress and that we think we can continue to drive that ratio down.","Luke Montgomery","And then it looks like in C&IS custody fees as a percentage of client assets that ticked up nicely this quarter, I calculated about 212 basis points that's the highest it's been in a long time. So I was wondering, if you could -- maybe if you could speak to whether that's business mix pricing anything unusual that I'm not considering and whether you think that could be sustained from here?","Biff Bowman","It reflects a few items. First it reflects very strong new business that we've talked about in previous calls and continues to come in. It's both global and across segment that's helping drive the majority of that, you do have a full run rate of Bridgewater in this year, so that is a portion of that versus last year, where we would not have had a full run rate for Bridgewater in that. And I would largely just say it's the success of the new business momentum in across the globe.","Luke Montgomery","But it's a new business but it's coming on a higher fees as a percentage of assets or\u2026","Biff Bowman","It's -- we've seen some of the pricing, while I won't say move far north, we've seen the pricing stabilized in across many of that, many of those clients and we think that's help drive some of the improvement that you see.","Bev Fleming","Luke, this is Bev, one thing to keep it in mind as well is the calculus there, which is custody and fund administration fees to asset under custody. So to the extent that we continue to be successful in growing our global fund services business which serve asset managers, be a traditional asset managers or hedge funds that will help to fee line and that has certainly been a significant contributor to the fee growth there, but it won't be reflected necessarily in the denominator and assets under custody because what's coming in, in some cases with the asset under administration.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","If you can maybe just talk a little bit about the lending strategy, you mentioned the loan growth was very strong, first of all, the charge I assume is coming out of the loan bucket on the average balance sheet, that the leasing aircraft resurge looks like the yield was fairly confident on a core basis, if you can verify that? And then secondarily, if we can talk a little bit about the leverage to higher rates in terms of loan pricing the lag of resets on your both your commercial and residential books to higher rates.","Biff Bowman","First, as you said the nor lease impairment charge the lease impairment charge was flow through the NII and as you likely said our loan yield actually was down 2 basis points driven by mix. So to the first question, the loan strategy there, we have shrunk the residential real-estate by approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter, but if you look at C&I, if you look at commercial real estate and you look at personal loans which we would typically be secured by the investment assets of our client, all of those had growth rate in the teens up to the mid 20s. So across those portfolio we had very high growth, they produced slightly lower yields because of the secured nature and the credit quality which is strong in those. So that was 2 basis points of the NIM and I previously talked about the premium amortization that's pretty much your 4 basis points of NIM. So, that's the loan growth strategy that we've seen as supplying that into largely our wealth management franchise.","Your second question I think was around the leverage to rates and movements of rate, approximately two-thirds of the portfolio, entire portfolio is floating, and so we will have a positive reaction to that in that nature. Because our residential real-estate is shrinking as you might expect that's tied probably closer to the 10 year or something 5 to 10 year type rate, that is declining so it makes it slightly less sensitive to those moves. I would just highlight that roughly two-thirds of the portfolio is floating in nature and likely to be sensitive to the rate moves, so.","Brian Bedell","And do you have a sense of the average lag -- after rates go up, in terms of the resets on the floating part?","Biff Bowman","I don't really have that available, I don't -- Bev if you have that.","Bev Fleming","I don't, Brain.","Brian Bedell","And then just a follow up to be back to the expenses and obviously very good traction there. If you talked a little bit about the technology investments, numerous investments that you're making in the platform. Can you talk a little bit about to what extent you think over the long-term those enhancements are revenue producing versus just expense reduction?","Biff Bowman","Well, they're both -- there are clearly both many of these are investments for instance in technology that will allow our wealth partners to be able to deliver services and capabilities to our clients in a more effective, the holistic manner. Others are quite frankly investments in processing platforms that will allow us to be more efficient. So it is a blend of those that we believe will generate ultimately revenue and those that generate operating efficiencies and it is not just an operating efficiency type investment for those technologies.","Brian Bedell","And that would -- dovetail the comments of getting at 107 continue to drive the 107 down even in the near-term?","Biff Bowman","Yes.","Operator","And we'll now take our question from Jeffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research.","Jeffrey Elliott","On the money market fee waivers, why are they down this quarter?","Biff Bowman","So, money market fee waivers were down for two reasons in the quarter. One was primarily because the yields are up and short term rates have risen if you look across overnight REPO rates in particular moving up so that's one factor and we've slightly lower cash balances in those funds available. So the combination of those two were the drivers but I would highlight that rate -- the short end of the rate curve moving up does help produce a lower fee waivers.","Jeffrey Elliott","And does the -- in the fact that you've been able to get a bit of a benefit from a very small move and short-end of the curve. Does that give you more confidence on your ability to recapture a higher proportion of the fee waivers or is it still kind of too early to tell?","Biff Bowman","I would describe it is too early to tell, because I think we need to see probably a more pronounced move as oppose to the 1 to 2 to 3 basis point type moves, we've seen that likely will come with any kind of Central Bank action that may move rates up.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Glenn Shor from Evercore ISI.","Glenn Shor","What caused the changes in the fee arrangements in Sec lending. How broad based was that? Was that part of a broad change across the whole book just curious on how that unfolded?","Biff Bowman","The competitive nature in securities lending means that we revisit the securities lending fee splits with all of our clients on a regular basis. It remains competitive around fee splits and we negotiate those and have dialogues with our clients on those on a regular basis. We have seen it move modestly against sort of a trend meaning more is returned to our clients than to ourselves and the fees splits that is relatively modest which is the competitive place.","Bev Fleming","And Glenn one thing that I would add to that is it, it's not just the fee splits on specific clients but it's also the proportion of revenue that we earned from different clients and to the extent that we have a mix shift in where we're with the clients than it could be that the overall fee split would come down. So, mix plays a roll on that as well.","Glenn Shor","And is that something that will take few quarters to annualize if you will meaning this quarter it shows up in your year-on-year number, next quarter we should look to see that flow through on a year-on-year number as well?","Biff Bowman","That's a reasonable assumption, I think Glenn.","Glenn Shor","And then just one other one was I'm curious the global family office has been growing at a much better pace than the regions. I don't know if that's a smaller base thing or if there are special things you're doing to put more resources at it, just curious if you could talk towards that?","Biff Bowman","I would say a couple of items I would highlight there is one, these are ultra high net worth of family offices and others and they tend to be chunkier in the nature of their growths so they have very big opportunities, they come in very large size. And we have a very strong market position in this space in particular we have strong position across all of our wealth management franchise, but in this area in particular, it leverages the technology that we talk about the institutional space significantly as many of these clients can and often look very similar to institutional investors and so is growing similar to what you saw on the corporate institutional side is probably not coincidental.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Adam Beatty from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Adam Beatty","Just want to ask about some of the equity index rebalancing by sovereign, seems like a bit of theme this quarter. What's your sense of what types of products where that money went types of products either Northern Trust or other firms or whether it was a source of liquidity for your clients?","Biff Bowman","I don't want to speculate on all the places and when I think they were all rebalancing from asset classes and equity as you saw for perhaps different reasons, it could have been their own liquidity needs, it could have been that they felt that the equity market it had a very strong run and then third I would say is as you know passive management has outperformed active over the most recent periods and some maybe taking a view that in this next environment or perhaps we don't see same type of steady growth that active would begin to outperform passive. So I won't speculate any further on what their decision making process was, but I think those three items were probably in the decision process for many of our clients.","Adam Beatty","And I also wanted to ask about engineered equity solutions which you highlighted as an important and growing part of your business. What's the level of interest you're seeing currently there? What kind of fee rates do you get around that business? And what's the growth outlook looking like right now?","Biff Bowman","We're having a great dialogues and great conversations, we had a significant win in Europe around that product and capability and we continue to have dialogues with both our wealth and our institutional clients in this space. The take up is very high and the market we feel is very intellectually curious about this product and capability right now. The fee rate really ranges based on the complexity of the instrument we're talking about. I know this won't give you all the guidance you want and we don't give guidance, but it's certainly north of traditional passive management and somewhere less than what you would see in an active spread and then that depends on the complexity of the product where it is closer to equity type activity equity type pricing or more passive type pricing.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Just another -- just a follow-up on the balance sheet, you guys obviously saw some strong deposit growth and I am just trying to get a sense or do you get a sense that you're kind of grabbing some share from more leverage constrained competitors who are trying of push deposits off the balance sheet and let me get you thought on that and if you view that as a long-term sort of market share opportunity to grab some of these deposits because you're much less leverage constrained?","Biff Bowman","Yes, so we certainly see clients that are approaching us because of discussions they have had elsewhere around the use of other's balance sheet. I would say that we're taking a transaction by transaction approach to that and looking at the overall breadth and nature of the relationship we attain with those deposits before we take and I am speaking a very large deposits here before we take those on. So if it's an opportunity that say a hedge fund has a billion, we want to dialogue about what the other opportunities are with them other than what we would say as a very transactional oriented deposit or very rate sensitive deposit. And we're actively pursuing those in terms of deal-by-deal. Excuse me when I said we're looking at those deal-by-deal.","Jim Mitchell","And then maybe just a follow-up on wealth management, just curious the central region saw revenues that were down when most others up so just was there something unusual in that line item?","Biff Bowman","There were in the first quarter there were certain tax related fees that were accrued in the central region. We adjusted those in the second quarter and allocated those out amongst the other regions so it created what would appear to be a negative growth rate for the central region sequentially.","Jim Mitchell","But the total numbers I guess fine which is just how it was allocated in the quarter?","Biff Bowman","Total number is fine.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share as you've mentioned that you had some very good strong deposit growth in Europe, so the European deposits that had negative interest rates due to the central bank policies in certain countries over there were those new deposits brought on was the customers having to pay you guys to hold the deposits?","Biff Bowman","So the answer of that would depend on the currency in which those deposits came in the Swiss, Swedish, Danish and Euro market the answer to that would be yes, not in sterling but in the other currency the answer of that would be yes, we've moved to negative rates in the currencies I discussed.","Gerard Cassidy","So that the existing customers and the new ones that came in as well, correct?","Biff Bowman","It would be both.","Gerard Cassidy","And then second this is more longer term, it was decided that they were not going to include selected Chinese stocks in the MSCI World Indexes. Should that happen at some point in the future, is that an opportunity for you guys to see a bump in your the index funds and everybody having to move to buy those securities to match these MSCI World Indexes and to drive revenues for quarter or two as a even out to the new ratings?","Biff Bowman","We haven\u2019t factored that in that would make intuitive sense that there could be a bump with the purchase of those securities in there. But I wouldn\u2019t be able to give you any indication of what the magnitude of that impact would be for us?","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Mike Mayo from CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Can you elaborate more on the increase in demand and other non-interest bearing deposits? What is that and why is it going up so much?","Biff Bowman","It\u2019s generally just growth in the business and growth in our clients, both domestically and internationally. And some probably have some temporary nature to it but the majority of it is operating oriented deposits that\u2019s reflective of our success across the regions.","Mike Mayo","Could you make it a little bit more concrete because these aren\u2019t the interest bearing deposits that\u2019s not savings in money market or that category and it\u2019s a little bit further down and your liability and stockholders equity category. Just any one concrete example would be helpful, because it\u2019s up one third year-over-year and up couple of billion just linked quarter.","Biff Bowman","I mean there is clients that are large fund clients or others that have put large balances with this because the nature of perhaps we have a GFS relationship or some other, where it will not be interest bearing they have just left the funds cash or some other portion of that cash no our balance sheet. And we\u2019re trying to determine the interest rate sensitivity to those as we enter a rising rate environment. But it\u2019s probably large GFS or our asset manager type clients were that balance has grown.","Mike Mayo","And just preliminarily, how sticky do you think those deposits are, do those play with higher rates or what?","Biff Bowman","So the operational component clearly won\u2019t Mike, but we think it will be reasonably rate sensitive as rates rise.","Mike Mayo","And redeploying those funds because they went up so much I guess you put a bit more into securities. Is that the main usage of these additional funds?","Biff Bowman","So most of it is in deposits with banks as you would see I don\u2019t know that we put our securities portfolio has both long and short-term components to it and some could be in the very short-term components of the securities portfolio.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now take a question from Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan.","Vivek Juneja","Just a follow up on the question that was asked earlier about deposits from being set by other banks. So did you actually see -- did any of the growth this quarter come from that?","Biff Bowman","Modest amount really came from what we would say were outflow from others, most of it was really either our existing clients increasing their balances with us or just growth in general from our franchise. So there probably some modest amount of that but most of it was just core growth.","Vivek Juneja","And one last thing just timing on when you\u2019re planning to start disclosing Bev what you referred to earlier the assets under custody and administration.","Bev Fleming","Vivek that's something that we continue to work on and to make sure that we have everything aligned internally to get to the point where we wanted do public disclosure of that. So it\u2019s something that we continue to work on.","Vivek Juneja","Why is it taking so long, since you\u2019ve been talking about it for a while now?","Biff Bowman","I think we want to make sure that we have this right for not only reporting here but for SEC reporting and all the other documentation that\u2019s important to go around it and we continue to invest in it and we\u2019re moving forward when it\u2019s ready to be moved forward.","Vivek Juneja","Because I am sure you track this yourself, so it\u2019s a little surprising that you\u2019ve been talking for so long and it\u2019s not yet out?","Biff Bowman","Internal management reporting however is different than external when we\u2019re ready to move it forward, we will.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take a question now from Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I just had a quick question on the your opening comments about the advanced purchase and the Fed checking the model, I was just curious as to why you kind of mention that and is there something eminent and then I know the Fed's always reviewing those models, so do you have had recent communication or something that would indicate that there is going to be changes coming soon?","Biff Bowman","No, that's a standard statement but as we evaluate our models under the advanced approaches any change in the parameters of the models themselves can produce changes in our advanced approaches ratio, so we cover that off with that statement to acknowledge that, particularly things around operational risk for instance could be changed with different parameters or different events being in database could change those numbers in any given quarter.","Bev Fleming","But just to emphasize our commentary this quarter was no different than it had been for the last several quarters.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then just a follow-up question, on those remaining Visa shares, can you walk through the internal thought process on when you sell those? I mean it sounds like it represents about 8% of your tangible equity there.","Biff Bowman","So, the decision this quarter was clearly an investment decision that we took as an organization, we have not sold any visa shares any of our Class B shares held to date, but we've seen a meaningful increase in the visa's stock over that period of time and felt it was time to monetize if you will a portion of our gain. So, we do still have remaining post sale of about 5.23 million Class B shares and that today's conversion rate is about 8.6 million A shares. At this point we make investment decisions on a regular basis and we will evaluate those on a regular basis.","Operator","And we have no more questions currently in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back over to today's moderators for any additional or closing remarks.","Bev Fleming","Well, thank you, Lisa and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you after we report third quarter results in the month of October, if not sooner. Thank you so much. Have a good day.","Biff Bowman","Thanks.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. And we thank you for your participation."],"16257":["Northern Trust Corporation (NASDAQ:NTRS) Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call January 20, 2016 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Bev Fleming - IR","Kelly Mullen - IR","Biff Bowman - CFO","Jane Karpinski - Controller","Analysts","Adam Beatty - Bank of America","Luke Montgomery - Bernstein Research","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Brennan Hawken - UBS","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Jeffrey Elliot - Autonomous","Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW","Gerard Cassidy - RBC","Operator","Good day everyone and welcome to the Northern Trust Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.

I urge you to read our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.","During today\u2019s question-and-answer session please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today I was review our results for the quarter and the year after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning we reported fourth quarter net income of $239 million. Earnings per share were $0.99 and our return on common equity was 11.1%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our client. Let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the quarter.","Equity markets were lower year over year but higher sequentially. In US market the S&P 500 was down 1% year-over-year and up 6.5% sequentially. In international markets the MSCI EAFE index was down about 3% year-over-year and up 4.4% sequentially with the year-over-year decline being driven by the impact of a stronger US dollar. Recall too that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and the third quarter 2015 markets were generally lower. In bond markets the Barclays US Aggregate Index was lower both year over year and sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 11% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. In the sequential comparison currency volatility was 4% lower. ","Foreign exchange market volumes as measured by two of the Interbank brokers were down over 20% year over year and down about 13% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-US currencies to the US dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger year over year which tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth but benefited expense growth.","Sequentially the dollar was stronger against most major currencies except the Australian dollar and Swedish krona. U.S. short-term interest rates rose on the heels of the first Federal Reserve rate increase in nearly a decade. Three months LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate averaged 41 basis points and 16 basis points respectively both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher averaging 22 basis points in the quarter.","Before I move to the highlights of the quarter, allow me to mention one item discussed in our press release. In the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 550 million of non-strategic leases and loans for a net gain of 26 million. We also wrote down by approximately 27 million certain held-for-sale leases, which had a book value of 112 million at year end. The net effect of these two items on other operating income was essentially nil.","Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 2% with non-interest income essentially unchanged and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 6%. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 18.5 million in the quarter, reflecting a change in the estimation methodology for inherent losses and improving credit quality. I'll explain the methodology change later on this call.","Net income was 2% lower year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was essentially flat with non-interest income down 2% and net interest income up 8%. Expenses increased 2%. Net income was 2% higher sequentially.","Client assets under custody at 6.1 trillion increased 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by the currency translation impact of a strong dollar. In the sequential quarter comparison, favorable equity markets and new business were partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar against most major currencies.","Assets under management were 875 billion, down 6% year-over-year, a decline in equity assets was the primary driver due primarily to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients in light of economic conditions in their regions. A continuation of the trend we mentioned last quarter. In addition, fixed income assets were lower year-over-year, primarily due to the loss of one sizable passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management decreased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by lower securities lending collateral.","Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately 1.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were 747 million in the fourth quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially.","New business and lower money market mutual fund waivers were the primary drivers of year-over-year growth, with currency [ph] translation as I mentioned earlier detracting from overall fee growth by about 1 percentage point. Fee waivers were approximately 20.5 million in the fourth quarter, lower by 12.5 million year-over-year and 7 million sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fee shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was 53 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline, while the sequential decline reflects lower volumes and volatility. Other non-interest income was 68 million in the fourth quarter, down 12% from last year and down 9% sequentially. The primary driver of the decline was other operating income, which at 33 million was 20% lower year-over-year and 13% lower sequentially, reflecting decreases in various categories.","In the year-over-year comparison, recall that the fourth quarter of 2014 included two quarters of income associated with a third-party servicing agreement which was modified in late 2014. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was 296 million in the fourth quarter, increasing 9% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled 428 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were 286 million in the fourth quarter, up 2% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, while assets under custody for C&IS clients were 5.6 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially.","The year-over-year growth in custody and fund administration fees primarily reflects new business, partially offset by the unfavorable currency translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In the sequential comparison, new business was more than offset by lower quarter lag equity markets, lower transaction volumes and unfavorable currency translation.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $86 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were $8 million, lower by $9 million year-over-year and $4 million sequentially driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $648 billion, down 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier.","Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, 3% higher than last year and 13% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $104 billion at year end, but averaged to $124 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Other fees in C&IS were $34 million in the fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, reflecting higher fees from investment, risk, and analytical services invested payments. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher sub-advisory fees.","Moving to our wealth management business trust, investment, and other servicing fees were $319 million in the fourth quarter, essentially unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. In both comparisons new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were offset by the impact of unfavorable lagged markets. ","Money market mutual fund fee waivers and wealth management totaled $13 million in the current quarter, down $4 million year-over-year and $3 million sequentially, primarily reflecting higher gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $227 billion at year end, up 1% both year-over-year and sequentially.","Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $296 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and up 8% compared to the third quarter, growth was driven by a higher level of earning assets and higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $106 billion in the quarter up 6% versus last year and 5% sequentially in both comparisons driven in part by the level of client demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion, up 20% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. We saw solid loan growth again in this quarter. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially.","The net interest margin was at 1.11% in the fourth quarter, up 3 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on the securities portfolio due to lower premium amortization in our mortgage back portfolio. Premium amortization was less than $1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $14 million in the third quarter and $7 million one year ago.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were $825 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Compensation expense up 366 million increased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and the impact of annual base pay adjustments, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates and a lower accrual for incent of compensation. ","Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 85% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila, and Limerick and our newest operating centre in Tempe, Arizona. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 1%, primarily reflecting staff growth. Employee benefit expense of $69 million increased 11% year-over-year, reflecting higher pension expense and employee medical expense. ","On a sequential quarter basis employee benefit expense decreased 1%, due primarily to seasonally lower payroll taxes. Outside services expense of $155 million was 8% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. ","Outside services expense declined 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower third parties sub-advisory expense. Equipment and software expense of $117 million was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher software related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. Higher depreciation expense also contributed to the sequential increase.","Other operating expense of $74 million increased 5% year-over-year and 14% sequentially, primarily driven by higher business promotion expense and other miscellaneous expenses. The effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 31.7%. Our fourth quarter results include a $5.5 million income tax benefit related to our decision to reinvest the earnings of certain additional foreign subsidiaries and definitely outside The United States. This decision under APB opinion no. 23 reflects the continued growth and success of our business to outside the U.S. and it's consistent with similar assertions made in the past. Excluding this income tax benefit the effective tax rate was 33.6 and earnings per share were $0.96.","As I mentioned earlier, our loan loss provision was a credit of 18.5 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects not only improving credit quality as evidenced by a 9% or $19 million sequential reduction in non-performing assets, but also a change effective December 31 in our methodology for estimating inherent losses. The new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused and leverages work developed for regulatory purposes. This change resulted in a decrease in the inherent loss estimate for commercial and institutional loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for off balance sheet commitments.","Turning to the full year, our results in 2015 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was 974 million and earnings per share were $3.99 both up 20% compared with 2014. During 2015, we recorded a $99.9 million gain on the sale of a portion of our holdings in Visa shares, a 45.8 million charge for voluntary cash contributions to certain constant dollar NAV funds and a lease impairment of 17.8 million. Excluding these items, net income was 951 million and earnings per share were $3.90. We achieved a return on equity for the year of 11.5% adjusted for the items I just noted, better than 10% in 2014 and within our target range of 10% to 15%.","Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew 5% in 2015. New business across segments and geographies contributed to this result. Foreign exchange trading income increased 25%, primarily reflecting higher currency volatility. Net interest income increased 6%, primarily driven by 7% growth in earning assets. The net result was 8% growth in overall revenue in 2015. Expenses were 5% higher in 2015, reflecting investments in staffing and technology to support the growth of the business as well as to comply with evolving regulatory requirements.","Turning to Page 10, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we've made in recent years to improve the expenses to fees ratio, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from 131% in 2011 to 110% in 2015 has been a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity from 8.6% to 11.5% across the same time period. This metric remains an important parameter of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward.","Turning to Page 11, our capital ratios remained solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 11.9 and 10.8 respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.5% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.5%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.2% and at the bank was 5.6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable in Northern Trust in 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016 and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017.","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares at a cost of 152 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional 285 million of common stock through June 2016. For the full year, we returned 830 million in capital shareholders via common dividends of 333 million and share repurchases of 497 million. Our total payout ratio for the year was 87% which we believe continues to position Northern Trust among the highest rates of capital return across large U.S. banks.","In closing, in 2015, we continue to grow the firm profitably for our shareholders, deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients and improve our technology and infrastructure to ensure the sustainability of our momentum. From a financial perspective, we delivered an 11.5% return on equity for the full year moving further into our target range of 10% to 15%. In addition, we returned 830 million to our shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases, while maintaining strong capital and liquidity levels.","Our C&IS business delivered strong profitable growth in 2015. New business success was balanced both globally and across client and product types. During the year CNIS introduced several new or enhanced capabilities for its clients. For example we launched our complete FX service and outsourced foreign exchange execution service for investment managers which provides flexible execution options and operational efficiency. We also announced the agreement to acquire ADA Global LLP an institutional focused equity brokerage firm which will expand our existing capabilities to the EMEA and A-PAC regions. ","Our wealth management business grew revenues 4% year-over-year and continued to produce attractive margins achieving a pretax margin for the year of 36%. Product innovation and support of our personal clients continued in 2015. For example in response to an increase in demand for ART advisory services and how ART fits in a client's asset allocation we have expanded our expertise in providing leverage against collections to preserve liquidity and a client\u2019s portfolio and estate.","Also in 2015 we implemented a first generation bank-by-text platform. Clients are now able to check balances, view their net worth summary, transfer money, locate ATMs and perform other frequently used banking functions via text on their mobile devices. Our asset management business also has been successful in creating innovative client solutions. We expect to launch soon a new generation of target date funds designed to improve retirement outcomes by leveraging our engineered equity expertise. ","Lastly our investment in technology and infrastructure facilitated the growth we produced in 2015. An example of our investment was acknowledged in December when we were awarded best cloud and best analytical initiatives by Waters magazine which recognizes financial services technology excellence.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter Earning Conference Call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Zack please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, [Operator Instructions] we'll take our first question from Adam Beatty with Bank of America, please go ahead.","Adam Beatty","Thank you and good morning, just wanted to get some color on AUM particularly on the wealth management side, maybe you could provide some details around what you're seeing in terms of equity and fixed income and also maybe a comment on trend within the quarter whether December was significantly worse or pretty much run rate, thank you.","Biff Bowman","Thank you, when we look at our wealth management AUM what we have continued to see is movement from equity and other higher yielding products into lower basis point products, over the cycle that's been true for the whole year. I think that trend continued at about the same pace in the fourth quarter, so as clients look at their portfolios the movement from equity into passive solutions and or lower basis point yielding products continued throughout the quarter.","Adam Beatty","Great thank you, and just to follow up on the money market fee waivers, short rates came up significantly kind of mid-quarter, I was wondering either what the run rate looked like at the end of the quarter or you know whether you would expect continuing diminishing of the waivers, thanks.","Biff Bowman","We saw the gross yields in many of our funds improved with the short rate movement. I would position that as it was later in the quarter, not the midpoint in the quarter but tenders [ph] that occur more in December and then throughout December. So we certainly saw the waivers abate meaningfully throughout the month of December and the run rate of waivers the demunition that you talked about really occurred the week or two before the Fed announcement and then post that we began to see the growth yields in the funds move up meaningfully. So the waiver rate was very back loaded in the quarter.","Adam Beatty","That's helpful, much appreciate.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research, please go ahead.","Luke Montgomery","Hey good morning, a quick question on the NIM expansion. Looks like the yield on Fed deposits seems to have benefited from the Fed hike, so similarly to the money market question, am I right to think that if you run rate that through the full quarter the dynamic would be a tailwind for Q1? And then also it seems like the biggest driver this quarter was this spike in the GSE book, the yields there. You cited that the premium amortization so maybe you could remind me if that's a one off benefit that goes away next quarter and what the NIM was excluding that benefit. ","Biff Bowman","Yes, so, if you, let me address the Fed first, your analysis is correct, we benefited obviously from just a brief two weeks of that and you can project the forward benefit of that going forward in your models. In terms of the securities portfolio improvement if you will in the spread that was driven by the premium amortization that you described was a meaningful component of that during the period. It has some seasonality but it's more impacted by factors such as movement in the housing market and or rates in any given period, so we do typically see a slowdown in housing activity in the fourth quarter we generally have better amortization in that period if you will but as we mentioned in the script in the first part of the prepared remarks, it was slightly larger than last year and more than slightly it was about 13 million difference at quarter over quarter.","Luke Montgomery","Okay, great, thanks. And then a question on what you\u2019re seeing in credit quality, it looks like market pricing recession here, you release reserves for the fourth quarter in a row and net charge offset are near historical lows, I wondered if underneath that you're seeing any signs of stress at all and I think maybe that's getting in a leading way period in loan balances tick down for the first time in over two years, I know you called out at the loan sales, but I'm wondering if you\u2019re getting a little tighter about extending credit, giving your outlook on the environment or is that just reading too much into it","Biff Bowman","You might be reading a little too much into it, some of that it was the $550 million of loans and leases that ran off during the period. So, that's a portion of it, in terms of our own credit quality, it's important to remember this our mix in our credit portfolio as we have slowed or we have negative growth if you will in residential real estate, the growth is largely coming from areas that are investment accounts secured or large C&I type loans where the credit quality remains a very robust and very strong right now. So, the mix in our portfolio has driven improvement in the overall credit quality. I think we've referenced the 9% sequential improvement in non-performing assets and I think on a year-over-year basis the non-performing assets were closer to a 19% better. So, we have experienced strength in our own credit portfolio. ","Luke Montgomery","Okay, thanks very much. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask you a question, again if you look at the rate sensitive pieces that were favorable this quarter, you back out the 13 million from the prepayment fees, out of 8 million net impact on NII about 7 million on waved fees, taking that that's about a total of 15 million, but yet only really a month out of a quarter, you can move that up to be about $45 million in total once you get through the full run rate, just want to make sure I was looking at that right.","Biff Bowman","If you have that, you also have to look at volume and consider volume in there but your math is accurate.","Marty Mosby","Okay and then the other question was when you look at the balance sheet inflows of deposits especially non-interest bearing deposits were really still very strong, so your cash position continued to expand and securities came down little bit, you've been trying to do the other which is put more securities on utilizing. Given what you're seeing in deposit characteristics, do you feel comfortable you can still expand securities faster, so that you can bring some of that cash position down going forward through 2016?","Biff Bowman","Yes, the growth in those deposits can often be lumpy, we get significantly high deposits and from hedge fund and\/or endowments or other large institutional type deposits and we have particularly near period ends we will typically place that at the Fed. Over a long period of time the migration and looking at our ability to move some of those into the securities portfolio remains something than our asset liability committee is focused on and we do believe, we can do that in any given short time period we may have the need to put those with the Fed, so that it helps with LCR as well. ","Marty Mosby","Thanks. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","So, I want to be careful and not overly focus on one quarter because the full year revenue expense relationship was good and as you pointed out the expense to trustee relationship continued to improve, but if you look at the course specifically, I think some people are worried that there is a little bit of reversal trend. Some of the expense items you pointed out are higher and the ratio gave back a little bit. So I'm just looking for a higher level comments of, how much of that is just one quarter and the fourth quarter specifically, and I know the market is breaking down but as a general comment should we continue to look for that relationship to improve? Because it feels like some of the expenses are elevating.","Biff Bowman","Thanks. Let me -- we still think that the expense-to-fees ratio it's an important parameter of our progress towards sustainably improving profitability and returns and we remain committed to improving that ratio, but as you noted in the short-term and on a quarterly progress there can be a variety of factors. I would say Glenn as you pointed out on annualized basis, we've improved that since 2011 every year and we were like I said remain committed to that improvement.","Also there is a numerator and denominator in the equation, it\u2019s in that ratio as you know in a difficult macro environment certainly makes the space that which we can improved that challenging, particularly if you look across a very short timeframe like a quarter. Look, we're focused on the areas that we can drive that and that\u2019s new business on the top-line and fee growth on the top-line and the success continues there very strong new business results for the firm.","On the expense side, on the denominator if you will or actually in the numerator, on the expense side, we've got several initiatives that we continue to work on, our location strategy, procurement optimization, technology optimization, those are still in force and still moving at pace. You see some of that investment in our equipment software line, in the depreciation we hope has long-term benefit for us.","So a little longer answer, but it's the question I know that matters there and we are committed to continuing to drive that ratio down. And as fee growth slows, we have to recalibrate our business to address that on the expense side.","Glenn Schorr","Yeah understood and appreciate the one quarter versus one year. The only related follow up I have is, when you look at the expense items that you lined up between employee related stuff outside services equipment, on a gross dollar basis are those the best estimates we have for starting point for the year? Is there any seasonal component that we should be thinking about?","Biff Bowman","We have some seasonal components in the first quarter around other expense which is business promotion around the Northern Trust Open and there is some modest compensation, first quarter impacts from when we set our compensation awards. The Northern Trust Open beginning the business promotion being probably the most seasonal of those expenses. The rest are relatively balanced and that is a good launch point.","Operator","And we'll go to next to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.","Brennan Hawken","I guess just following up on Glenn's question there on the expense front. Can you -- if you continue to see these difficult market conditions, downward pressure in the equity markets and the like, can you talk about how you think about your expense flexibility, how you're approaching your budgeting process this year and obviously you've got some pressure from regulatory -- on the regulatory front as you've laid out in some of those line items, so how do you balance all of that?","Biff Bowman","Sure. Parts of our business as you know are on the expense side are actually also tied to market level, so we have a natural movement either up or down based on market level, so there is a component in our expense base that moves relative to those market, so it's not all fixed cost if you will into our expense base.","As we think about the year going forward, we certainly run multiple iterations of macro factors impacting our business, such as markets up X or down X, rates hikes coming or not coming and we run multiple iterations. We try very hard to run our business without macro factors being major inputs to the success of the firm's business going forward, which means we are not overly reliant on either rates or markets in any given period. And so that's how we build our process and we hope that not being overly reliant allows us to be flexible in our ability to react to large macro events, particularly in your question on the expense side.","Brennan Hawken","And then I guess that -- is it paraphrasing it correctly, Biff, here to say that you feel good about your front expense flexibility and you feel like you've embedded some in your budgeting process, am I taking too much of a lead [ph]?","Biff Bowman","I would phrase it this way, I would say that part of our expense base is variable based on market levels. Part is we have access to maneuver that in this environment and part is quite frankly investment that needs to continue to support the growth on the new business side, so its parts of all three of your question are true in that. We don\u2019t have complete flexibility on the expense side, it's not at 100% variable expense base.","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for the color there. And then one question just maybe if it's possible for you to give us a little more color on the change of methodology for the provision and how much of that credit improvisation we should assume is one-time. Does this mean that there would be less credits running through that line on a go forward basis due to the change in methodology? And I think you mentioned there was a regulatory issue driving it or feedback from regulators, if you can give a little more color there, that'd be great?","Biff Bowman","Yeah, I'll start with the last thing, I mean it was not the regulators driving in, it was our use of the models and methodologies we use in CCAR to help guide us to help build this model to drive our loan loss reserve policy. So it was not something regular drove us to do.","I will give you a little bit of color. So at December 31 that was the first time that we applied the new methodology and it produced the $18.5 million release that you talked about. Your characterization of, we\u2019ve now set that baseline and that\u2019s establish and in any given quarter based on the credit quality and the factors that we look at from the model perspective. We will see provision or release based on that modeled approach going forward. But it certainly was one quarter where we employed the methodology and got the number two at least a level that allows us to move forward based on how the actual credit quality and other factors are moving in the future, so we rebased if you will.","Brennan Hawken","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Can I ask a question just about the interchange between NII and fees? Specifically, I see you had another outstanding growth quarter for the size of the balance sheet. And I\u2019m wondering, can you talk us through the inflows that you\u2019re continuing to see into deposits. Is that new client money, is it flight to safety or is it money coming out of your existing clients and maybe showing up in NII, but not so much showing up in fees. Just trying to get to interplay between money flows across the franchise and is it a net positive or is it more of a hedge against the total revenue?","Biff Bowman","I would describe that it has primarily driven by growth in our organic business underlying. So these clients may come to us and become a global fund services client and use our firm for fee based services. And then place an additional billion dollar deposit with us after that relationship has strengthen overtime. So it adds if you will to the deposit base and I would say that they\u2019re linked.","There are some deposits that are probably a flight to safety, but I would not say that\u2019s the majority of what we seen in our growth, most are existing clients in other fee based lines in the firm. And in fact, what I would add is generally, we have not taken on large deposits that we talked about, if they don\u2019t have broader relationships, just because the return dynamic is less attractive.","Ken Usdin","And then my follow-up, if you could just split the businesses for a second and just talk about then any changes and either the pipelines or client activity that you\u2019re see given the sentiment change that we\u2019ve witness now for going on a couple of months in the marketplace and if you can disaggregate that into CNS [ph] to CNIS component and wealth management?","Biff Bowman","I\u2019ll start with CNIS, the pipeline remains very strong and when I say that it\u2019s really globally strong strength in Asia, particularly in Australia and other parts of Asia. In Europe very strong demand and pipeline there. And then in the U.S., a balance pipeline, but between our global fund services business, servicing asset managers and institutional investors as we would call them, think pensions and foundations, endowments, et cetera. Very balance set of existing wins and pipelines in both of those businesses.","On the wealth side, we talked about our investment in certain markets in Texas and Houston specifically in New York. I can say that both of those experienced meaningful outsized growth versus the rest of the wealth management franchise. So that investment in their pipeline in those regions is very important. We made a key hire that we announced in New York just this week or the 11th, we announce. So I would say both pipelines are very, very solid and we feel good about the pipeline.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell ","Biff could you comment a little bit more about the passive investing I think we\u2019re seeing maybe across consider [ph] it wealth management franchise. How are some of the recommendations to clients changing and I guess are you recommending passive strategies, overactive and then on the new target dates funds are those going to be invested in passive products, no-interest passive products or active. And I guess just the risk posture of the wealth management client basis and how you\u2019re recommending allocations in this market?","Biff Bowman","So we have a very robust IPC committee and investment policy committee made up professionals from our asset management expertise and Katie Nixon on the wealth management side, looks that I diversified investment portfolio for our wealth clients, which does make tactical asset allocations during any given period, but it is largely well diversified portfolio across all array of investments. So when you ask the question about passive versus active, it's really a question around diversified versus commitments to large components.","So, when you can get large-cap exposure through active or passive, but it's about being diversified across that portfolio mix that's important. That's a very independent committee that helps to make that decision for our clients and they do make some tactical decisions if they are concerned about region or an asset class, but they generally stick to what I would say is a very well diversified global portfolio mix for the clients. ","Brian Bedell ","Is that shifting more toward passive only because in a legacy basis, it may have been more active or not necessarily?","Biff Bowman","So, it may not but as the price point difference between the passive and actives, and then the performance comparison has changed for those clients to get S&P 500 exposure or large-cap exposure the cost point for them could be quite different and they continue to evaluate that cost point. So they do evaluate that and there has been some migration from say active equity to passive equity, we've focused first and formal on the diversification of the portfolio and then whether that's delivered actively or passively is something that we talk with our clients in our policy. ","Brian Bedell ","Okay and then maybe just shifting to the balance sheet, there was pretty strong growth in the short-term borrowing in the fourth quarter, is that at the startup [ph] or is that in line with the commentary that you give around deposit growth and then maybe if you can talk about how you're thinking about deposit data moving into the new year with the higher short-term rates in December and then also on the loan book, if you can remind us what portion of your loans are floating rate what kind of lags to I think it's LIBOR for those part that we'll see, just trying to get a sense of that, how that might move in one [multiple speakers]? ","Biff Bowman","Try to give all three of those ","Bev Fleming","Brian, let me just take couple of the factual questions that you asked here. In terms of the loan portfolio about 70% floating, the reminder fixed. So that's one of the things that you're interesting about and then in terms of pricing, I mean it depends on the loan category you're talking about. So, clearly for example our commercial loans would be generally LIBOR based, our private client loans also LIBOR based, although a few could be time and then of course the real estate portfolios would be based off of treasury. So, it depends on the category, you're referring to ","Brian Bedell ","And then just on the commentary on your sense on the deposit [indiscernible]?","Biff Bowman","Yes, we're watching the market like many. Like others, we did not pass the 25 basis points on to the clients on that but we continue to watch the market and I think we'll have a much better idea how that unfold over time. ","Brian Bedell ","Okay, fair enough. Thank you. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Couple of quick questions. I guess, just sticking with NII and the balance sheet discussion. I guess, seasonally we shouldn't expect that there was an elevated level of activity towards quarter ends, so like quantify, [indiscernible] balance is a decent starting point for next year and then again the organic growth that we've seen in a past, is the reasonable way to think about it?","Biff Bowman","Yes. ","Alex Blostein","Okay, easy enough. And my other question was around the securities lending business and you mentioned the drop off in collateral balances happened towards the end of the quarter, again just want to understand whether or not it was something episodic or what drove the decline. And I guess, as a follow up to that given the fact that we've seen obviously pick up in market volatility in a more challenging backdrop quarter-to-date, just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any change in demand spreads or something that could help the securities lending business as we look out into 2016? Thanks. ","Biff Bowman","So, talking about the balances and the difference between the average balance sheet in the end. That was a borrower or a demand driven phenomenon and I'm -- I will presume that was -- those institutions looking at their own balance sheets at year-end as they did what they needed to, to make their balance sheets and ratios look appropriate at year-end.","It benefited us in the sense that if you look at our standardized ratio we had a 40 basis point improvement, much of that was reduction from a standardized approach as I said, much of that was a risk weighted approach -- risk weighted asset improvement driven by lower securities lending balances at quarter end.","In terms of we're not seeing so far into 2016, more of the same trend that you saw late in Q4 for us, nothing than I'd called out at this point. ","Operator","And we'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","So that was just a one off on client event for the securities lending book?","Biff Bowman","It was not a one off client, it was just demand in general, I'm guessing that our clients were working on their own balance sheets at quarter end and it was really a quarter end phenomenon.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just a follow up question on the reserve methodology changes, just want to make sure I understand what drove the decision to do this and is it as indicated that the kind of reset the bars so from here changes in credit outlook Q-on-Q-on-Q is going to drive changes in reserving or in net charge-offs. Any legacy reserve benefit or reserve release has been coming through this quarter with reserve methodology change?","Biff Bowman","I\u2019ll take the second part and answer it. Beth, that is accurate, it is -- the new methodology and approach has been approved and utilized in this quarter and is I think put in at the run-rate and then quarter-on-quarter credit quality will become variable. In terms of the, why now. We've worked to build out the model over the course of the year and we wanted to leverage the work we had done with CCAR to use a much more quantitatively oriented model to do this and we also work with our accountants and others to make sure that the reserve is as quantified as possible. This allowed us to get to that level of a much more quantified approach and that was the trigger.","Betsy Graseck","And do you think that there is any impact in the volatility of provisioning going forward where there is model change? Is there anything on that net nature that we should be thinking about?","Biff Bowman","No, it will just depend on overall the credit quality of the portfolio, so I'm hesitant to say yes or no. If the credit trends continue then it should be well reserved and if there's something in the portfolio then it will move. I think it is reasonable unless there is meaningful improvement or degradation in the portfolio that large releases are unlikely to happen.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Well, Biff I guess your timing for $500 million of government bonds was pretty good, you probably had a gain on those purchases in the fourth quarter. So I'm not sure if we'll gains on those down the road, but my question relates to the funding of some of the purchases, I know you were asked before, I missed the answer. The short-term borrowings were up 1.7 billion. Now, I'm just trying to understand the balance sheet dynamics, just a little bit more, I mean earning assets grew at an annualized pace of 20% and you have short-term borrowings up quite a bit and why just, a lot of questions have touched on this, but I just want to make sure I have the right answer.","Biff Bowman","So part of that was federal home loan bank borrowing that we took advantage of which was an attractive, a very attractive borrowing rate, so that was a meaningful portion of the increase in short-term borrowings if you will that you described there. And in terms of the timing of the purchase, again, Mike we have an asset liability committee that has a view on where we should take investment decisions and we thought maybe right after the rate hike it maybe opportunistic and I don\u2019t know if that's right in the long-term, but it was -- it's an attractive trade through today.","Mike Mayo","And the federal home loan bank borrowing rate, could you elaborate on that, what is that? If you're allowed to disclose the rate or -- I mean how often does this come up? Is this something you never seen before or you see it every so often?","Biff Bowman","We've had access to that borrowing in the past, I don\u2019t know if we can disclose the borrowing rates, I'm unsure. I will say that it is very low, very low effective borrowing rate.","Mike Mayo","So a part of the quarter was simply advantageous situation, where you took advantage of a very low borrowing rate at a good time when you thought it might make sense to load up on some more government security, so is that correct?","Biff Bowman","No -- yeah -- not completely that, I think part of it was we liked -- the federal home loan borrowings is attractive from an LCR perspective as well, so that borrowing allowed us to also strengthen some liquidity measures and then we were able to take advantage of some of that borrowing and create some yield.","Mike Mayo","Last follow up, so you had 8% growth in NII\u2019s linked quarter which is pretty impressive, should we consider that to be sticky? Should we consider the potential for our growth in NII like that again in upcoming quarters?","Biff Bowman","I think that there was obviously the amortization benefits in there that has seasonality and deals with macro factors like rates and\/or housing starts, so that tailwind is unlikely to maintain itself during the entire course of the year. It tends to be worse in the second and third quarters, so --.","Mike Mayo","So should we see that come down a little bit from the first quarter level?","Biff Bowman","I'm hesitant to say one way or the other, I don\u2019t know what the premium amortization in mortgage backed securities will do in the period, so --.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeffrey Elliot with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Elliot","I wanted to come back to the securities lending collateral move because I kind of heard at one point you were saying this was a quarter end phenomenon and then I also thought I heard you say something about the behavior that you'd seen at the end of the fourth quarter how it continued into the first. So I guess could you clarify the drop in like lending collateral is that a kind of something that happened around December 31st, it probably comes back, is not going to impact the P&L or has there been some sort of change in customer behavior that maybe last a bit longer?","Biff Bowman","So the collateral levels and the loan levels were quarter end phenomena, my comment was about -- the question was around spread, has we seen any dramatic changes in the spread and or demand in the first part of this year and I would say the demand and the collateral levels are closer to the averages we've talked about in the previous period. Not a decline and then movement from the quarter end.","Jeffrey Elliot","That's clear and then just to follow up, again on the institutional side, the AUM you know I guess if you take out the cycle ending it's not as if it\u2019s declined a lot but given equity markets are up quite a lot, we might have expected a bit more growth. So you know the reasons why that business isn't grow that -- AUM balance isn\u2019t growing as strongly as you might have expected given what equity markets did in the fourth quarter customers kind of going elsewhere.","Biff Bowman","Yes, so one meaningful factor in that would be our sovereign wealth fund exposure that I mentioned in my prepared remarks but we, we do report in P&I magazine, a year ago I think we reported sovereign wealth balances of 70 billion in that. At year end those had migrated down just too sovereign wealth funds of 50 billion, approximately 50 billion. So we're seeing some of the pressures, if you will, on those regional economies and the need for some of those large sovereign wealth funds to use those funds, if you will, in their local environment.","So that phenomenon has helped drive down the AUM, what I will say is about 95% of those are passive management mandates and generally have very low basis point fees, so while the AUM decline is meaningful the fee impact is more muted.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW, please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, thanks, so quick question on the deposit betas, I know you said it\u2019s too early to get a sense of what deposits are doing in the quarter, but can you have any balancing or managing the balance sheet for lower for longer, why if deposit betas are low shouldn't we expect the securities portfolio to increase?","Biff Bowman","Well if that is correct we may see that happen, but we're still observing the market and I think it's digesting the first round of these and remember we have a variety of large clients where the deposit betas may be more bespoke, more uniquely crafted in the contract so it's not a direct corollary that that is going to happen. And then the other thing is just from a liquidity standpoint, maintaining our liquidity.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then just a follow up on the seasonality and the expenses, so not in 2016 but in 2017 when you changed your title sponsorship, will that seasonality move from the first quarter into the third or fourth quarter and kind of what is the magnitude of that impact on a dollar basis?","Biff Bowman","Yes, it will move to the third quarter in 2017, and we don't disclose the magnitude of that, but you'll be able to see in the expense run rate after the third quarter 2017. ","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC, please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you, good afternoon Biff. Question for you and this isn\u2019t really directed at your loan portfolio because I don't think you have anything to really worry about with this fall in the price of oil but you can give some color, what are you guys looking into how this decline in the price of oil may affect maybe some of your wealth management customers or are there any counter-party risks that you're trying to figure out that you may have that would be impacted by the decline in the price of oil.","Biff Bowman","Sure, so let me start at a high level and I just briefly -- if you look at the decline in the price of oil many of the sovereign wealth funds that we serve are in oil producing nations and so that decline does have an impact on our business. They have lower asset levels and we certainly have seen flows out of those sovereign wealth funds as they address their issues.","So that's on the institutional side, I know you also asked on the wealth side. And certainly in certain regions, we've talked about Houston is that, there can be secondary or tertiary impacts from low oil prices, so there are people providing services to companies and others that have been impacted, generally our clients given the wealth nature of our clients our liquid well invested and well diversified away from those single asset wealth creation in vehicles and we generally see modest impact to them from this type of environment, our direct exposure as you rightly said is largely too large multinational diversified firms with strong investment grade credits and so from an overall credit quality at this point while we certainly monitor it and look at it from a risk perspective, it has not had a significant impact on the overall credit quality of the deferral [ph].","Gerard Cassidy","Great and then the second question obviously you guys have focused on driving your return on equity higher within your range of 10% to 15%. We all know the industry is -- had to carry a considerable more amount of equity which is permanently reduced return on the equity. If you shift over to your ROA, that obviously is not impacted by equity and those ROA numbers are still quite a bit below where you used to be prior to the crises, is it primarily just that net interest margin and spread that's affecting the ROA would you say or is there other factors as well?","Biff Bowman","So, it is the two items that you described. I would say, it can be a bit of the earning asset mix, it can be some of the impacts of netted low net interest income, margins, et cetera that are driving that fundamentally. I will say that our business is much more liability driven and so the focus is really on turning those liabilities are fees essentially those liabilities are client placing deposits with us that we then turn into asset and so our focus is on return of equity and it just so happens that the ability to turn those liabilities into higher earning assets has been muted in the last several years under these low environments, but I think the combination of those has probably driven the ROA down, what we focus really on the ROE as a primary profitably measure.","Gerard Cassidy","Correct, which is the one to -- I agree with you. Great, thank you for your input. ","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. ","Bev Fleming","We thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you when we report first quarter earnings in the middle of April which will occur on the same day as our annual meeting. Thank you very much. ","Biff Bowman","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Thank you again for joining us today.","Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call.","Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $347.1 million, earnings per share were $1.48, and our return on common equity was 14%. As noted on the second page of our earnings release, this quarter\u2019s results included $12.3 million of severance-related and restructuring charges within expenses.","Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets rebounded during the quarter, following a challenging fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year, the S&P 500 ended the quarter, up 7.3%, while the MSCI EAFE was unchanged.","On a sequential basis, end-of-period markets were favorable, with the S&P 500 and the EAFE indices increasing 13.1% and 9.6%, respectively. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged pricing, and those comparisons are challenging, both versus one year ago as well, sequentially. On a month lag basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were down 2.6% and 9% on a year-over-year basis, and down 4.7% and 4.1% sequentially. On a quarter lag basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were down 6.2% and 13.4% on a year-over-year basis, and down 14% and 12.5% sequentially.","U.S. short-term interest rates were modestly higher in the quarter on average, driven by the full quarter impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s December rate hike. On a sequential basis, average one-month and three-month LIBOR increased 15 basis points and 7 basis points respectively. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar ended the quarter down 7% and 9%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The year-over-year declines favorably impacted expense, but had an unfavorable impact on revenue. On a sequential basis, the British pound ended the quarter up 2%, while the euro declined 2%.","Let\u2019s move to page three and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue was flat with non-interest income down 3% and net interest income up 9%. Expenses increased 3% from last year. The provision for credit losses was zero in the current quarter compared to a credit of $3 million one year ago. Net income was 9% lower year-over-year.","In the sequential comparison, revenue declined 2% with non-interest income down 3% and net interest income flat. Expenses increased 1% compared to the prior year. Net income declined 15% sequentially. Return on average common equity was 14% for the quarter, down from 16% one year ago and 17% in the prior quarter.","Assets under custody and administration of $10.9 trillion, increased 1% compared to one year ago and were up 8% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $8.2 trillion were also up 1% compared to one year ago and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by favorable markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. The sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business.","Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, flat on a year-over-year basis and up 9% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance reflected higher markets and new business, offset by lower period-ending and securities lending collateral. The sequential increase was driven by higher markets and new business.","Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, flat compared to last year and down 2% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $929 million in the first quarter, down 1% from both last year and the prior quarter.","Foreign exchange trading income was $66 million in the first quarter, down 16% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by lower volatility, as well as lower foreign-exchange swap activity in our treasury function. The sequential decline was also impacted by lower client volumes.","Other non-interest income was $64 million in the first quarter, down 16% compared to one year ago and down 15% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower security commissions and trading income, higher Visa-related swap expense and lower miscellaneous income. The sequential decline was due to a leasing gain recognized in the prior quarter, as well as higher Visa-related swap expense.","Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $430 million in the first quarter, increasing 9% year-over-year, and flat sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $535 million in the first quarter and were down 2% year-over-year and flat on a sequential basis. The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fee growth by approximately 2%.","Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fee, were $375 million, and essentially flat on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business, partially offset by both unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation. On a sequential basis, the impact of lower markets was mostly offset by new and favorable currency translation.","Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.2 trillion at quarter end, up 1% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. The sequential performance was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter\u2019s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $104 million in the first quarter were down 5% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the impacts of unfavorable markets. On a sequential basis, the impact of lower markets was partially offset by new business.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $868 billion, down 1% year-over-year, and up 10% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower period-end securities lending collateral, mostly offset by favorable markets and new business. The sequential growth was driven by favorable markets, higher period-end securities lending collateral and new business. Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, down 13% year-over-year, but up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower volumes, while the sequential performance reflected slightly higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $165 billion at quarter-end and averaged $158 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels declined 14% year-over-year and were flat sequentially.","Moving to our wealth management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $394 million in the first quarter and were flat compared to the prior year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance reflected the impact of new business, offset by the impact of lower markets. On a sequential basis, the impact of lower markets was mostly offset by new business. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $294 billion at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially.","Moving to page six. Net interest income was $430 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $111 billion in the first quarter, down 4% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $91 billion and were down 7% year-over-year. Interest-bearing deposits declined 3% from one year ago to $74 billion. Non-interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $18 billion during the quarter, were down 19% from year ago. Loan balances averaged $31 billion in the first quarter and were down 4% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.58% in the first quarter and was up 20 basis points from year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates and a balance sheet mixed shift.","On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was flat. Average earning assets declined 1% on a sequential basis as deposit levels declined 2% from the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 6 basis points due to the favorable impact of higher short-term rates.","As we have discussed in our most recent quarters, we did continue to see the opportunity for foreign-exchange swap activity within our treasury function. This activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to Central Bank deposits, as we swap out of U.S. dollars, but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income. For this quarter, we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of $13 million, offset by $10 million less in net interest income.","Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet. For the first quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposit. This is equal to one year ago and down from 70% in the current quarter.","Turning to page seven. Expenses were $1 billion in the first quarter and were 3% higher than the prior year and up 1% sequentially. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $12.3 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. For comparison purposes, note that the prior year and prior quarter included 8.6 and $5.7 million in severance and other related charges, respectively. Excluding the called out charges, expense for the current quarter was up 3% from one year ago.","With respect to the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, the following items were key drivers within the categories. Compensation was higher, primarily driven by base pay adjustments within salaries, which were effective in April of 2018. The impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Employee benefits were lower compared to last year, primarily due to lower medical expense as well as lower retirement plan costs. Outside service costs were higher, driven by increased technical services and higher levels of legal and consulting costs, partially offset by lower third-party advisor fees and lower sub custodian expense.","Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year, mainly due to higher software-related spend. Other operating expenses were up for the prior year due to higher staff-related business promotion and other miscellaneous expenses, partially offset by lower FDIC expense.","Shifting to the sequential expense view, including the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter.","Compensation expense increased, primarily reflecting the higher expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive comp -- compensation due to the vesting provisions associated with grants to retirement eligible employees in the current quarter. This quarter's compensation included $30 million in expense associated with retirement eligible staff. It is worth noting, due to changes in service requirements associated with performance share compensation, there will no longer be an additional component of the retirement eligible expense impacting the second quarter, as we have seen occur over the previous two years.","Employee benefits declined sequentially, primarily due to lower medical and retirement plan costs, partially offset by higher payroll tax withholding. Outside services declined sequentially due to lower third-party advisor fees and consulting costs. The sequential decline in equipment and software costs was primarily due to a prior quarter software related charge. Other operating expense declined $16 million from the prior period, driven by lower business promotional expense, as well as lower sequential costs associated with account servicing activities, and other miscellaneous expenses.","Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. With staff growth was all attributable to staffing increases in lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona, partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations.","Turning to page eight. As we have discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative, we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. We continue to embed a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our first quarter results reflect approximately $45 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately 3 points. This would equate to just under $180 million on an annualized basis, against the $250 million goal. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities.","Turning to page nine, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expense to fees is particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. While this quarter's ratio of 111 does demonstrate the impact that macro environment, particularly lower equity markets can have, we remain focused on continuing to drive organic growth in our business and managing our expense to improve our efficiency and productivity. When we look at our results for this quarter, absent the market impacts, we would say that our expense to fee ratio was comparable to where we were tracking in the most recent quarters.","Turning to page 10. Our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.5% under the advanced approach and 13% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio of the corporation was 7.2% and at the bank was 6.6%, both of which exceeded the 3% requirement that became applicable in Northern Trust effective at the start of 2018. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the applicable 100% minimum requirement.","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.60, representing a 9% sequential increase and a 43% increase on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, we also purchased -- repurchased more than 2.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $257 million.","In closing, despite the challenging backdrop from the impact of lagged equity markets and flatter interest rates, our performance during the quarter was resilient, generating return on average common equity of 14%. Our balanced business model continued to generate organic growth with each of our client-facing reporting segments of C&IS and wealth management contributing approximately 50% of our earnings. We are confident in our competitive positioning within attractive markets and our ability to continue to generate organic growth. Our focus remains on providing our clients with exceptional services, improving our productivity and driving profitable growth.","Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call a bit earlier than in other quarters to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10.30 am Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Kerry, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for the updates. I just wanted to understand, as you are thinking through the operating leverage that you delivered on this quarter, was there anything unusual in the expense line? I know you called out a couple of items, but then, the follow-on is, as you're thinking through 2Q and 3Q, can we expect the same kind of run rate that you delivered in 1Q?","Mark Bette","So, other than the charges that we called out in the expense lines, I would say, it was pretty much expenses as normal. So, pretty much core run rate in our expenses. We did have a higher retirement eligible impact in compensation of $30 million in the first quarter, but some of the other spend, like business promo is sometimes a little bit lower in the first quarter too, but pretty clean.","Biff Bowman","Yes. And we have the compensation expense in every first quarter, which you can see a flow through, but the rest of the other line items, I think, were pretty much as reported.","Betsy Graseck","I know you don\u2019t give guidance specifically, I'm not asking for that. I\u2019m just wondering the run rate that you're exceeding in 1Q, do you think that that kind of pace is something you can continue with or is there any kind of investment spend that you\u2019d be ramping up on the back of a slower 1Q?","Biff Bowman","We continue to focus on our value for spend initiatives and to try to drive our expense base as hard as we can, but we also are growing, as you could see and when you strip out the impacts of markets, it was pretty good underlying growth again in the quarter. So, there is some expense that comes with supporting that growth. But I would say, in general, we think that the trajectory you saw here is something that we're going to -- is a decent run rate and that we're going to continue to try to improve it with our value for spend initiatives, but I think it\u2019s a pretty good run rate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","I know you guys don't give guidance obviously, but I was hoping we can talk through some of the NIR dynamics as a jumping off point from here. So, I guess, one, non-interest bearing deposits down a little bit over $1 billion. I think that you talked about in the past, you thought that kind of the excess number was sort of in that $1 billion range. So, should we be thinking of that being sort of down or do you guys think there's more to go. And broadly speaking, is there anything you guys can do from a firm-specific, idiosyncratic perspective to protect the level of NIR from here or is this pretty much peak NIR for you guys. ","Biff Bowman","So, let me walk through without providing guidance, the way we're thinking about it. The first, Alex, is the volume of the balance sheet. And the thing we feel we can control most on the volume is through the continued organic growth in our custody business primarily, our AUC, which produces that growth in the balance sheet. And we\u2019ve had pretty good results there, and we think we can continue to do that that the balance sheet should continue to grow with that inherent growth that we talk about in our custody business. As it relates to non-interest-bearing deposits that you talked about in this quarter, and we talked in the past about that pool of couple billion, I think we\u2019ve used, is that of that runoff in non-interest-bearing deposits this quarter, half of it was from one client. So, we still do have some sizable, lumpy type deposits that could be yield-seeking. But, we think it's inside the bucket that we\u2019ve told you in the past, the 1 billion to 2 billion in the noninterest bearing.","So, we can control the volume. The second part of the forward look, if you will, without guidance is the mix. What we\u2019ve seen in the mix of the balance sheet is, we have seen interest-bearing deposits move from about 78% of the balance sheet to 80%. So, that\u2019s a trend. I think that's a trend that we see in our industry amongst our competitors. And I think that\u2019s a market dynamic. So, I'm not sure how much is controllable there, but we continue to look at that.","And then, the last piece that we still focus on is the spread or the yield that we can get from that. And I will break that a little bit apart on the asset side. Look, we\u2019re still asset sensitive as a firm. And so, if rates sort of flatten out from here, there is still the ability to have assets reprice higher for us. So, that is a positive based on where we are. But then, the liability side, the deposit beta and the pricing in the market is something we have to watch from a competitive dynamic. And I think, we've been disciplined and we have a good process to watch that. And if we think it flattens out from here with no rate movements on the horizon, then there might still be the ability to grind up a little bit on the NIM over time. That's where we are. There's a lot of ifs in there but we\u2019re -- if the pricing and the competitive landscape holds stead, we still think we could see a grind up on the NIM.","Alex Blostein","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then my second question around is just the core fees. I mean, it looks like custody and admin fees in particular came in quite strong relative to a challenging exit as of the end of last year. I know you guys highlighted new business, so maybe expand on that a little bit, was this a quarter of outsized new business wins that sort of drove fees where we ended up obviously being for the quarter, without obviously naming clients but maybe you can just help us kind of characterize where some of that business is coming from?","Biff Bowman","Yes. We continue to see a strong pipeline across both of our businesses, both C&IS and wealth, and both produced, particularly versus first quarter of the previous year, strong performances. In fact, our C&IS business produced a much -- a really strong year-over-year comparison to the first quarter of last year on the new business front. And we continue to see a broad range of wins, both geographically, product line client types in both sides. In fact, on the wealth side, our organic growth rate was at the higher end of the range as we talked about as well in the first quarter. So, pretty strong new business momentum and then obviously the markets and others in the first quarter came back and we have obviously some lagged impacts, but we also have some month lagged impacts and so we saw the benefit of rising markets. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Biff, maybe just on the expenses. Given that you are already at the 180, the 250, how should we be thinking about timing? I think, you guys said through 2020, but are there any initiatives in place that we should see some steps along the way as we get into 2020?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, we've said the 250, we\u2019re continuing to push forward on that and making good progress, as you can see. What I would say is, is that we're trying to build in the DNA and the culture here is, is that ongoing expense savings has to be a part of our regular routine. So, while we've got a program defined its $250 million, we also know that we have to embed culturally the ability to go in there and create economic savings from an expense standpoint on a longer term basis than just 2020. We've got a program, we\u2019ll define it by 2020. But that discipline of taking some of the inflationary pressures out of our business through strong expense initiatives is embedding and we can see it and it's becoming part of the culture. So, we will continue to attract to the 250 that we've told you about, but I think more importantly is embedding that discipline for forward-looking years beyond 2020.","Michael Carrier","Okay. And then, just on the follow-up on the last question in terms of the organic growth and even the fees, you tend to hold up or continue to hold up better than some of the peers out there. And maybe if you can just provide some color on -- some of the wins that you're seeing, maybe whether it's like asset mix, the client mix, just trying to get some color particularly on the C&IS, and how much from like a competitive fee standpoint are you seeing versus maybe the mix, the product that continues to maybe hold up better than the industry?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, let me pull it apart a little bit on the C&IS side. I would say, first, let's take some regional. We've seen strong growth in our Australia market where we\u2019ve moved up near the top portion of the league tables. I was just talking with Pete Cherecwich before I came in. So, we're near the top of the league charge there in our growth from a graphical perspective there. Luxembourg is another area with the UBS acquisition and other new business. Where we\u2019ve seen outside geographic growth that\u2019s organic, that's strong in the client type, I would say, let me highlight two. We continue to do very well with hedge funds. Our acquisition and hedge fund services has allowed us to grow. I think last year, we cited and continue to see wins in the hedge fund space. I think we had the largest hedge fund launch that was launched last year, is a Northern Trust client, we had a press release on that. But we\u2019ve also been very well in the foundation and endowment space as another example. And we\u2019ve got what I would say is a product and a capability there, front office solution for what I will say a large in-house pools of money, which is commonly or typically done in a foundation endowment.","So, that\u2019s two examples of a client type and a geography where I think we\u2019re seeing outsized growth. We\u2019ve got more than those, we can highlight, but we just have a strong performance right now in the growth. In terms of the second part of your question and the competitive nature of the pricing, look, this is a competitive business. I\u2019ve been at the bank 34 years, it\u2019s been a competitive business for 34 years. I would say that we haven't seen it at least in our client mix, the outsized versus normal, which we would typically see somewhere 1.5% to 2% type of fee pressures, which we assume in our organic growth rate, we have to overcome that. We\u2019ve still seen that. And I think that in our client mix, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen. I don't know that it's been higher than that right now but it\u2019s also not lower and it\u2019s pretty constant.","Operator","Your next question will be from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.","Steven Chubak","I just wanted to unpack some of the remarks around the NII commentary and recognizing it's not guidance. But I was hoping you could speak to your appetite to the extended duration of the balance sheet, given some concern as the next move could be a Fed easing cycle, and how we should think about against that backdrop, maybe what the deposit trajectory could look like over the coming quarters, if we're in a flat rate environment?","Biff Bowman","What we say typically here is, is that we have a process where we go through and look at our own internal projections for interest rates and then we make decisions on how to position the balance sheet. I think, it's fair to say that in the previous quarters, we\u2019ve had some of the interest rate projections that I think are now being held more widely, and we have extended the duration in particularly the long-term portion of our securities portfolio. So, we have that thought process and we do take actions when we see that. So, that provides some protection against that down rate scenario.","What I would also say is that if it behaves as normal, the deposit betas on a down rate cycle are typically pretty fast and pretty high, and we would anticipate that being the case here too. So, depending on just how that rate curve move happens and shifts, we could protect some of that spread in margin in a down rate scenario, plus with some of the actions we've taken on our asset sensitivity by adding the duration. So, we have contemplated that. I think we've got a lot of news from our investment management firm and our own Chief Economist that have used on the rate trajectories. And we take those all in and then make decisions on the overall Alco asset liability policy.","Steven Chubak","And just switching gears to the capital side, you guys continue to run with best-in-class capital ratios. I know you try to avoid deviating from some of your peers and try to manage the similar capital targets through the cycle. Just given some commentary from some of your trust bank peers about increased confidence given some upcoming changes to our leverage ratio, as well as what appears to be maybe more a benign test in the coming exam, how you're thinking about your capital ask, and whether you have increased confidence in your ability to maybe raise your payout target a bit?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So, we\u2019re pleased to enter this cycle that we just submitted here in April from a position of real strength, as you could see from our ratio, and the flexibility that that gives us entering that period of time. The SLR was not a binding constrain for us. So, that change in definition, while we will take regulatory definitions that end up easing the ratio for us in that case, it wasn\u2019t a binding constraint. So, I pull back on that. What I would say is, in the quarter, I think we had a payout ratio of a 119% in the quarter that we cited. So, I think, in the environment we\u2019re in, we don't feel constrained with what we want to ask other than our own constraints, which are, do we have enough capital to support the growth we foresee in the business, do we have enough capital to withstand our own idiosyncratic stresses, do we have enough capital to support our clients\u2019 needs and wants? And I think the answer to that with where we are currently positioned is a pretty strong yes with the 13% CET1. So, again, we like the flexibility that gives us going into positive the review by our regulators.","Operator","Our next question will be from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","So, the C&IS fee rate was -- saw a bit of a bounce here this quarter, and I know this is an imperfect way to model your servicing revenues, but it's the best we've got. So, could you maybe help us -- I know that you've flagged new business wins this quarter. And so, I'm guessing that contributed to some of that servicing fee rate improvement. Is that right? And then, were there other factors? Can you just helps us sort of level set, given that this is the way most of us model your servicing revs and how to think about that line from here?","Mark Bette","Hi, Brennan. It\u2019s Mark. I would say, as we look at the asset servicing fees on a sequential basis, there was certainly the market drag mainly from both month lag and quarter lag. We\u2019re probably looking at about 2 to 2.5% drag from markets. And then currencies were actually modestly better, but very little. So, really the new business that we saw on the fees side, would have been offsetting that because the fees were basically flat during the quarter. So, pretty strong on the new business side. I mean, it does become a function of business that we're adding. And I would say that we're going to look at the mix of business that we\u2019re adding these days. We probably are from a fee bid rate perspective, that new business is probably coming on at a higher level than what a traditional custody would be, for instance. And some of the moves that we\u2019ve seen, large moves on a year-over-year basis where there has been -- we talked about one transition last quarter would have been at a lower bid rate than what we're hitting segment, we\u2019re bringing on new global fund servicing business. So, it kind of comes back to the mix of what\u2019s coming on and then how the point in time assets look versus the fees that you kind of earned, kind of as you go through the quarter.","Brennan Hawken","Okay. That makes a lot of sense, Mark. Thank you. And then the next one is on NII and some of the comments that you\u2019ve made here so far. And this is sort of a cleanup, so I\u2019m kind of dumping a couple of cleanups in here into one. When we think about -- I think you said that there was one large outflow with the noninterest bearing that you still think non-operating is one to two. So, was some of the outflow from the non-operating? And just so we can kind of think about that or was this more competitive pressure? And then, given the fact that you still think and NIM can grind higher and your deposit can grow, that seems to suggest that you guys feel pretty good about NII growth from 1Q as a starting point. Is that fair? Do we need to be concerned upward pressure on deposit costs?","Biff Bowman","Let me take the second question first on the upward pressure. That is a competitive dynamic. I think, we feel that we have stayed abreast of the market and that we have competitive pricing in the institutional space today. But, we have to observe the market, and I mean that -- as you know there is sort of very public -- our clients probably are aware of the market pricing from a relatively small number of competitors, and so that pricing is pretty transparent, particularly on the institutional side. So, we\u2019ll remain competitive is all I can say. And there is not upward pressure from others than I think on the deposit pricing there. And the first question was on the...","Mark Bette","On the decline in noninterest bearing. And on that it -- I mean, this was a situation where our client was seeking other yield enhancements on that money. But, I would also add that of the decline, so call that half the decline, there was also decline that we saw about a third of the decline was not in U.S dollar currencies, it was actually in non-major currency around the world. So, those were probably just more transactional frictions that those clients have moving through the system, not necessarily an indicator of future trend because that wasn\u2019t part of some of what U.S. dollar looking for higher yield.","Operator","Next question will be from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. ","Brian Bedell","Maybe just go back to the -- to your organic growth trend, so just especially in the custody and fund admin business, it looks like we should have a decent tailwind coming into the second quarter, both on a markets basis, but also if you could just comment on the cadence of organic growth. It looks, like you said, very strong, if that came in during the quarter. So, we also have a little bit of a fee tailwind from that. And then, to add on to that, maybe if you can talk about your front to back office integration, the open architecture approach. I know it\u2019s counter to State Street. I think you have the partnership with Bloomberg. I guess, how new is that effort and should be expect that to be something that can enhance your organic growth of return?","Mark Bette","Sure. Let me do the organic growth part first. I\u2019m going to split the businesses apart here if I could real quick. Yes, we saw -- we've talked as a firm of the range that we\u2019re comfortable with from an organic growth perspective. In any given quarter we could be in that range, slightly lower or slightly higher. But then, our businesses themselves could have different trajectories as well. Our wealth business, as I said, actually I think saw organic trajectory at a higher end of its historical range, but that's lower than what we talked to you about target, it's a slightly lower organic growth business.","And our C&IS business, if you exclude securities lending, which is heavily capital markets influenced, also was in the range that we talked about for that business from an organic growth standpoint. It's hard to ignore the security lending and asset management businesses. But, when -- if you peel those out, we were in the organic kind of growth rate from a pure asset servicing business that we\u2019ve seen. So, that was a strength there.","In terms of the value chain or the -- our positioning, what I would say is we don't believe we have to own every piece of the value chain. An example is an OMS, an Order Management System. I think it\u2019s our goal is to allow our clients to access our technology and allow them to communicate and process their trades in an efficient manner. It's a competitive landscape in the OMS space and there are some very good providers out there. So, we think being able to partner and to integrate with those vendors is very important. We do have a relationship, as we highlighted in our press release at the end of March, with Bloomberg where we\u2019re doing just that. But, that's an example of a very important vendor in the space that we've struck-up a strategic partnership with and can bring that to bear. So, I would say at the end of the day we believe very much that we don't have to bring every piece of that component of the value chain and own it all the way through that we can partner with some best-in-class providers in different spaces and they can work.","Brian Bedell","And then, just maybe just one on expense growth, looking at year-over-year basis. If I'm measuring this right, it looks like about 3% to 3.5%, which would be tracking below your organic -- I believe and correct me if I am wrong but maybe slightly below your organic growth rate on a year-over-year basis. So, is that mostly due to the value for spend program coming through, so you try to match that expense growth? I know it can't be every quarter, but generally sounds like you're tracking very well against that goal.","Biff Bowman","So, what I would say is, in all transparency and candor, that growth rate is a little higher than that on an organic basis because we had some currency benefits of, call it 4.5 type of a growth rate, which is in the range of where we talked about our organic fee growth rate. So, I think they\u2019re reasonably well-aligned. We\u2019d like to get that organic growth rate and the expenses down a little lower. So, we created leverage to what we talked about. But in fully transparency, the reported number has some currency benefit in it. Obviously, fees have some currency drag equal and offsetting to that. But we would have probably pinned it somewhere in the 4.5 type range from the quarter on an organic expense growth rate.","Operator","Next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Jim Mitchell","Maybe just a follow-up on wealth management. You noted that the high end of the organic growth range, I know you\u2019ve been investing there to try to accelerate organic growth. Is that sort of early evidence that you\u2019re getting access and maybe just talk a little bit more broadly about what you're doing to drive that organic growth there and what you think the traction is so far?","Biff Bowman","So, I would take a couple of components to that one. I think, the technology that, the Goals Powered Solutions and the approach to the holistic advice and the goals-driven wealth management has really resonated with our clients. We\u2019ve really seen that we have differentiated in the market and we\u2019ve been told that consistently by our clients and other centers of influence that influence the wealthy individuals that we have a differentiated technology to bring to bear for people. So, I think that's been really successful.","And the other thing I would say is -- we\u2019ve done a good job of attracting clients in what I will call our virtual markets. As you know, we've got physical offices in about 60 locations in most of the wealth centers around the country. But, there are other cities where we don't have necessarily physical presence. And we\u2019ve been able to create our call to virtual team type environment and really penetrate some, I don\u2019t want to say secondary cities but cities that mark in the major metropolitan wealth centers but still have significant wealth, without having to put physical footprint in. It\u2019s been a really successful strategy. That\u2019s two examples of really strong growth that are I think pushing us up towards a pretty significant organic growth rate relative to the industry and wealth management.","Jim Mitchell","That\u2019s help and maybe one another question on deposit betas. It seems like this quarter, at least on aggregate level, your deposit beta was -- has actually slowed versus the last three or four quarters. I think some of your peers are mentioning accelerating deposit betas and high competitions. So just trying to get a sense of maybe the difference that you are seeing, are you seeing that competitive pressure on deposit rates? It doesn\u2019t look like it. Just maybe talk to the deposit beta this quarter and where you think if anything should change going into 2Q.","Biff Bowman","Yes. I caution you to look at one quarter\u2019s beta. We could be catching up, slowing down from previous moves that we\u2019ve made. I think if you go back and look at our beta across the cycle, you can start with the rate cycles as the hikes and go back to 2016, if you want to go back, our beta will look much more like you would expect across a longer horizon. So, I think it's a little bit dangerous to only look at it for one quarter because like I said, we\u2019re going to slow because we were comfortable with our positioning in a quarter or [technical difficulty] about 75ish probably percent beta and then lower than that obviously on the retail.","Jim Mitchell","Thanks. I think my phone got cut out for half of your response. I\u2019ll follow up later. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will be from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Just a couple of quick follow-ups or clean-ups I guess. Biff, you mentioned earlier that the second quarter won't have the same stock-based compensation that the year ago quarter had. Can you just tell us then again what was the magnitude of that a year-ago, and so what -- how much will be absent this year relative to what was in last year?","Mark Bette","I guess, Mark, we are having some audio difficulty on our end. And hopefully what we\u2019re saying is coming through. But yes, you are right, the last couple of years, I remember there was extra expense that came through in the second quarter from a retirement eligible [technical difficulty]. Last year it was $11 million in the second quarter, so we had 32 in the first, 11 in the second just a year ago. This year, we had 30 in the first, but there will not be further retirement eligible stock expense that would impact the second quarter because of the changes in the service requirements were around the performance shares. So, $11 million was in the second quarter of last year but this year, we would not have that. ","Ken Usdin","Got it. That's a nice year-over-year starting point helper. And then second one on the deposits. Biff, you mentioned that the customer-related deposits should be growing with the growth of the business but obviously the balance sheet has been net shrinking because again of that removal of liquidity. But, has the core deposits been growing underneath the surface and how can you help us like to understand the inflows versus outflows in terms of, trying to guess an estimate when that total earning asset base starts to bottom and turn the corner upwards?","Biff Bowman","So, the answer is, that\u2019s a core and it's hard to see in any of the financials we put out there. But, I would say, as a general statement, at the core, we have seen that core operating balances sort of flat now. It's hard to see, like you said, all of the liquidity moving on and off the balance sheet. So, it can be difficult to see. The other things I would say too is when we say that the new business that we win comes with balances, some of the new business wins we\u2019ve been having are administration in nature, and they don\u2019t always come with balance. So, mix of business we win matters too. Over time we tend to win a broad-based mix of business, some which comes with custody balances, some which comes with administration. I would say, we had more wins in the -- large wins in the administrative side that may or may not come with balances. It\u2019s one of the reasons you may see our AUC and AUCA a little bit flatter but revenue still going up and fees going up because the mix of that business is different that\u2019ll probably help the balances. So, you got the dynamic of the win mix matters and then you got the dynamic of the underlying balance sheet that has some, what I will call, the liquid flows or the excess balances moving around, if you\u2019ve seen that in [technical difficulty] core operating deposits continue to be pretty stable.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Brian Kleinhanzl and he is from [technical difficulty].","Brian Kleinhanzl","Couple of questions here. On the -- you mentioned you\u2019re taking a while bit more duration on securities portfolio. Can you actually give what the security duration is now and still how much is tied direct repricing on 30-day basis?","Biff Bowman","So, the duration of the portfolio has historically been closer to 1, and it\u2019s moved up by 30% or something like that. On the long end of the securities portfolio is longer than that, but the total portfolio has moved up by that 30 or so percent. And the second part of your question broke up. I apologize. Can you repeat that?","Mark Bette","I think [technical difficulty] the exposure of the 30 days within [technical difficulty].","Brian Kleinhanzl","Yes, how much reprices in the next 30?","Mark Bette","Yes. On the securities side, the short end of the -- I should say, [technical difficulty] little bit more than half of the shorter portfolio, and there we would say a lot of that would be driven by the one month, three months type of LIBOR moves with a little bit more weight toward the month side. So, it does -- that part of the security does reprice pretty quickly. When you get to the longer portfolio, obviously not all that is going roll over in one quarter or even one year. That\u2019s kind of over the course of -- if for instance if you\u2019re seeing on average two years security [technical difficulty] roll over every quarter. That\u2019s not to think where we\u2019re at. But, that\u2019s just an example of what you would have and you\u2019re sitting with a two-year book when you look at the longer portfolio. Does that help [technical difficulty].","Brian Kleinhanzl","It does. And then, just a second quick follow-up on the deposit runoff. I think, in the past you said that you\u2019ve been able to captured as much as two-thirds of those deposits. Is that still -- is it now -- that\u2019s still true or is it, a lot of that deposit run-off just running away from you in total?","Mark Bette","I think we said we captured, about half of it could move into a money fund and then a half would go either to some other vehicle at Northern and investment vehicle somewhere else or would lead. I don\u2019t know that I know if that\u2019s changed dramatically from what we\u2019ve seen. So, I think it is still -- we\u2019ve seen growth in our cash funds as you can see, particularly on the institutional side but we saw growth in our cash funds. So, there is clearly some with this move in the cash funds from the [technical difficulty] and we will typically look on [technical difficulty] options for clients. And so, sometimes the balance sheet is a right fit, sometimes the cash. But, we\u2019ve been able to capture [technical difficulty] within the Company.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks. ","Mark Bette","Thank you for joining us for the first quarter call. And we\u2019ll look forward to talking to you again in July. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conclude today's teleconference.

I urge you to read our 2012 annual report and our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about the factors that could affect actual results.","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Mike O'grady.","Michael G. O'grady","Thank you, Bev. I also welcome you to Northern Trust's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We've organized today's call into 4 sections. I'll review both our fourth quarter and full year results, update you on Driving Performance and comment on our capital. Bev and I will then be pleased to answer your questions.","Starting with some overview comments on Slide 2. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.69 and a return on equity of 8.8%. This quarter closed the year of solid performance for the company. We achieved robust growth in both our personal and institutional businesses and improved our profitability against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment. Full year earnings per share of $2.81 and a return on equity of 9.3% were both higher than last year.","New business was excellent in the quarter and for the full year, increasing client asset levels and trust fees. The growth in clients is broad and diversified across our businesses, services and geographies. In our institutional business, for example, just last week, we announced that Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge fund managers, appointed Northern Trust to independently replicate certain middle and back-office services for their approximately $140 billion in assets under management. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we finalized the implementation of our investment operations outsourcing relationship with Australia's Queensland Investment Corporation or QIC, capping off an on-boarding process that was first announced in March of 2011.","The fourth quarter was also strong for our personal business as we were well-positioned to provide Wealth Management and Asset Management solutions to new and existing clients that address the uncertainties presented by the changing tax and investment environment. Winning mandates such as these from new and existing clients is the primary driver of growth for Northern Trust over time.","The macro environment continued to pose mixed operating conditions. Equity markets in the U.S. and Europe were higher for the year, which supplemented our new business growth. Year-over-year, our client asset levels increased with assets under custody ending the year at $4.8 trillion, up 13%, and assets under management ending at $759 billion, up 14%. Client asset levels were also up 1% sequentially.","Currency volatility continued to deteriorate in the fourth quarter, negatively impacting our foreign exchange trading income for the quarter and the year. The low level of interest rates experienced throughout 2012 declined further in the fourth quarter. Low short-term rates pressure our net interest margin and result in ongoing fee waivers in connection with our money market mutual funds, although waivers declined in the quarter.","Finally, we successfully executed on the Driving Performance initiatives we announced a year ago, achieving in 2012 over half of the $250 million target we set for the end of 2013. Driving Performance, which is focused on fundamentally improving our productivity and profitability, also enhances our capacity for investment in future growth regardless of the macro environment. We made further progress on this critical priority in the fourth quarter and are on track for the current year.","Overall, although we are pleased with our performance in 2012, we are not satisfied with our returns and are focused on continuing to execute on our strategies in 2013.","Let's move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights for the fourth quarter. Earnings per share of $0.69 increased 30% year-over-year and were down 5% sequentially. We recorded restructuring and integration charges of $8.2 million in the fourth quarter compared with $61 million a year ago and $2.9 million last quarter. Excluding these charges and a Visa benefit of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, earnings per share increased 6% year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially.","On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 1% and expenses adjusted for charges in Visa were also up 1%. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues, increased a strong 15% due to new business and higher markets, but was offset by lower foreign exchange trading income and net interest income. The modest increase in adjusted expenses was primarily the result of investments in people and technology to support our growing business, offset by the benefits achieved through Driving Performance.","Year-over-year, our loan loss provision was lower as credit improved. Compared to last quarter, revenues were flat and expenses were up 6%. Trust investment and other servicing fees were up 3%, but again, this growth was offset by lower foreign exchange trading income, net interest income and other operating income. The 6% increase in expenses primarily reflects continued investments related to business growth, as well as certain expenses that tend to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. Our loan loss and tax provisions were lower in the fourth quarter sequentially. Our return on equity of 8.8% for the fourth quarter was higher than last year but lower than last quarter and below our long-term target range of 10% to 15%.","With that background and summary, let me get into more details behind our fourth quarter results, beginning on Page 4. Fourth quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were $979 million, up 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $623 million in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. New business and higher equity markets drove the increases.","Foreign exchange trading income was $41 million in the fourth quarter, down 43% compared with last year and down 7% with last quarter. The primary driver of foreign exchange trading income, currency volatility, continued to trend lower. As measured by an index of major currencies, volatility was lower by about 40% year-over-year and 14% sequentially.","Other operating income of $36 million for the quarter was down 6% year-over-year and 24% sequentially. In the sequential quarter comparison, recall that other operating income in the third quarter included a $5.3 million gain related to hedges of certain investments in our foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries. The sequential quarter decline also reflects lower income on certain employee benefit plan assets held in trust and lower leasing-related income.","Net interest income of $244 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, was due primarily to lower net interest margin.","Moving to Page 5. Let's look at the components of our fee revenues. For our institutional business, C&IS fees totaled $344 million in the fourth quarter, which was up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Let me explain some of the key drivers behind this performance. Given that some of our custody and investment management fees are calculated based on a quarter-like methodology, higher third quarter markets with both the S&P 500 and the EAFE up 6% supported fourth quarter fee growth. Looking more closely at the components, custody and fund administration fees for C&IS were $225 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of new business and higher equity markets. In the sequential quarter comparison, new business, higher third quarter equity markets and sub custodian recoveries all contributed to growth.","Investment management fees for C&IS were $74 million in the fourth quarter, up 22% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, new business and higher markets drove the increase. The sequential quarter increase reflects new business, primarily in index, fixed income and mutual fund management. Waived fees associated with institutional money market mutual funds and impacting C&IS declined from $12 million in last year's fourth quarter to approximately $6 million this quarter and were down about $1 million sequentially. Lower fee waivers primarily reflect higher gross yields achieved in the underlying funds.","Securities lending fees were $20 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher spreads. The sequential quarter decline reflects lower spreads and volumes. Securities lending collateral of $88 billion decreased 7% versus last year and 10% sequentially. C&IS assets under custody were $4.4 trillion at year-end, up 12% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, while C&IS assets under management were $561 billion at year-end, up 15% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The sequential decline reflects the reduction in securities lending collateral that I mentioned earlier. We continue to be pleased with the pace of new business in C&IS, with their results in the year being our best ever.","Moving to our personal business. PFS, trust, investment and other servicing fees were a record $278 million in the fourth quarter, up 18% year-over-year and 4% on a sequential quarter basis. The 18% year-over-year increase reflects strong new business, higher month lag equity markets, lower fee waivers and the impact of the January 1, 2012 change in our fee structure. The 4% sequential quarter increase primarily reflects the impact of higher markets and new business.","Money market funds fee waivers in PFS were approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter, down $1 million from the third quarter. Waivers in PFS were down significantly from $21 million in the year-earlier quarter, reflecting higher gross yields achieved in the underlying funds and a lower fee rate in our retail money market family, which was effective on January 1, 2012.","PFS assets under management were $198 billion at year-end, up 14% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, in both cases, reflecting higher equity markets and new business. The sequential quarter increase primarily reflects higher levels in our money market mutual funds.","Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $244 million in the fourth quarter, down 13% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Earning assets averaged $83 billion in the quarter, down 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower deposits with the Federal Reserve. The mix of earning assets remained relatively constant.","The net interest margin of 1.17% in the fourth quarter, both the prior year and prior quarter, included adjustments that benefited net interest income as shown on Page 6. Absent those adjustments, the fourth quarter's net interest margin declined 8 basis points year-over-year and 2 basis points sequentially. The lower margin reflects lower yields across earning asset categories as interest rates continued to decline. For example, 3-month LIBOR declined approximately 11 basis points sequentially to average 32 basis points in the fourth quarter. By earning asset category, the yield on interest-bearing deposits at banks declined 12 basis points sequentially due to lower short-term rates, with the biggest impact being a decline in overnight rates in the Australian dollar of over 30 basis points. The yield on the securities portfolio also declined 12 basis points, although the yield would have been essentially flat absent last year's amortization adjustment. And the overall yield on the loan portfolio declined by 12 basis points as some of our loans are linked to LIBOR, and new loans and leases are coming on our balance sheet at lower yields than those rolling off. These declines in earning asset yields were partially offset by a slightly lower cost of funds.","Now let's look at fourth quarter expenses on Page 7. On a reported basis, expenses decreased 4% year-over-year and increased 6% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, and as shown in the slide, we recorded restructuring and integration charges in each of the periods. Excluding these charges and the Visa item last year, adjusted expenses increased only 1% year-over-year as we saw the benefits of Driving Performance, including closely managing staff costs, our largest expense.","Versus last quarter, increases in expenses primarily reflect the costs and investments necessary to generate and support our business growth, as well as certain expenses that tend to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. As I discussed earlier, we are winning mandates and bringing on new substantial clients. Marketing to and winning these new clients, as well as transitioning them onto our platform, are long- and resource-intensive efforts. For example, in the fourth quarter, our Global Fund Services business was particularly successful and active in both finalizing terms of new client relationships, such as Bridgewater, and on-boarding several new clients such as QIC, which resulted in higher costs in the quarter but will produce much higher revenue in the future. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we incurred higher marketing and promotion expenses related to the launch of 6 new FlexShares ETFs. We believe these new ETFs will continue FlexShares' growth and assets under management, which exceeded $2 billion at year-end.","Looking at specific line items, compensation expense and related staff count were both essentially flat sequentially. Employee benefit expense increased 4%, primarily due to higher medical expense. Outside services expenses were down compared to last year but increased 11% sequentially due to higher costs for contracted services related to the increased new business activity I mentioned and sub custodian expense, which tends to be higher in the fourth quarter and is captured through higher revenue as well. Equipment software expenses were higher by 5% sequentially, reflecting depreciation and amortization of technology investments. Occupancy expense was relatively flat when adjusted for charges associated with certain office closings.","Other operating expense, after adjusting for charges, increased $7 million over last year and $17 million over last quarter. The sequential increase related to several areas such as the business promotions expenses I previously mentioned, losses associated with account servicing activities and staff relocation costs were also higher in the quarter.","Overall, although our expense base does fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter for various reasons, it generally tracks with the longer-term trend of our fee revenues. Given the continued success we've had in adding new clients, our objective is to grow our expenses at a lower rate than the growth rate of our fee revenues. We were successful in achieving this for 2012 as we had trust, investment and other fee growth of 11% and adjusted expense growth of 4%. By continually reducing the ratio of our expenses to our fee revenues, we better position the company's profitability in varying operating environments.","Turning to the full year. Our results for 2012 are summarized on Page 8. Net income was $687 million, and earnings per share were $2.81, both up 14% compared with 2011. We achieved our return on equity of the year -- for the year of 9.3%, better than last year and moving toward our target range of 10% to 15%.","Full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on Page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew a strong 11% in 2012, better than the 4% growth achieved in 2011, reflecting new business and equity markets. This growth was offset by a 36% decline in foreign exchange trading income and a 2% decline in net interest income, resulting in 3% overall revenue growth. Reported expenses were 2% higher in 2012 than 2011. Excluding charges, expenses grew 4% year-over-year. Investments in people and technology were the primary drivers of the expense growth in 2012, however, the first year of our Driving Performance initiative had a meaningful impact on moderating the level of expense growth for the year.","Let's move to Page 10 to discuss Driving Performance a little more. In January, we indicated our goal to improve pretax income by $250 million by the end of 2013, with over half of the $250 million coming in 2012. In the fourth quarter, we produced approximately $50 million in pretax operating income improvement from Driving Performance initiatives. Increased benefits from revenue initiatives were similar to last quarter, primarily the result of successful pricing and cross-sell efforts in C&IS. On expenses, in the fourth quarter, we began to see the early impact of various initiatives that target improving the productivity of a number of end-to-end processes. This brings the 2012 benefit to approximately $160 million, split roughly 40-60 between revenue and expense items, which bolstered our pretax margin and return on equity by approximately 375 and 150 basis points, respectively. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of our Driving Performance effort and its contributions to our 2012 financial performance.","Based on the results achieved in 2012, we remain on track, if not ahead, of our 2013 target for Driving Performance. We believe that we will continue to successfully implement the initiatives already identified to enhance our revenue and improve our productivity and that we will continue to identify incremental initiatives to drive future performance.","Capital, outlined on Page 11, remained very strong, with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 12.8% and 12.4%, respectively. We estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III advance framework, as we currently understand the regulations, including the impact of the proposed rules issued by the Federal Reserve, would equal 13.1%, exceeding all anticipated requirements. In 2012, we paid $287 million in dividends, including an increase in our quarterly dividend earlier in the year to $0.30 per share.","Under the common stock repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors in March, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for $63 million during the fourth quarter. This brings our total repurchases for the year to 3.5 million shares for $163 million. Under our capital plan review without objection by the Federal Reserve last March, Northern Trust may repurchase up to an additional 77 million through the first quarter of 2013. We submitted our 2013 capital plan to our primary regulator last week and expect feedback in a time frame similar to last year.","I'd like to close with a few thoughts. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of Northern Trust partners and the support from our clients throughout the world, 2012 was a year of excellent progress across several fronts. We created value by executing our strategy and remaining true to our enduring principles. As we enter 2013, our core businesses, Wealth Management, Asset Management, Asset Servicing and Banking, are performing well and are positioned to continue to do so.","Certain aspects of the macro environment, which were difficult during the year, such as low interest rates and low volatility, are expected to persist through 2013. Although these factors will impact our financial performance, given we can't predict them, our objective is to anticipate them as best we can and then execute our strategy of growing our business by expanding existing client relationships and winning new ones, increasing our productivity in order to improve our profitability, deploying our capital efficiently to produce attractive returns and returning excess capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We believe this will generate long-term value for our clients, shareholders, partners and the communities we serve.","Thank you again for participating in the Northern Trust Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Christie, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Cynthia Mayer from Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess just a little bit on expenses. Within other bucket, it sounded like some was seasonal or onetime and some might repeat. I can see the 3.3, but within the rest, I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of what wouldn't repeat and what is maybe a step-up.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. Why don't I, on that, Cynthia, just step back a little bit, given that there are a number of items in other, and it's that category that went up sequentially. Our expenses fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter for various reasons, and we did see that in the fourth quarter. When you look year-over-year, expenses were only up 1%, but quarter-over-quarter, they were up 6%. Third quarter expenses often can be lower. Often just with the summer months, they're slower from an activity standpoint, whereas fourth quarter expenses can be higher, given that we just have much more activity at the end of the year, which we certainly did this year. Much of it across our businesses, as I talked about, some due to things that were different this year, like the fiscal cliff and other things that I think just happen every year where you try to get a lot done by the end of the year. This year, we definitely saw the change in outside services and other operating expenses. Outside services includes a number of expenses, but certain things like sub custodian costs and third-party advisor fees, which fluctuate throughout the year. And there's no real definitive seasonal pattern to those fluctuations, but they were higher in the fourth quarter. Other outside services, such as contracted, technical, legal and consulting services, are required to on-board new clients. I mentioned QIC, but there were some other large clients which we finished the on-boarding in the fourth quarter. And so we saw those expenses go higher. And then similarly, as you point out in other operating expense, you have various charges such as accounting service charges related to accounting service -- accounting -- excuse me, account servicing activities, and those also tend to fluctuate. And we're higher in the fourth quarter. And then the largest category within other is business promotion. This includes things like travel, marketing, advertising. And these activities were lower in the third quarter and then higher in the fourth quarter. Other also includes staff-related expenses, so things like expat costs and relocation costs, and those were higher in the fourth quarter. And to your point, not costs that, in our view, necessarily repeat each quarter. And then I would go on a little further to say that as we've discussed on the call in the past, and it's in our financial disclosures as well, there are several areas where in the first quarter, we see seasonal patterns as well. So if you recall, stock option expense is typically higher in the first quarter of each year just due to the requirement that we expense options that are granted to retirement eligible employees. FICA insurance is also usually higher in the first quarter. And then, as you know, we also have the Northern Trust open that is held in February, and that results in higher business promotion expense in the fourth quarter. And if you also just recall, looking at last year, our expenses in the first quarter of 2012, if you adjusted out the charges, were fairly close to what our expenses were in the fourth quarter of 2011. And that's also when we began the execution of Driving Performance. So we're beginning to see some of the benefits of Driving Performance. So hopefully that gives you a little context.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. That really anticipates what my next question was going to be, which was what carries into the first quarter. I guess -- actually, one more, which is on expenses, which is you have ongoing technology investments. And I'm just wondering what you consider a normalized growth rate for that on an annual basis.","Michael G. O'grady","There's no question that the technology costs for certain investments will continue going forward. That scenario, where in order to provide the services both on the personal side and the institutional side that not only that our clients demand but that our competitors are looking to provide as well, will require us to continue to make those investments. And as a result, the equipment and software line that you have there is one of the lines where we would expect that to continue to grow. Again, it's more than just the depreciation and amortization in that line. So there's not just a steady-state rate that will continue. There is some fluctuation, but for the most part, that's one where you saw approximately 6% growth in that line, both sequentially and year-over-year. And we expect that we'll continue to have growth in that line. And frankly, that's part of what we're doing with Driving Performance. It's not to say that we don't look at potential efficiencies and technology because we are. But given that we know we're going to have the growth in that expense category, we have to find other areas where we can find ways to reduce the rate of growth.","Operator","And we'll go to our next question from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just, I guess, a follow-up on expenses but maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question. When you guys think about the initiatives you put into place early part of last year or 2012, I guess, if the environment is probably tracking a little bit worse than you anticipated, so NII is down a couple of percent, FX down substantially, clearly, you're tracking, I guess, a little bit above, ahead of where you thought you'd be. So -- but if we continue in this kind of a malaise throughout 2013, and who knows what 2014 would look like, I guess, are there any other initiatives that you could consider to kind of keep driving the costs down from here?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. And you're right, Alex, that unfortunately, due to the environment, many of the gains that we made in Driving Performance essentially were taken away by lower FX and spread income. And with the environment at least at this point, looking that it's going to continue like that, the first priority is to make sure that we continue to execute on the set of initiatives that we have in place. And with that, as I pointed out and you just did as well, we are ahead of schedule on executing on that set of initiatives from a timing standpoint. So we got to the levels of savings and benefit faster than what we had originally laid them out for, that also if you look at some of them, we're a little bit above where we thought we would get, and some of them, we're a little bit below. And we will look to continue to execute on the remainder of those initiatives. And hopefully, we can get to that $250 million level sooner than what we expected. So that's the first part. The second part is, it's not a 2-year program and then we're done with it, but it's something that we're looking to continue going forward. So in 2013, we're executing on a number of those initiatives, but we're also looking to find additional initiatives that will help potentially later in 2013 but, more importantly, will be incremental in 2014 and beyond. And then the last thing I would say is, beyond just specific initiatives, what we're really trying to do with this is change the way that the corporation looks at productivity and that we just constantly look to improve our productivity. And doing that will beyond -- will be beyond just initiatives but also looking to just drive various metrics or measures of productivity so that this is a longer-term permanent change in our approach.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. Shifting gears a little bit. I want to touch base on the core business and specifically C&IS. You obviously mentioned the big Bridgewater mandate you guys won that, I guess, is going to fund some point in 2014. And without, I guess, getting in the weeds on specific client relationships, it feels like that part of the business post Omnium acquisition continues to do quite well. Should we -- how should we think about, I guess, those type of mandates, your pipeline for those type of mandates, and then more importantly, the fee rate and then maybe profitability on kind of this middle office hedge fund solutions business relative to your current C&IS mix of businesses?","Michael G. O'grady","Okay. A number of questions in there, but let me see if I can get them, Alex. As far as the growth in C&IS, yes, agreed it's been very strong in the last couple of years, certainly. And if just -- with looking at the growth that we've had in new business, the one thing I would add beyond just the rate is the breadth of the new business. So you pointed out the growth in Global Fund Services, which has been very healthy. But likewise, in 2012, we saw very good growth in our traditional business of working with pension plans and corporations, and we also saw very good growth in our investment management products and solutions with our institutional clients. So when I look at our net new business, it's somewhat equally distributed between those 3 broad categories. Now going specifically to hedge fund services, which you mentioned there, very successful year in winning mandates in that business. But you are correct in pointing out that the revenue impact from that is going to be seen more in 2013. So the pipeline is very strong for that business. And then Bridgewater, for example, is the beginnings of, I would call, the 2014 pipeline because that's when the revenues will begin to come online there. So healthy growth across the -- kind of across the businesses. And from a pipeline standpoint, you'll see that coming through in '13. As far as the fee levels and profitability, I will just say that each of these businesses has a fee structure that works for that client base and for that marketplace. So they price things very differently because the services -- and it's not just the individual services, but it's the collection or bundle of services being provided to a pension plan, maybe very different than what we provide to one of the hedge funds. For example, just with the hedge funds, it's primarily a admin fee, if you will, hedge fund administration fee, asset servicing fee. There's less with regard to custody balances and, therefore, net interest income. There's less with regard to foreign exchange at this point and things like that. So it's more around the fees. So hopefully that addressed it. But then I would say as far as profitability, certainly, with all of those businesses and all of those clients, we're looking to achieve the appropriate profitability for the company and for that group overall. And there is a rigorous process around that in order to make sure that business is appropriately priced.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then the last one for me. I'm just hoping you guys could dissect net interest income picture a little bit. So average balance is down, I guess, a little bit quarter-over-quarter, slightly different, I guess, what we've seen from other so far, given that the level of deposits has been, I guess, fairly healthy. And the ending balance, I guess, was a little bit higher than the average. So should we expect, I guess, the balance sheet to pick up a little bit or the average balance should pick up a little bit heading into the first quarter? And then the second part to that, Mike, I think you and I spoke in the past that there's a little more flexibility for you guys to kind of reinvest and maybe given the liquidity on the balance sheet, as well as the conservative position you have within your securities portfolio to do a little bit more to protect the net interest margin. Is that still the plan? Or should we think about reinvestments being kind of where they are today so the NIM could continue to kind of roll further down from here?","Michael G. O'grady","Again, a number of questions in there. Let me try to go through it. So as far as net interest income, on the asset side -- so our average earning asset is down a little bit in the quarter sequentially. And if you look at the categories, and again, for us, just 3 primary categories, the loans and leases, our securities portfolio and then the deposits with banks, each of those categories, relatively constant, where we saw the decrease was with our balances at the Fed, which -- that allows us to handle deposits as they come and go. As you pointed out, Alex, at the end of the year, our deposit levels and, therefore, our asset levels were a little bit higher. I would say we're at a little bit of a point of transition with regard to the size of the balance sheet. And what I mean by that is, with the fiscal cliff at the end of the year, we did see increased balances on the balance sheet. Having said that, now that we're past at least the first fiscal cliff and now we're dealing with other cliffs, we've seen further movement of those balances, often into just deploying them into different asset categories. The other factor, which I think is important, is at the end of the year, the TAG program or Transaction Account Guarantee program by the FDIC expired. So that was unlimited FDIC insurance on deposits. When that was put in place, we saw an inflow of deposits under our balance sheet, some very large, both personal and institutional deposit balances. And now we're seeing some level of diversification of those deposits on the part of our clients as opposed to concentration on any 1 institution. So there are inflows and outflows, I would say, with regard to the balance sheet. At this point, I don't necessarily see a significant directional move for the size of our balance sheet. With regard to NIM and margins, if I just go through the categories for you, looking at loans and leases first, we are at -- I think it was 2.73% in the quarter, which was down 12 basis points. As I mentioned, LIBOR was down 10 or 11 basis points in the quarter. A good portion of those loans are linked to LIBOR. So that's going to bring those yields down. And then also, with our mortgage portfolio and some of the other loan categories, as we put on new assets, which we've been talking about, if rates are lower than they're replacing mortgages that were at higher levels. Then the securities portfolio is at 91 basis points, which, if you exclude the 1 item from last quarter, is actually relatively flat with the previous quarter. And as you mentioned, Alex, one of the things that we've been trying to do is to maintain that yield, if you will, within the constraints of our asset and liability policies and the committee that executes that, but trying to maintain that yield as best we could. We did extend the duration on that portfolio a little bit during the quarter. And so we're reinvesting a little bit further out. The average duration now, the index duration, if you will, is a little bit over a year. So that's up. We were previously a little bit under a year on that. So we've been investing a little bit further out. But in doing so, just with where rates were in the quarter, that is at a rate that is below the average yield on the securities portfolio. And as much as we're trying to manage through that, to your point, Alex, there's only so much risk that we think is appropriate, whether that's interest rate risk or credit risk, that we're willing to take on in order to maintain that. And then finally, just with deposits with banks, that was, I think, at about 81 basis points, down 12 basis points. And as I mentioned, our deposits with Australian banks where the rate is much higher, the decline in yields was much greater. I think it was 30 basis points. And that accounts for about 9 of the 12 basis points. So other currencies were down for the remaining 3 basis points, and that's just where short-term rates are very low in the euro and other currencies. On the cost of funds, that was down about 5 basis points, so it helped a little bit. Most of that is due to the fact that we have Australian dollar deposits as well. So when the rates go down there, we get the benefit of that as well. So hopefully that gives you some picture. Obviously, much of it has to do with what the rate environment is and will be in the third quarter and in 2013.","Operator","And we'll go next to Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, you just spoke to some of the deposit dynamics but was hoping you could provide a bit more color on how your institutional and PFS clients behaved into the uncertainty created by the fiscal cliff and how that's maybe changed or not changed in recent weeks. I'm just trying to get a sense of level of re-risking and how you think that might sort of play through into fee yields and ultimately, fee revenues.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. Particularly, as you mentioned, Howard, on the PFS side, we did see an increase in activity with regard to our clients at the end of the year. But it was very much focused on dealing with the uncertainties of the I'll call it the tax and investment environment going forward and less about re-risking or de-risking per se. So high level of activity, whether that's because they were receiving special dividends or again for some of our larger clients, selling businesses, things like that, that had more of a tax impact, if you will, than an investment impact. We also saw when that happened, Howard, that some of their balances came on to our balance sheet as deposits. But also, we saw a pretty sizable increase for the quarter in our money market mutual funds with PFS. And that accounted for most of that sequential increase in our assets under management. So it was about getting those types of transactions done. I think now as we go into 2013, there's still a level of uncertainty as to how this is all going to play out, but it's less around executing transactions and changing the structures of their estate, things like that where we were very active and more now looking at the environment and whether they want to deploy some of those proceeds and distributions into different asset classes, be it higher risk or otherwise.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then, with respect to Driving Performance, what do the remainder of the expense savings exactly encapsulate? And looking back to when you announced the plan, would you say you're in reinvesting more in general than you originally thought given the new business momentum that you've noted a couple of times, Mike?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So on the first part, as far as the expenses, the incremental benefit that we're going to see in 2013 is mostly focused around what we call the either process optimization, if you recall that category, or it's often called end-to-end initiatives. So these are things that run across the institutions and in many ways are -- take longer to map out the plan and then to actually execute on that plan because it touches so many parts of the business. So many times I've talked about client administration, that's something that involves changing our processes and also changing the technology. And so, we saw very little benefit in 2012 from that, but expect to get a benefit from it in 2013. Another area, Howard, which is in that same category but I think is even easier to understand is in our procurement area where we made a number of changes in the way we approach procurement. In certain areas, it was easy to get the benefit upfront of what I would consider more of just purchasing leverage. But we think that there's still significant opportunity in that category and probably represents the biggest opportunity for us in 2013 as far as savings. So those are the types of things that are more of these end-to-end initiatives that are going to deliver the expense savings.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then, I wanted to get your latest thought, Mike, on -- your latest base case as to how you think about money market reform. We've now heard from the FSOC, and the SEC has some commentary from their commissioners. And then, within that, Schwab has proposed delineating between the institutional retail channels. And I'm curious, as a player in both, what you think about that proposal.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. As far as just reform, we, as you mentioned, are a significant participant in that market. And we have submitted our own comment letter to FSOC. And I would say that the summary of that letter is that we don't believe that any of the 3 alternatives that they put forward in and of themselves are the answer. But we do believe that there are components that, to the extent they head down that direction, are reforms, if you will, that could be beneficial. So the idea of a floating right NAV, for example, in the right context is something that we think can work for our clients, as well as the managers and providers of this. Where there are other components, such as holdbacks, which we just don't think will meet with client expectations for these types of vehicles. So we know it's going to continue to evolve. As we've said before, we're really trying to just make sure we're positioned for whatever the change is because, to the extent that a money market fund becomes less attractive for our clients, we want to make sure we can provide other alternatives for them, like deposits on the balance sheet or like other ultrashort vehicles. We did introduce in the fourth quarter I mentioned the 6 new ETFs. One of them is a very short duration product, so in many ways, it acts as an alternative for our money market fund. It has the equivalent of a floating rate NAV, if you will. So we're trying to make sure that we're going to be positioned to deal with the clients and have a view on the reforms that -- as to things that make sense and don't make sense. And at this point, as far as differentiating between channels, I don't necessarily have a comment on that. I guess we haven't really tried to think about trying to differentiate in the channels, but rather just trying to provide products and alternatives that will meet with the various needs.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then finally, on capital management. I realized it's always been a Northern's DNA to be conservative, but there's this growing gap of conservatism between now, 13% Tier 1 common and growing and where capital standards are ultimate landing. So I'm just curious, Mike, are you in a position yet where you feel comfortable asking for that ratio to come down? And what's that ultimate landing point?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. We do feel very good about our capital position, Howard. And in 2012, we paid back -- our total payout ratio was about 65%, so obviously, we were accreting capital. And as much as maybe you and we look at those total capital ratios, at this point, the capital plan process that they have in place is more focused on payout ratio. And so, we're looking to put forth a very strong plan to the regulators. We submitted our plan the beginning of January. We'll work our way through that process. We don't think it's appropriate really at this point to talk about what's in the plan because we are working through it with the regulators. But needless to say, the ratios that we have, we are very, very comfortable with that level of capital and would like to return more capital to our shareholders.","Operator","And we'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","On that 13%, how about -- why wouldn't it be 100% or more? And I know a lot goes into it. And I'm not asking what's in your plan. But you're getting to a point where Switzerland would be proud of you. So just curious, what would be a hypothetical holdback on why it wouldn't be 100% payout?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, it's -- first of all, Glenn, we clearly have the objective of wanting to have our plan not objected to by the regulators. So that's kind of point number 1. Point number 2 is that when they evaluate these plans, it's a very kind of holistic evaluation. So as much as we have a particular capital ratio, others may have particular capital ratios. In the regulators' mind, that's one component. We feel good about the other components of our capital process and our capital adequacy, but I'm just pointing out the fact that it's a holistic approach. The reason why they don't give us an answer right away, of course, is because they're in here doing their work and there's a lot of interaction between now and when they actually give a response. As you know, they run various stress scenarios, so they want to ensure that they can -- that we, in fact, are running idiosyncratic risks to our capital basis. And there's various things also that are uncertainties, if you will, in the sense that -- the ability to do acquisitions, for example, certainly would consume capital going forward. So my only point in it is it's not a simple, just a comparison between your current capital level and whether you'll be at a particular payout ratio. It's a more holistic process and dialogue with the regulators. And again, we feel good about where we are. Certainly, returning capital to our shareholders is a priority. We have a very good relationship with the regulators, and so we're going to continue to try to work through with them. And over time, we do think that this process will evolve. And it will evolve in a way, Glenn, I think where it's less about that payout ratio that you talked about. So we won't necessarily -- 100% plus or minus won't necessarily mean that much. It much more will be where you are in your overall capital adequacy.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Understood. And for the record, I think you checked out very well on all those other touchy-feely metrics. One last follow-up, you gave an unbelievable amount of detail on the puts and takes on expenses this quarter versus last and what some seasonality pokes its head on the first quarter, so I'll go back and run through the transcript. But in a nutshell, first, flat revenue world, first quarter versus fourth quarter, with all the puts and takes. Can you give us a bigger than a breadbox how it all net out?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I think -- here's one thing I would look at, Glenn, which is there's always going to be fluctuations, and I won't go back through some of those categories that -- again, we can't predict necessarily when we're going to have charges for account servicing activities, we can't necessarily determine we have sub-custody, et cetera. So it's hard to necessarily say, \"Okay, where is it going to be?\" But if you look at the year, adjusted for the charges, our expenses were up 4%. Obviously, they were up only 2% just on a reported basis. But if you adjust for the charges, up 4% in a year when granted revenues were up about 3%. But our trust fees were up 11%. And the trust fee has been really where we're growing the business, granted there's some impact from equity markets, but it was mostly due to new business. If we roll forward here, we're going to continue to try to grow the trust fees at a healthy clip. We don't know what revenue growth is going to be because of those other factors. Certainly, we're going to try to maximize on those other revenue streams. But not knowing that and going through the year that we just went through and expecting that environment, we're certainly going to try to keep our expense growth in line with what we've achieved in 2012.","Operator","And next we'll go to Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","JPMorgan reported fairly good flows in private banking and wealth management this morning. It looks like they had some help from the alternatives business. I think in the past, you singled out an expansion alternative investment capabilities of -- as one of your growth initiatives for Northern Trust Global Investments. So I was just wondering an update on how that's progressing. I know there wasn't much of evidence of an increased risk-taking among clients last quarter, but there's any indication that you're getting more traction on the alternatives business.","Michael G. O'grady","You're correct, Luke, that alternatives is an area that is, I would say, a strategic focus for our asset management business. And the primary focus there for our clients is to be able to provide them with a robust set of alternatives within the alternatives space. So the way we've approached it is through both hedge funds of funds and private equity funds of funds primarily. And that business, and I don't have any specific numbers in front of me, but continues to do well. But as you pointed out, we haven't seen an increased level of risk appetite, if you will, on the clients' part that has changed the trajectory in a meaningful way where we're seeing outsized growth in that category. It'll continue to be one of the things that's at the top of the list for NTGI. And I think it's going to have to be a combination of our ability to offer more alternatives for them, and at the same time, the risk appetite of the clients also increasing.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Got you. Another question kind of on longer-term strategy. In the past, you've indicated that transporting the PFS business to Europe was difficult largely because your success in the U.S. had to do with your knowledge of U.S. tax regulation, so on and so forth. But I think, you're evaluating a more formal international strategy. And when I look around the world, I think the Swiss banks are retrenching, they're focusing more on private banking, but they've also lost some advantages with the international tax treaties, and there's been a migration of client assets away from small players in Europe. So I'm wondering if any of that has really resulted in the change to your outlook regarding opportunity you might have to put capital to work by growing PFS abroad.","Michael G. O'grady","International expansion for PFS is another strategic initiative for us, and it's one where I would say that, that initiative is also progressing. We've made a number of personnel changes earlier in the year, placing more partners over in Europe to continue that strategy. And one of the things I would point out is, the way we're approaching that market is where we feel that we have the strongest offering, so it's at the higher end. And with that, you mentioned some of the areas that can be challenges for us, one of the strengths we think we have is that given the institutional side of our business, our Global Family office, part of our PFS business, can benefit from the custody platform, our technology platform, that we offer to our institutional clients. And so, that's something where, while we might be -- we're not an incumbent in some of the jurisdictions that you've talked about there, we think that we can present a better service offering which will help us grow that. So still early stages, and it's a long-term strategy, it's not something that I would look for immediate impact on. But we talked about, for NTGI, that alternatives is at the -- towards the top of their list, in the same way for PFS international is towards the top of their list for strategic initiatives.","Operator","And next we'll go to Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to expand on the operating leverage equation as we think about looking long out of next year or 2. Can you -- you're spending, obviously, a lot of money in terms of landing these new wins. And you mentioned that you'll see some ramps from some of the specific ones and broadly. Can you talk about time to implement and cost to implement versus revenue ramp in terms of what you're seeing in your current pipelines and how the pipeline has changed with -- or strengthening, weakening in terms of what's happened in the environment over the course of last year?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So let me start with the pipeline part of it because I think that's easier, which is, continues to be strong. And it's -- when I say across the board, I've talked about difference businesses, but it's also in the size of transactions as well or new clients. So at the top end, it is things like Bridgewater or QIC, but it runs all the way down the list. When I look at the list for 2012 of our new client wins or business that's actually been implemented, it's a very diversified list in the sense of size as well. Obviously, the larger ones require more in the way of time and resources, meaning dollars, to get implemented. And that's not -- it's not perfectly smooth, as you would expect. I mentioned the QIC in the fourth quarter. There's certainly, as I think is only natural, often target dates for implementation that are put out there as well, and we certainly had some that were end of the year. And so in the C&IS business, they were on-boarding some clients which did cause some of these expense categories that I've talked about to be higher. So it's not going to be smooth. But at the same time, I don't think that we're going to have quarters where it's extremely high and then other quarters where it's really low. With the largest clients, we do look to pace the level of cost there. There are certain costs, not all of them -- there are certain costs that we can defer as part of the implementation, so that also helps somewhat. But that's the pattern, if you will, for these. But I would say that every time that we look at -- we look primarily at the economics of that new client as opposed to necessarily what the individual period accounting might be. And for some of these, the front end is more challenging from the accounting standpoint, but certainly, the longer-term economics are very favorable. And they're not necessarily -- yes, I don't want to give the impression they're back end weighted. It's just the fact that the startup can have more expenses than the revenues.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I mean, to your point, you made about spending on to close some deals, I mean, that's the type of thing you're -- that's going to be ongoing, right? I mean, you might have had some things that were above trend this quarter, but I would presume that you guys are working on big deals that you will have similar business-related expenses as we look ahead, right? So I just want to try to understand that back-and-forth between a good deal closing which causes an extra increment of expense versus an ongoing push you guys are making on these bigger, more complex deals that, that's just, like you said, it costs you a little bit more money upfront.","Michael G. O'grady","Okay. And let me address that maybe a little more pointedly, Ken, to, which is as much as I think we were a little bit higher in the fourth quarter, I do not want to give the impression that we were much higher in this quarter and for some reason, those aren't going to repeat because to your point, we are constantly looking to win new clients and there's costs involved with that, but also to on-board them. So these are ongoing costs. If you ask, okay, how do we think about that from a trend standpoint? I've mentioned a couple of times here, looking at our expenses relative to the fees, and so as much as every quarter, that ratio is not necessarily going to improve. There's no doubt that we want that trend to improve. So in 2012, that ratio was down meaningfully from where it was in 2011. Now the ratio in fourth --- in the fourth quarter is a little bit higher than the third quarter. So you're going to -- it's going to bump a little bit, but definitely we want that trend to be coming down.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then I wanted just to ask you to talk a little bit about the FX business. I think you made it very clear that the key driver of the market related challenge was -- is the reduction in volatility. But I just wonder if you could give us an update on also just underlying trends on the FX side, any change in terms of custody related flows or volume trends that's also -- that you've seen either because of some of the secular changes in the business and\/or the environment that we've been within.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So volatility, obviously, a big driver for us and just for the market for FX. And with foreign exchange, if we look at just our custody clients, their level of FX activity was lower sequentially in the quarter and definitely year-over-year. So they're just doing less. Obviously, our objective is, for anything that they are doing, we would like them to transact with us. So the strategy part primarily comes into how can you increase your share with your clients based on their activity because you can't really impact volatility and you probably don't have much impact on how much your client is actually transacting. So that's with our custody clients. The other thing that we're doing, Ken, is we are definitely looking to do more with non-custody clients. And that's an area where I would say we may have trailed others with the level of activity that we have with non-custody clients, but it's something that we're looking to continue to expand going forward here in 2013.","Operator","And next we'll go to Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","I guess, just listening to how much of the [indiscernible] are interest rate related, I was wondering if you could circle back to the rate disclosures you've given in the 10-K and 10-Q, and it just surprises me that there's not more upside from rising rates. Is that just a timing thing, or they way you're modeling interest rates building in some conservatives and more, or how should we think about that?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, as you pointed out, Brian, I mean, that's very much a modeling exercise and one that we have to look at and make various assumptions about the behavior of both the asset side and the liability side. And on the liability side, the big question, of course, is as rates move up or move down, but your question is directed more towards the up, how quickly do we expect that we would need to also increase the rate that we pay on the various types of deposits. So one could make arguments about how aggressive or conservative we are in making those assumptions. But bottom line, I would say, is clearly, we expect in an increasing rate environment that, that will be very beneficial to us. The pace or timing of that is difficult to anticipate. And as you know with those models as well, you look at defined time periods and also the speed of the ramp, which I think are largely artificial and impossible to predict. And so I would say, it's mostly directional as opposed to being able to really forecast what's going to happen in a particular rate environment.","Brian Foran","Got it. And then I guess a follow-up, and I guess it might be somewhat answered by your comments that it's a modeling exercise and more directional. But the other thing that always trips me up is the 100 basis point increase and 200 basis point increase scenarios are almost on top of each other in terms of earnings impact. I mean, does that imply all the benefit really comes from the first 100 basis points and the next 100 basis points isn't that meaningful, or is, again, that's just an outcrop of a modeling exercise?","Michael G. O'grady","Well, it is an outcrop of the modeling exercise but also the rationale or the assumption behind it. Generally speaking, you're correct in the sense of saying at what point do those liabilities behave in a way that you need to be essentially passing along the increase in rates, right? So you may -- the timing of when the increase in rates helps your yield versus when it impacts your cost, and once you get to a certain level of that, those 2 things become more correlated, if that makes sense.","Brian Foran","It does. And then, I guess, the last one and not to beat a dead horse here, but -- so on the deposit repricing. I guess, on the one hand everyone has tons of deposits and you can argue the deposit lag or pass-through or deposit betas, whatever term you want to use, would be better or more beneficial to you. On the other hand, you could argue, the depositors will want it quicker because it's such a low level of rates that every 25 basis points really makes a big difference. So I mean, are you thinking about deposit behavior and deposit pricing similar to '04 or bigger deposit lag or less of a deposit lag when you think about that?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I can't tell you the exact because I don't know relative to '04 what our assumptions are, but we do have a lag assumption that's in there. I would also say though what's tricky on this, particularly tricky, Brian, is we've never seen rates that are as low as they are right now across all the currencies that we have. So there are certain currencies, as you know, that are actually negative rates. And so, to be able to compare it to a different time period and, frankly, to be able to project out what is going to happen when those rates change and come back into positive territory and what the expectation of depositors are is just particularly a tricky exercise.","Operator","And we'll go next to Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 quick questions. First, when you look at the growth in the trust fees, both on the institutional and PFS side, what you see is that the fees are growing a little bit faster than even the balances. So I was just curious, you all had done several pricing initiatives, do you feel like you're getting some traction out of those initiatives as a part of Driving Performance?","Beverly J. Fleming","Marty, this is Bev. I would say on the PFS front, we absolutely believe that we are getting traction on the pricing methodology change that we made at the beginning of the year, and that has been a big part of the revenue enhancements that we saw as 2012 unfolded. The phenomenon that you're talking about specific to the fourth quarter is that we did see a little bit of a mix shift in our private client assets under management and that we had a higher level of cash in the fourth quarter for reasons that Mike spoke about earlier, and of course, we would earn less on cash than we would on other assets. So on the private client side, I feel like -- we feel like the Driving Performance initiatives have been very effective and hopefully, that would help you understand the fourth quarter phenomenon. On the custody side, I'm not quite sure where you're coming from because the note that I have in front of me is that we actually had fee growth that was better than custody asset growth. So for that one, you might be...","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, no. I was suggesting that there was pricing improvement given that the fee growth was 3% to 4% and that's rolling about 1% sequentially.","Beverly J. Fleming","There you go. That's exactly right.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, and I would just add on that, Marty, and I didn't mention this earlier, but just with regard to Driving Performance. We've talked in previous calls about the fact that with PFS, they had their change in pricing structure at the beginning of the year, so essentially, it was implemented. On C&IS, we've talked about in previous quarters the fact that, that's a different process where we need to essentially work our way through with -- one by one with each of these clients in order to determine the appropriate approach and then outcome with them. And so, the revenue pickup for C&IS has increased each quarter. And on the revenue side, the fact that we are up a couple of million dollars over the previous quarters is due to C&IS, and you're seeing that through the metric that you just mentioned as well.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And the second last question was, given that we're in the second half of the Driving Performance, so the quarterly restructured charges begin to kind of taper off as we go through the year -- or when do you expect that those quarterly charges would be behind us?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So the charges that we had in 2012 were a combination of integration costs related to finalizing the integration of the 2 acquisitions that we did in 2011 and then also restructuring charges related to Driving Performance. And to your point, Marty, we would expect that both of those charges related to those things and we can't -- I don't know outside of that, but with regard to those 2 things, those would definitely go down. They were higher in the fourth quarter because of some of the actions that we took with regard to Driving Performance, so particularly on the real estate front, for example, where we closed various offices both on the PFS side and also reorganized space on the corporate side, as well, but those involved charges. And at this point, we're not expecting to have as many real estate moves like that.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Bedell from ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe just to go back to the pricing side. On the C&IS or the custody business, I guess, if you could comment on to what extent you're effectively cross-selling more into that custody base. Are you seeing a better revenue -- realization rate on a custody asset when in fact, you might be selling a hedge fund admin service that's not included in the denominator? And then also, can you comment on your ongoing conversations with a lot of the pension plan clients in terms of raising the core pricing, sort of where you are in that evolution?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So on both of them, I'm going to answer them somewhat together, which is we are seeing benefits in both categories, so both the cross-sell and with specific fee increases. And in the traditional business, part of that conversation is just the other revenue streams are not at the levels that either we nor our clients anticipated, and so an increase in the fee is something that they believe is appropriate as well. So that's been a positive. And then the other thing I would say is, as far as how far we are, the way I think about it is, we keep track of where we are with client discussions. And at this point, we're at 3\/4 of the way through the dialogue. So in other words, we've had discussions on this front with 3\/4 of our clients. That doesn't mean that we've necessarily seen 3\/4 of the benefit that we're going to get. But as far as having a specific dialogue related to Driving Performance, related to overall profitability for that particular client, we're 3\/4 of the way through.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Is there an expectation that most of these clients will accept fee increases, or do you think it's a -- sort of a minority portion?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, I don't know the specific answer. So I don't necessarily want to say majority of them are. But it is not one where I would say that we're looking to change the pricing on every client by any means. It is -- it's looking -- that's why it's taken so long and it is very methodical is because each of these are different. And some of them were very much at a point in what I call the value proposition was balanced at the beginning. It's very balanced right now. So there's really not much of a need to change, and others are much further out of line.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And just one last one on -- just coming back to the capital deployment. What's the timeline for the goal to be within the 10% to 15% ROE area? And where would you ultimately in a -- in potentially, like a more normal environment like to be within that, closer to the lower end, low to mid end of the 10% or closer to the higher end? And I guess this will be in conjunction with returning capital.","Michael G. O'grady","Right. So clearly, we'd like to be in that range sooner and be towards the upper end of it. We do not have a specific corporate timeline for when we believe that we need to be within the 10% to 15%. Frankly, with a little bit better environment, we would have been -- we would already be in the 10% plus range. But we gave up, as I've talked about, the majority of the savings from Driving Performance through reductions in FX and in net interest income this year. So that's why our objective this year is to continue to move along the lines with Driving Performance so that we could get ourselves into that range. And then really the driver of where we end up within the range will have to do with the broader environment. Our plan is to continue to improve our profitability, but at the same time, given the impact of the environment, it's also going to be up to those factors to determine whether we get towards the higher end of the 10% to 15% or more towards the middle for various time periods. But for the things that we can control, it's about trying to continue to move up into the range and then further up in the range.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great, great. That's -- I have just one last one on -- I think you said it was a record year for C&IS net new business. I don't know if I missed it, was it also a record year for PFS?","Michael G. O'grady","It was a record year for PFS new business.","Operator","And our last question will come from Betsy Graseck from MSSB.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All my questions were asked and answered. I\u2019m good.","Michael G. O'grady","All right. Thank you, everybody, for dialing in today's call.","Operator","That concludes our call for today.

Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'Grady, Northern Trust's Chief Financial Officer; Jane Karpinski, our Controller; and Allison Quaintance from our Investor Relations team.","For those of you who did not receive our third quarter earnings press release or financial trends report via e-mail this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com.","In addition, and also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings presentation -- earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call.

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.","Michael G. O'Grady","Thanks, Bev. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. On today's call, I'll review our third quarter results, update you on our Driving Performance initiative and comment on our capital. Bev and I will then be glad to answer your questions.","Before I review our results, I want to point out that our Board of Directors, at its meeting yesterday, approved the name change of 2 of our business units: Personal Financial Services to Wealth Management and Northern Trust Global Investments to Asset Management. These changes more accurately reflect the nature of our businesses and provide greater clarity around what we do for our clients in those segments. The names of our other 2 business units, Corporate & Institutional Services and Operations & Technology, remain unchanged.","Moving to our third quarter results on Page 2. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $206 million and earnings per share of $0.84. Our reported results included a gain of $33 million on the sale of our Miami office building. Excluding the gain, net income would have been $186 million and earnings per share would have been $0.76.","The operating environment in the third quarter continued to be mixed with both positive and negative implications for our business. Equity markets in the U.S. and Europe were higher, which supplemented our strong new business results while fixed income markets were a modest headwind. The S&P 500 was up 17% year-over-year and 5% sequentially while the EAFE Index was up 25% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was down 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially. Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $5.2 trillion, up 10% over last year; and assets under management ended at $846 billion, up 13%. On a sequential basis, client custody and managed asset levels were both up 5%. Currency, volatility and client trading volumes, both of which influence foreign exchange trading income, were lower in the third quarter which is not uncommon for summer months but were still higher year-over-year. Short-term interest rates declined further in the quarter, remaining at very low levels. Average levels in the quarter for 3-month LIBOR, Fed funds and overnight repo were all down 1 to 5 basis points. This placed continued pressure on our net interest margin and also resulted in higher fee waivers in connection with our money market mutual funds.","We continue to successfully execute on the Driving Performance initiatives announced in early 2012, enhancing our capacity for investment and growth and other initiatives regardless of the macro environment.","The net effect of all these factors was a reported return on equity of 10.6%. Excluding the gain, our return on equity would have been 9.6%, short of our target range of 10% to 15%.","Let's move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the third quarter. First, I'll compare the third quarter, excluding the gain to last year's third quarter. Revenues were up 4%, and expenses were up 6%. Revenue growth was a result of trust, investment and other servicing fees increasing 8% and foreign exchange trading income increasing 43%, offset by a 5% reduction in net interest income and a 26% decrease in other operating income. Expenses were up 6% due to higher outside services and equipment and software expenses. Our loan loss provision was $5 million in the quarter, down from $10 million last year. As result, net income was 4% higher than last year's third quarter.","Compared to last quarter, revenues, excluding the gain, were down 1%, and expenses were up 2%. Lower trust, investment and other servicing fees and foreign exchange trading income were largely offset by higher net interest income.","Expense growth on a sequential basis, similar to the year-over-year comparison, reflects higher outside services and equipment and software expenses. As a result, net income, excluding the gain, would have been 3% lower sequentially. Earnings per share was $0.84 on a reported basis and $0.76, excluding the gain, compared to $0.73 last year and $0.78 last quarter. Our return on equity of 10.6% for the third quarter would have been 9.6%, excluding the gain, unchanged year-over-year and lower than the second quarter.","With that background and summary, let's get into more details behind our third quarter results. Beginning on Page 4, third quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were approximately $1 billion, up 7% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. As I mentioned, excluding the gain, revenues would have been up 4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues, were $648 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Higher equity markets and new business were both drivers of growth with higher money market fund fee waivers offsetting.","Money market fund fee waivers were approximately $32 million in the third quarter, an increase of $16 million over last year and $9 million over last quarter. The increase was primarily due to the gross yields of the funds declining by approximately 4 basis points on average from the second quarter. I'll go into further detail on trust fees shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was $63 million in the third quarter, up 43% year-over-year and down 12% sequentially. Higher currency market volatility and higher trading volumes both drove the improved results year-over-year. On a sequential quarter basis, both volatility and volumes were lower.","Other noninterest income of $99 million for the quarter included the $33 million gain. Absent the gain, other noninterest income would have been $67 million, down 18% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Last year's results included a $5.3 million gain related to hedges of certain investments in our foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries. Both comparisons also reflect lower income on employee benefit assets held in trust. Net interest income, which I will also discuss in more detail later, was $245 million in the third quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially.","With that backdrop, let's look at the components of our fee revenues on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $360 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $239 million in the third quarter, up 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher equity markets, new business and favorable results from our Driving Performance revenue initiatives. In the sequential quarter comparison, new business drove the increase.","Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $4.8 trillion at quarter end, up 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. The increases reflect higher equity markets in new business and a favorable impact of currency translations sequentially. Investment management fees in C&IS at $71 million in the third quarter were down 3% year-over-year and 4% sequentially despite assets under management for C&IS clients increasing 12% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. New business, primarily mutual funds in index management and higher equity markets, were more than offset by higher money market fund fee waivers. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equaled $15 million in the third quarter, $9 million higher year-over-year and $5 million higher sequentially, primarily reflecting the lower gross yields achieved in the underlying funds as I previously mentioned.","Securities lending fees were $23 million in the third quarter, down 5% year-over-year and 27% sequentially. The sequential quarter decrease reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads last quarter. Securities lending collateral of $105 billion at quarter end, up 7% both year-over-year and sequentially.","Other fees in C&IS were $26 million in the third quarter, up 15% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, primarily reflecting growth in investment risk and analytical services and benefit payments.","Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $288 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth reflects strong new business and higher equity markets while the sequential quarter comparison primarily reflects new business. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were impacted by higher money market fund fee waivers, which, at $17 million, were $7 million higher compared with last year and $4 million higher than last quarter.","Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $212 billion at quarter end, up 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, reflecting higher equity markets in new business. Wealth Management assets under custody were $470 billion at quarter end, up 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.","Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $245 million in the third quarter, down 5% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. The net interest margin was 1.14% in the third quarter, down 7 basis points year-over-year and up 4 basis points sequentially while earning assets averaged $86 billion in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The lower margin compared with last year primarily reflects lower yields across earnings asset categories as short-term interest rates continued to decline. For example, average 3-month LIBOR was down 17 basis points year-over-year. The higher margin compared with last quarter primarily reflects lower premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio due to changes in prepayment speed assumptions. Premium amortization was $5 million in the third quarter, down from $15 million in the second quarter. As a result, the yield on the securities portfolio increased 16 basis points sequentially. In addition, the yield on interest-bearing deposits with banks increased 5 basis points sequentially, primarily due to higher proportion of deposits denominated in the Australian dollar where interest rates remain relatively high versus other currencies.","Offsetting those increases was a lower overall yield on the loan portfolio, which declined 3 basis points as over 1\/2 of the portfolio is floating rate and new loans and leases are coming on our balance sheet at lower yields than those rolling off. The cost of funds declined 3 basis points sequentially with all categories but senior notes declining. The higher costs of senior notes was largely due to the maturity in the third quarter of a note with a comparatively low rate.","Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $741 million in the third quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Let's take a look at the trends in expenses by category. Compensation expense was up 3% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects staff growth, which also increased 3% and was driven by hiring in our Global Fund Services business and C&IS, which is growing rapidly, and in our operational centers in India and Ireland.","Employee benefit expense increased 4% year-over-year and was down 1% sequentially. Employee medical expenses were higher in the quarter, but were offset sequentially by the lower FICA insurance.","Outside services expenses increased 15% or $19 million year-over-year and 7% or $10 million sequentially with higher consulting, technical services and sub-custodian expense driving both the year-over-year and sequential growth. As we've discussed, this category of expenses for third-party providers can vary both with client activity levels in a particular period, as well as for corporate needs such as regulatory projects and initiatives. Increasing requirements related to CCAR, resolution planning, AIFMD and other initiatives resulting in higher expenses for certain components of outside services this quarter. For example, consulting expenses were $15 million in the third quarter, about 3x as much as in the same quarter last year and twice as much as in the last quarter. We anticipate this level of activity will continue until we will also be carefully managing the related resources and costs.","Equipment and software expense was higher by 11% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. This growth was expected and reflects the higher level of investment we are making in our technology platform. For example, during the third quarter, we rolled out new mobile offerings for our Wealth Management clients for Apple and Android smartphones and tablets. We also launched the first phase of streamlining client account opening for institutional clients and implemented a new front office trading platform in foreign exchange.","Occupancy expense was essentially flat both year-over-year and sequentially.","Other operating expense increased 8% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due to a number of miscellaneous factors.","In sum, while our expense base fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter for various reasons, it generally tracks with the longer-term trend of our fee revenues as we continue adding new clients. Our objective is to grow our expenses at a lower rate than the growth rate of our fee revenues. We were successful in achieving this in 2012 and in 2013 year-to-date.","Let's move to Page 8 and discuss Driving Performance. In the third quarter, we've produced over $70 million in pretax income improvement from Driving Performance initiatives, split roughly 40-60 between revenue and expense. Relative to last quarter, incremental positive impacts resulted from a range of pricing and business building initiatives, as well as further progress on our process optimization efforts such as client administration. With $190 million in benefits achieved year-to-date, we are on track to exceed our Driving Performance target of $250 million for 2013. All else equal, these benefits have improved our pretax margin in 2013 year-to-date compared to 2011. However, the full impact of these benefits is not evident in our bottom line because much of the total has been used to absorb the decline in net interest income and foreign exchange trading income, which have each declined approximately $60 million compared to the same year-to-date period in 2011. Driving Performance is creating sustainable improvements to our operating model, which are critical to our future financial performance. We will continue to pursue meaningful efforts to further improve productivity beyond our original target.","Capital, outlined on Page 9, remained very strong with Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios of 13.1% and 13.6%, respectively. Based on our interpretation of the final Basel III rules released by the Federal Reserve on July 2, our Tier 1 common capital ratio, based on the advanced approach on a fully phased-in basis, would be approximately 13%. Under the standardized approach, the Tier 1 common capital ratio would be approximately 11%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. Additionally, the supplementary leverage ratio is estimated to be approximately 5.5% at the holding company, which is above the requirement applicable to Northern Trust.","In the third quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares at a cost of $97 million. Our capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to $287 million of common stock between October 2013 and March 2014.","A few thoughts in closing. We continue to execute on our strategy of providing exceptional service, expertise and advice to clients around the world. Our third quarter results build on progress made earlier in the year. As a result, through the first 9 months of 2013, we're achieving our objectives of growing the business and improving our productivity, profitability and return. Trust fees have grown at approximately 9% and expenses as a percentage of trust fees are down over 5%. Although these improvements have been offset by the impact of declining short-term interest rates producing only modest growth in income, we continue to better position the company financially for the future. We feel very confident in our strategic and competitive position and are keenly focused on continuing to execute.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call today. Marquita, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","In terms of foreign exchange, it's still a very depressed revenue line, but I think it was better than I expected anyway. Maybe some of that has to do with volumes being better than some of gauges indicated. But I know you've been taking steps to replace some of the revenues that were lost due to transparency and lower spreads. So I'm wondering if those steps had an impact this quarter. And if not, what is your expectation about when we might see some of the benefits? And I guess, you could review the steps as well.","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So you're right. We have taken some steps in the foreign exchange area. And these go back about a year ago where we changed the -- a couple of the folks that are running that business. And as part of that, they did, I would say, 2 things primarily. The first is really taking a hard look at how we provide the service to our existing clients and looking to make sure that we are providing the best level of service and execution for them. Part of that is from a service personnel perspective, but part of it also is from a technology perspective. And as you heard me mention earlier, in the quarter, we've put into place a new front office trading platform for FX, which I think has enabled us to better serve our existing clients on the custody side, and as a result, see some improvement in our market share there. The other big step that we've taken is to look to grow the business outside of our custody clients, to do more third-party FX trading with some of our fund services clients. And on that front, we've made progress, but I would tell you from a financial perspective, we're only seeing a very modest impact in the third quarter and would expect that we'll see much more down the line.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I know I've been harping on this a bit lately, but have you given more thought to increasing the disclosures around the components of net new business and organic growth? I mean, it seems like to me you have a good story to tell here, and since your organic growth is better than peers, and I think that gives you a good opportunity to set the disclosure bar for the industry. So I'd like to know what considerations you're mulling over and whether we could expect that?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. We definitely take your considerations and others into account on that front. As you can imagine, the primary objective for us, first, would be to make sure that any information that we provide to you is accurate and reliable. And on that front, when it comes to looking at new business, we look at new business in a number of different ways, whether that's assets that are coming in the door, whether that's the associated revenues that come in the door with that. And we also carefully track business that can either be lost or where the revenue streams are decreasing. And what we don't want to do is paint a picture with the data on the front end saying, here's this new business we have, but not have that appropriately correlate with what you're seeing in our actual financial reporting. And so that's what we've been trying to make sure that is aligned as much as possible. The other part around that is making some advancements again on the technology front to be able to track, whether it's Assets Under Management, Assets Under Administration, Assets Under Custody at a very detailed level, all the inflows and outflows so that, that will help us be able to provide some of that information that you're looking for.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mike, you've been loud and clear around the burden of some of the regulatory and compliance-related items on your expense base this year, and that's obviously coming through in the numbers. But as we try to think about 2014, it sounds like the incremental build might not be as onerous as it has been I guess this year. So when you think about the expense growth heading into 2014, should we, I guess, expect to see some easing at least from that bucket?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So one of the things with regard to new regulations, for example, whether that's CCAR, resolution planning, et cetera, we first of all want to make sure that we are building the capabilities in-house to be able to continue to comply with those requirements as they increase as well. But at the same time, at certain time periods, it's necessary and frankly even more financially appropriate to use outside resources to do that. And in 2013, with the higher level of either new regulations or new levels, so for example for us to go from CapPR to CCAR and also submitting our resolution plan for the first time, we have had to supplement the internal resources with more external resources. So that is what you've seen.","Now going forward, what we don't know is both the increase in level of the existing regulations. So for example, with the CCAR and the capital planning, do they raise the bar even further going forward, which we think they will do. And also, you have other regulations, which were still frankly in the earlier days, so AIFMD in Europe is still in the early days and really we'll see more of that implementation in 2014. So at this point, we're hesitant to say that those external costs, if you will, are necessarily going to go down when we don't know exactly what the requirements will be next year. Having said that, Alex, it is something where you can imagine we are very keenly focused on trying to be as financially careful as possible in how we manage those costs through the process. I think it would be easier frankly to hire significantly more external resources just to get these various initiatives completed. We've tried to balance that with building the capabilities and doing it in a cost-effective way, and we'll certainly do that going forward too. So we would like to bring some of those down.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. All right. I guess I was just trying to get to, if they don't go down, which I don't think many people are, I guess, too hopeful that they would, but if they don't go down and just given the fact that you had a big ramp this year, I guess the pace of that ramp might slow next year. Is that the way to think about it?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, I think that's a fair expectation.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then my second question was just on securities lending business and I think this is something we haven't actually talked about in a while. But I guess if I look at the collateral balances for you guys this quarter, they're at the highest level we've seen in almost 2.5 years. And I know for the industry in general, it has obviously been a struggle with the lack of sort of demand from the end users. Are you starting to see, I guess, a shift in that or what would you attribute the growth in the balances to this quarter?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. I would say that the shift in the balances has to do as much with just the mix of the demand, the type of securities, so areas where we've just had more demand than we have in previous periods. But I would not say that overall, we're seeing a significant shift in the demand for this. And as much as you do see that somewhat in volumes, you also really see it in spreads as well because if there's greater demand for particular types of securities, that's when our clients are able to get a greater spread on that. So at this point, I would say we're still in the pretty muted environment that we've been in for a while.","Operator","We'll go next to Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","With respect to the net interest margin, thanks for the disclosure on the premium amortization. But putting that aside for a minute, Mike, can you just talk about what you and the team are investing the portfolio in today, and what were the nature of those modest securities losses this quarter?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So just to hit the securities losses first. That's where we just sold one particular security, Howard, where we had a gain in the security. We happen to also have an offsetting position in a hedge. And so as a result, it had no net impact. it just showed up on 2 different line items. And it just had to do with the effectiveness of the hedge that we had in place, which was going to create further volatility going forward. So we decided easier just to sell that security essentially at no gain or loss. But to your bigger, broader question with regard to the portfolio. As you saw in the period, they're putting the premium amortization aside. I would say that the yield on the portfolio remains pretty consistent, and our strategy remains consistent there as well. Our average duration on the portfolio is still just a little bit over a year. And when we look to reinvest the proceeds that are rolling off of the portfolio, we're balancing it between a portion that's very short term for liquidity purposes, and then a portion that has to be extended in order to maintain that duration. But even with that extension, Howard, it's in the kind of 2- to 3-year duration. So we're definitely not looking to significantly extend the duration of the portfolio at this time. And I would say from a credit perspective, we continue to be very consistent with the credit profile that we're looking at, which as you know is very high quality.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then my follow-up, just over the next few years as the operating backdrop improves, we have higher short rates, better client engagement. Can you just refresh us about how you all think about the incremental margins on that essentially outsized revenue growth? And where would you all like to invest that you might be holding back on today?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. We hope you're right about the environment improving in the near term here. And it's an important point, Howard, because the revenues that are related to the environment there. So, for example, with short-term interest rates, whether that's the spread that we can earn on the investment portfolio or the short-term investments that we make with bank deposits, or it's a reduction in the money market fund fee waivers, those are all relatively high margins, very high margins relative to the business overall. And so to the extent that happens, that will have a meaningful impact on our overall pretax margins. Now as you point out, we continue to make investments, but I would say with those investments we've been careful through the more difficult time period and making sure that the investments that we make whether that's in our Global Fund Services business, whether that's things like ETFs that we're doing, whether that's the technology investments that we're making, that these are really important, critical investments to our business that will produce the type of returns that we expect going forward. And so that standard, if you will, won't change. So we're not necessarily looking to make significantly more investments just because the environment is going to be better. And in fact, that's really the driver behind Driving Performance is to be able to create capacity to be able to invest through cycles are opposed to be more cyclical in the investments that we make.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So, Mike, if I put all of what you just said together, is that a 50% incremental margin? 75%? 90%? Is there a way that we can kind of more broadly think about that?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. It's a little difficult to say exactly what the margin is on those, but it is going to be greater than 50%. Just taking one of them, for example, Howard, would be on the money markets fee waivers. As you can imagine, there are many costs that are up against waiving fees, so the vast majority of that should drop straight to the bottom line. That's not necessarily true of all of the other revenue streams that are impacted, but that gives you some idea.","Operator","We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Mike, just a follow-up on expenses. You guys, earlier in the quarter, had gone out of your way just to make sure that people understood these -- some of these incremental step ups. And I just, given that we see the results now, and following on Alex's question earlier, have we gotten the right run rates as far as some of these incremental step ups? Understanding that there's still likely to be a growth rate from here, but have the items that you were specifically talking to with regards to outside services and equipment and software, net occupancy, have that -- have we caught up to that now, or is there still a build that really still has to happen in some of those areas from here?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. Yes, it does depend a little bit on the line item that you're looking at. So for example, on outside services, we did see this I would call significant ramp in the time period. And where I talk about consulting expenses being 3x what they were a year ago in this quarter, that ramp aspect of it, we'd certainly like to think that we've seen the ramp. Certainly there can be growth, but that is not something that we would expect to continue at a very high growth rate. Whereas if you look at equipment and software, as we've talked about, the reason why that's growing at a higher growth rate is because we are making greater capital investments, capital expenditures, with a lot of that around software development. And that's something where we do expect to continue at a higher growth rate than our average growth rate overall. So overall, the expense growth rate so far for the first 9 months of the year is about 3%, whereas I would expect that with equipment and software, that will continue at a higher growth rate. So hopefully that helps.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And the building in Miami, is that now in there on the occupancy side?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, that is in there. And that's again another example where we're able to invest in the new office space in Miami. We're able to open up an office in Saudi Arabia. We're able to open a new office in Frankfurt. And yet as you've seen, our occupancy expenses have grown at a rate that's below that 3% that I mentioned. And that's because of the things that we've been done on the Driving Performance side to carefully rationalize our office footprint overall. And so as you've known, previously, we've had places where we reduced our footprint to make it more efficient, more aligned with the business at this point.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Mike, on the forward, we know you've also been spending to onboard these 2 very large clients that you publicly announced, Bridgewater and ATP. But is there any way you could help us as we get closer to '14, understand when these bigger contracts are online? And I know you're not going to be able to help us with the magnitude, but just trying to understand, Mike, is there an accelerating growth rate in the future in the C&IS side, just versus what's been happening this year on the cost side?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So just taking the 2 that you mentioned there. First, ATP, that's a client that will be onboarded here in the fourth quarter. So we'll begin to see that in our run rate in the current quarter and then going forward. Bridgewater, which as we've talked about, a much more complex onboarding, the one that we've been making additional investments into the technology and also being ready just to take on a fund manager of that size. That'll come on next year at this point, targeted for second quarter of next year. And at that point, we'll have the revenue impact and we'll also have the full expense impact of bringing Bridgewater on at that time. Because that is a long-term agreement, it's structured in a way such that some of the expenses that we have related to that onboarding, we're able to defer those until we begin recognizing the revenue as well, so that will happen at the same time.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last quick one for me, just in PFS, x the fee waiver delta, it looked like that line dipped a little bit sequentially even with a good lagging mark. I'm just wondering if there was either an activity thing or some outflows that you can just talk us through on the Wealth Management and PFS side?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. The biggest factor definitely was the money market fee waivers. So on a sequential basis, it accounts essentially for the decline that you saw sequentially. And I would say outside of that, you did have some modest pickup because of the markets, some of the equity markets. That was largely offset by the bond markets having a negative impact during the period. And then also I would say that there were certain PFS fees, a modest amount that in the second quarter were kind of one-time in nature that were not recurring in the third quarter. But that was a small amount. The driver definitely more is the money market fee waivers.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Maybe a quick question on first on a kind of a capital and CCAR process. I mean, understanding that this is new to the CCAR process, clearly spending the money on it and we don't have the, I guess, the stress environment yet that the Feds will want you to look at. But given your prodigious capital build or a very strong capital position and build over time, I mean what's kind of your current thought process, unless you get thrown a curve ball in a stressed environment? Is it kind of thinking that, gee, you know, we feel pretty good about where we are? Do you get any perspective even though it's not finalized, supplemental leverage ratio, Basel III kind of pick your ratio that you may be thinking that it's coming up to a point where you get more comfortable asking to return larger proportions of cash generation?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So as you know, we're just going to be getting into the really heavy decision-making part of the capital plan going forward, and ultimately, it's the Board that will make those type of decisions on the ultimate capital actions that they'll ask for. Having said that, let me just walk you through the framework that we have as we approach that. The first is definitely our capital position going into the CCAR process and as you mentioned, but as you can see from the numbers here as well, we feel very good about our capital position going, really looking at any of the ratios. And we could talk through how they measure risks differently and can be impacted by different things happening going forward. But I would say, we feel good about our capital position across the board despite how you might measure it, regardless of how you measure it. The second thing that we'll look at is certainly the environment going into the process. And at this point, as we know, the economy continues to improve but very slowly. We are through a time period here where there is uncertainty in Washington, which can have an impact on the economy. We could certainly tell you right now that even the uncertainty we've had over the last several weeks has had an impact on our business. It just causes our clients to be more uncertain about their moves and slow down in some of the activities that they would have. So we would have to take into account whatever the exact current environment is at the time. The third piece as you mentioned is from a regulatory perspective and from our perspective, stress testing is a critical component of this. And while we're doing some of our own stress testing right now, we're obviously going to have to see the stress scenarios that are presented to us and see what the impact is by the time we run it through our process and our models. And then the fourth component is certainly looking at the robustness of our process, and making sure that we feel that we have all of the components in place that delivers a very reliable output. And one likewise that the regulators would agree with regard to the process that we've gone through and how we've documented that process for them. And I think when we take all that into account, that's where -- that'll guide us as to ultimately what will be recommended to the Board and what we'll decide on as far as capital returns.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe as my follow-up. I'm just kind of curious, if I look back at your balance sheet over the last 1.5 years to 2 years, I mean you've had seems like pretty good new business trends, whether it's in the private client, whether it's in the C&IS. And I guess I would have thought that maybe I would have translated it into a little bit more, maybe not a lot, but a little bit more kind of natural growth in the balance sheet, whether it's just deposit taking, just kind of the flow from clients. And yet it's been pretty stagnant notwithstanding some modest increase this quarter. So maybe if you -- is there some type of mix taking place that you bring a new client on board, but it's -- whether it's in PFS, maybe it's not as deposit driven or the changing nature of their relationships, and maybe it's the type of business you're seeing with C&IS just as in those fewer deposits associated with it? Just kind of give a sense for maybe what's holding back a little bit of more balance sheet growth.","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So there's -- you mentioned a number of the factors that are involved there, but I'm going to approach it from 2 different perspectives. The first is just with regard to the balance sheet overall and just deposits over time kind of longer term trends and how they can somewhat mask what may be going on underneath that. And that is the fact that we saw our deposits go up very significantly through the financial crisis. And they really hung in at that higher level until the TAG program was rolled off. And since then, we felt kind of a very immediate drop down in the first quarter and then we've seen some moderate decreases from that time period going forward. And while the balance sheet and earning assets have been really relatively stable, some of that is new clients putting deposits on, while other clients reducing the amount of deposits they have.","The other thing I will say about that is when we go through a time period where we are right now, with the situation in D.C., we do see our clients again come back the opposite direction, so we have seen some inflow of deposits from very large institutional clients preferring to put more deposits on the balance sheet. So that can -- those types of trends can mask kind of the underlying growth that you may have with deposits.","But then the other way that I would approach it, which is a little bit of where you were going is where we are primarily focused with the business. And that is on the C&IS side, it really is a balance between what I would consider some of the more traditional defined benefit-type clients that do have significant balances, particularly outside the U.S. But as you know, a lot of our growth is coming through our Funds Services business. And with the Global Fund Services business, it's not as deposit intensive, if you will. And so that changing nature, you can see a faster growth than in the assets under administration or custody than you will in balance sheet assets. And there's a little bit of that on the wealth side as well that you really have to look at the specific segments and the nature of their needs, if you will, where we look to focus upmarket that may involve less deposits than some of the just below that end of the market. And then at the same time Global Family Office, cash management is a significant need. However, they balance between what they do on our balance sheet with what they put into our funds, and that can move around a fair amount.","So lots of trends over time, but I would say that you put it all together and we've been in this relatively stable level of deposits and for the time being, that's where we think we'll be.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I'm going to ask my expense question 2 different ways. One is a way which you can kind of brag about Northern and the other way is a bit more critical. So I'll start with the positive question, and that is, isn't it ironic that you have all of these extra compliance and regulatory costs when you've been one of the most safe banks in the industry? And in some ways, that might not seem so fair. So how do you think about that? All these new originations to make you safer, yet you should be an example for others if you're simply talking about safety.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. Well, I guess it's not about fairness per se. It's about compliance. And from a regulatory perspective, as you know, they're focused on the entire system and have a single standard, I would say. Maybe that's not perfectly correct in the sense that they do differentiate by size, but once you're of size, if you will, their expectation is for our processes and our risk management infrastructure to be the same as the largest banks. And so on that front, we have to make the changes, make the investments in order to the get to that level. And so that's what we're doing.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","All right, that seems like you're penalized for being in that same grouping. But my other question relates to your delivery on expenses. And I'm looking at quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years. I know that most of that predates you. But when I'm looking at total revenue growth versus expense growth, I'm seeing negative operating leverage almost over any time frame that I look at. And I know you said that the goal is to grow fees roughly in line with expenses. But I'm not sure about that as a target. I mean, shouldn't you evaluate the entire client relationship, which includes deposits and therefore net interest income? So I'm questioning the efficiency or expense target that you have and if it should be a little bit more clarified. I mean State Street, I'm not saying it's one size fits all, but State Street has a margin target. Other banks have more clearly identified efficiency targets. Other banks will include all the revenues in line with the expenses. So given the -- from my perspective, it looks like a poor efficiency record over many time frames. Shouldn't you revise your efficiency target? And also, now that you're on set to get delivering performance, what's the next step?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So the perspective on operating margin whether to look at the pretax margin or some other ratio, certainly at the end of the day, I would agree that it's about delivering the bottom line results. And by no means do we look at that differently. That is the final determination, and we think at the bottom of all that is return on equity, which takes into account the margins, as well as how well you manage your capital.","The reason why we look at the expenses relative to fees is because the nature of the fee revenues is very different than the other revenues, net interest income, FX, et cetera. And as a result, we think it's most appropriate to look at how those expenses line up with those fees, particularly, I would say, on an incremental basis, right? So certainly, there are costs associated with generating net interest income or generating FX. It's just the fact that when interest rates change or FX change up or down, there's not that much we can do on the expense front that's directly related to that. Whereas with the fee revenues, they're very highly correlated. When we bring on a new client or lose a client, we do have more or less work to do. And so the reason why we focus on the metric we have is because that's where we think we have the most control over it. It doesn't mean that we ignore the others, it's just recognizing the fact that they have a different nature, a nature that is much higher margin as we talked about with one of the previous questions. And we think that over time, if we can focus on that, we're going to deliver better operating performance and better pretax margins over multiple cycles. We feel that if you look at just the pretax margin itself, that there's -- the risk on the upside, I'll say, to not be as disciplined around the expenses when you have revenue streams that are going up that really don't require more work. And it can take the eye off the ball, if you will, on trying to continue to be more productive. So that's how we look at it.","Now with regard to Driving Performance going forward, as you point out, we're going to surpass our goal here through the end of the year. What's next? There's still a number of the more end-to-end type initiatives that we have that both require further work, but have greater opportunities going forward. So things like the client administration that we talked about, we're still in the earlier phases of that. We had some benefit, for example, in this period but there's more going forward. There's other things we do with regard to just serving clients and executing for them. So for example, how we strike NAV, how we value derivatives, things like that where there are opportunities for us to do that more efficiently. It's not easy to do but we can do it and generate savings from it. And then finally, I would say, as we look at our footprint, if you will, our operational footprint, there's still opportunity to continue to have a balance that is most effective to both serve our clients and be efficient for it. So there are more opportunities going forward, but they will continue to require more work.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr","A quickie on just the way I look at both average balance sheet and period end, a little bit of a mix shift between long-term debt and senior notes coming down, short-term borrowings going up. I don't know if that's a point in time or if there's any specific actions you are taking, but curious if there's an explanation there?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. It's more point in time. I would say, though, this, you will see some shift in that from period to period just depending on where rates are. And I say that in the sense that to the extent that it is very efficient for us, low cost for us to borrow in a short-term basis and we think that we can earn a reasonable very lower risk return on that and we have the capital to be able to do that, then we might do more of it in a particular time period. But it's always going to be within a certain range. I would just expect some fluctuation. And then as I mentioned, we did have a senior note that rolled off in the time period, that's going to change that. But at certain points, we'll also be issuing and that will change the level of senior debt that we have.","Glenn Schorr","Okay, appreciate that. And then the other follow-up I have is, I heard your comments on CCAR. The one thing I'm curious about is if there's -- you're one of about, what, a dozen banks that are going through it for the first time, and I think it's consistent across the industry for those banks that are employing, whether it be Oliver Wyman or McKinsey or whoever to help guide through the process. I'm just curious, is there much of a specific back and forth with the regulators on how to, do they provide a CCAR for Dummies book, or are you just following the same path that banks before you have?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. Certainly, every bank has its own direct dialogue with its regulators that's very specific to that institution, and we have that as well. But they did put out a paper a few months ago that essentially was both the criteria but I think importantly, now that we have as a system gone through this for a few years, what are best practices and weak practices. And it is a very helpful document, I think, both for institutions like ourself who are stepping up to the next level, because you do gain the benefit of what they view as favorable or unfavorable. But it's also frankly valuable to other folks that are trying to look at the results and understand how these are being evaluated and frankly why it's so much more than just the ratio that might be disclosed.","Operator","We'll go next to Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question's on the share repurchase. It looks like you picked up the pace a little bit in 3Q versus previous quarter, even though the average share price wasn't that different. So I'm just wondering what motivated you to do that? And also on previous quarter, you said you'd consider a few different forms of capital return, maybe even a special dividend, so I'm wondering if the resumed share repurchase makes that less likely in some way.","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So our framework or philosophy around share repurchase is consistent with what we've talked about before, and again, has to start at the highest level of just what our capital position is, how we feel about that, the needs and opportunities we have to deploy it, then certainly looking at the capacity that we have, both from a Board prospective but also from our capital plan prospective.","But I think more to your question, Cynthia, just around once you've cleared those first 2 hurdles, how do you think about it? And I think that the most important part to understand is that we want to have flexibility around our capital deployment, including share repurchases. And in this capital plan framework that we're in right now, there is limited capacity. In other words, you put a capital plan in the beginning of the year and you need to essentially stick to that plan throughout the year. And so as a result in buying shares back from any time period to another, we want to make sure we have a little flexibility because stock prices are volatile. And there are certainly time periods where going back over the last few years, we would have liked to be able to repurchase more shares and take advantage of where the stock price was, but frankly wasn't in a position just because of these limitations around it.","And so at this point, we feel pretty good about the level of flexibility we have through the end of this capital plan period, which means we have this quarter and the next quarter to repurchase. And as much as our average repurchase price, what was very consistent between the last 2 quarters, we did have an opportunity to buy more in this quarter than we did in the previous quarter around that. So that's how we'll continue to think about it.","And specifically around other alternatives besides share repurchase, a special dividend, for example, as I've said, is not specifically in our capital plan. So it's something we have to go back to our regulators to discuss. And I think you're right in the sense that the more that we repurchase, there's less of a rationale for necessarily having a special dividend because there just would be less the dividend because you've utilized that capacity otherwise.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just briefly on the money market fee waivers. When you look at the current yields and maybe your outlook, which could be very different, how's it looking for the coming quarter in terms of waivers?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, it's a little bit -- well, I'd say a little bit, it's very difficult to project because those fee waivers are mostly driven by the shortest end of the curve. And whether you look at -- you could look at LIBOR although that's not a great barometer. It's much more the overnight repo rates that are going to give you the best barometer. Because remember, the average life of these funds is counted in days, if you will, or weeks is a better way to characterize it. And so much of that is invested overnight in the portfolio. So if you look at the overnight repo rates, it jumps around quite a bit. And it was down, as we've seen the evidence of in the third quarter, the dynamic changes, it's been up and down so far this quarter already. But I really have no idea where it's going to be through the remainder of the fourth quarter. It's something frankly that any one can monitor as we go through the quarter and have some idea of what the expectation would be. But it's something I think that's impossible to project.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. It's currently -- it looks currently high, but basically you're saying you don't really have an outlook on it because it moves around so much.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. I think that if you look back just a little bit, it was pretty low. So and I think there's a lot of dynamics around that beyond just rates per se. It also has to do with available collateral and things like that, just the dynamics of that marketplace for that rate.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","On expenses, I wanted to ask again, you had mentioned that based on, I guess, the way you look at it in terms of operating leverage, fee growth versus expense growth that you've achieved that so far this year, year-to-date, as well as last year. Is that still achievable going forward into kind of a still tough operating environment that you guys have laid out generally? I've got a follow-up.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. So the growth rate for fees relative to expenses, we'd definitely love to continue to be able to achieve the improvement that we have achieved. So our fees have grown so far this year for the 9 months at 9% and our expense is closer as I said to 3%. So we expect that relationship to continue. It may not be the case in every single quarter on a sequential basis, such as we experienced in this quarter. And it's not to say that those can't be impacted by things like the equity markets. But that the underlying organic growth rate for that fee portion of our revenues is something that really is on us to grow those at the same time that we're focused on managing the expenses.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of Driving Performance, you had mentioned that you're well in your way to exceeding your ultimate goal there of 250. So you had mentioned in terms of the kind of full impact in terms of the operating margin lift, I believe you're referring to, right, of originally kind of laid out to be 500, 600 basis points potential benefit to operating margins when you first laid it out, that those were kind of part of that you don't really see because it's absorbed with other factors. So how do you think about it now in terms of kind of ultimate benefit? Do you still think you can get close to that kind of ultimate benefit into the low 30s without higher rates in terms of an all-in kind of a lift, or how should we think about it now?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. At the time that we launched Driving Performance, we said all else equal because so many factors are out of our control or impossible to forecast. And so it's the same thing going forward here, which is all else equal, the answer to your question is yes. We certainly would look to continue to improve the margin overall. So putting aside even the metrics that I put out of expenses to fees, we're looking to improve the underlying margin as well. And frankly, you don't need to do that in order for our return on equity to be in our target range. And so that is our expectation. Now again, not knowing where the macro environment is going to be, that can have the same type of impact that it's had over the last 2 years. But without a doubt, we expect that, that demonstrates productivity both the way we talked about it, but also increased profitability in the sense of higher margins.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So maybe said another way, is it still achievable kind of getting from, what is it, 27, 28 range now on an operating margin up to the low 30s without higher rates?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So it's in the 30s?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, definitely into the 30s. And then where we are within that is really more driven by those other revenues, which as you point out, rates is big driver.","Beverly J. Fleming","Thank you all for joining us for the call today.

Equity markets had a mixed impact for us during the quarter. End-of-period markets were favorable on a year-over-year basis with the S&P 500 and MSCI EAFE Indices increasing 12.2% and 3.3%, respectively. On a sequential basis, both indices increased with the S&P 500 up 2.9% and the EAFE up about 2.5%. Average daily markets for these indices were slightly lower on a sequential basis. As you will recall, some of our fees are also are based on lagged pricing. And in the prior quarter, the S&P 500 was down 1.2% while the EAFE was down 5.1%. The markets were also lower for some of our month-lagged pricing.","Short-term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Currency rates influenced a translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and, therefore, impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. Both the British pound and euro ended the quarter up 2% versus the prior year as compared to the U.S. dollar, favorably impacting revenue, but negatively impacting expense. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro declined 6% and 5%, respectively, compared to the U.S. dollar. The sequential changes had an unfavorable impact to revenue and a favorable impact to expense.","Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 14% with noninterest income up 12% and net interest income up 21%. Expenses increased 6% from last year. The provision for credit losses was $1.5 million versus a credit of $7 million 1 year ago. Net income was 46% higher year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 2% with noninterest income flat and net interest income up 8%. Expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 2% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 16.5% for the quarter, up from 11.6% 1 year ago and up from 16% in the prior quarter.","Assets under custody and administration of $10.7 trillion increased 15% compared to 1 year ago and decreased slightly on a sequential basis. Included in assets under custody\/administration is $575 billion relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland.","Assets under custody of $8.1 trillion increased 10% compared to 1 year ago and were flat on a sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable market impacts and new business. On a sequential basis, the benefits from favorable markets and new business were offset by unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates.","Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, up 12% year-over-year and down 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business flows while, sequentially, the decline was primarily relating to lower end-of-period securities lending collateral levels as well as unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates.","Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 14% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Excluding the acquisition, revenue was up 12% from last year. The favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates benefited year-over-year revenue growth by approximately 0.5%.","Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $943 million in the second quarter, up 11% year-over-year and up 1% from the prior quarter. Excluding the UBS acquisition, fees were up 9% on a year-over-year basis.","Foreign exchange trading income was $79 million in the second quarter, up 58% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher client volumes and increased foreign exchange swap activity in our Treasury department. Volatility, as measured by the G7 Index, was down both on a year-over-year and sequential basis.","Other noninterest income was $71 million in the second quarter, down 13% compared to 1 year ago and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to nonrecurring net hedge gains recognized in the prior year and a decline in the current quarter relating to the valuation of existing swap agreements related to Visa Inc.'s Class B common shares. The Visa swap evaluations were also the key contributor of the sequential decline.","Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $423 million in the second quarter, increasing 21% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $552 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. The quarter included $22.1 million in fees relating to the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. Excluding these fees, C&IS fees were up 9% compared to the prior year. The favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates benefited year-over-year C&IS fees by approximately 1%.","Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $377 million, up 15% compared to the prior year and up 1% sequentially. This line does include the UBS acquisition-related fees. Excluding these fees, custody and fund administration fees were up 8% compared to the prior year. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business, favorable currency translation and markets. The sequential increase was primarily driven by new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation and lower markets.","Assets under custody\/administration for C&IS clients were $10.1 trillion at quarter-end, up 16% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. These results include $575 billion relating to the UBS fund administration acquisition. Year-over-year, excluding the acquisition, the increases primarily reflect favorable markets and new business. Sequentially, the benefit of markets and new business were offset by unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter-lagged and month-lagged markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $113 million in the second quarter were up 14% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential growth were both impacted by new business as well as a change to gross revenue presentation for certain clients. Markets had a favorable impact to the year-over-year growth, but had an unfavorable impact on a sequential basis. There was a corresponding increase to third-party advisor cost in outside services expense as a result of the change to gross revenue presentation.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $862 billion, up 13% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Favorable market impacts and net new business were the drivers of the year-over-year growth, while the sequential decline was driven by a lower level of end-of-period securities lending collateral as well as unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.","Securities lending fees were $30 million in the second quarter, up 23% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. For the sequential comparison, higher spreads were the primary driver of growth. Securities lending collateral was $174 billion at quarter-end and averaged $184 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 38% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.","Other fees in C&IS were $32 million in the second quarter, down 10% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. The year-over-year decline reflects lower sub-advisor fees. The income associated with sub-advisor fees has an associated lower expense in outside service category. This decline in sub-advisor fees is consistent with the prior 2 quarters when we discontinued the service offering. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to seasonally higher benefit payment fees in the first quarter of each year.","Moving to our Wealth Management business. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $391 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business fees increased 11% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business and favorable markets while the sequential performance was driven by new business, partially offset by unfavorable markets. Within the regions, the year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, higher fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard and new business. Sequential performance was impacted by unfavorable month-lagged markets. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $287 billion at quarter-end, up 8% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially.","Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $423 million in the second quarter, up 21% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $114 billion in the second quarter, up 4% versus last year. Total deposits averaged $96 billion and were down 1% year-over-year. Interest-bearing deposits increased 1% from 1 year ago to $74 billion. This growth was offset by a 9% decline in noninterest-bearing deposits, which averaged $21 billion during the second quarter. Loan balances averaged $32 billion in the second quarter and were down 5% compared to 1 year ago. The net interest margin was 1.48% in the second quarter and was up 20 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by a balance sheet mix shift. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was up $30 million or 8%. Average earning assets declined 1% sequentially driven by decreases in deposits, partially offset by higher short-term borrowing. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of higher short-term interest rates as well as lower premium amortization.","You will recall that premium amortization totaled $19 million in the first quarter as we shifted our remaining life assumption estimation methodology. That change will lead to a more consistent quarterly amount that we expect to be within the $10 million to $12 million range going forward. The prior quarter's results included a onetime $7 million true-up adjustment to align the remaining amortization. The current quarter reflects the new methodology with premium amortization at the lower end of the $10 million to $12 million range.","Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the second quarter, U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposits. This compared to 71% 1 year ago and is unchanged from the prior quarter.","Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $997 million in the second quarter and were 6% higher than the prior year and up slightly on a sequential basis. As previously mentioned, the current quarter included $21.8 million in expenses associated with the UBS acquisition. The current quarter also included $6.6 million in expense associated with severance and other charges. For comparison purposes, note that 1 year ago, our results included severance and other charges of $22.8 million while the prior quarter included $8.6 million. Excluding both the UBS acquisition and called out expense items, expense for the current quarter was 6% higher than a year ago. Excluding charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses was up slightly.","Now, keeping to total noninterest expense, I would like to break down the year-over-year growth further. Starting with the adjusted 6% year-over-year increase, approximately 0.5 point of growth was from the unfavorable translation impact of changes in currency rates, primarily the British pound and the euro. Excluding currency impact therefore, our year-over-year expense growth rate was approximately 5.5%.","With respect to the remaining increase in year-over-year expense growth, the following items were key drivers within the category, compensation was higher driven by increased incentive compensation and this year's base pay adjustments, which were effective in April. The impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts. Benefits were higher primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses, medical cost and higher payroll tax withholding compared to the prior year. Outside service costs were higher, driven primarily by higher third-party advisor fees, sub-custodian costs and technical services, partially offset by lower consulting and sub-advisor costs.","There was a corresponding increase to trust, investment and servicing fees as a result of the higher third-party advisor fees due to the change to gross revenue presentation. Equipment and software expense was up year-over-year due to higher software amortization costs. Occupancy-related costs were higher compared to the prior year, primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to a previously announced facility exit in one of our Chicago locations. Other operating expenses were lower than the prior year, primarily driven by a lower level of charges associated with accounting -- account servicing activities, lower FDIC costs and lower staff relocation expense, partially offset by higher business promotion costs.","Shifting to the sequential expense view. Excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter, expenses were up slightly. Compensation expense declined sequentially primarily reflecting lower expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive compensation resulting from higher charges recorded in the prior quarter associated with incentive grants to retirement-eligible employees. This quarter's compensation included $11 million in expense associated with retirement-eligible staff versus $32 million in the prior quarter. Partially offsetting the decline from equity-based compensation were higher accruals for cash-based incentives and the impact of base pay adjustments, which were effective April 1. The impact of the base pay adjustments on salaries was partially offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts.","Outside service costs were up sequentially primarily relating to higher levels of third-party advisor fees, technical service, consulting cost and sub-custody expense. Equipment and software expenses were higher sequentially primarily due to increased software amortization and software support costs. Other operating expense increased from the prior period primarily due to higher business promotional spend and staff-related costs, partially offset by lower FDIC and other miscellaneous expenses within the category.","Staff levels increased approximately 4% year-over-year and less than 1% sequentially. Approximately 1\/2 of the year-over-year staff growth was the impact of the UBS acquisition. The remainder of the growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower-cost locations which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona, partially offset by reductions in our higher-cost locations.","Turning to Page 8. As we have discussed on previous calls, through our Value for Spend initiative, we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. Concurrently, we are betting a sustainable expense management approach. We expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth. Our second quarter results reflect approximately $23 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately 2.5 points. This would equate to approximately $92 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million goal.","I'd like to highlight a few examples of our progress to-date for you. We continue enhancing productivity by leveraging automation technologies such as robotics to increase efficiency of existing processes within our fund accounting and transfer agency businesses and we have optimized the organization of technology and operations to streamline processes and decision-making, enhance productivity and more closely align these functions within our clients' needs. We continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities.","Turning to Page 9. A key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense-to-fee ratio, pretax margin and, ultimately, our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011, to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our pretax margin and, ultimately, our return on equity.","Turning to Page 10. Our capital ratios remained strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.2% under the advanced approach and 12.4% under the standardized approach. The supplementary leverage ratio of the corporation was 6.8% and at the bank was 6.2%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement to become -- that became applicable to Northern Trust effective at the start of the year. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective at the start of 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $191 million. As we announced in June, our 2018 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend 31% to $0.55 per share. Yesterday, our Board of Directors formally approved the planned dividend increase. The capital plan also provides the flexibility to repurchase up to $1 billion of common stock. The timing and amount of shares repurchased will depend on various factors, including but not limited to Northern Trust's business plans, financial performance, other investment opportunities and general market conditions, including share price.","In closing, Northern Trust continued to deliver solid financial results in the quarter, growing earnings per share 50% over the prior year and achieving return on average common equity of 16.5%. Our assets under custody\/administration and assets under management were up 15% and 12%, respectively, versus the prior year. Importantly, as we seek to drive profitable growth, we delivered positive operating leverage and positive fee operating leverage both on a year-over-year and a sequential basis. On an organic basis, our fee and expense growth rates were better aligned.","Profitability continues to be strong in each of our businesses. Our Wealth Management business grew pretax income by 16% versus 1 year ago while improving the pretax margin from 39% to 41%. Our C&IS business similarly drove strong year-over-year performance with pretax income growing 41% and the pretax margin improving from 28% to 33%. Both businesses delivered strong year-over-year operating and fee operating leverage.","This year's THE NORTHERN TRUST will again kick off the FedExCup Playoffs August 21 through 26 at Ridgewood Country Club in Paramus, New Jersey. THE NORTHERN TRUST Tournament remains a strategic asset for us as we continue to grow our business in the Northeast and, in particular, the greater New York area. Last year's business promotion expense increased approximately $17 million sequentially in the third quarter and we would expect a similar trend this year.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Jonathan, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just to start out with the balance sheet and just look at sort of the growth maybe on a year-over-year basis. The deposit levels have come down a little bit on a year-over-year basis. Maybe if you can just talk about sort of what you're seeing on deposit behavior in the Wealth Management segment and -- versus your C&IS segment and think about how we should think about balance sheet growth going forward given you certainly have a lot of capacity -- capital capacity. And then, your use of borrowed funds as well does -- have doubled on a year-over-year basis, so maybe just talk about the strategy behind that as well.","Stephen Bowman","Okay. I'll start with question one around the balance sheet and the growth and I'll focus first on the Wealth Management deposits. We have seen that level come down a bit. I think it's -- there are a couple of factors that we would highlight there.","First is, obviously, we've moved into an increasing rate environment. And those clients, particularly our clients at the higher end of the wealth spectrum, have an array of opportunities to invest their cash. It could be on our balance sheet and we do what we can to provide competitive pricing and opportunity on our balance sheet, but they also may be looking at cash funds and\/or other investments to deploy their cash. So when we've seen that -- over the span of a year, we've seen those balances move. Most of those, more than half, about 2\/3 have moved somewhere inside of The Northern Trust into either cash funds or other products and capabilities where we've seen those move internally.","The second thing on the deposit side which we see sequentially in the second quarter is we do see some sequential moves for tax purposes and that's -- we've seen that seasonally in the past. So on the Wealth deposits, while we've seen some of that come down on the Wealth side, it's really the deployment of that and, in some cases, that just moved from balance sheet to other funds at The Northern Trust. Some, approximately 1\/3 or so as we described it, could have moved to other products somewhere outside of The Northern.","We remain competitive. We track our peer set closely and do what we can to ensure that our pricing remains competitive to attract and pay on those wealth deposits because they're very valuable deposits as you know.","On the institutional side, I would say that those deposit balances can demonstrate a little more volatility based on, A, our growth profile. We grow and they go up, but those are large sophisticated asset owners who may deploy those assets into the market at any time -- an opportune time. A meaningful portion are very operational in nature, but we can see some movement in that from quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year.","The pricing on those, the competitive nature of the pricing on those, we have fewer competitors than we do in the Wealth, but it's a little less transparent. So we monitor and have dialogues with our clients and do what we can to price those deposits appropriately. As you might imagine, some clients are on pre-negotiated rates and some are on standard rate cards. And again, we monitor that closely. We're competitive in the world in deposits and we will be in both spaces and continue to be competitive.","I think, generally, the growth on our balance sheet that we've seen over time has just been the success of our business growth strategy. You've seen high single to low double-digit growth rates in our firm and fees and that generally manifest itself in, over time, a growing balance sheet.","Mark Bette","Short-term funds.","Stephen Bowman","And then short-term borrowed funds, the second part of that, I would say what we do -- because of our strong capital levels, we have the ability to do some discretionary leveraging, which does produce incremental net interest income for our shareholders. And given our financial strength and the leverage or lack of leverage constraints that we have as you see in our results, it's allowed us to utilize that. It can have the added benefit, the borrowed funds, of helping the LCR as we manage that so it does add to that. Those borrowed funds where we typically borrow can have the added benefit of helping out on the LCR as well.","Brian Bedell","That's super helpful. And maybe just a follow-up, just the organic growth, we've had -- obviously had some headwinds on the FX side and the market returns were mixed on a sequential basis, but if we look at the actual AUM in Wealth Management, if you can just talk about your general organic growth in Wealth Management maybe in the second quarter versus, say, to the first quarter and a year-over-year basis?","Stephen Bowman","Yes. I'll start maybe -- well, I'll talk the whole firm first. The organic growth rate, which we fairly consistently have been talking about in fees, has been -- we've talked about in the mid-single digits. Let's call it the 4% to 5% range. We, again, had a quarter where we were in that range, we saw.","Specifically to Wealth, we did see some slowing of the organic growth rate in Wealth from first to second quarter and, again, that was impacted less by gross new business than it was by flows. And the flows, if we think about it, can have things like tax payments in the first quarter when -- early second quarter, excuse me, on tax day and\/or deployment of that cash and\/or investment in the markets and\/or potentially even loan pay downs as second homes or other items have become less tax-attractive. Those combined could create some flow pressures on values and AUM inside of our portfolios, but generally, the gross new business portion of that organic growth continue to be very strong in the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Maybe just one more on the net interest revenue outlook. Just how should we be thinking about it for the rest of the year in terms of balance sheet growth given that it doesn't seem like maybe there's a lot of demand, but you're able to use the short-term funding? And then, if we do get another rate hike, what's the expectations in terms of that flowing through either to the NIM?","Stephen Bowman","Yes. So we obviously don't give guidance, but if I look at the impacts of a future hike, what I would say is the first thing we've got to look at is the asset side of the balance sheet for us. And I would say you can see that we remain asset-sensitive. We are heavily impacted by short-term rates, 1-month LIBOR primarily and three months LIBOR moving. So if those move up with a rate hike, which they would likely, the asset sensitivity remains in the balance sheet as you can see via a relatively low duration. So I think the asset side still has sensitivity to rate moves.","Then we go to the important factor, which is what happens with the liability pricing in that. And what I would just say there is we're doing our best to be both disciplined in our pricing on the liability side, but we also need to be competitive. So we have to be both. And you have a view on what the competition is doing and others do. We monitor them as well and we remain competitive. It's important for us to be competitive in that landscape. I think we want to be a disciplined firm. I think you can see that in our betas and others, but we also have to be competitive. Our clients expect and deserve competitive rates and we will be mindful of the market when we do that.","So the betas haven't reached one. So they are expensive to at least the NIM. And then the second part of your question was on the balance sheet side. That's a reflection of our new business opportunities and some of the nuances of where our clients are either deploying cash or elsewhere. So I'm certainly not going to be able to give you a projection on that, but I did give you some of our thinking on how we think the asset and liability side could move.","Michael Carrier","Got it, okay. And just as a follow-up, on the FX -- on the trading income, you mentioned the swaps again this quarter. Just, I don't know if you mentioned the magnitude, but just wanted to get some color because we saw the activity. But maybe like -- I know it's volatile [indiscernible] lumpy in the quarter.","Stephen Bowman","Yes. So you're right. So if we looked at our FX total of $78 million, $79 million, approximately $18 million of that was from the treasury swap. But remember, as we said last quarter -- and that was largely swapping dollars into euros, and that drove a positive FX variance. As you might imagine, that actually hurt or suppressed net interest income to the tune of about $14 million. So the trade produced $18 million of FX at the expense, if you will, of $14 million of NII. That trade, if you look at sort of a euro-dollar swap kind of curve or something like that, you can see that spread has narrowed some. So it is possible that in the quarter, if that maintains, you could see some redistribution between FX, that $18 million in NII in the quarter. We'll provide better color later in the quarter as we see that unfold. So I would say that's generally what we've seen on the FX trade. Our core FX supporting our clients was actually up 20% year-over-year when we look at what we would consider our traditional FX support of our asset servicing business as well. So good trends in both of those components.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","So a question on expenses for you guys. So I heard your $92 million of annualized kind of run rate expenses [indiscernible] $250 million in 2Q. I think that's up from $55 million last quarter. So I guess, can you walk us through the pace of realizations for the remaining of this year and how we should be thinking about it for 2019? And I guess, secondly, as I think about it, I guess, sort of the jumping off point for expenses, backing out severance, it looks like you guys are around $990 million for this quarter. Other than the Northern Open, is there anything else we need to be mindful of as we think about 3Q expenses specifically?","Stephen Bowman","So I'll take those in two parts, right? The first is on Value for Spend and the run rate. Alex, the answer on that is we continue to have a really strong pipeline of opportunities to get after, and we're getting after it as fast as we can. So the pacing of that, you did see some acceleration in there. And the team here remains focused on getting after it as fast as we can. I know we have talked about it being fairly evenly distributed over three years. We're going as fast as we can. And if we exceed that expectation, we're happy. But we also are getting after some of the things that have the quickest and -- I won't say easy because none of them were easy, but the fastest return. But we continue to look at an array of opportunities. So we think and are committed to that $250 million. So can't give you much more on that front. In terms of the third quarter, we gave you the Northern Trust Open. I would say the only other item in the quarter is we have actually some modest decline in equity incentives from, I think, we had 11 in this quarter, Mark...","Mark Bette","That's right.","Stephen Bowman","And then we should see some modest decline in the equity incentives as they ratchet down during the course of the year. I'd say other than that, it would be nothing that you wouldn't jump off. And your run rate of jumping off at $991 million was $990 million, $991 million is reasonable.","Alexander Blostein","Got it, great. And then just as a quick follow-up on cost but slightly on the cost. Credit, not a huge deal, obviously, but we've seen you guys put up a negative provision for many quarters. The first time it turned positive. Obviously, credit remains quite benign. So maybe just kind of what's going on there would be helpful.","Stephen Bowman","Yes. So we had one credit that we had a specific reserve for that drove it, one individual credit. So we would not see any trends unique, and credit quality remains at a very strong and positive levels. And that's about all I could say that we have very, very strong credit quality right now in the cycle.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Just one more question on the expense growth rate. So you showed on the slide 6% year-over-year growth, and I believe that would also be inclusive of the change in accounting presentation.","Stephen Bowman","Yes.","Kenneth Usdin","So I'm just trying to understand if you adjust for that change in FX translation what you really saw as the underlying core growth rate in expenses on a year-over-year basis?","Stephen Bowman","Yes. Ken, let me walk you through that real quick, if I could. I think that's a good question. If we took the charges out of the second quarter from last year and the charges out of this quarter, we think the expense growth rate would have been closer to 8%. I would take two points of that out for UBS is attributable to UBS. Currency is about 0.5 point. And then revenue recognition or net to gross presentation, however you want to call it, is about another point of that. And that point is also offset by some of our...","Mark Bette","On the fee side...","Stephen Bowman","No, while it's offset on the fee side, it's what we got out of in our GFS business.","Mark Bette","Subadvisory.","Stephen Bowman","Excuse me, subadvisory, thank you. So if you do that walk, Ken, you go from 8% down to about 4.5% as a core expense growth rate in our expenses. So that [indiscernible] rev rec or subadvisory, yes.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, got it. And that's all right. And then that's a -- well, we'll see what happens going forward to your points about the comp comparisons, but Northern Trust and the comps [indiscernible] those are year-over-year things that were already in there, right? So it's really just about how the business grows in terms of that rate of growth from here?","Stephen Bowman","Yes.","Mark Bette","That's right.","Stephen Bowman","That's right.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, perfect. Great. And then just a question on just core business and wins and such. Obviously, the markets were down, so -- and it looked like the global piece was more of a negative in terms of the AUC, unless I look at the global assets under custody. Can you just talk us through just what type of win quarter it was in terms of new assets put on? And any updates on your just kind of underlying growth pipeline will be great.","Stephen Bowman","Yes, we continue across both businesses to see a strong new business opportunities, and we highlight some of those with press releases, very strong. In the AUC piece, particularly the sequential comparator, the currency was really a pretty meaningful driver of what was flattish sequential. It was, I think, about two points of a currency impact. As you remember, we have a fairly significant global custody asset mix of our AUC, so we have a lot in other currencies. I think about 65% is in dollars but 35% isn't. And so the currency impact was pretty meaningful. So I know you asked about the new business trends, but in the AUC specifically, I would say that the currency was a meaningful driver. It more than offset market and new business uplifts in the quarter. We continue to have a significant pipelines and healthy, healthy growth opportunities in both businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","So you know where I'm heading. If you look at your NII number, it only represents 28% of your revenues, but it actually generates about 82% of your bottom line pretax profit. So it's a pretty important portion of what you manage. We've got the data now that show that look, interest-bearing deposits rates haven't increased precipitously. You may get a little bit more as we think you will get elasticity from here forward, so you'll get that low curve. DDAs have been relatively sticky, so there's not like they're running off in big portions. And yet, we still have $25 billion sitting in cash, and we got a duration on our securities portfolio that's probably about a year and a half. So at some point in the cycle, we need to defend against the next cycle, which is when rates come down and which that 82% of our profits get squeezed. So I just wanted to kind of put that back out there again and see how you're thinking about that now [indiscernible] what timing of that you might be looking at.","Stephen Bowman","Yes, thank you, Marty. Well, what I would say is all of the points you made are factors that we contemplate in our ALCO committee. And we meet regularly, and we think about duration management. We think about liquidity management. We think about credit and quality in the portfolio. We have active and regular dialogues. And I'm certainly mindful of your views on those, and we continue to have active debates about what we should be doing to that portion of the balance sheet on a regular basis. So appreciate your comments.","Marlin Mosby","And you've been continuing to roll the expenses relative to your core business -- core fees down. So where you were -- expenses are still 6% higher, but that is significantly better than what we've seen in the past. The efforts that you have should continue to push that ratio closer to 100%, I would expect, over the next couple of years. So that's the other piece of the initiative that really does create a lot of leverage to the income statement.","Stephen Bowman","Yes. We're internally very focused on that measure because we think the majority of our expenses -- the majority, not all, but the majority of our expenses are tied to generating trust fees. So we think it's a very prudent measure. It's not a perfect measure, but it's a very prudent pressure to look at operating leverage in our business and performance leverage in our business, and we continue to drive that down. If you did the calculation in our Wealth Management business, you will see it's actually sub that 100%, and you see that manifest in 41% pretax margin in that business. But there's still opportunity left in there, and we talked about that a little bit in our Value for Spend options, our opportunities, and we're committed to continue to focus on that and drive it to the best levels we can.","Marlin Mosby","That's been impressive improvement, so appreciate that. And that other leverage piece we have on the balance sheet with 3% yields out there in the marketplace, there's a lot of income that can still be kind of garnered through this process and yet still derisk and not risk the balance sheet anymore.","Stephen Bowman","Thank you, Marty.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Apologize if you hit on this before. I don't think you did. Any update on the -- I think you've previously called it the $5 billion to $6 billion of nonoperating balances [indiscernible] interest-bearing deposits.","Stephen Bowman","Yes, and we haven't commented on it. We continue to have regular dialogues with those because those are typically large clients that are associated with our GFS business, our Global Fund Services business. And we have regular dialogues. It has remained at that level for 4 to 5 quarters now, so we think that at least a pretty meaningful portion of that is there for operational or other liquidity needs. We haven't seen that move. It could. We talked about that. So I can't predict. But in our regular dialogues with our relationship people and the owners of those balances, they continue to seem to need them there for liquidity and\/or other strategic investment purposes. So they're ready to go. So we've -- we haven't seen that change now for 4 quarters.","Brennan Hawken","Okay, that's encouraging. And then thinking about -- I believe you said that 69% or so of the deposits are not in U.S. dollar. Are you still mostly pound oriented? Can you remind us of that mix? And then how should we think about -- from what we hear, expectations are pretty good for an August rate hike from the BOE. How should we think about that? How should we think about expectations for beta given that the Bank of England is still in very much the early stages of raising rates?","Stephen Bowman","Yes. So to clarify, 69% of our deposits are in dollars. I think you said aren't...","Brennan Hawken","Yes, sorry, sorry. I got it backwards.","Stephen Bowman","Yes. 69% are in dollars. So the 31% that aren't, I think, pound is our largest next balance 12%...","Mark Bette","About 12%.","Stephen Bowman","Of ours, and then euro would be next. But to your specific question then around the BOE rate rise, look, our clients that are -- that we have that have pound balances, we would benefit from another hike from the BOE. Our betas are not one there. Again, as I said earlier, we have clients in all currencies that are on what I would say more negotiated rates, and then we've got some that are on standard rate cards. The standard rate card's betas would be more preestablished. And then the majority that are on select rates, we would -- are on standard rates, excuse me, would be able to affect the beta through the cycle. Still coming off of a pretty low base. So if it behaves like it has in the U.S., there should be some opportunity there for expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","You've now have been above the top end of the 10% to 15% ROE range for a couple of quarters. Can you give us an update on what you're thinking there given lower taxes? And we seem to be in a bit of a higher rate environment when you were kind of down at the lower end or even below the lower end of the range a few years ago.","Stephen Bowman","Yes, so we don't have any change or nothing that we would comment on as of today. But we continue to look at this, and we'll keep you posted. I think, the one item that you pointed out in there that we look at is a truly secular change is if the tax rate is changed. So that will certainly be one of the important factors as we consider that range that we will contemplate. And a quick example would be, in this quarter, you can do this calculation, but effectively, it added about 1.7 points of ROE. So ex that, we would have been at the very high end of our existing 10% to 15% range. But as I said, we'll keep you posted as we look at that.","Geoffrey Elliott","What's kind of held you back from changing that sooner? I guess, we're kind of 7 months post tax reform now, and the tax impact at least is fairly mechanical. So what stops you coming straight out and adding 1.7 points or whatever the number is to that range?","Stephen Bowman","I think, Geoff, your comment assumes that all of those dollars flow through. The competitive landscape didn't change. The people didn't choose to price that away. We're six months into the tax reform here [indiscernible] perspective. And our view is we certainly wanted to observe how the tax reform was absorbed into the economy and to our clients and to our P&L before we raise to make those changes because you don't know exactly how it would end up flowing through financial statements until you looked at the competitive landscape. We're taking that time to observe that, absorb it and observe it, and then have the right strategic dialogues with all of our key constituents.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Couple of questions. So I want to go back to the short-term borrowings leverage question. I guess, try and look -- try a different tack. How much more leverage can you add here? How much more room do you have?","Stephen Bowman","Well, that's a complicated question in this sense as some of that borrowing that we do is, I will say, dry powder that we want available for liquidity purposes and others. So we don't always necessarily want to tap that fully because we like it available for other reasons in the marketplace. The second is as you might imagine, that is -- it has somewhat constrained the NIM. It is producing incremental NII, which I know is valuable. But we do look at the overall balance of that and then we do also look at leverage ratio and others, which we're not terribly tight on, as you say, but we do evaluate all those factors when we look at the amount of discretionary leveraging we choose to do.","Vivek Juneja","And would you say you still can bump this up a little bit further?","Stephen Bowman","Our ratios would allow it, but we have to put it into the calculus that I just gave you where we're looking a whole series of factors, like liquidity and other items. So we can move it around and contemplate that from quarter-to-quarter.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. It's completely a different question. Technology investments, can you give us an update on where you are in that trajectory of investing? Because I know you've been trying to automate and digitize. And where are you? And any color, any details on that?","Stephen Bowman","Yes. So we continue to have significant investment in the business. This is a technologically intensive and capital intensive from that perspective business. I think we published in our K. We spent somewhere around $2.5 billion on both CapEx and expenditure on a rolling 3-year kind of program. So I think we've given about $2.5 billion from '17 through '19 that we would contemplate in terms of technology spending and\/or expense associated with that. And that's meaningful against our revenue base. It's meaningful against the competitive landscape in which we operate. And we think that our technology efforts are certainly competitive and we hope, in many cases, leading the competition. But I know it's a primary focus and discussion point amongst our board and our management team.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","I just wanted to confirm one more time the way you look at core revenue growth and core expense growth year-over-year. What I think I heard you say is that a core -- and we can get rid of the accounting impact, the FX, the UBS deal. Core revenues were up 12% year-over-year and core expense was up 4% year-over-year. Is that right? Or do you want to change my assumption there?","Stephen Bowman","No, you're pretty close. I would say, Mike, we would probably look at core revenue was up if I exclude any year-over-year currency or the acquisition would be up mid-11%, so 11% -- a little over 11%. And you're right on, on expenses. So that's what we would look at core revenue and core expenses sort of 11% and 4.5%, something like that.","Michael Mayo","All right, so I think you're going to win the award for greatest operating leverage for the quarter, measured that way. But how should we think about that going ahead? Should we think of some of these expense being lumpy? Or you don't get 700 basis points of positive operating leverage 1 quarter with -- I assume, without having not as good of operating leverage in future quarters. You did mention the $17 million of marketing in the third quarter, so I guess, that will impact that though, I guess, you still have that comp year-over-year. So I mean, what kind of operating leverage are you looking for, for this year and on a go-forward basis?","Stephen Bowman","Well, there's obviously both the revenue and expense component to that. So it depends on how markets perform and rate lifts and others. But I know that we're focused on driving operating leverage into the franchise and particularly fee operating leverage into the franchise. So if we look at that, our fees grew somewhere adjusted around 7% if we stripped out all of that noise versus that 4.5%. So we still were driving 2.5 to 3 points of fee leverage. That is a very important focus. And then the second thing I would say is -- Mike is, we're very focused on organic leverage. So the rate we can organically grow our fees versus the rate that our expenses grow organically. So if our expense growth rate was 4.5%, some of those were inorganic factors in there. So that growth rate would've been lower. And if our fees were, as I've told you, somewhere in that 4% to 5% range, we're getting to that organic fee leverage -- I think we wrote in the script as well. So organic fee leverage, fee operating leverage and total operating leverage remain commonly held discussions around here in terms of focus.","Michael Mayo","And to be clear, so that 7% year-over-year fee growth excludes the UBS impact? And if it doesn't, what is the growth year-over-year excluding UBS?","Michael O\u2019Grady","So excluded.","Stephen Bowman","That does exclude it. And excluded -- I took currency and I took the acquisition out of our fee numbers, and that's where you get it.","Michael Mayo","And how is UBS doing in terms of retention, cross-sell, kind of the metrics that you guys had internally? Is it above, in line, below?","Stephen Bowman","Yes, it's exceeded expectations to date in terms of revenue growth and performance.","Mark Bette","Yes. And the one thing, Mike, I would add is the AUA related to the UBS that we called out was $575 billion, which is down sequentially from $607 million, and that was really a currency factor there. So not a lost business this year or anything like that. So everything is going along really well.","Stephen Bowman","Substantially from the acquisition though.","Mark Bette","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Sticking with the comments on M&A, can you give us your outlook for opportunities? Obviously, the UBS transaction sounds like it's going well. You guys have done a number of deals over the years. Is there anything that you see in the horizon that could look interesting to you, whether it's in a different product line or just enhances an existing product line?","Stephen Bowman","If you look at some announcements that were public, we closed, what I will call, the CTEC technology, Omnium technology acquisition in the quarter. We talked about an investment in Lumint and others. What we've done is found opportunities, I think, to partner with or work aside or acquire some products and capabilities to get to market quicker and to, I think, create some speed and solutions for our clients. So rather than a large acquisition, that's where we have over the last twos quarters focused more of our energy and some of our capital is those types of moves. We obviously stay attuned to the market. And should opportunities come up, we pay attention and we get the people that call on us that give us those advices, but I'd say what you've seen in the public domain is more of a targeted smaller acquisitions or investments in products and capabilities or technologies that I think help can move us forward.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then just going into the organic side, over the years, you've obviously grown organically the private wealth business by expanding into different geographies outside the home base in Chicago. Can you give us an update on what your thinking over the next 12 to 18 months of potential organic expansion of the private wealth, personal wealth business geographically?","Stephen Bowman","Yes, so we are absolutely continuing to look at anywhere where we -- there's a high opportunity set for wealth markets there, pockets along the East Coast where we're -- there's high net worth opportunities where we're underpenetrated. What I would highlight for you though in that strategy is that we don't always need to have a physical location there. There are some markets where virtual teams have covered that, and we've had tremendous success in certain cities where we actually cover them with virtual teams and have been successful with that approach. So we feel pretty good about our coverage in the wealth space, but we will continue to look at those opportunities if we have a geographical gap. But I think we're pretty excited with our model to be able to close that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Just real quick on the new business wins. I know you don't want to quantify the numbers. But can you at least directionally say if it's up or down quarter-on-quarter?","Stephen Bowman","Our new -- we don't -- I mean on a year-over-year basis, I would say yes. I mean, I don't know especially when you think about the institutional business quarter-on-quarter. There was a positive impact on the fees, I would say. The actual new business that's recognized can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But there was sequential benefits as well as year-over-year benefits from new business.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And just as you look out for the organic revenue growth, I mean, when you look out at the asset servicing, what's the driver of this organic growth that you're seeing? Is it coming from client switching from other providers? Is it really just the new phase of outsourcing you're seeing picking up? I mean, can you help us give a better understanding of where it's coming from?","Stephen Bowman","Yes, sure. Good question. I would say, we have seen a lot of it in our institutional side has been with asset servicing -- excuse me, asset manager clients providing asset servicing to asset manager clients. And to your point, some of that has been their drive to look at their cost structures in a difficult environment. And so opportunities for middle, back office and\/or other places where they can outsource or partner with somebody has driven some of that. Look, many of -- if you're with the right managers, they also have growth. So we get some distributed growth as well. I think that's particularly true in our hedge fund services space, where we've had the opportunity and good fortune to partner with some partners, some clients who've been very successful in growing their own books and therefore our organic growth goes with them as they either launch new funds or grow their AUM themselves. And then geographies, I would add.","We've had great growth as we talked about in Australia, but we've had great growth in other regions of the world. The Netherlands has had terrific success. We opened an office in Seoul, South Korea, and other parts of the world. So geographical, it's some distributed growth by partnering with the right folks. And then the macroeconomic environment is causing some folks to look at outsourcing and\/or other opportunities. And that's driven a lot of our C&IS growth. You're right, in the more traditional pension space, that's more of a takeaway game. We do very well in that takeaway game, but there's probably not a lot of new defined benefit plans being open for instance, so it's really a market share kind of gain there, which we continue to do well in.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference.

This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to Northern Trust first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Starting on page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning, we reported first quarter net income of $276 million. Earnings per share were $1.09 and our return on common equity was 11.6%.","As discussed on our third quarter call, this quarter includes the impact of the first dividend associated with last year's preferred stock issuance. This initial dividend payment of $14.9 million covers eight months. Going forward, these fixed rate dividends are expected to be paid every other quarter in the amount of $11.5 million, with the next payment scheduled for the third quarter of this year.","This is in addition to the quarterly dividend of $5.9 million from our previously issued preferred stock. Our assets under custody and administration, assets under custody and assets under management increased 13%, 14% and 11%, respectively, compared to the prior year, reflecting favorable markets and our continued success in winning new business.","A number environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of these factors unfolded during the first quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 14.7% year-over-year and up 5.5% sequentially.","In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 14.7% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and fourth quarter markets were also up compared to the prior year as well as sequentially. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was down 2.7% compared to the last year and flat sequentially.","Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 4.7% lower than the first quarter of last year and 1.4% lower sequentially. Foreign exchange market volumes were also lower during the first quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 10% to 20% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially.","You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses.","Dollar strength compared to one year ago tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, while benefiting expense growth. The British pound and the euro ended the quarter 13% and 6% lower than one year ago, respectively. On a sequential basis as compared to the U.S. dollar, the British pound and euro both strengthened by 1%.","U.S. short-term interest rates were higher during the quarter, most evident in the three-month LIBOR, which averaged 107 basis points during the quarter compared to 92 basis points in the prior quarter and 62 basis points one year ago.","Let's move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 8% with non-interest income up 6% and net interest income up 15%. Expenses increased 8% producing two-tenths of a percent points of positive operating leverage. The provision for credits losses was a credit of $1 million. Net income was 13% higher year-over-year.","In the sequential comparison, revenue was up 4% with non-interest income up 2% and net interest income up 10%. Expenses were up 2% compared to the prior quarter. Net income was 4% higher sequentially. Return on average common equity was at 11.6% for the quarter, equal to what we reported one year ago and down from the 11.9% reported in the prior quarter.","Assets under custody\/administration of $8.9 trillion increased 13% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $7.1 trillion increased 14% compared to one year ago and 6% on a sequential basis. In the year-over-year comparison, solid new business and favorable market impacts were partially offset by the currency translation impact of a stronger dollar.","For the sequential comparison, the growth was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, but also had a slight benefit from the currency exchange rates. Assets under management were $1 trillion, up 11% year-over-year and up 6% on a sequential basis. Favorable market impacts were the primary driver of both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons.","Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with the revenue on page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.3 billion, up 8% from last year and up 4% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $808 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and up 2% from the prior quarter. Fee waivers were essentially zero in the first quarter compared to $7.7 million one year ago.","Foreign exchange trading income was $48 million in the first quarter, down 21% year-over-year and down 17% sequentially. Both comparisons were impacted by lower currency volatility as well as lower volumes.","Other non-interest income was $75 million in the first quarter, up 1% from last year and up 15% sequentially. Other operating income in the prior quarter included charges of $8.1 million related to the decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio. The prior year's results included a benefit of $2.3 million related to this portfolio. Excluding these items, this line item was up 5% from last year and 3% sequentially.","Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $362 million in the first quarter, increasing 15% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $463 million in the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $308 million, up 7% compared to the prior year and up 1% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons benefited from new business and favorable equity markets, with the year-over-year growth partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates.","Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.5 trillion at quarter end, up 15% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets. Currency exchange rates muted the year-over-year growth, while adding a slight benefit on a sequential basis. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees, with both quarter-lag and month-lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $94 million in the first quarter were up 5% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable markets, lower money market mutual fund fee waivers and new business. Money market fee waivers one year ago within C&IS totaled $1.7 million, while the current year was essentially zero.","For the sequential comparison, recall that almost two-thirds of our investment management fees in C&IS are build on a one-quarter lag and C&IS AUM was down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $741 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Favorable market impacts were the primary driver of both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons.","Securities lending fees were $24 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than one year ago and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher volumes, partially offset by lower spreads. The sequential decline was driven by lower spreads, partially offset by higher volumes.","Securities lending collateral was $124 billion at quarter end and averaged $123 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The growth in volumes was driven in part by increased demand for U.S. Treasuries.","Other fees in C&IS were $38 million in the first quarter, up 8% for year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. In the sequential comparison, other fees were up 11%, primarily reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payment business.","Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $345 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Within Wealth Management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by new business as well as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers, while the sequential growth was primarily related to new business.","Performance within the regions also benefited from lower money market fee waivers compared to last year as well as favorable markets and new business. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management were essentially zero in the current quarter, which was equal to the prior quarter and down $6 million year-over-year. Assets under management for Wealth Management clients were $260 billion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.","Moving to page 6, net interest income was $362 million in the first quarter, up 15% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $109 billion in the first quarter, up 4% versus last year, driven primarily by a higher level of deposits. Non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $52 billion and were up 6% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the first quarter and were down 1% compared to one year ago.","The net interest margin was 1.35% in the first quarter and was up 14 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets due to the higher short-term interest rates.","On a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up 10%, as the net interest margin increased 15 basis points sequentially, driven by lower premium amortization and higher short-term interest rates. Premium amortization was $1 million in the first quarter compared to $6 million one year ago and $10 million in the fourth quarter.","Turning to page 7, expenses were $894 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Compensation expense of $426 million increased 12% year-over-year and increased 9% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was attributable to higher performance-based compensation, base pay adjustments, which were effective October 1 of last year, and staff growth, partially offset by favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. The sequential growth was attributable to higher performance-based compensation and staff growth. Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year. The growth in staff was all attributable to lower cost locations, which include India, Manila, Limerick and Tempe, Arizona.","The higher level of performance-based compensation was driven by long-term equity-based compensation increasing $30 million compared to one year ago and $36 million compared to the prior period. Both comparisons are primarily attributable to a change in the vesting provisions associated with retirement-eligible employees, which allows their restricted and performance stock units to continue to vest upon retirement. This change impacted restricted and performance stock units related expense beginning with the 2017 grants. The change requires the immediate expensing of restricted stock unit grants to retirement-eligible employees.","Performance stock unit expense attributable to retirement-eligible employees is recognized from the date of the grant through the end of a requisite service period, which ends on June 30, 2017. Stock option-based compensation expense already included a continue-to-vest provision, which results in the immediate expense recognition of stock option grants made to retirement-eligible employees.","The current quarter's results included $30 million in retirement-eligible related expensing compared to $5 million one year ago. The performance stock unit expense attributable to 2017 grants to retirement-eligible employees will approximate $8 million in the second quarter.","Another way to look at this change in the equity-based compensation I have outlined for you can be summed up in this way. Approximately 50% of the expense associated with this year's grants will have been recognized by the end of the second quarter, leaving the remaining 50% to be expensed over the normal three- to four-year vesting periods.","Under the prior plan provisions, we estimate that approximately 15% to 20% would have been expensed by the end of the second quarter, with the remaining 80% to 85% being expensed across the three- to four-year vesting period. Therefore, this change is largely an expense timing issue.","Staying with the compensation category, you will recall that last year we deferred the salary-based pay increases to October 1. For the current year, we have returned to our traditional date of April 1, and this will result in approximately $8 million of additional compensation expense in our run rate for the second quarter.","Employee benefit expense of $78 million was up 10% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher medical costs and payroll taxes. On a sequential quarter basis, benefit expense was up 1%. Recall that the prior quarter's results included a $4 million impact relating to non-U.S. pension settlements. Excluding this item, benefit expense increased sequentially driven by higher payroll tax, partially offset by lower medical costs.","Outside service expense of $153 million was up 2% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher market data costs within technical services and higher sub-custody costs, partially offset by lower consulting spend. On a sequential basis, outside service expense was down 5%, primarily driven by lower consulting and legal expense.","Equipment and software expense of $127 million was up 11% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by increased software amortization as well as software support and rental costs, continuing the implementation of our technology strategy as we invest to support clients and improve employee efficiency.","Occupancy expense of $45 million was up 11% from one year ago and down 3% sequentially. The growth from last year was mainly relating to a credit in last year's results relating to a lease adjustment in Europe. The sequential decline related to an early termination penalty recorded during the prior quarter.","Other operating expense of $65 million declined 13% year-over-year, primarily related to lower business promotion and advertising expense, partially offset by higher FDIC insurance costs. Regarding the decline in business promotion and advertising, recall that we announced during 2016, we would become the title sponsor of the lead FedEx playoff event during the third quarter.","The event to be named to Northern Trust will be held in New York area in August. We had expense associated with the Northern Trust Open in our first quarter expenses for the past several years, thus the reason for the year-over-year decline. Moving ahead, that expense will now be carried in the third quarter, when the new tournament will be held. Sequentially, other operating expenses declined 16%, primarily relating to lower business promotion and advertising as well as lower staff-related expenses.","Turning to page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fees ratio, pre-tax margin, and ultimately, our return on equity.","The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our return on equity.","This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business to drive fee growth and driving productivity within our expense base through our ongoing initiatives focused on location strategy, procurement and technology.","Turning to page 9, our capital ratios remain strong, with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 12.9% and 12.2%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 12.8% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 12.1%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer.","The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.9% and at the bank was 6.1%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.","With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 100% minimum requirement that became effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the first quarter, we repurchased 812,000 shares of common stock at a cost of $70 million. On April 5, we submitted our 2017 capital plan to the Federal Reserve.","In closing, despite remaining geopolitical uncertainty across the globe, the first quarter of 2017 was characterized by strong global equity markets, rising rates in the U.S., and low currency volatility as measured by the VIX and other measures, such as the JPMorgan G7 Currency Volatility Index.","Northern Trust delivered solid financial results in the quarter, growing earnings per share 6% and delivering a return on equity of 11.6%. This was accomplished while implementing a change in vesting with \u2013 for our restricted and performance share units that require the accelerated or immediate expensing for grants to retirement-eligible employees.","We generated both positive fee and total operating leverage in our commitment to improve the profitability of our firm and continue to maintain strong capital ratios. Our assets under custody and administration, assets under custody, and assets under management were up 13%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, compared to the prior year.","Our Wealth Management business grew trust fees 10% year-over-year, driven by solid new business coupled with favorable markets. This was done while maintaining a very attractive pre-tax margin of 37%. The success in the business was well diversified across our regions and our Global Family Office, which continues to demonstrate double-digit growth.","Our C&IS business also continued its strong growth trajectory. Trust fees were 7% year-over-year, largely driven by organic factors as markets and currency impact essentially offset each other. The quarter also included the announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire the Fund Service Units of UBS in Luxembourg and Switzerland. This acquisition will significantly enhance our client capabilities in these two very important Global Fund marketplaces.","On the regulatory front, there are two areas to highlight for you. First, as a result of changes to capital plan rules announced on January 30, 2017, we became a large and non-complex firm subject to SR 15-19 rather than a large and complex firm subject to SR 15-18, effective with the 2017 capital plan cycle.","With this change, our capital plan submissions are no longer subject to objection by the Federal Reserve Board on qualitative grounds in the CCAR process. In lieu of the qualitative assessment, we will be subject to a targeted horizontal review of specific areas of capital planning conducted as a part of the Federal Reserve Board's normal supervisory process.","Second, as noted in the Federal Reserve and FDIC joint press release, the agencies did not find the resolution plan submitted by Northern Trust at the end of 2015 to be not credible or that it would not facilitate an orderly trend resolution. Although the agency did not identify any deficiencies, there were three shortcomings noted. We are working diligently to address the shortcomings in connection with our 2017 resolution plan submission, which is due by December 31, 2017. We remain committed to advancing our resolution planning capabilities.","Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10:30 Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Don, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Good morning. So just first question around NIR, obviously very strong growth in the quarter and I was hoping to get a little more clarity around the jumping off point as we're thinking about 2Q. So, given the kind of relief on premium am, is 1.35% NIM still a good kind of run rate to think about and obviously whatever happens with the rates will be on top of that? Or was there any sort of catch-up that we need to think about that helped the NIM this quarter?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yeah. In the quarter, if we look at the NIM expansion sequentially, first, let me give some color to that, the NIM expansion was roughly driven up by about 10 or 11 basis points of what I would say were market factors, and 3 [basis points] was sort of a premium amortization benefit in the quarter. So, it was largely driven by rates.","In terms of \u2013 I know you're asking jumping off point to go forward. There's a couple of factors that I think that are important to consider in that. One is, whatever view you have on future rate increases, but the second is around deposit betas. And if I look at our deposit betas and if you look at our cost of funding, you can see that, generally, the betas remained low in the first quarter on our wealth deposits or our retail-based deposits that was very low betas. And on the institutional side, we have seen those betas move up to some degree, but they still remain relatively low. How those move with subsequent hikes will impact the NIM's ability going forward.","And then lastly, I would say, is the duration of our portfolio remained short. So the ability to reprice assets with any ramp in LIBOR will benefit us relatively quickly as those assets roll off and reprice into new assets.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","And then I'll just add to that. The premium amortization, we do usually see the fourth quarter and the first quarter as being more favorable than the second and the third quarter from a housing market activity standpoint. So, based on history, we have seen that track higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. And then just around the size of the balance sheet, down a little bit sequentially, not terribly. And I was just wondering whether or not it's some sort of a seasonal dynamic. I think we saw something like that in the first quarter last year as well. Or is this just a reflection of higher interest rates and there's a little bit more kind of rate chasing?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","As you rightly pointed out, it's largely flat sequentially. There was some rundown, very modest rundown in non-interest bearing deposits in the U.S. that was partially offset by growth in some foreign office time deposit growth that we've seen. But in general, if you look at our non-interest bearing deposits in particular, they've held around the $25.5 billion to $26 billion range fairly consistently. How that reacts to ever increasing rates will be important to watch and it is possible that some of that could start to move into interest bearing.","I would say, generally, the flattish balance sheet that we've seen reflects growth particularly in Europe where we've seen actually the foreign office time balance grow, I think, about 6% year-over-year.","Operator","We will go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks very much. Hello. You mentioned all the good double-digit growth across the board. In such an environment, do you think the expense to trust fee ratio would be better? How much of it do you think was impacted by some of this quarter's extracurricular expenses related to comp and all that? And do you have a pro forma number on what it would have been?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yeah. So, the first item I think that's important to think about in there is the compensation item that we walked you through into the script. That is just a change in vesting and an acceleration, if you will, of the expense into the first quarter. If you were to back that out, our expense growth rate which would have also been offset by the Northern Trust Open not being in this quarter.","If you net those two out, the expense to fee ratio probably would have come down to around the 1.08, 1.09 levels, there's other moving parts in there, so it was better. I would like to think that the growth rate, excluding the two items I mentioned, would have been about 6.3% expense growth rate versus the 8% as reported, which would have produced 1.75 points of operating leverage in the quarter. And that's probably a better way to think about that. There are other puts and takes in the quarter, but I think if you think about 1.75 to 2 points of operating leverage is probably a better way to think about what was truly in the quarter.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","Perfect. Exactly what I'm looking for. And then just a follow-up question to the NIM discussion. Why \u2013 I get the lower deposit betas on the retail Wealth Management side? Why do you think institutional betas are low now and should we expect to have a significant ramp on future hikes, I mean, don't clients want that?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yeah. I won't speculate on why they haven't moved at this point. That's a behavior of our clients that we've seen. In the case for, I think, the custody banks in general, there's still meaningful portions of that that are operational in nature and I think viewed as such by our clients. And so I think they have a certain level of stickiness to them. Those that are probably truly excess, I think we do feel that as rates continue to move up, we will see that concern, if you will, around rate advancement moving forward.","So I mean, they'll be interested in those rates on excess deposits. I don't know where that trigger point is. We're already experiencing clients who are seeing this now as we get closer to the 1% environment really make decisions between balance sheet and off balance sheet opportunities for what I will deem to be their excess cash. But meaningful portions of that, for us, really are operationally driven.","Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI","I understand. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Hi, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Hey. How are you doing? Biff, just wanted to walk through a little bit of this comp color that you gave on the script, which is definitely appreciated. So it seems like what you're saying is, most of what happened here was the 2017 grants, right, and so you're changing \u2013 you're accelerating the expense. Half of the expense is going to be done for 2017 here versus previous 15% to 20%.","So does that mean that we take about 30% of that $30 million dollar uplift? So really, if we think about how much this might impact next year, we still have the same uplift, because you'll be still expensing. You will just have a lesser amortization from 2017. And so net, instead of going up $30 million next year, it'd be more like $9 million higher? Is that right or am I missing something?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","So your thinking is right. The way you described it is absolutely right. We pulled forward the expensing to be about 50% this year. Assuming we do another grant in 2018 under the same terms, which is something we will decide at that point in time, but assuming we do, you will have the acceleration of the grants in 2018, plus some residual from grants in 2015 in previous years in there. So you're right to assume, this year would have the highest percentage. It will be on a declining basis in each of those years, but it will still be \u2013 there will be some seasonal expense associated with this change in vesting.","What I want to be clear on the call is, this change in vesting fundamentally isn't changing the overall expense amount associated with LTI other than in the past for retirement-eligible employees if they left, they could have had some forfeitures. That was a relatively small number relative to the size of the overall grant. So the total isn't different. It's just that it's going to be seasonal and accelerated into the first quarter over the next four years, while we have a four-year vesting on our restricted stock.","And the reason we did this, Brennan, just so everyone understands is it was for competitive positioning with our employees. We were in a minority of large financial institutions that did not continue to vest equity upon retirement. We do not continue to vest upon leaving for other reasons, but we do upon retirement now.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for walking through that. I think I get it at this point. So the next question that I would have would be on the AUC and AUM front. You said that on a sequential quarter basis, FX was a small uplift, so that's I think nice to see that switch to a tailwind, but \u2013 and that new business was positive, too. Is it possible to give us some specificity around how much came from FX on a sequential quarter basis, how much came from FX tailwind versus new business? Just so we can understand some of those components?","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","On a sequential basis, Brennan?","Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC","Please.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","So the currency impact would have been less than 1% on a sequential basis for the AUC. And really the market and the client flows were the main driver, a little bit more on the market than the client flows, but not by a whole lot.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","And, Brennan, on a year-over-year basis, of the 8% growth in fees, a little more than half was organic if we look at it that way, so if we strip out all of the things. So very healthy organic growth rates in AUC on a year-over-year.","Operator","We'll go to Brian Bedell for our next question with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Hey, Brian.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Maybe just \u2013 one more on the balance sheet, if you can talk a little bit about the loan repricing dynamic. You actually had a very good quarter there. Should we \u2013 in terms of how those loans are repriced and moving through core, should we expect a similar type of repricing dynamic in the second quarter based on the March hike? And then if you can just comment on your view on deposit beta within the Wealth Management unit, if you think that will be a little more elastic?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Let me take the second part of your question first, which is around the deposit betas. I would highlight for you that we are very much a follower in our liability pricing on that front. Our clients in the Wealth side generally \u2013 excuse me, our competition in that isn't always traditional regional banks, for instance, for our Wealth Management clients. So our ability to sort of lag the market a little bit as we think about our deposit beta pricing there has historically held true.","That being said, we do need to remain competitive. Our clients have choices and they're savvy investors, so they look at that. But the reality is that we're not funding an asset book, a loan book, as aggressively as some of the regional banks need to fund their balance sheet.","So, we're very much aware of the markets, but not generally leading in terms of deposit beta there. So if the market continues to have relatively low betas, I believe that we will follow suit. I don't \u2013 what we do have interestingly from our Wealth clients is, the opportunity to think about moving their assets from balance sheet to our funds. And as you know, we have a large cash fund complex, so we have the ability to capture those assets as they move between balance sheet and off-balance sheet opportunities. Do you want to talk about the loan side? Sure.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","Yeah. On the loan side, Brian, about 75% of our loan balances reprice within one year and much of that would be linked to one month LIBOR. The one thing I would say about the \u2013 when you look at the sequential growth and the loan yield, we saw about a 22 basis points sequential increase. There was a small amount of that that was relating to client overdraft that get recorded within loan balances. When we look at the core loan yield, we saw about an 18 basis points sequential increase when you strip out the impact from the overdrafts. So, hopefully that helps. But the loans do generally reprice 75% within one year. And like I said, the best measure to look at it would probably be one month LIBOR there.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And so in that repricing dynamic then, looking back, I guess, you had more leverage to essentially the December 2015 Fed hike within that one year pricing dynamic in the first quarter than the recent December hike?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yeah. So, we did \u2013 we have a bit more leverage to the first hike, yes.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then just lastly on expenses, on the expense to trust fee ratio, how should we think about? If we do get several more hikes over the next year and you generate, obviously, a lot more NIR, how should we think about your management of that expense to trust fee ratio, because obviously you'd have a much bigger denominator on the NIR side that would allow you theoretically to invest more in the business? Should we think of that as sort of stabilizing or even increasing the expense to trust fee ratio if that happen?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","No. So we remain focused on improving that expense to fee ratio in periods of time when we get strong net interest income revenue or if we're constrained by the interest rate environment. In fact, I would state that in periods of time when we get the net interest income benefit that we're seeing now, we still need to remain vigilant on the controllable expenses and the fee growth, and continue to create fee leverage. What is partially true is if we've got strong net interest income revenue flowing through, that may allow us to invest some of that in our businesses, but we're still committed to improving that expense to fee ratio regardless of the benefits that we see coming through the net interest line on a regular basis. If the net interest income were to constrict in some ways, then it's even more important to drive more leverage through the expense to fees in that environment. But by any measure, we're going to continue to try to improve that expense to fee ratio even with market rate tailwinds.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Hi. Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks. Hey, Biff, how are you doing? Just one more level set on the expense side then. So, just understanding the starting point and the incremental vesting, can you just help us understand the natural new first to second quarter seasonality and the netting of what comes down versus what goes up in terms of the high point versus starting to get the merit in, in the second quarter? I've assumed that's a net down, but can you help us understand the type of magnitude of what comes out of that comp and benefit side?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Sure. So, in the first quarter, you would have seen traditionally somewhere with the new \u2013 with the new vesting, you will see approximately 35% to 40% vesting of our LTI in Q1 with another, let's call it, 12% to 15% in Q2. That gets us somewhere to that 50% we would say we'd see in the first two quarters.","That will then start to ramp down in Qs three and four in terms of an overall vesting. So, Ken, if in the past we had $100 million worth of LTI, if you look at the previous year in our SEC filings of LTI, we would have historically expensed 25%, 25%, 25%, 25% over four years. Now, you will see roughly $50 million in the first two quarters and then $50 million delivered over the next three \u2013 50% or $50 million of $100 million over the next remaining quarters over four years.","So that dynamic will take place so that the rate of expensing will go down meaningfully then over the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the vesting life of the equity grant. In terms of the salary in the second quarter, as we said in the script, that our merit raise will take effect April 1, that will be an $8 million increase, but you will see the compensation associated with LTI come down meaningfully in the second quarter versus the $30 million that we quoted earlier on the call.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","And, Ken, so we had $30 million in retirement-eligible expense in the first quarter. And we did mention in the script because of the performance shares, they are expensed over the service period for retirement eligible. So not all of the performance share expense retirement-eligible hit in the first quarter, and we did mention that there would be $8 million of that that would hit the second quarter.","So, you have $30 million of retirement-eligible expense this quarter, $8 million in the second quarter and that in addition to that color, we mentioned the $8 million for the base pay adjustments will be a sequential increase as well.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. And then also, do we have typically lower payroll, just payroll in the second as well? Not merits, but just FICA and whatnot.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","Right, yeah, usually ...","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yeah, it starts to run down.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","Right.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yes. It does start to run down during the course of the year.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. So that's still a net decline, and then it declines in the second half and then we see how big next year's grant is. But if we presume the grants are about the same size, then this is more just about timing and reallocation across more into the first half than the second?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yes.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then \u2013 so just for the follow-up, it looks so \u2013 in a really good revenue quarter, and you exited out in response to Glenn's question, 6% year-over-year just absolute expense growth with some help from FX translation is still a sizeable expense growth number.","I know you're still adding staff, I know you had the resolution plan stuff. But can you just talk about just that from an absolute growth perspective still being a pretty high rate of growth? And is there anything underneath the surface that we can see on the \u2013 looking forward to show that we're either getting towards a peak or eclipse of some of that spend?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yeah. So let me walk through a couple of line items I think to help explain that what I'd call core expense growth rate. One of the meaningful lines that you see is the depreciation and amortization or the equipment software line was up 11% year-over-year. Some of that was a reflection of the capital investments that we've made to try to create some of the efficiencies that we help drive that run rate down that you described.","And we've always said that that is the one of the line items that would outgrow our fees while we utilize that capital spend. We saw that come through in this quarter and particularly it ramped up. Part of that was driven by \u2013 we've had some substantial capital projects that we effectively turned on for depreciation reasons. They were sitting in work in process and we turned on those in the fourth quarter \u2013 early first quarter work in process that was turned on. So that increased the depreciation rate. That's one of those. We don't anticipate is that you would see that kind of sequential ramp going forward in that line item.","So in equipment software, if you look at our location expense, if you will, or a rent expense, that had noise in it. We had a $3 million, $3.5 million decline year-over-year. And so while it looks like a double-digit increase, really it's getting closer to our run rate. And that's up about $1 million really if you strip out the year-over-year comparator.","So, we continue to try to drive on those expenses. We do need some expense growth to fuel 8% fee growth. So it's a story of trying to create the maximum amount of leverage that we can, Ken, but there is a certain amount of expense growth to fuel 8% growth in our top line as we did this quarter. And so we're trying to maximize that delta or that operating leverage versus fees and continue to try to drive net expense to fee ratio down further.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","And, Ken, you had commented on the current fee favorability on expenses and that was just under 1.5 points, but on the flipside, the trust fee growth was about 1.5 points less than what it would have been because of currency, so a drag on both side. Revenue was down a little bit more than a percentage because of that. So, the currency kind of net out, but adjusting for those, we would have had higher expense, but we also would have the higher fee growth and the higher revenue growth.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks a lot. Understood.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","Okay.","Operator","We will go now to Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Hey. Good morning, Jim.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. I'm just scratching my head a little bit on foreign deposit rates, why they went up about from 11 basis points to 17 bps. Is that sort of hedging activity? Why would foreign deposit rates be increased \u2013 rates paid be increasing?","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","So, this is Mark, within the non-U.S. dollar deposits \u2013 I'm sorry, the non-U.S. office deposits, there is a significant amount of those. In fact, most of those are U.S. dollar-based. So even though they're non-U.S. office deposits, and there is a mix of about \u2013 two-thirds of it, I believe, is the mix that's U.S. dollar. So, we did see higher rates in the U.S. So that's part of function of the deposit beta, but there is a mix there where the other non-U.S. currencies would not have seen the movements that U.S. did.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Right. Okay. That makes sense.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Correct.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And just maybe on just the deposit behavior, understanding uncertainty, but what have you seen over the last month since the March rate hike? Have you seen betas or flows change dramatically since the March hike?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","We have not seen them since the March hike, the behaviors meaningfully change.","James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Hi, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Hey. Biff, I wanted to ask you about capital a little bit. You're going into the CCAR now. Last year, you were looking at the growth as a reason to deploy less capital, because you were really still wanting to kind of have that flexibility, especially with the balance sheet growth you were seeing last year. As we've now kind of moved forward here, things have stabilized a little bit more. Do you feel like you could go back to what you were kind of deploying earlier in a sense of how much earnings you give back each year?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","So I would say that we're entering \u2013 or we entered the capital planning cycle from a position of strength. So as you rightly point out, our risk-weighted asset growth has slowed meaningfully. And that's a result of discipline inside the firm and looking at quite frankly loan-by-loan what the return on equity is for use of the balance sheet, particularly when we think about credit.","And what that's created is that those uses of balance sheet capital aren't returning the types of returns we talked to you about, the 10% to 15%, that we're judicious with the use of that capital. That then leaves us with decisions to make about how we then utilize that capital and maximize for our shareholders, and that's either internal usage. You saw us with the acquisition that we entered into an agreement with UBS. There's inorganic uses that we could do. And then there's obviously the return of that capital through the dividends and share buybacks that we would have asked for in our capital plan.","And I would just say that we certainly entered that cycle from a position of strength. As we said on previous calls, last year's total payout ratio as calculated by the Street was not a new trend. It was just simply meant to be what our 2016 ask was. And our 2017 ask will be appropriate for where we see our capital needs going forward.","So I think that's all the color I can give on that right now, but based on our CET1 ratio, we're in a position of very strong capital.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Good answer to a sensitive question. Now, I got an even more sensitive question to ask you. It's been a subject that we've talked about a lot, which is eventually when we get to some normalization of rates. We're not there yet.","But restructuring the balance sheet to protect against what Northern Trust experienced in the last downturn. Are you still thinking about at least rebalancing down the road as we think that rates are kind of getting to a point where there's as much chance that they go down as up? So just wanted to see if you were still thinking in that direction.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Well, we meet every month and consider from our ALCO committee the directions and the nature of the balance sheet and the structure of the balance sheet, and have active dialogues with input from our Chief Investment Officer, our Chief Economic Research, Carl Tannenbaum and others. And we have a view on the construct of the balance sheet. That has generally been guided, as you know, and kind of observed, by a conservative shorter duration construct to the portfolio.","We will weigh all the macro factors and come up with an asset allocation and an ALCO policy that we think does our best to generate returns for our shareholders, while protecting the strength of the balance sheet. And we've all worked here long enough to know that the strength of the balance sheet here is one of our most important items to protect.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","It is and conservative in the past was meant to avoid any mark-to-market adjustments. But when you have the strength in capital and the balance sheet you have, and we saw how much of the pain that came from short and \u2013 rates going down as far as they did, there is a little bit of riskiness left in that position that we had and Northern Trust had as they went into the last cycle. And maybe rethinking that as you go through the next cycle could be productive. So thanks.","Operator","We'll take our last questions from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Hi. Two quick questions. One just \u2013 one more on expenses, and it just has to do with the outing in the third quarter that you moved. We talked a lot about getting the expenses right between 1Q and 2Q. Could you just remind us roughly what the dollar spend is incremental that we should make sure we have in our 3Q numbers for the golf outing?","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yeah. So one way to look at that would be, if you look at the other operating expense in the quarter, it's a reasonable proxy for what it would cost, but I want to add a little bit of color here. The tournament in the third quarter is taking place in New York. It is a FedEx Cup event. It is the first round of the FedEx Cup event. And we can't, even for disclosure reasons, not only for ourselves but because of our contracts with the PGA Tour and others, give exact dollar amounts.","But you might imagine that a tournament in New York that's a FedEx Cup event would come at a premium and the entertainment around it would come at a premium. So if you look at that variance and put whatever multiplier you are used to putting on for something in New York versus other parts of the world, I would probably go ahead and do that. Sorry, we can't give the exact numbers on the cost.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","And in our 10-Q, you break out the other operating expense. You'll see the business promotion line is down about $11 million on a year-over-year basis. And we would say that very much the key driver on that was the Northern Trust Open.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it.","Mark Bette - Northern Trust Corporation","So that gives you some idea. Not specifically, but some idea.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Put whatever premium you think you should put on that for a tournament that is generally higher TV viewership in the New York marketplace. So we'll leave it at that.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Last question is on the Luxembourg acquisition you mentioned during the prepared remarks. I just wanted to understand how you plan to leverage that. I know that you went up quite significantly in ranking with the acquisition in Luxembourg, but I would expect that you could leverage that position into your existing customer set a little bit more. Maybe you can give us some color around that.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Yeah. That's absolutely the strategic intent. We were subscale in Luxembourg, which is one of the two or three largest fund markets in the world. We'll be able to \u2013 for our large global clients who have fund complexes in the Lux marketplace, this will give us an opportunity to more holistically service their needs.","We've been able to service a lot of these large asset managers in the UK or in Ireland. And now, we'll have the capability to service their Luxembourg funds as well. It also gives us access to the Swiss marketplace, which I believe will be one of the two, I think, the largest fund administrator in Switzerland when we move in there.","So, we're really excited about the strategic fit and opportunities to leverage existing relationships where we really didn't have a scalable service in Luxembourg and now we will.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","S. Biff Bowman - Northern Trust Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session and brings to an end today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.","S.

This will allow us to move through the queue and allow as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits. So, thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman ","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call. As is our customary practice, today I will review our results for the quarter after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions.","Starting on Page 2, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $231 million, earnings per share were $0.94, 25% higher year-over-year. Our return on equity was 11.3% in the quarter. Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mixed in the first quarter, a theme which has been ongoing for some time. U.S. equity markets were higher year-over-year with the S&P 500 up 10%, but relatively flat sequentially. International equities as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index were down approximately 3.5% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially and were negatively impacted in both comparisons by a stronger U.S. dollar. In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was up 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.","Client assets under custody ended the quarter at 6.1 trillion, up 6% over last year and 2% versus last quarter, and assets under management ended at 960 billion, up 5% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. I\u2019ll provide further details on asset trends later during this call. Currency markets had multiple impacts this quarter. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 33% higher than the first quarter of last year and 22% higher than last quarter. Currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity. Currency rates which influence the translation of non U.S currencies to the U.S dollar impact client assets and our revenues and expenses. The dollar was stronger both year-over-year and sequentially. Dollar strength tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth, but benefited expense growth. Short-term interest rates rose slightly compared with the fourth quarter yet remained at very low levels, continuing to pressure our net interest margin and resulting in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three month LIBOR and the fed funds effective rate both increased 2 basis point sequentially to 26 and 12 basis points respectively and the overnight repo rate increased 1 basis points to 15 basis points.","With those comments providing context on the environment, let\u2019s move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 9% with non-interest income up 10% and net interest income up 5%. Expenses increased 3%, primarily reflecting higher compensation, equipment and software, and employee benefit expense. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 4.5 million in the quarter primarily reflecting a sustained improvement in the level of non-performing assets. Net income was 27% higher year-over-year.","Compared to last quarter revenue was flat with non-interest income up 1% and net interest income down 2%. Expenses increased 1% due primarily to higher employee benefit expense, business promotion and equipment software offset partially by lower outside services expense. Net income declined 5% sequentially as the prior quarter included a 9.5 million income tax benefit. Excluding last quarter's income tax benefit net income was 2% lower sequentially.","Page 4 let's look at the result in greater details starting with revenue on page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately 1.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees the largest component of revenue were 728 million in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially fees in our Corporate & Institutional Services business increased 7% year-over-year and declined 1% sequentially while fees in our wealth management business grew 7% year-over-year and were unchanged sequentially. ","New business and higher equity market were both drivers of growth but currency translation as I mentioned earlier detracted from overall fee growth. The impact was approximately 2 percentage points year-over-year and 1 percentage point sequentially. Fee waivers were approximately 33 million in the first quarter relatively unchanged both year-over-year and sequentially. I'll go into further detail on trust and investment fees shortly. Foreign exchange trading income was 72 million in the first quarter up 43% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Currency volatility was higher in the first quarter, client trading volumes were also higher both year-over-year and sequentially. Other non-interest income was 75 million in the first quarter up 15% from last year and 3% lower sequentially. Within other non-interest income securities commission and trading income was again strong at 20 million as we continue to see strong demand for interest rate protection products from our personal clients. ","Other operating income of 39 million in the quarter increased 2% year-over-year but declined 6% sequentially reflecting lower income associated with a third party servicing agreement which was modified in the fourth quarter. If you recall we said last quarter about half of the income recorded in the fourth quarter reflected the third quarter impact of the modified agreement. Net interest income which I will also discuss in more detail later was $267 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially.","With that backdrop, let\u2019s look at the components of our fee revenues on Page 5. For our corporate and instructional services business, fees totaled 407 million in the first quarter up 7% year-over-year and 1% lower sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees; the largest component of C&IS fees were 277 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.6 trillion at quarter end up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflects new business and market conditions including higher equity and bond markets offset partially by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.","Investment management fees in C&IS of 76 million in the first quarter were up 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. Assets under management for C&IS clients were 727 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in C&IS assets under management was due to higher equity and fixed income markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger dollar on international assets. In the sequential quarter comparison, modest improvement in equity markets and new business were both contributors to the increase.","C&IS investment management fees were impacted by fee waivers on institutional money market mutual funds totaling 15 million. Securities lending fees were 22 million in the first quarter, 5% lower than last year and 1% lower sequentially. Year-over-year results reflect lower spreads across asset classes with the largest decline in U.S. equities offsetting the impact of higher collateral levels. The sequential quarter decline reflects higher collateral levels offset by two fewer days in the first quarter. Securities lending collateral was 123 billion at quarter end, up 6% both year-over-year and sequentially.","Other fees in C&IS were 32 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 13% sequentially due to higher sub advisory fees. The sequential quarter increase also reflects seasonally higher revenue for benefit payment services.","Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were 320 million in the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year reflecting higher equity markets and new business. Growth was relatively consistent across the regions and global family office. Wealth management fees were up slightly versus the prior quarter as new business was largely offset by higher waived fees in money market mutual funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were 233 billion at quarter end, up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Money market mutual fund fee waivers in wealth management totaled 18 million in the current quarter, flat compared with last year, but up 1 million compared to last quarter.","Moving to Page 6, net interest income was 267 million in the first quarter, 5% year-over-year and up 2% compared to the fourth quarter. The year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by a larger balance sheet as client deposits averaged 87 billion in the quarter, up 7% versus last year. Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin, which at 1.1% in the first quarter was down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, net interest income was lower due to two fewer days in the quarter, a slight decline in earning assets was offset by 2 basis point increase in our net interest margin, which resulted from a favorable mix-shift in earning assets. We continue to see growth in our loan portfolio with average loans and leases increasing 2% sequentially and we reallocated a portion of our short-term interest bearing deposits into our securities portfolio which was 7% higher sequentially.","The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 5 basis points sequentially, about 4 basis points of the decrease in yield was due to higher premium amortization in our mortgage back securities portfolio versus the prior quarter. Premium amortization in the fourth quarter was $10 million, compared to 4 million in the year ago quarter and 7 million in the fourth quarter. Loan balances averaged 32 billion in the first quarter up 10% or 2.9 billion year-over-year and up 2% or approximately 700 million sequentially. We saw solid loan growth this quarter across commercial and institutional, private client and commercial real estate, partially offset by a lower level of residential real estate loans. The yield on the loan portfolio increased 1 basis point sequentially.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were 789 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Compensation expense increased 4% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation. The impact of staff growth and annual merit increases was largely offset by the favorable impact of movements in currency rates. Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 75% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila and Limerick. On a sequential basis compensation expense was essentially flat as higher equity based incentives including the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement eligible employee were offset by the impact of movement in currency rates, staff growth was 1%.","Employee benefit expense increased 9% year-over-year primarily driven by higher pension and employee medical expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense increased 16% due to the higher pension expense, payroll taxes and medical expense. Outside services expenses were down 6% both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting a lower level of expense in a number of categories including legal, consulting and third-party advisor fees. Equipment and software expense was up 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially reflecting higher software amortization as we continue to invest to support clients, improve our efficiency and meet regulatory and compliance requirements.","Other operating expense increase 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher charitable donations and higher deferred amortization expense related to client on boarding. In the sequential comparison other operating expense increased 3% reflecting seasonally higher business promotion and marketing cost associated with the Northern Trust open.","Turning to page 8, we continue to make progress on our goal to sustainably improve profitability and returns the focused execution that I have highlighted this morning has resulted in continued improvement in the ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees from 113 in the first quarter of last year to 108% this quarter. This combine with the slight moderation in the revenue headwinds that we have faced in recent year including growth and foreign exchange trading and net interest income produced meaningful operating leverage and resulted in improvements in our pre-tax margin to 31% and in our return on equity to 11.3%.","Turning to page 9, our capital ratio remains solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios up 10.5 and 11.8 respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advance and standardized. Both were lower when compared to prior periods. The decline in the transition basis advanced common equity Tier 1 ratio was primarily due to higher risk weighted assets given mix changes on the sheet as well as higher operational risk weighted assets due to modeling refinement. The decline in the transition basis standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio was primarily driven by the implementation effective January 1st 2015 of Basel III standardize risk weighted assets.","On a fully phased in basis our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.5% and under the standardized approach will be approximately 10.3%. All of these ratios are well above the full phased in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.4% and at the bank was 5.6% both of which exceed the 3% requirement applicable to Northern Trust. ","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules. As we announced in March our 2015 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.36 per share. And its regular meeting later today our board of directors will consider formal approval of the planned dividend increase which is expected to be payable July 1st. In the first quarter we repurchased 1.6 million shares at a cost of 1.7 million. In addition, our 2015 capital plan provide for the repurchase of up to 675 million of common stock between April 2015 and June 2016. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio Northern Trust is above the 80% minimum requirement effective as of January 1st 2015, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective of January 1st, 2017.","In closing the first quarter demonstrated continued progress in driving our return on equity deeper into our target range of 10% to 15%. Execution around both growth and efficiency priorities remain strong and is evidenced by meaningful operating leverage generated in the quarter. And our C&IS business momentum remain strong with announced wins such as the government employee Superannuation board of Australia and AutoCanada based [indiscernible] Trust as well as a robust pipeline of new opportunities.","New business was diverse both geographically and across products and clients segments. Our wealth management has solid new business results as well. Record level of AUM and AUC coupled with strong loan growth helped to deliver positive results in the quarter. From a financial perspective, while we have moved our return on equity into our target range we remain focused on further enhancing profitability.","Before I conclude as its customary for our first quarter earnings call we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual begin which began at 10:30 central time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question and answer period earlier than our normal practice.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I will be happy to answer your questions. Casella, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.","Brennan Hawken","So the fully phased in Basel III capital ratios declined quarter-over-quarter in about 30 bps for standardized and 40 for advanced, what drove those declines?","Biff Bowman","So there are a couple of factors that we need to consider here; first is the phase to Basel III. So largely it was a risk weighted asset impact. The two point that you talk about approximately 75% were driven by that conversion and then 50% were driven -- up to 50 basis points were driven by the shift in asset mix on the balance sheet. So we have greater loans and we moved items out of our fed deposits if you will into other earning assets. And is as expected we -- these are as we would have expected to move under the migration into Basel III and the shift-mix if you will on the balance sheet into assets that draw the RWA up again about 50 of the basis points and then 150 basis points is simply to move to the Basel III standardize.","Brennan Hawken","But I was actually asking on the fully phased basis, your fully phased as you guys reported last quarter, standardized 10.6, this quarter at 10.3 and the advanced was 11.9 and this quarter to 11.5. So does that mean that on the fully phased basis it was purely based on asset mix on the balance sheet?","Biff Bowman","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right.","Brennan Hawken","Okay thanks. And then thinking about -- what you just referenced the deposits with fed, what drove that shift quarter-over-quarter? They dropped almost in half, is that something that you expect to be sustainable and is that some progress that you're making in decreasing non-operating deposits?","Biff Bowman","I don\u2019t know that the halfing is something that we\u2019ll continue, but we\u2019re just trying to put the balance sheet items to work. The asset mix as you can see shifted to the shorter end of the securities portfolio, so we have just put those items to a more effective use than 25 basis point deposit at the fed. I don\u2019t think you should anticipate a half -- continued halfing though.","Brennan Hawken","No, sure, sure of course, I just -- and the other part of the question does that mean is it right to infer that maybe non-operating deposits might have decline too, which gives you the confidence to switch it over to securities?","Biff Bowman","No I don\u2019t think you can make that inference.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll move now to Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Luke Montgomery ","So just a question on the base line fee rates for which we estimate a fee waivers. I think some investors are concerned that the fee waiver disclosures, maybe not just for you, but for the industry are calculated on fee rates that haven\u2019t been negotiate for a long time and clearly your yields on those funds could be primarily lower. In the past, I think you\u2019ve discussed you're recapture expectation and the possibility of how competition might play into that, but more fundamentally in providing those disclosures, is your basic assumption that fee rates are roughly what they were about six years ago?","Biff Bowman","So, we\u2019ve reprised some of our money market fee assets more recently than that, I think 2012 was the most recent reprising in a portion of our money market fee asset. So it's not fair to say that some of those aren\u2019t current, but we are revisiting in light of the money market reform and all the other acts, we are constantly revisiting if you will our bulk of product offerings and capabilities as well as the competitive pricing landscape in that space.","Luke Montgomery","And then on sec lending in February, you said a couple of pair of class action lawsuits for about; I think it was three quarters worth of sec lending revenue. So could you just remind us are there other suits outstanding of a similar nature or is this issue pretty much put to bed and then had that already been accrued for in prior earnings or was there an impact in the P&L this quarter?","Biff Bowman ","As we previously disclosed we did agree to settle the alleged class action claims arising out of the client investments in the Northern Trust index funds that experienced losses from securities lending during the financial crisis. We took the 19.2 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2013. The parties obtained preliminary court approval for the class wide settlement during the first quarter of 2015 and the final approval hearing has been schedule for August of 2015. So there are still some items that we are reviewing in the process the best sort of the most recent update we have on our securities lending.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll move next to Glenn Shor with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Glenn Shor ","A NIM question if I could on the yield front, so yields on the loan -- so I think 22 basis points year-on-year they fell double that on the debt front which is helping support [indiscernible] among other things. So the question is, is the drop end loans -- how do you attribute to rates versus pricing versus mix of products and on the debt front? I\u2019m assuming there is a component of rolling off high [cost] debt, could you talk about maybe the year ahead and in terms of what's rolling off and can we still expect to same year-on-year trends?","Biff Bowman ","If you will on the loan mix and if you will -- the lessening of the yield. The mix of products there has moved from, as we talked about residential real estate into what we would call investment secured loans. Those have a lower yield but they are well secured in high credit quality. So the mix shift there has driven a lot of that change if you will in rate, in terms of the first part of your question in the loan mix. So the areas we are growing our loans in have a slightly higher lower yield then the traditional residential real estate and others. So that is driven most of the loan mix down. In terms of the debt we did have last year 500 million of senior notes and then in the first quarter of this year we had 125 million sterling note which was used financed the bearings acquisition about a decade ago roll off in the first quarter. And then as far as the rest of the year we along with the treasure in the [indiscernible] committee of the firm look at our debt structure on an ongoing basis to determine what type of debt structures we will have over that roll off.","Glenn Shor ","Okay, nothing imminent schedule?","Biff Bowman ","Nothing.","Glenn Shor ","I know you're sure on time, go ahead you can move on. Thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ashley Serrao","Just a boarder question, expenses in general. You are off to a good start in the first quarter, as we think about the balance of the year what are some of the puts and takes which we should mindful of in terms of reinvestment and maybe any other efficiency gains in the horizon?","Biff Bowman ","So as we've discussed before we have many ongoing expense initiatives around the firm. I talked about our location strategy for instance and we gave some numbers in our talking points were last year a little north of 75% of our higher were in our locations that we would call Operating Centers in Tier 2 and Tier 3 locations. That will continue ongoing and we've done a great job of managing our consulting and legal expenses that we've talked about that are other drivers on the expense front. Those can be episodic, particularly legal can be episodic but some of the disciplines that we put in place around there have aided us in the expense measures that you see here and in the expense performance that you see here. In essence it's a business as usual on the expense product, we've embedded some of the disciplines around the expense to trust fees that we talk about is been embedded into our businesses and people are gearing their expense growth rates to be in line with our trust fee growth rates.","Ashley Serrao","And just a quick follow up. Just in FX if you look at the cumulative pre-tax impact was this last quarter or a year ago what was it?","Bev Fleming","Are you talking about the impact of the currency rates?","Ashley Serrao","Yes, the exchanges rates.","Biff Bowman ","If you're talking about the impacts on the P&L for us, to give some indication if you look at revenues sequentially we would have had 7% on trust fees -- excuse me $7 million of trust fees were impacted negatively. And then if you looked at it on a year-over-year basis that would have been about 15 million negatively impacted by the strengthening dollar, that\u2019s an important line. On the expense side if I look at [indiscernible] largest expense line it was $14 million impact year-over-year and sequentially also 7 million. Just trying to give you some idea of our two main expenses.","Operator","We'll move on to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell ","Maybe just go back to expenses very good cost control in the quarter. I was just trying to understand a little bit more granularly some of the what you would identify as seasonally high or first quarter and then some of the -- as mentioned I think the lower consulting and legal fees. Just trying to isolate that as well.","Biff Bowman ","So we do have some seasonality in our expense as you noted. We have the Northern Trust open and then we have certain compensation related expenses particularly with option expense for retirement eligible individuals that are seasonal. I think if you look probably historically you'll be able to see the spike particularly in our business promotions and other lines in your analysis to see. We felt pretty good about our ability to absorb that increase in expense in the first quarter and still maintained expense growth rates at you saw in our earnings release.","As for things like legal and consulting, the disciplines we put in place around the use and the contracts, and the rate cards with those individuals, I think will allow us to create some permanent savings, but take legal for instance there is -- there can be episodic situations where we need to utilize outside law firms for situations and we continue to manage the cost of the rate cards, but if we have to use legal firms more for entities going forward or consultants for needs going forward it could move that needle around. I think most of the other expenses again are very much in line with the expense-to-trust fee ratio that we talk about and people are embedding that into their allowable growth rates in their businesses.","Brian Bedell ","And then just maybe on the outside services, do you view that run rate as a sustainable run rate borrowing anything unforeseen in the first quarter?","Biff Bowman","I am hesitate to say that that\u2019s a run rate because of the episodic nature of some of it, but I think there is a portion of that that is permanent, but there is also the episodic need. So I am not sure I am willing to concede.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Blostein","Question on the asset management business and the I guess the organic growth, I know you guys don\u2019t give that to us here and that\u2019s sort of a wish, but broadly speaking if I look at the AUM growth up 4% quarter-over-quarter it\u2019s up quite nicely despite the FX headwinds in the market helped to some extent, but I am assuming that\u2019s not all of it. So just got a curiosity here where the growth is coming from? We\u2019ve definitely seem a lot of incremental growth in the past with strategy seeing that, predominantly what\u2019s driving that and maybe what the pipeline looks there?","Biff Bowman","So if we look at our growth in our AUM and our asset management business in general, we did see growth in our cash funds in the quarter, we\u2019ve seen growth in our OCIO business, our outsourced Chief Investment Officer business, very much we\u2019ve seen growth in our enhanced equities strategy. Our three areas where we\u2019ve seen growth are ETF business also has continued to grow as well. So, we\u2019ve had -- and it's been -- I would also say it's been global as well, that growth has been both domestically here in the U.S. and particularly in Europe and in the Middle East we\u2019ve seen significant growth in our AUM.","Alex Blostein","And then just my follow-ups to business initiative, the cash business, given the fact that the bigger banks continue to seek pressure on the balance sheet size and more cash continues to move off to the sidelines. Given your roll in the cash management world both on the money market fund side, but also I guess some of the balance sheet capacity since you guys are not, that\u2019s a lot of constrained like your peers. Just curious to think about how you guys think about that opportunity relative to some of your peers given the fact that there is still -- feels like a lot of cash in the systems that needs home and nobody sort of wants it?","Biff Bowman","We\u2019ve assembled a cross business unit project team which would as you describe encompass both professionals from our asset management business and our treasury team to look really in servicing the liquidity needs of our clients and in some cases that liquidity needed is balance sheet and in some cases that is in some form of money market fund or some other type of cash vehicle. There is a cross Northern Trust wide team looking at that, working with clients to understand their solution needs and it\u2019s very active and moving forward at a pace as you might imagine, in conjunction with the money market reform that you see on the asset management side but also in relation to other financial institutions that have taken a very different tact around large deposits and we -- right now we view each of those on an individual basis, but we\u2019re looking at that as I said across the business with a real holistic approach to client liquidity needs.","Operator","[indiscernible] with Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","A little bit on the securities lending business, you mentioned that the spreads look like they continue to be under pressure, you had okay period in collateral growth and we did see little bit disconnect between LIBOR and sec funds this quarter. So can you talk through to some of the underlying dynamics and if anything is just changing fundamentally inside the security lending business or if it was just some anomaly from this quarter?","Biff Bowman","On volumes we did see a pickup in borrower demand particularly in U.S. equities and U.S. corporate bonds, our sequential volume growth was impacted -- we have sequential volume growth. However it was essentially offset by two fewer days in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and I know you're asking from macro trends as well. We also saw sort of for us a mix shift in the impacted fee splits so our clients with different fees split were more in the market than those with perhaps more favorable to Northern fees splits. And so the clients having those less favorable fee arrangements represented a larger portion of our revenue in this quarter. Fundamentally though I don\u2019t think we saw any other macro level issues that we would call out on the call. I would note in the second quarter we get our dividend fees and ramp up in security funding so we anticipate that in the quarter. ","Unidentified Analyst","And then my follow up is just on the same topic. So historically securities lending spread, did you tend to widen when we get an advance of that rate cycle. But I'm just wondering this time do we actually have to wait for the administer grade to change. Or should we anticipate that as dead funds in LIBOR go up in advanced of the actual fed cycle. How would you expect that dynamic to work this cycle if any different form prior.","Biff Bowman","I don\u2019t know that I can answer that, if you want to be all candor. I'm not sure that I\u2019ll have a good answer for you on that. ","Unidentified Analyst","I'll follow up offline.","Operator","We'll go now to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Betsy Graseck ","Couple of questions on wealth management. We've seen some headlines on some of the neutrals that are coming out of the West Coast they're known as robo advisors. I'm not asking if, if you\u2019re going down that road, but is there something in the technology that you could use to leverage that kind of concept and get even more efficient, freeing up some of your folks to spend more of their time on client acquisition or enhance there wallet in using some of these tools?","Biff Bowman","We are -- our product team insight is actively looking at if you will the capabilities that those type of robo advisors if you will bring to the market. And if you will considering the technology that would enable our client situations more effectively and it is an emerging trend, our president of our wealth management business spends significant amount of time on the West Coast meeting with individuals to further understand the technologies if you will that are driving the wealth management business forward. So you're right, there is technology there, it today doesn\u2019t target our typical client as you might suspect. But I think the nuances and the capability under penning the technology there is of interest to us to continue to evaluate. ","Betsy Graseck ","And the follow up is just on the fiduciary standard language that came out of departmental [liberalizing] was last week. I'm sure you had took the time to look through that just wondering if there is any change in how you approach the marketing of your clients given that language come of the DOL.","Biff Bowman","We believe our wealth management remains very well positioned versus others vis-\u00e0-vis the new fiduciary standards. A brief overview from a financial perspective we would expect minimal negative impact because our model is a fee based model, other have commission oriented models with different compensation structures. Ours are largely discretionary structures which don\u2019t lend themselves to some of the issues the department of LIBOR has timed on. If you think about the discretionary incentive awards for our individuals, the factors that drive them are really based on client satisfaction, client retention and risk management and not driven by product placement and some of the other elements that the department of LIBOR is concerned about. And then lastly I would say this for 125 year the firm has been driven by fiduciary responsibility and we don\u2019t some of these new requirement that department of LIBOR is talking about here is new news for us in that space.","Betsy Graseck ","So opportunity for potential mortgage or gain as the DOL has tightened people awareness around the need for fiduciary responsibility. And maybe there is a marketing effort that will ring little bit more clearly in people minds.","Biff Bowman","We hope so.","Operator","We'll move next to Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Foreign exchange is up about one fifth quarter-over-quarter and about two fifth year-over-year. How much that is sustainable? How should we think about that?","Biff Bowman","So it is highly links to volatility and volumes. So it's very links to the volatility that you saw. We have taken -- as we discussed we have taken efforts to look at our e-commerce platforms and other solutions for clients that has modestly driven up our client volumes and our client share. But still the lion share of this is driven by the volatility that we see. We're hoping to further through products and capabilities and solutions, have more that is sustainable as you describe, but it's partially linked to volatility.","Mike Mayo","And what are the key drivers of that volatility when you do the analysis and is that continuing into the second quarter?","Biff Bowman ","Well we used probably the same things that you do to looking at the JP Morgan, G7 currency volatility or the emerging market volatility index in the [seats], we have into April seen the same types of volatilities that we\u2019ve seen and I -- we believe that you have the possibility of Central Bank divergence on monitory policy it could continue to create at least the need for more volatility or create volatility in the foreign exchange system.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll move next to Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Adam Beatty ","On asset management just interested in any differences that you're seeing between your overseas and domestic clients, whether that\u2019s in C&IS or wealth management just in terms of the level of new business or asset allocation and whether maybe currencies effecting that? Thanks.","Biff Bowman ","If you look at our business and our asset management business globally, in the U.S. it has a strong balance between our asset, our wealth management business and our corporate institutional businesses. Outside of the U.S. that becomes largely an institutional base for our AUM and it has a significant position in our passive products if you will and particularly to large sovereign wealth funds those are meaningful clients across the globe outside the U.S. So there is obviously substantial pools of assets there and they need those kinds of index products. And in U.S. in the domestic product market, we have a wide arrays of suite of products in our asset management that are attractive to our clients from alternatives to ETFs, to mutual funds, to cash products, to active equity, et cetera. So it's a much broader spectrum.","Institutionally, in the U.S. we also have a broader array, it still has a heavily cash and index component on the institutional side, but we do have an array. But on the wealth side it's a much broader mix product capabilities.","Adam Beatty ","Thank you, really appreciate the detail and then just a quick follow-up on the OCIO business, how much synergy is there between that and custody and asset servicing, do you look for cross selling there or is it more of a stand alone? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","Tremendous synergies and if you think it from a -- we may be providing the custodial services and as part of a solution set to that client, they need help or they\u2019re seeking help, or they\u2019re seeking to outsource some of the pension responsibilities or the investment responsibilities, we become a fairly natural solution for them and there is synergies in the ability to bundle that product and service together.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy ","Biff, can you share with us an update on the funding over in the European markets where there are negative interest rates and you\u2019ve passed on the cost to some of your customers, what\u2019s been the reaction by the customers? And also what percentage of those deposits are actually being -- that cost is being passed on them, in the markets where there are negative rates?","Biff Bowman","So we do have several markets, you're correct where we have a negative rate environment. We have the Euro, we have the Danish krona, we have the Swiss franc, our three areas where we have gone negative if you will with our clients. In terms of the spread if you will on that it's interesting in some cases it depends on the reinvestment possibilities that we have in those. So we -- in some cases we have seen the spread erosion occur where the spread is narrowed and in others we\u2019ve been able to maintain that if you will that spread even with negative rates.","I will say that we on a continuous and an active basis we monitor the markets, we understand where we\u2019re able to reinvest and we have active dialogues with our clients about in some cases perhaps the need to press further negative into the rate environment where Central Bank\u2019s continue to take more aggressive negative rate stances.","Allison Quaintance","Gerard, one thing that I would add to that is that of the three currencies where we\u2019re currently charging negative rates, the one that is really the most significant for us from a client balance perspective as the euro and I think we had mentioned last quarter that while we had seen a run up in our Euro balances when our rates was not negative, we did see that come down we went from about \u20ac4 billion to about 3 billion, kind of stabilized at that level in line with what our expectations had been and I guess after that initial response, we have seen those balances drift up, but just modestly. In terms of the Swiss franc and the Danish krona is about the balances is there from client, they\u2019re really quite small.","Gerard Cassidy","And about what percentage of customers are being passed on this cost? Is it half of the deposit base or a third or all?","Allison Quaintance","A vast majority.","Biff Bowman","A vast majority.","Gerard Cassidy","And then second, there has been some evidence of loans that are tie to Euro bar, that when the Euro bar rate has gone negative the variable rate loan, the spread over the loan is also pushing the loan yield negative meaning the bank is being forced to pay the borrowers. Do you guys have any loans tied to these negative rates where you could be at risk, where you would be forced to pay the borrower?","Biff Bowman","We don\u2019t as of our last asset liability committee meeting because we walked through this scenario. But we keep our eyes very closely pealed to I know what you're describing and to date we don\u2019t have that situation. But we're continuing to stay close with the negative movement in the rate. Most of our lending is domestic in this dollar based; in fact I believe all of our lending is dollar base.","Operator","And we'll move now to Jeffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Elliott","On the 20 million or so year-on-year increase in foreign exchange trading income. Can you give us sense of what if, any expenses all attached to that incremental income or does it all just drop through to pretax?","Biff Bowman","There are some but they are relatively modest level of expenses. There is compensation related expenses that would move with that success in the foreign exchange trading market. But there is not much else in way of incremental expense that moves with that.","Operator","We'll move next to Brian [indiscernible] with KBW. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","I just have a quick question on the wealth management specifically looking at the East region. I know you have been seeing growth there relative to all the other reasons but look like for the last four quarters revenues kind of plateaued and I know in the past you kind of talk about a j-curve when you are in certain markets. Kind of outline where you are at on that j-curve in the market? When you kind of expect to see enhance growth in that market again? ","Biff Bowman","So I would take a step back and say that our east region is very broad geographically, it goes from Miami Florida to Boston. So I think you need to sort of peel back into market by market type analysis which we don\u2019t have in here. So we've got markets within there that have stronger growth trajectories than what you see here overall. We are -- and continue to have very large market share and meaningful presence in the Florida coast and we're building out that presence from what I would say the Washington D.C. quarter. We have meaningful presence in New York but continue to work on increasing our presence and penetration in that market all the way up to Boston.","So I don\u2019t know that I can specifically make a comment on generically about the East because it's made up of so many markets along the Eastern sea board. So some with great growth dynamics and some where we continuing to invest and want to deliver more.","Unidentified Analyst","Would say that the investment in the North East is going to pick up year-over-year than in 2015?","Biff Bowman","It continues to be a growth initiative for our wealth management area and we continue to invest both marketing and probably more important talent [dollars] into the region to facilitate that growth.","Operator","We'll take our final question today from Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neil. Your line is open.","Jeff Harte","Looking at assets under custody the growth has been consistently impressive and the market share gain opportunity is pretty clear with 6 trillion versus some peers north of 30. Can you talk a little bit about what is actually driving the market share gain you're seeing there? Is it a better product offering than competitors? Is it simply entering new markets and winning your share of bids? What's actually driving that logistically?","Biff Bowman","I'll answer that with a few points. One is we had success in regions where we've grown quickly. So let me highlight Australia and we highlighted an Australian wins. So there is an example where the regionality and our strength in that region has helped drive that market share growth, that\u2019s one area where we've seen net growth. Most notably has been our success in our servicing asset manager or our global fund services business. We've seen really substantial double digit growth in that business over the last three or four years and our ability to compete against our primary competitors in there and be successful has grown remarkably over the time. And then I would end with product and capabilities, technologies like what we have -- from in our hedge fund services, the Omnium acquisition and other elements of technology. The combination of technology, regional strength and growth particularly in our GFS business have allowed to market share gains. ","Jeff Harte","Is GFS; is that a function of operating it to new markets where maybe you hadn\u2019t been before?","Jeff Harte","In some cases geographic markets, in some cases its product and capabilities. So it's a combination of both. And then the scale that we've achieved in that business makes us competitive force.","Operator","And this does conclude our Q&A for today. I\u2019ll turn the call back to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Bev Fleming","Thank you, Biff and thank you everyone for joining us today. Allison and I would be happy to take additional questions as the rest of this week unfolds and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter call in July. Have a good day.

Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings conference call.","Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $242 million. Earnings per share were $1.01 and our return on common equity was 11.4%. A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Let me review how some of these factors unfolded during the first quarter. Equity markets rebounded in March after a volatile and negative start to the year.","In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter down 0.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. In the international markets, the MSCI EAFE index was down 10.7% year-over-year and down 3.7% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and fourth quarter 2015 markets were generally higher.","In bond markets, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index was lower year-over-year and higher sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 index was 2% higher than the first quarter of last year and 12% higher sequentially.","Foreign exchange market volumes were varied in the first quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 11% to 14% year-over-year, and up 19% to 24%, sequentially. You\u2019ll recall that currency volatility and client activity influenced our foreign exchange trading income. Currency rates influenced the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses.","Dollar strength, primarily versus the British pound sterling, tempered custody asset growth and related fee growth while benefiting expense growth. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher following the Federal Reserve rate increase in December. Thee-month LIBOR and the Fed funds effective rate averaged 62 and 37 basis points respectively, both higher sequentially. The overnight repo rate was also higher averaging 46 basis points in the quarter.","Let\u2019s move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased 5% with noninterest income up a modest 1% and net interest income up a strong 18%, expenses also increased 5%. The provision for credit losses was $2 million. Net income was 5% higher year-over-year.","In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 3% with noninterest income up 2% and net interest income up 6%. Expenses were essentially flat when compared with the fourth quarter. Net income was 1% higher sequentially.","Client assets under custody of $6.2 trillion increased 2%, both year-over-year and sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, strong new business was partially offset by lower international equity markets and the currency translation impact of a strong dollar.","In the sequential quarter comparison, new business, favorable quarter end equity markets, and currency translation were all contributors to asset growth. Assets under management were $900 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Lower equity assets were the primary driver due to outflows from certain sovereign wealth fund clients and weaker global equity markets.","In addition, fixed income assets were lower, primarily due to the loss of one passive mandate from a non-U.S. institutional client, which I mentioned last quarter. Assets under management increased 3% sequentially, primarily driven by higher cash and equity balances.","Let\u2019s look at the results in greater detail starting with the revenue on Page 4. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was approximately $1.2 billion, up 5% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $748 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially.","Lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were an important driver this quarter. Fee waivers were approximately $8 million in the first quarter, lower by $25 million year-over-year and $13 million sequentially. I\u2019ll go into further detail on trust and investment fee shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was $61 million in the first quarter, down 15% year-over-year and up 15% sequentially. Lower client volumes drove the year-over-year decline, while the sequential improvements reflect higher volumes and volatility. Other noninterest income was $74 million in the first quarter, down 2% from last year and up 9%, sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflects higher other operating income.","In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $2.3 million related to our decision to exit a portion of a non-strategic loan and lease portfolio, which I mentioned on this call last quarter. Our fourth quarter results included a $1.1 million net loss in other operating income related to the same decision. Net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later, was $314 million in the first quarter, increasing 18% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.","Let\u2019s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $433 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 1%, sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $286 million, up 3% year-over-year and unchanged sequentially.","Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.7 trillion at quarter end, up 2% both year-over-year and sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business partially offset by the unfavorable impact of equity markets and currency translation. Recall that lagged market values factored into the quarter\u2019s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $89 million in the first quarter were up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, driven in large part by lower money market mutual fund fee waivers. Fee waivers in C&IS were approximately $2 million lower by $13 million year-over-year and $6 million sequentially, driven primarily by higher gross yields in the funds.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $670 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the outflows that I mentioned earlier and up 3% sequentially, due primarily to a $15 billion increase in cash balances and a $5 billion increase in equities.","Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, 5% higher than last year and 1% higher sequentially, primarily reflecting higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was a $106 billion at quarter end and averaged to $115 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels decreased 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower loan volumes in U.S. treasuries. This asset class has been most impacted by the regulatory landscape, as actions have been taken by agent lenders and borrowers to calibrate capital usage in the securities lending business.","Other fees in C&IS were $35 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services and other ancillary services. In the sequential quarter comparison, other fees were up 4%, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payments business.","Moving to our wealth management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $315 million in the first quarter, down 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Within wealth management, the global family office business have strong performance with fees increasing 13% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, due to solid new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers.","Performance in the regions was lower in both comparisons, as lower money market mutual fund fee waivers were more than offset by the impact of unfavorable lag markets and lower fees on equity mutual funds. Recall that fees within the regions are based on month lagged asset value, so the difficult equity markets in January and February negatively influenced first quarter fees.","Money market mutual fund fee waivers in Wealth Management totaled approximately $6 million in the current quarter, down $12 million year-over-year and $7 million sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates on the gross yields in the underlying funds. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $230 billion at quarter end, down 1% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially.","Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $314 million in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, driven by higher level of earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Earning assets averaged $105 billion in the first quarter, up 6% versus last year, driven by higher level of deposits. Demand deposits, which averaged $26 billion increased 19% year-over-year and non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits, which averaged $49 billion, or up 4% year-over-year. We saw solid loan growth again as loan balance averaged $34 billion in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year.","On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income increased 6%, primarily driven by higher net interest margin, as average earning assets were unchanged sequentially. The net interest margin was 1.21% in the first quarter, up a 11 basis points year-over-year and up 10 basis points sequentially. The improvement in the net interest margin primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets as short-term interest rates rose following the Fed\u2019s move in December.","In the sequential quarter comparison, the benefit of higher interest rates was partially offset by higher premium amortization or mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Premium amortization was $6 million in the first quarter, up from less than $1 million in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were $829 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially. Compensation expense of $379 million increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth, the impact of last year\u2019s annual base pay adjustments, and higher accrual for incentive compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates.","Staff levels increased approximately 5% year-over-year with more than 60% of the growth emanating from our global operating centers in Bangalore, Manila, and Limerick. On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher performance-based incentive compensation, including the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement eligible employees and the immediate vesting of certain restricted stock units awarded in the first quarter.","Employee benefit expense of $71 million decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower pension expense. On a sequential quarter basis, employee benefit expense increased 2%, due primarily to seasonally higher payroll taxes, partially offset by lower medical and lower pension expense.","Outside services expense of $150 million was a 11% higher year-over-year. The increase primarily reflects higher technical services expense and higher consulting expense due to evolving regulatory requirements. On a sequential quarter basis, outside services expense declined 3%, primarily reflecting lower consulting expense.","Equipment and software expense of $114 million was up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher software related costs in support of client and regulatory technology initiatives. In the sequential comparison, equipment and software expense was down 2%, primarily reflecting lower equipment related expense.","Other operating expense of $74 million increased 1% year-over-year and was unchanged sequentially. In the sequential comparison, seasonally higher business promotion expense related to the Northern Trust open was offset by lower expense in various other categories.","Our loan loss provision was $2 million in the first quarter. This compares to a provision credit of $4.5 million in the year earlier quarter and a provision credit of $18.5 million in the fourth quarter. Recall that we changed our methodology for estimating inherent losses effective December 31, 2015. This change resulted in the provision credit of $18.5 million last quarter.","Loan quality remains very strong with nonperforming assets of $174 million at quarter end, down 7% versus year-end and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans equal to only 48 basis points at quarter end. The effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 32.7%.","Turning to Page 8, a key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expenses to fees ratio pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expenses to trust an investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress, as it addresses what we can most directly control, reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement and our return on equity.","We have seen the ratio hold steady or move slightly upward over the most recent quarters, as both macro and seasonal factors can impact this measure in the short-term. This metric remains an important barometer of our progress and we remain committed to lowering it on a sustainable basis going forward through continuing to win new business, to drive fee growth, and drive productivity within our expense base, our ongoing initiatives focused on location, strategy, procurement, and technology.","Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remains solid with common equity Tier 1 ratios of a 11.6% and 10.6%, respectively, calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.4% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 10.3%. All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer.","The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 6.1% and at the bank was 6%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement, which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2015. With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above the 90% minimum requirement effective as of January 1, 2016, and is also above the 100% minimum requirement that will become effective on January 1, 2017.","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Our 2015 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to an additional $145 million of common stock through June 2016.","In closing, the first quarter of 2016 was characterized by volatile markets, low commodity prices, low and even negative interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Despite that difficult backdrop, Northern Trust produced solid financial results growing earnings per share 7% year-over-year and delivering a return on equity of a 11.4%.","Our sequential performance demonstrated our commitment to improving our operating efficiency. Expenses were essentially flat to the fourth quarter even with the seasonal uplift the results from the Northern Trust open and annual equity compensation grants. In addition, we returned $234 million for our shareholders through dividends and stock purchases, while maintaining strong capital ratios and funding our growth.","Our wealth management business grew revenues 3% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive returns achieving a pre-tax margin of 34% in the first quarter. Our ability to serve complex client needs and create sophisticated solutions for our clients was evident within our global family office business, which serves ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices.","Global family office had strong new business at a 13% trust fee growth in the quarter. C&IS continue to grow as well. One growth driver over the last couple of years has been providing services to help our clients meet new regulatory requirements. For example, we provide depositary services, so clients can meet their AIFMD, UCITS V, and other asset safety related regulations.","Another growth driver has been providing new tools and technology to enhance our client\u2019s oversight of their increasing investments and alternatives. We\u2019ve recently announced the exclusive agreement with AltX to offer our clients access to the largest amount of data for hedge funds on a single platform. These are just a couple of examples how we\u2019re growing our business by doing more for our clients.","I\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge that this will be Bev Fleming\u2019s last earnings call after remarkable 15 years as our Director of Investor Relations. So many of us within Northern Trust have relied on her expertise. Her wisdom, advice and counsel will most certainly be missed. Please join me in wishing her well in retirement.","We\u2019re also fortunate to have Mark Bette joining Investor Relations. Mark joined Northern Trust in 1994 and has served in a number of leadership roles within finance, including a Senior Financial Analyst and Investor Relations from 2001 to 2006. He brings a wealth of knowledge about the firm to the role.","Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today\u2019s call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10:30 Central Time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice.","Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust first quarter earnings conference call today. Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions. Zack, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ashley Serrao","Good morning, Biff.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, Ashley.","Ashley Serrao","So first question just on a couple of expense line items. I wanted to get a sense if you feel that outside service expense has finally normalized somewhat. And also if you could share some color on what drove the reduction in occupancy despite all the growth efforts?","Biff Bowman","Yes. I\u2019ll take the first part of that on outside services in terms of normalizing. The regulatory environment still remains robust and we need to continue to make investment in that, but we will continue to get feedback from the regulators as our CCAR was submitted last week, April 5, and as we sense that. But there are other line items inside and outside services that I think we demonstrated control of in the quarter, and those include, I would say non-regulatory consulting spend, legal spend, and other items inside of that category that I think we demonstrated good discipline during the quarter.","So I\u2019m hesitant to tell you where that run rate will go. But I think the vigilance around the most controllable items inside of that we remain steadfast on. The second part of your question was around\u2026","Bev Fleming","Occupancy expense\u2026.","Biff Bowman","Occupancy expense in the quarter. From an any given quarter, we could have certain leases that we need to advance the accounting work, make changes to the accounting that could move it by a modest amount in this quarter. Certain leases in Europe were adjusted. But the \u2013 that\u2019s essentially what we did in the quarter.","Ashley Serrao","Okay. Thanks for the color there. And just one clean up question on expenses. Can you quantify the seasonally higher comp items this quarter, what were they in total?","Biff Bowman","So seasonally we do have, as we said in the script, we have certain equity expense that relates to the vesting of retirement eligible individuals that is a first quarter seasonal expense that we experienced to deal with our retirement eligible employees option expense for them.","Bev Fleming","And as it is \u2013 this is Bev. Those numbers will be disclosed in our 10-Q, so I would ask you to refer to that. There\u2019s a table in the 10-Q that will provide you some of that information and that\u2019s probably the best way to get the exact figures that you are looking for.","Operator","We will take our next question from Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Adam Beatty","Thank you, and good morning. A couple of questions on asset servicing, particularly hedge fund and mutual fund. I want to get your thoughts on the recent FSOC update, which seems to call for greater data collection and also assurance around third-parties, and then maybe get your thoughts as well on the termination of Aurora 50 South and how you are thinking about M&A in that area? Thank you.","Biff Bowman","Let me take the second part of your question first. Alternative investments really remain a strategic priority for Northern and 50 South Capital, our alternative arm. I don\u2019t really have anything to offer beyond what was announced in the press release after consideration from all parties we mutually agreed to terminate the agreement.","In terms of the second part of yours was the FSOC on certain data requirements for mutual funds. I think can we get back to you on that question? Bev and I will and Mark will follow-up with you Adam on that one.","Adam Beatty","Sure, that\u2019s fine. Yes, just and maybe a follow-up on Aurora and 50 South, Do you feel as though M&A continues to be a good way to expand your asset servicing and hedge fund servicing business, or are you looking more around partnerships or expanding services organically? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","So our general philosophy on growth has been to do it through organic means. However, when opportunities to either fill a product gap, a geographic gap, a technological gap, or a regional gap, as I said our geographic gap, as I said, we will be opportunistic in those, but we really fundamentally still have an organic growth bias. And so in this space, discussions with Aurora were based on filling client and product needs, and we will continue to look at the strategies I laid out for you.","Operator","And we go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, two quickies related to net interest income.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hi, Biff. The two were you mentioned I think $5 million of premium amortization, just curious what the impact was on the NIM in the quarter if this is a big jump up? And the other part was with average securities up 8%, curious on what you\u2019re buying on the asset side these days, and what the change in duration, if any of the overall securities portfolio was?","Biff Bowman","Okay. The premium amortization as we described in the quarter, it was up sequentially from the fourth quarter. I think it was $6 million in the quarter. We have discussed in the past that amortization is typically $9 million to $10 million in a quarter. It can move so it was slightly better than the normal run rate, but in the fourth quarter of 2015, we actually experienced kind of a low at only $1 million of premium amortization. So sequentially, it actually hurt the returns. On a year-over-year basis, it actually helped by a small amount, actually a modest amount. So that\u2019s a little bit of color on premium amortization.","In terms of what we\u2019re buying and the improvement in the security portfolio, first of all, I would say the \u2013 we benefited from the rate move in the portfolio. We did at about -- you could see about a $1 billion of treasury securities. Those were largely five- to seven-year duration purchases, but swapped back to something closer to three months. So the duration in the portfolio was really not extended, but we were able to get some enhanced feel there. We did have a small portion of that billion that we went out a little longer in duration. So the overall duration of the index duration of the portfolio only increased modestly.","Glenn Schorr","Okay. So I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like this \u2013 this is the most rational jumping off point we have for the NIM going forward?","Biff Bowman","Yes, that\u2019s a reasonable assumption.","Glenn Schorr","Excellent. Okay, thanks, Biff and Bev, you\u2019re the best.","Bev Fleming","Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Hey good morning, guys. So just picking up the discussion around NII and NIM. So, Biff, it sounds like the securities overall has to be very short duration. There might be additional benefit just as the security portfolio kind of reprices even, I guess, if you don\u2019t get them anymore hike this year. Can you help us understand that dynamic a little bit more, so if 120 is kind of a decent starting up point assuming no more rate hikes, how meaningful of a benefit could we still see through the NIM from the initial hike?","And the follow-up also around the net interest income discussion. It looks like the ending balance sheet ended a bit higher than the average. So just wondering whether it\u2019s the timing of the kind of net new business that came in a little bit later in the quarter, or is it just the typical and quarter stuff, so the balance sheet was a little bit lower, but the average should kind of normalize, as we\u2019re looking to the second quarter.","Biff Bowman","So I\u2019ll take the second part of the question first. The ending balance sheet is just traditional quarter end balance sheet maintenance that can happen. It can move, as you know on March 31 or any quarter end period based on client activity, et cetera. So I would say there was nothing unusual about that movement from our perspective.","In terms of the NIM and the expansion or potential expansion of the NIM, two components that I want to address there. First is, you have to remember that approximately half of our balance sheet is in foreign office time deposits. And in some of those places, we\u2019re experiencing negative spreads and others where that compression is not impacted by necessarily by treasury rates.","In the U.S., two things to consider there. If there are no further rate hikes, many of our assets repriced in the first three months of this year or since the rate hike, but there are still some repricing opportunities left inside of that portfolio, remember, it\u2019s of a short duration. So there is some benefit in there.","So I would say, we\u2019re going to wait and see how that plays out. But to-date, as you rightly saw in the NIM, the data has been relatively close to zero and the assets have been able to reprice, so we\u2019ve been able to capture that 11 basis point increase in the NIM.","Glenn Schorr","Got it. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks, again, and\u2026","Biff Bowman","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just on the trust fee side, you\u2019ve got a great benefit obviously also from the first hike on the fee waiver side. Can you just help us understand, if we got another hike, do you anticipate at this point now seeing the experience of the first hike that you\u2019d get the rest of the seven and change back?","Biff Bowman","Yes. The \u2013 we did get a majority of the waivers back with the first hike. And our anticipation would be that, we would get a significant portion with the second hike that remains. But we have, as you can reduce we had meaningful movement with just the first 25 basis point hike in that.","Bev Fleming","And, Ken, another way to think about that is the fees on the funds for the retail fund family, 35 basis points for the institutional fund family, 22 basis points. So I think that should help to answer your question.","Ken Usdin","Yep, okay. And then my second follow-up is just on the \u2013 just a follow-up on the wealth management business, which and this come up in the last couple of quarters. But you mentioned the mutual fund pricing in there, and I\u2019m just wondering, if you give us some of the underlying growth dynamics, if we take out that fee waiver recovery and wealth management the growth rate of wealth continues to be slower than the positive growth rate that we\u2019re seeing in C&IS.","So just any other dynamics that just help us understand in terms of whether it\u2019s pricing or activity on top of that clear explicit one you mentioned on the mutual funds one?","Biff Bowman","Sure. So in the quarter new business and lower money market mutual fund fee waivers weren\u2019t really sufficient to offset the drag from, remember, we have month lag equity markets. So the fees are based on February month end, which was still quite down, and the lower fees on equity mutual funds, as you discussed.","If you think about this, there\u2019s an ongoing and broad industry trend towards passive management, as investors continue to face lower overall returns. And they look to control what they can control, which is namely fees. So we have seen that kind of fee pressure in our funds into lower cost alternatives. So the combination of the month lag in the fees, the migration, if you will to lower fee structured products was not enough to offset the positive fee waiver in the quarter. We do still think relative to the industry that the growth rates are healthy and that the business is indeed strong, it\u2019s just a difficult macro environment for that business.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Best of luck, Bev.","Biff Bowman","You bet.","Bev Fleming","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Great and congrats Bev also and welcome back Mark. The first question is just on just trying to get a better handle on the expense trends going into second quarter you mentioned on the occupancy side, the lease adjustment and as we think about some of the cost-cutting that you\u2019ve had and then I guess merit increases, I think we\u2019re posting to 3Q, I believe, if that\u2019s correct?","Biff Bowman","Correct.","Brian Bedell","And if you could just talk a little bit about that trajectory coming into the \u2013 sort of the second quarter \u2013 through the CCAR process as well?","Biff Bowman","Yes, so if you think about \u2013 let me start with the first quarter. There is some seasonality in the first quarter that you can see if you look historically. As it relates specifically to the occupancy expense, I think looking at a longer period of quarters in the past, probably gives you a better indication of the run rate in our occupancy expense. So that line item as you look historically has remained fairly consistent. And that\u2019s probably your better trending.","Other line items you suggested, we did differ salary increases to October 1st for all employees. So that we did April of 2015, we did merit salary increases. We will not have that in this sequential comparison and we continue to be vigilant on business promotion non-regulatory consulting spend and all other key discretionary line items and there is a continued focus on that line item as we enter Q2 and beyond.","Brian Bedell","Great and then just a follow-up would be just on customer behavior, I guess first of all on the deposit side, you said the deposit beta was extremely low, went through the passing on rates. Do you see any impact on deposit behavior? And then similarly you mentioned within wealth management, obviously continued shifts towards passive products, do you see that trend across your wealth management franchise continuing?","Are you seeing more of your own manufacture products such as FlexShares into that client base and should we expect to the \u2013 sort of the revenue yields, you\u2019re obviously capturing that on the passive side, but the revenue yields would potentially be pressure longer-term in that trend?","Biff Bowman","Yes, so in terms of the client behavior, first part of your question on deposit behavior, we do not see any exodus of clients based on our deposit base that we push through. So we did not really see that and you can see that from sequentially a very stable balance sheet size and even growth on a year-over-year basis, which is really driven by I would say our core organic growth rate, so no real behavior changes.","In terms of the migration from active to passive, what I would say first is that in some cases that\u2019s from higher fee to lower fee solutions as our clients have struggled to get returns. They focus on what they can control, which is the fee portion of that. So they\u2019re looking for lower fee opportunities.","And in some cases, along that spectrum from active to passive, there are our product and capabilities that we continue to discuss with our clients. Those could be FlexShares, those could be engineered, paid our engineer equity offerings. So we do have products along the spectrum if you will between fully active and fully passive to help \u2013 some of that fee compression that we talked about.","Brian Bedell","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to David Long with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","David Long","Good morning guys.","Biff Bowman","Good morning.","David Long","We\u2019re talking about the change in active versus passive and my question just looking at the Corporate & Institutional Services, the custody fees and the Investment Management fees, given a strength in the markets and the decline in the fee waivers, how do expected those lines would be a little bit stronger? Is that \u2013 is this just go back to that mix shift change? Why those lines maybe didn\u2019t have the full benefit?","Biff Bowman","So in the C&IS business, it was a smaller AUM. As we talked about in the past sovereign wealth fund migrations as they needed to convert those assets for whatever those reasons were for the sovereign wealth fund. So we\u2019ve seen a lower base on those. So smaller AUM and I think that\u2019s probably driven more than offset migrations into passive solutions at this point, though the sovereign wealth fund an example was down almost 33% from a year-over-year, the AUM, down to, I believe $46 billion and down 32%, as I said year-over-year. So their low basis point realization of products, but high AUM.","David Long","Okay, got it. And then as a follow-up, the effective tax rate was down 32.7% in the quarters, seems a little bit lighter than where it has been running. Any reason for that and should we expect it to normalize?","Biff Bowman","I would say that it was normal actions that can be taken in any quarter typically those could be APB23 actions, they could be the release of a small reserve in a region or something like that. But it will typically be normal, if you look historically that that\u2019s probably the right rate to put into your thinking.","David Long","Great. Thanks, Biff.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","I was just wondering about the buybacks and I heard what you did this quarter. But I was wondering, if you included within that some incremental like we\u2019ve seen some of the other institutions this quarter or de minimis addition to what was approved last year?","Biff Bowman","Betsy, we did not \u2013 our total payout ratio as you can see is very high and we did not utilize the de minimis exception.","Betsy Graseck","And I was just wondering if you would consider doing that in the future, or was there a reason why it shows not to do that, given the strength of the capital ratios that you have?","Biff Bowman","Yes, first of all, I think, we already have a very high payout ratio, as we look at this. And our capital ratios, if you look at our common equity Tier 1, it\u2019s sort of in the median of the CCAR banks and we view that as the prudent level in terms of right now how we think about that.","Betsy Graseck","Okay.","Biff Bowman","We\u2019ll say we will use it, but we didn\u2019t use it last quarter.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And is there any consideration for potentially issuing pref and doing buyback just to use that bucket, which some other people have used wondering if that how you think about that?","Biff Bowman","Yes, we always evaluate our capital structure and in fact obviously spend meaningful time evaluating it as a part of our submission of our capital plan. And we think about all the ways we could maximize our capital structure.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. All right. Thanks very much and Bev have a great retirement.","Bev Fleming","Thanks, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Okay.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Biff Bowman","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Bev, it just seems like yesterday you joined Perry [ph], so congratulations on your return. Biff, I apologize, I had to jump off on the call, so if you address this, I can read in the transcript. But you guys are doing a very good job in driving that ROE higher, as you show in Slide 8 in the presentation. I know the business at times can be seasonal. Are we at the best you can do for whether it\u2019s the margin at 30.6% or the noninterest expenses as a percentage of trust and investment fees, because when I look at first quarter 2015, you\u2019ve kind of given an apples-to-apples approach those numbers in first quarter 2015 are a little better. These are good numbers I recognize that, but are we at the best, or do you think there is improvement to be had?","Biff Bowman","So we\u2019re indeed committed to driving long-term improvement in the expense to fee ratio, and it remains a key strategic focus. And that obviously has a knock on impact to produce better ROE. Improvement in the ratio was driven by achieving positive fee operating leverage.","And as is the case with operating leverage in the short term, there could be periods of time where we have degradation in the ratio sometimes due to seasonal impacts. This quarter, for instance, while the ratio would have benefited from lower level fee waivers, the seasonal expense impact of stock-based compensation in the Northern Trust open more than offset the improvement in fee waivers.","So we remain focused on the two parts of that equation that we can the first is and what I would describe is the organic growth rate of our fees. And the second is on the strategic long-term initiatives on the expense side include location, strategy, procurement, technology. If we focus on those things that we can control, we think we can continue to drive that down.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then just as a follow-up and again I apologize if you have given this number. I believe many of the banks are going to see higher FDIC premiums in the third quarter to boost up the reserves of the FDIC. Did you guys disclose what you expect your premium or will you see higher premium and if you will, can you disclose what that number will be?","Biff Bowman","Yes. Right now we anticipate in the third quarter of 2016 that we would have an incremental $3 million headwind. Obviously, balance sheet size and other things can move that around, but that\u2019s \u2013 our anticipation is about a $3 million headwind starting in Q3.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi, good morning, Biff.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Sort of quick question. Since the last Div Arb season over in Europe, there has been a lot of discussion about from tax regulators, as well as politicians on investigations about Div Arb. Have you heard anything additional about that from clients, or is there any concern that there would be less seasonality in the Div Arb season this year?","Biff Bowman","At this point in time, we are entering that season and our team anticipates a similar seasons they have experienced in the past in my conversations with them.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay, good. And then some of the large like [ph] few years also had a Living Well feedback given to them. Does their feedback affect how you think about the outside services fees and how that run rates over the back of the year, I know there is some increase due to the feedback that you got from regulators from Living Well. So it is the fact that some of those banks have passed and it\u2019s generally looking like there\u2019s a blueprint for the Living Well process allow you to kind of lower those fees over the back half of the year?","Biff Bowman","Yes. So at this point we\u2019ve not received feedback. So we haven\u2019t had a designation made regard to Northern Trust 2015 resolution plan. We don\u2019t have any indication as to when that determination will be announced for us from the Fed or the FDIC. That being said to answer your question, we have been in regular contact with the Fed and the FDIC.","We have engaged industry expertise to help guide us through that process, and we are certainly reading the feedback given to our two closest competitors as in that our business model is similar in structure and that we can learn from the feedback that they\u2019ve received, which is public. We will incorporate that into our thinking around our resolution planning. So more to come, as we get our feedback.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it appears we have no further questions at this time.","Biff Bowman","Okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Bev, thanks again for everything.

What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectation of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those expressed or implied by this statement because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. I urge you to read our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.","During today's question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.","Before turning the call over to Biff, I would like to review with you some of the larger nonrecurring items that are impacting the year-over-year comparison. These items are outlined on Page 12 of today's presentation.","In the current quarter, we recorded a charge of 22$.8 million related to severance and personnel related costs. As outlined in our earnings release, $19.5 million of that charge appears in the compensation line, $2.5 million in employee benefit expense, and $0.8 million in outside services expense. Excluding this charge, our expense in the second quarter totaled $915 million.","Our actions taken this quarter reflect a continued focus on improving profitability and returns and we expect the charge to produce annual ongoing savings of approximately $18 million once fully implemented.","In the prior year's results, you'll recall that there were several items that we reported to you last year. A pretax charge of $118.2 million and other operating income on the sale of $1.1 million Class B visa shares, a pretax loss of $21.6 million associated with our loan and lease portfolio, of the $21.6 million in losses, $18.9 million was reflected on the other operating income line with the remaining $2.7 million reflected within net interest income.","A pretax charge of $46.5 million and other operating expense in connection with the settlement of certain securities lending related litigation. A pretax charge of $18.6 million and other operating expense relating to contractual modifications associated with existing C&IS asset servicing clients, and a pretax charge of $17.5 million related to severance and personnel related costs. Excluding these items, the prior-year quarter's revenue was $1.2 billion and expense was $842 million.","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to Northern Trust second quarter 2017 earnings conference call.","Starting on Page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported second quarter net income of $268 million. Earnings per share were $1.12 and our return on common equity was 11.6%.","Excluding the current quarter severance charge that Mark noted, net income was $283 million, earnings per share were $1.18 and our return on common equity was 12.2%.","Our assets under custody and administration, assets under custody and assets under management increased 15%, 16% and 14% respectively compared to the prior year reflecting favorable markets and our continued success in winning new business.","A number of environmental factors impact our businesses as well as our clients. Before going through our results in detail, let me review how some of those factors unfolded during the second quarter.","Equity markets performed well during the quarter. In U.S. markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 15.5% year-over-year and up 2.6% sequentially. In international markets, the MSCI EAFE Index was up 18.9% year-over-year and up 1.7% sequentially. Recall that some of our fees are based on lagged market values and first quarter markets were also up compared to the prior year, as well as sequentially.","In bonds markets, the Barclays U.S. aggregate Index was down 3.4% compared to the last year and up 0.7% sequentially. Currency volatility as measured by the G7 Index was 28.3% lower compared to last year and 21% lower sequentially.","Foreign exchange market volumes were also lower during the quarter. As measured by two of the interbank brokers, volumes were down 6% to 14% year-over-year and down 2% to 8% sequentially. You'll recall that currency volatility and client activity influence our foreign exchange trading income.","Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound ended the quarter down 3% compared to last year while the euro ended the quarter 3% higher.","On a sequential basis as compared to the U.S. dollar, the British pound and euro both strengthened by 4% and 6% respectively. U.S. short-term interest rates were higher during the quarter most evident in three-month LIBOR which averaged 121 basis points during the quarter compared to 107 basis points in the prior quarter and 64 basis points one year ago.","Let's move to Page 3 and review the financial highlights of the second quarter. Year-over-year revenue was flat. Excluding the items Mark noted, revenue was up 8% compared to last year with noninterest income up 7% and net interest income up 13%.","Expenses increased 1% from last year. Again adjusting for the items that Mark noted, expenses were up 9% from one year ago. The provision for credit losses was a credit of 7 million. Net income was 2% higher year-over-year. Excluding the previously called out items, net income was up 11% from the prior year.","In the sequential comparison revenue was up 3% with noninterest income up 5% and net interest income down 3%. Expenses were up 5% compared to the prior quarter and net income was down 3%. Excluding the current quarter severance charge, both expense and net income were up 2% sequentially.","Return on average common equity was at 11.6% for the quarter down from 12.3% one year ago and equal to the prior quarter. Excluding the current quarter severance charge return on average common equity was 12.2% up from last year's adjusted 11.9% and up from last quarter's 11.6%.","Assets under custody and administration of 9.3 trillion increased 15% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of 7.4 trillion increased 60% compared to one year ago and 4% on a sequential basis. For both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons, strong new business and favorable market impacts were the driver. On a sequential basis, currency translation was [indiscernible].","Assets under management were $1 trillion up 14% year-over-year and up 3% on a sequential basis. Favorable market impacts were the primary driver of both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons.","Let's look at results in greater detail starting with revenue on Page 4. Second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.3 billion. Excluding last year's call out items that Mark highlighted, revenue was up 8% from last year and up 3% sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $848 million in the second quarter up 9% year-over-year and up 5% from the prior quarter.","Foreign exchange trading income was $50 million in the second quarter down 22% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both comparisons were primarily impacted by lower currency volatility.","Other noninterest income was $82 million in the second quarter. This was down 53% from one year ago. Excluding last year's net gains on the sale of Visa Class B shares, other noninterest income was up 8% from one year ago and up 10% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance were primarily driven by higher securities commissions and trading income, as well as net gain on hedging activities. Net interest income which I will discuss in more detail later was $350 million in the second quarter increasing 14% year-over-year but down 3% sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on Page 5. For Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $487 million in the second quarter up 9% year-over-year and 5% on a sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $327 million up 12% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially.","Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons benefited from strong new business and favorable equity markets with the year-over-year growth partially offset by the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates. On a sequential basis currency exchange rates were benefit.","Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $6.8 trillion at quarter end up 16% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. These results primarily reflect new business and favorable markets. Currency exchange rates were also a benefit on the sequential comparison. Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $99 million in the second quarter were up 5% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential comparisons were driven mainly by favorable markets.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $763 billion up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Favorable market impacts were the primary driver of both year-over-year and sequential comparisons.","Securities lending fees were $25 million in the second quarter, 8% lower than one year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower spreads partially offset by higher volumes. The sequential increase was driven by higher volumes but partially offset by lower spreads.","Recall that during a rising rate environment spreads can at first narrow as the maturity profile investments results in a lag before the cash reinvestment yields adjusted the higher rate environment. Securities lending collateral was $131 billion at quarter end and averaged $133 billion across the quarter.","Average collateral levels increased 14% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. The growth in collateral amounts and associated loan volumes compared to a year ago was driven by loans of U.S. and international fixed income securities. The sequential increase was driven by loans of both U.S. and international equities.","Other fees in C&IS were $36 million in the second quarter up 10% year-over-year reflecting higher fees from investment risk and analytical services, benefit payments and other ancillary services. In the sequential comparison, other fees were down 6% primarily reflecting the normal seasonal pattern in our benefit payment business.","Moving to our wealth management business, trust investment and other servicing fees were $361 million in the second quarter up 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Within wealth management, the Global Family Office business had strong performance with fees increasing 17% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Each of the regions also performed well during the quarter. Across Global Family Office in each of the regions both the year-over-year and sequential growth was driven by favorable markets and new business.","Assets under management for wealth management clients were $266 billion at quarter end, up 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially.","Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $350 million in the second quarter up 14% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $110 billion in the second quarter up 3% versus last year driven primarily by higher level deposits.","Non-U.S. office interest-bearing deposits which averaged $57 billion were up 12% year-over-year. Loan balances averaged $34 billion in the second quarter and were down 2% compared to one year ago.","The net interest margin was 1.28% in the second quarter and was up 12 basis points from a year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a higher yield on earning assets due to higher short-term interest rates.","On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was down 3% as the net interest margin declined 7 basis points sequentially as the favorable impact from higher U.S. short-term rates was more than offset by higher premium amortization and a change in the currency mix of our balance sheet.","During the quarter we saw U.S. dollar denominated deposits decline. These declines were more than offset by increases in non-U.S. dollar deposits mainly in British pounds and Euros. These non-U.S. dollar deposits are lower margin and U.S. dollar deposits given the low interest rate still persist in euro.","Thus this currency mix shift adversely impacted the net interest margin. Premium amortization was $15 million in the second quarter compared to $20 million one year ago, and $1 million at first quarter.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were $937 million in the second quarter and were 1% higher than the prior year and up 5% sequentially. Excluding the charges in both years, current quarter expenses of $950 million increased 9% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially. Compensation expense was $433 million and increased 11% compared to last year and 2% sequentially. Excluding the severance-related charges in the current quarter and the prior year's results, compensation was up 10% year-over-year and declined 3% sequentially.","The year-over-year growth was attributable to base pay adjustments, staff growth and higher performance-based compensation, partially offset by the favorable translation impact of changes in currency rates. Recall that for this quarter we had two sets of base pay adjustments in the year-over-year comparison as the 2016 increases were deferred until October 1 of last year, and the 2017 adjustments were effective April 1, of this year.","Staff levels increased approximately 6% year-over-year with the growth all being attributable to lower cost locations which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe. The higher level of performance-based compensation was driven by long-term equity-based compensation, as well as a higher level of accrued cash-based incentives.","Equity-based compensation increased $8.5 million compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily attributable to a change in the vesting provisions associated with the retirement eligible employees which allows their restricted and performance stock units to continue to vest upon retirement.","Recall that we discussed this change on last quarter's call and we highlighted that with this change approximately 50% of the expense associated with this year's grants wasn't been recognized by the end of the second quarter compared only 15% to 20% having been recognized under prior plan provisions. Therefore, this change is largely an expense timing issue.","The sequential decline of 3% in compensation expense excluding severance charges was driven by a $27.6 million decline in equity-based compensation primarily relating to the timing of retirement eligible expense partially offset by base pay adjustments, higher short-term cash incentives and staff growth.","Employee benefit expense excluding severance costs was $73 million and was up 3% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher payroll taxes and retirement costs partially offset by lower medical costs. On a sequential quarter basis, benefit expense was down 6% reflecting lower medical costs and a decline in payroll taxes.","Outside services expense including severance related costs was $166 million and was up 5% compared to the prior-year driven primarily by higher market data costs within technical services, higher sub-custody costs and higher third party advisor fees partially offset by lower consulting spend.","On a sequential basis, outside service expense was up 8% primarily driven by higher consulting, legal, sub-custody and market data costs.","Equipment and software expense of $134 million was up 13% from one year ago and up 5% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by increased software amortization, as well as software support and rental costs continuing the implementation of our technology strategy as we invest to support clients and improve employee efficiency.","Occupancy expense of $46 million was up 2% both on a year-over-year, as well as a sequential basis driven by higher rent and building operational costs. Other operating expense of $82 million increased 12% from last year after adjusting for last year special items. The year-over-year growth was primarily related to higher charges associated with account servicing activities, higher business promotion spend, as well as higher FDIC insurance costs.","On a sequential basis, the category increased 27% driven by higher charges associated with account servicing activities, higher business promotion spend and an increase in staff relocation costs.","Turning to Page 8, our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we've made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio pretax margin and ultimately our return on equity.","The ratio of expenses to trust and investment fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. Reducing this measure from where it was previously, as high as 131% in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement and our return on equity.","Although this ratio has flattened in recent periods, we remain committed to driving a lower by continue to focus on what we can directly control. Winning new business to drive fee growth and driving efficiencies in our cost base. Our productivity efforts include further implementing our location strategy driving procurement efficiency and using technology to drive productivity.","Turning to Page 9, our capital ratios remain strong with common equity Tier 1 ratios of 13.2% and 12.3% respectively calculated on a transition basis for both advanced and standardized. On a fully phased-in basis, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the advanced approach would be approximately 13.1% and under the standardized approach would be approximately 12.1%.","All of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7% which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio at the Corporation was 7% and at the bank was 6.2%, both of which exceed the 3% requirement which will be applicable to Northern Trust in 2018.","With respect to the liquidity coverage ratio, Northern Trust is above 100% minimum requirement that became effective on January 1, 2017. As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","In the second quarter we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at a cost of $158 million. The repurchases during the quarter did include our utilization of the diminimus exception as we finished the 2016 capital plan year.","As we announced in June, our 2017 capital plan received no objection from the Federal Reserve. In it we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividends to $0.42 per share. Yesterday our Board of Directors formally approved the plan dividend increase. The capital plan also provides the flexibility to repurchase up to $750 million common stock. The timing and amount shares repurchased will depend on various factors including but not limited to Northern Trust business plans, financial performance, other investment opportunities and general market conditions.","In closing, the second quarter 2017 was characterized by favorable global equity markets, rising short-term interest rates in the U.S. and lower currency volatility. Northern Trust delivered solid financial results in the quarter growing earnings per share by 10% and delivering return on average common equity of 12.2% both on an adjusted basis.","We achieved positive fee operating leverage both on a sequential and year-over-year basis when excluding the previously called out items in both periods. Our assets under custody administration, assets under custody and assets under management were up 15%, 16% and 14% respectively compared to the prior-year.","During the quarter, we also returned to $252 million to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases while maintaining strong capital ratios and funding our growth. Our wealth management business grew revenue 10% year-over-year and continue to produce attractive margins achieving a 39% pretax margin.","Our success in wealth management has been well diversified across our regions in our Global Family Office. Our C&IS business also continued strong growth trajectory with revenue growth of 12%. During the quarter we've been working diligently towards closing the previously announced acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration servicing units in Luxembourg and Switzerland and we continue to expect the transaction to close before year-end.","This transaction which remain subject to applicable regulatory and fund board approvals and other customary closing conditions will significantly enhance our client capabilities in these two very important global fund marketplaces.","As we discussed on last quarter's call, we are looking forward to being the title sponsor of the lead FedEx playoff event next month. The event to be named the Northern Trust will be held in the New York area. Recall in past years we had expense associated with the Northern Trust Open in our first quarter expenses, while moving ahead the expense associated with our sponsored event will now be carried in the third quarter when the new tournament will be held.","We are expecting the expense associated with the sponsorship, advertising, marketing and surrounding events to be approximately $0.05 per share in the quarter. Our sponsorship of this event is in line with our strategic focus on continuing to grow our business in the Northeast and in particular the Greater New York area.","Finally, earlier this morning we announced that we will be establishing an EU banking presence in Luxembourg. We are implementing these plans to continue to meet client and business needs in a post Brexit environment and this combined with the pending acquisition underscores our continued focus of growing our business in Continental Europe.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust second quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Anthony, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Biff, just I'll focus on the net interest margin and balance sheet side. Could you help us explain if you separate the sides of the balance sheets, how much of that mix shift effect from U.S. to non-U.S. was either temporary, permanent, something you control, something you can't control meaning, is this the new run rate or are there some certain things across the business it just happened that were out of your control?","Biff Bowman","So let me break that into two parts because the first part of that was the growth in the foreign office deposits that you saw. I would characterize that growth that we saw which is $4 billion to $5 billion that we saw grow there, as largely business as usual. It reflected new business and it reflects our clients normal activities where they\u2019re transitioning in and out of portfolios, and in and out of different currencies.","I would call that growth that we saw there, business as usual nothing structural. The $3 million that you see that left the balance sheet from the non-interest-bearing deposits in dollars, I would say has been driven by client reactions to a rising rate environment.","So, in that non-interest bearing component we have clients who heretofore have bits remained in that bucket but as we've seen the rate rises, many had comments that I need to look at alternatives for my cash.","Of the $3 billion that moved off, a $1 billion or so moved into our cash vaults so they chose an off-balance sheet solution. $1 billion or so we retained but have moved to an interest-bearing because they represent broader clients of the Northern and about $1 billion left in the balance sheet where that relationship with us was either very narrow or did not exist other than it just being a deposit.","So that bucket of non-interest bearing deposits I think is a very important part of the story Ken. That $3 billion runoff it sits in a line item today that represents about 20% of the balance sheet which is non-interest bearing deposits. Pre crisis that represented about 12% of the balance sheet, it\u2019s been as high as 23% of the balance sheet.","We're looking at how that part of the balance sheet will move in a rising rate environment. I can tell you that much of it is still core operating deposits but there is a portion that has been here temporarily particularly as we've grown our hedge fund servicing business and our GFS business our Global Fund Service business, they attract large asset-based clients.","So we probably need to calibrate or the analysts need to calibrate between kind of where we're at 20 and historical 12 as to where do you think as a portion of the balance sheet. Those could go in a rising rate environment.","Our current dialogues in many cases have led them to consider as I just pointed out our own off-balance sheet opportunities so this may move from a net interest income line to an investment fee line in that case.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So that explains the right side of the balance sheet which makes a lot of sense. Can you now also just follow-up, I think the bigger surprise then that is the fact that a lot of the asset side line items on the average earning income statement actually had flat to down yield. So can you just give us kind of that same kind of understanding of why the assets of the asset side sensitivity did not show through on many if any lines at all aside from the expected premium amortization? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","So first let me give - the $14 million of that was premium amortization and you can see that flowing largely if you\u2019re on our trend report through the government sponsored agency that you would have expected probably to see move up with a rate rise and in fact it moved down.","If you go to the loans, let's look at the asset side, so if we go to the loans while that did move up there a couple of factors inside of loans that I think are worthy of call out. The first is that we actually had about $2 million worth of lease residual write-downs in the quarter so that constrained it by about three basis points the loan yield.","And then we also have somewhat of the phenomenon of the repricing timing in those loans based on their structural elements that we see more of that repricing happened in the first quarter just from a unique timing of that component.","So that probably - people were looking for larger yield move on that loan and lease line. Those are some of the factors that somewhat constrain that. If you look on any of the other asset lines that I don't know if you had any Ken in particular that you wanted to highlight rather me going through asset-by-asset but\u2026","Ken Usdin","I would just, you know just - I would just say I mean - if you can just focus on even the ones that were just down like interest-bearing deposits was down, the Fed fund line only moved up five, U.S. government was down, Munis was flat and the other was flat. So either the rate - the short-term nature of the securities book just didn't pull through in most of those lines so I don't know if there is a specific reason on each but that's what people were asking?","Biff Bowman","So Ken on interest-bearing due from banks, the 91 bps move in the first quarter down to 74, that would mainly be a currency impact. So the fact that we've highlighted that we've had U.S. dollar deposits decline but we had non-U.S. dollar deposits increase and that mix would also come through on the asset side. So that's a little bit of what we\u2019re seeing on the asset side as well and especially on net interest-bearing deposit with bank line.","Ken Usdin","So I guess if you could wrap NIM just any thoughts \u2013 just on the trajectory of NIM from here, I'll leave it there? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","Sure. Obviously there's a series of factors there you know them well Ken. If we talk about the deposit betas that we've seen on the retail side, they\u2019ve remained low although we are sensing that maybe there is some movement in the marketplace for that to come under pressure. And we monitor and track that to remain competitive.","So the deposit betas on the retail side that's a story. On the institutional side, we've seen the deposit betas obviously move up and you can see that in our cost of funding fallen through the balance sheet. It's continued to move kind of on a trajectory that we would have anticipated and continues to be competitive on that front.","On the asset side, remember that in the third quarter traditionally we have seen premium amortization be high so that could be a factor in the third quarter as a second and third quarters typically our highest two quarters for premium amortization.","Generally because of retail deposit beta is low and because the institutional deposit beta isn't the one, there is still upward possibilities in the NIM. Those factually say there are still upward NIM possibilities that we will see in a normalized environment. In any given quarter that can be matched with the premium amortization, but we still think that there is based on the beta score I just gave you upward NIM possibilities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Maybe just shift to expenses, if you could talk a little bit about some of the legal and consulting expenses in the outside services bucket is - do you see that as sort of continuing to recur or more oriented to the second quarter. And then the other expense line you mentioned the accounts - servicing charges are those more like processing errors or something related to that that are also one-time?","Biff Bowman","Sure. Let's me if I could maybe walk through a little bit of the expense story and some detail and I'll start with the last question you had Brian is, we did see a higher than normal run rate if you will in the costs associated with account servicing. Those are operational cost and errors associated with servicing clients.","We had approximately one full point of expense growth above our normal run rate in that area. So if you look at our 8.5% expense growth rate that we talked about early, about 1% of that was in a couple of instances in the quarter in that line item.","The second item that I would point out in the expense structure is that we did have about one point of expense growth that was still residual from the LTI the long-term incentive decision around equity that we took in the first quarter which we said would be in this quarter as well, and told you it would be about $8 million that was flow through this quarter. That was about another one point of the expense growth, so that explains two.","And the third item is which we talked about in the script is the fact that our comparison for salary increases, we have two salary increases in this quarter versus none in the comparative quarter a year ago. If you had a normalized view where you were - if you were lapping just one, that would have produced about one more point of growth. So those areas drop three points of growth or they explain, I should say drop they explain three points of the growth.","In terms of your question around the sequential increase on consulting and legal, I think what's important here is year-over-year both of those are down, consulting is down meaningfully year-over-year but in a sequential period, you can have some spiky nature to that. It could be that we need assistance on specific regulatory matters for instance or specific operational initiatives that we've embarked on but we look at it in kind of six-month buckets and over the last four sets of those six-month periods, we've actually seen the consulting spend come down.","It did have a spike in the second quarter around some specific items that we're working on. Resolution planning which would be familiar with being one of those. You can read our 10-Q but our IPO is very modest so the legal can just have some spikiness this quarter.","Brian Bedell","Just looking forward to getting to the third and fourth quarters, of course you've got the golf outing in the third quarter and then you\u2019re establishing the bank in Luxembourg. Is that mostly in the run rate in terms of that cost or is that still in process?","Biff Bowman","So we gave you the Northern Trust ramp in the third quarter. There are some cost we've already incurred as we've embarked on the Luxembourg and there will be some going forward. Those are modest in terms of the way you should think about those flowing through in terms of the cost of those and they will be spread out over the coming quarters. So probably in any one quarter not worthy of any special callout.","Brian Bedell","And just a clarification, thanks for all the detail on the balance sheet. The loan repricing, if I recall that's a better one year lag, so would we expect I guess to the December '16 hike. Fee material loan repricing shifted to the fourth quarter of this year, or do you think it\u2019s a little bit either before that or after that. And then, do you plan on changing your investment strategy on the balance sheet as a result of the things that you're monitoring for client deposit behavior in a rising rate environment?","Mark Bette","So actually about 75% of our loans reprice within a year but that repricing - that 's not necessarily been a floating repricing necessarily so a lot of it will depend on the timing and there are more of those renewals that kind of come up in the fourth quarter early in the first quarter so they would've been more fully realized in the first quarter run rate than what we saw come through on the second quarter. So it can fluctuate just based on the timing of when certain renewal come up.","Biff Bowman","And it in terms of changing the portfolio strategy, the investment strategy, again we're liability driven, so we're out crying and winning new business and serving our existing client base and they bring their balances and others and we always have and continue have philosophy of conservatively managing those liabilities and turning them into what is and what we see as a relatively conservative but one that\u2019s produced I think consistent net interest income for the firm.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier","Just looking at on Page 8, where you have the operating leverage and the efficiencies. Since 2015 both the fee to expenses and the margin, it was kind of flat line yet the environment has been very favorable both rate in market. Just wanted to get your perspective, like something changing on the investment side, the run rate expenses is so much higher that we would expect.","And going forward I know you guys have talked about some of the things that you\u2019re working on in order to try to bring efficiencies but the expense growth rate continues to be elevated. So just wanted to get some sense, when we can start to see those - like the profitability metrics will improve?","Biff Bowman","You're right, the line has flattened out and I would suggest in this quarter we remain focused on it and would like to see that continue to widen out we did not - we did have some fee leverage in the quarter but with \u2013 the backdrop of a pretty strong market. So we remain focused on that.","Let me try to pull that part a little bit. Take the equipment software line it's up 13%. Underpinning that has been a capital expenditure program over the past one, two, and three years that we think will drive investment for our franchise going forward but you're seeing right now run through that that depreciation and amortization in some cases ahead of the expense savings initiatives.","We clearly have got to keep that balance correct. As I just highlighted, there were some unique items in this quarter's expense rate, so that the leverage can be different depending on how you look at those items that I called out. So there was probably wider than sort of flat leverage but we continue to remain focused on the initiatives around location and moving our people to the right place to drive that fee leverage as wide as we can, but yet still produce what we think was pretty strong top line fee growth in 9%.","So we need some expense to do that. The last part of that question Mike was, in some areas like the outside services line remember that while that item grows when you saw sequentially or year-over-year, much of the expense in there is actually sort of tied to market levels and revenue levels and volume levels.","For instance market data is often priced off of AUM or AUC. We got sub-custody expense that is tied to our holdings around the globe. So there is a linkage that will naturally flow in the growth in some of those line items to that. How far we can widen that out from our fee growth is what we remain focused on.","Michael Carrier","And then this is a follow-up, getting back to the net income, I get your comment on into the balance sheet is liability driven. When you look at some of those clients as you mentioned as the normal course of business, on the non-U.S. deposit side. How do you guys think about that client like overall for Northern meaning obviously it pressures, like the net interest income but what else is going on with that client as these balances are coming in. Are you benefiting more on the fee side or the transaction revenues and then anything on the cost that overtime your increase scale. Just trying to put the pieces together.","Biff Bowman","So we actually look at our clients and their profitability on a client by client basis and we do it not only on the margins but we do it on a return on capital. So we look at our clients individually to understand that do they bring the right mix of services, albeit they may bring deposits, they may bring fee-based business, in some cases they bring credit and loan income, we look at that land and we look at the capital allocated to another client level.","And so to your question clearly that - the growth rate that you saw there, certain clients were utilizing capital and they were utilizing or pressuring if you will in some cases our net interest margin. But we look at them across the broad array services and have great dialogues with them about you know if they are not producing the right kinds of relationship with this we have dialogues about other products and services and capabilities that we can bring to the table to help balance that out.","And that's generally - this quarter that allowed us to generate a 12.2% return on equity that type of approach in one of - as we say were committed to deliver between that 10% to 15% range on a client-by-client kind of approach.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","I just wanted to follow up on some of Ken's questions but instead of the start out maybe on the funding cost side. We saw the U.S. office interest-bearing deposit costs increase this quarter and given that there is growth there and given how low the yields are overseas, I guess I'm just - get how putting those assets to work way on yields wouldn't that though also or shouldn't that translate into a cheaper funding costs. So could you help me understand either why I\u2019m thinking about that incorrectly or what was going on that might have created some noise there?","Mark Bette","I think you're referring to the non-U.S. growth and the fact that the interest expense on that increased as well is part of the question.","Brennan Hawken","Yes, exactly and thanks Mark.","Mark Bette","So for the non-U.S. office deposit, a significant part of those deposits are actually in U.S. dollars but you know they're on that line of the balance sheet because we collect them in non-U.S. offices. So if we look at the totality of the deposits though, we\u2019re at about for this quarter about 71% of our total deposits were U.S. dollar and that compares to 74% of our total deposits one quarter ago and 75% one year ago.","So the movement that you see in the interest rate on the non-US office interest-bearing from 17 bps to 24 bps is actually a function of the U.S. dollar or the U.S. dollar interest rate and there been a significant proportion of U.S. dollar within that category.","And then on the savings money market and other line I think you referred to the U.S. deposits that our rates going up in that that there would be most of that is retail which we haven\u2019t seen a lot of movement, but there is some institutional that sits on that line. So when we have U.S. rates going up we expect both the non-U.S. office deposit line, as well as the savings money market and other line to move higher.","Brennan Hawken","So I guess following up on that with the non-U.S. side, if you collect in non-U.S. offices and you put it on the balance sheet in U.S. dollar, but then you put it to work in other markets where the yield may not be as favorable. Are you basically allowing your clients to negatively - yield geographies and is that the best way necessarily to price out the funding construct for those assets, I'm just a little confused there so if you could help out that will be great?","Mark Bette","So we do match off the currency on the balance sheet. So if we do collect in our non-U.S. office locations and we collect U.S. dollar deposits, we do put those to work - on the asset side in U.S. dollars. So we do match those up. It just so happened that the growth that we had this quarter in non-U.S. offices was not in the U.S. dollar part of it, it was in the non-U.S. dollar part of it.","Biff Bowman","Yes, sterling and euro.","Brennan Hawken","I\u2019m still a bit confused but I can follow up no need to drag on the call. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you give us your 30,000-foot kind of view with the Federal Reserve's actions that are coming with the unwind of the balance sheet? There's an expectation that the deposits in the banking system will be affected by this, where there'll be a decline. Can you give us a view what you guys think you may see on your balance sheet from the Fed action as it goes full speed next year?","Biff Bowman","As you know when the QE was put in place many and in particular the Trust banks saw their balance sheets grow. If you believe that the unwind will drive the interest rates up faster than expectations it's not unreasonable to think that our clients and money that's on balance sheets will be looking at alternative places to find that treasury portfolio and funds et cetera.","Our view right now, our house view is that it will be very orderly and that we would see any rate rises be reasonably measured and that deposit flows would be measured to in their movement on and off balance sheet in that environment.","I think one of the things that we have to think about is we\u2019re not constrained not really terribly constrained by leverage ratio and other items. So if there's opportunities to take some of those deposits on to the balance sheet if they make sense from a relationship standpoint, we don\u2019t have some of the regulatory constraints if they\u2019re flowing between banks or between funds and banks balance sheet. I think right now we think it will be done in a measured way and have a moderate to modest impact for us.","Gerard Cassidy","And can you also share with us - quite often, business customers use compensating balances to pay for services rendered by you and your peers. And obviously, as rates go higher, I would assume then that the amount of the compensating balance doesn't need to be as great when we're in a lower rate environment. Is that a safe assumption? And if it is, should we see some deposit outflow if rates continue to move for compensating balances?","Biff Bowman","So I think compensating balances is generally only linked to our treasury management business which is fairly modest on our revenue line. Our trust and custody balances are not traditionally build on a compensating balances type format. So, I would say that for our overall financial statements that would have a very limited potential impact for us.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just a technical question. You gave us that, I think, $0.05 per share for the golf expense in the third quarter. Was that after tax or pretax, the $0.05, if I heard you correctly?","Biff Bowman","$0.05 after, after.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Just a couple of quicky follow-ups. Share count flat to drop up year-on-year but you got a pretty big buyback in place. Can you just talk about the offsets and if any that\u2019s related to timing?","Biff Bowman","Yes, largely you have option exercise and other share issuances in the quarter, but largely from an option exercise driver.","Glenn Schorr","I mean with the cap rate on it?","Biff Bowman","No share count that\u2019s not capital because that\u2019s the capital - that share count - yes, I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s on the capital on the share count you would ask share count not capital. On the share count I\u2019m going to have get back to you I\u2019m not sure we bought back but we stayed relatively flat so we'll get back to you.","Glenn Schorr","I mean it\u2019s something that I assume would trend down given the size of your capital return. You mentioned when you talked about sec lending down 8% year-on-year, you talked about the spread lags but eventually lists in a rising rate environment. Is there a particular reason why that is it just that market dynamic in other words it gets passed initially off a low base and then eventually you get to keep little a bit more?","Mark Bette","There's really there is a lag from the time when the - we do think a higher interest rate environment is a positive factor overall for sec lending. So eventually when you get to the higher level, that's a positive thing but the process getting there sometimes pinches the margin and it's really because the rebate rates on loans against the cash collateral adjust more quickly than the cash reinvestment returns.","Those cash reinvestment returns are pretty short, so it doesn't take long for them to reprice, but if they\u2019re out 30 days or so that could have a minimal impact on the spread. And spreads were - they were minimally down sequentially it wasn\u2019t a large decline but they were minimally down.","Glenn Schorr","And last one, I had heard that there might have been some strategic decisions on passive versus active in part of your asset management business. Is that something that you\u2019ve been thinking about and have been contemplating lately?","Mark Bette","I don't have any comment on that I\u2019m not sure what that it's in reference to.","Glenn Schorr","I can ask in a different way, I guess you have a fantastic passive franchise and good in parts active franchise and I guess how are you growing the asset management business I know - there's is a piece that there to service the current client base but there's also another great piece that has asset management only customers?","Mark Bette","So we remain focused on all of the capabilities from passive, we've grown our ETFs to about $14 billion and AUM and we\u2019ve continue to grow our engineered equity program across all asset classes.","Internally we have traditionally distributed through our - and maybe this was what you're trying to get to, we've traditionally distributed through our existing client base. We continue though to be committed to distributing through third-party and intermediary as well and there is investment in that product and capability that we've really been going after for few years but in earnest in the last year or so.","Biff Bowman","And as an example of the growth that we seen on ETF side, a pretty good share of that has come through a third-party as opposed to directly through the wealth management or C&IS channels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Grasic with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Grasic","I just wanted to get a sense of when you do close the acquisition of Luxembourg Bank, could you give us a sense as to how we should anticipate the impact on the balance sheet and on the income statement if there is going to be a mix shift even further in certain currencies that we should anticipate?","Biff Bowman","Yes, for the acquisition I don't know that the balance sheet - we would see a significant impact on the balance sheet side unless.","Mark Bette","No, there will be limited to know balance sheet impact from the acquisition. So we are acquiring fee-based services from - in the acquisition.","Betsy Grasic","So there is no deposit coming in?","Biff Bowman","I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve disclosed that at this point, but we bought the fund administration and the fees associated with that business. So yes, that\u2019s how we keep the assumption.","Betsy Grasic","And then at the quarter you mentioned that there was an influx of deposits in the European region. Could you just give us a sense as to what drove that because the end of period balances obviously did go up quite a bit relative to the average. And I'm just wondering what type of activity would drive that big of a move.","Biff Bowman","So, they're likely two areas that could drive that. One could be we could have clients with large pools of assets particularly in Europe that could be restructuring portfolios and moving certain portions of their assets around in transitional type periods while they reconfigure or restructure portfolios. And that could have very short-term impacts.","And we also have an Edge Act subsidiary that does certain clearing for certain foreign entities and they can in important time keep large euro or other balances that could be the client could leave those balances with us at period ends. So we do typically see some spiking from those two types of activities.","Betsy Grasic","So one is transition management and one is Edge Act clearing related I guess?","Biff Bowman","So clients themselves transition not necessarily our transition management business, but the clients are moving some of their assets around in periods near quarter and significantly?","Betsy Grasic","Sure. And then is there anything in there around just the rate outlook on the euro that you think - based on what you saw in this quarter that you would expect would drive increased behavior like this going forward I am just wondering if there is a link in it all to improving outlook and rates in Europe that would lead us to expected this kind of activity would continue?","Mark Bette","Yes, I don't believe so. I don't know that there is anything fundamentally that\u2019s triggered the activity and the growth we saw that fundamental to either and improving or an increasing rate environment in Europe at least at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I have a quick question follow up on the loan yields here. So if I'm thinking about this right, is the right way to think about it that since most of your loans repriced later in the fourth quarter and beginning of the first quarter, you\u2019re not really seeing much of the pickup in the March Fed funds increase, you\u2019re not seeing a pickup in the June and if there is another Fed funds increase in December that you\u2019ll really be - you\u2019ll have a three Fed funds hike catch up in your loan yields in the first quarter of 2018?","Biff Bowman","Yes, so I think it's a portion of the story that you just described is because of that, what I will say earlier in the first quarter. I think you also have to look at the loan mix where some of our loans that are driven by more fixed basis may not follow the pattern you just described. You really have to decompose that loan portfolio and look at the repricing structures of that loan portfolio to make the assumption you just did. Might be a little - it maybe on the high side that it's all going to catch-up in one year from now from a repricing perspective, but what you think that would be some lumpiness to that.","Brian Kleinhanzl","I'm not saying it goes up by 75 basis points, what I\u2019m saying is can you refresh maybe your memories as to what the percentage of variable is as a percentage of loans.","Biff Bowman","75% - I don't have the actual flowing but 75% does reprice within a year - but we're not necessarily implying that most of that all happens around year end. It's just that there will be on average probably a larger part of it that would happen at the beginning of the year which would impact the first quarter but that's not to say that every year would be in the first quarter when we would see the stuff up for loans.","Brian Kleinhanzl","You mean they don\u2019t follow a similar repricing schedule, so it would be year-over-year?","Biff Bowman","It would depend on the timing, it would depend on timing of loan renewals and a lot of those might be - a handful of those more in proportion might be set up to roll over at the beginning of the year versus at the beginning of April let\u2019s say as an example.","So in this sequential comparison we picked up a little more maybe in the first quarter then what we would have picked up just from a timing perspective in the second quarter.","Brian Kleinhanzl","What if I compare first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2017, shouldn't that be an accurate comparison?","Biff Bowman","On a year-over-year basis, yes you\u2019d probably - you\u2019re right yeah.","Brian Kleinhanzl","And then just a second question on the other operating expenses. I mean how much of that spend this quarter was discretionary, I heard you say business promotion to me that sounds discretionary, you could pull that back to help improve operating leverage, staffing, maybe or maybe not but how of much of that $17 million increase that you saw sequentially really could drop off next quarter?","Biff Bowman","In the other operating\u2026","Mark Bette","Other operating expenses.","Biff Bowman","Yes, so first of all we saw as I said about one point of growth so you can do that - that was due to account servicing losses. So call that $8 million to $9 million, I can't tell you if it will repeat we certainly hope it doesn't repeat, but the reality is that you can call that discretionary and that's one item in there and there is clearly items, while the Northern Trust Open is in the next quarter and we gave that there are clearly discretionary items in there like business promotion. There's other discretionary items in there that we look carefully at and manage carefully on an ongoing basis but we'll continue to be laser focused on them going forward.","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay.","Mark Bette","The other thing Brian I would mention on the expense side is, we did take the $22.8 million severance charge in the current quarter and indicated approximately an $18 million run rate savings on that. And it will be - the timing of that will come in over the next six quarters.","So the full run rate impact of that wouldn't really be in place until the end of 2018. So that's just one other thing on the expense side as far as looking out beyond the current quarter.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Mark Bette","Appreciate you joining us for the quarter, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.","Biff Bowman","Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"16619":["Northern Trust Corp.

Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O\u2019Grady, Northern Trust\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jane Karpinski, our Controller, and Alison Quaintance from our Investor Relations team.","For those of you who did not receive our first quarter earnings press release or financial trends reported via email this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com.

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Thank you, Bev. Good morning everyone and let me join Bev in welcoming you to Northern Trust\u2019s First Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. As usual, I\u2019ll review our results for the quarter, after which Bev and I would be happy to answer your questions.","Starting on Page 2, this morning we reported first quarter net income of $181 million and earnings per share of $0.75, which was up 12% over last year and 7% over last quarter. Our reported return on equity was 9.3% in the first quarter, better than last year\u2019s first and fourth quarters but below our target range of 10% to 15%. Let me draw your attention to three specific items which will help you evaluate our performance this quarter.","First as noted in our press release this morning, net investment security losses were $4 million this quarter due to an other than temporary impairment of certain Community Reinvestment Act eligible securities. Impairment was taken on four CRA pools backed by residential mortgage loans. Second, our results in the first quarter of last year included a $12.4 million write-off of certain fee receivables recorded in other operating income and $1.8 million in restructuring and integration-related charges. Third, recall that our reported results in the fourth quarter of last year included a charge of $19 million in connection with an agreement to resolve certain longstanding class action litigation. Excluding these items across the relevant periods, earnings per share rose 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially.","Environmental factors which impact our businesses and our clients were mixed in the first quarter, continuing trends which persisted in 2013. Equity markets were higher year-over-year in the U.S. and Europe with the S&P 500 up 19% and the EAFE Index up 14%. Bond markets, however, were down year-over-year as the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index was down almost 4%. (Audio gap) equity markets were mixed with the S&P 500 up 1% and the EAFE Index flat, while bond markets were up about 1% sequentially.","Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $5.8 trillion, up 15% over last year, and assets under management ended at $915 billion, up 13%. On a sequential basis, client custody and managed assets were up 3%. Currency volatility, which influences foreign exchange trading income, was lower in the first quarter, having decreased each month in 2014 to multi-year lows. FX industry market volumes were lower versus last year but higher sequentially. Short-term interest rates remained at very low levels and continued to pressure our net interest margin and result in fee waivers on our money market mutual funds. Three months LIBOR averaged 24 basis points, down 6 basis points year-over-year and down 1 basis point sequentially. The Fed fund\u2019s effective rate at 7 basis points was half the level it was at the same time last year and down 1 basis point sequentially. Average overnight repo was 5 basis points in the quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year and down 4 basis points sequentially.","With those comments providing context on the environment, let\u2019s move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the first quarter. Starting with the year-over-year comparison, revenues were up 7% and expenses were up 5%. Revenue growth was the result of higher trust, investment and other servicing fees and net interest income. Expenses rose due to increases in compensation and benefits, outside services, and equipment and software. As a result, reported net income was 11% higher year-over-year. Excluding the specific items I mentioned previously, net income was 6% higher year-over-year. Compared to last quarter, revenues were essentially flat and expenses excluding the fourth quarter settlement charge were down 1%. Growth in trust, investment and other servicing fees was offset by lower net interest income and the other than temporary impairment item that I mentioned earlier. Expense management was led by lower outside services and other operating expense. As a result net income, excluding the specific items mentioned earlier, increased approximately 1% sequentially. Earnings per share was $0.75 and our return on equity was 9.3%.","With that background and summary, let\u2019s get into more details behind our first quarter results. Turning to Page 4, first quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were approximately $1.05 billion, up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues, were $679 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Fees in our corporate and institutional services business increased 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially while fees in our wealth management business grew 6% year-over-year and were down 2% sequentially. Higher equity markets and new business were both drivers of growth with higher money market mutual fund fee waivers offsetting. Fee waivers were approximately $33 million in the first quarter, an increase of $10 million over last year and $2 million sequentially. The higher waivers were primarily due to the gross yield of the funds declining by approximately 6 basis points on average from the prior year and 1 basis point sequentially due to lower overnight repo rates. I\u2019ll go into further detail on trust fees shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was $50 million in the first quarter, down 16% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Currency volatility was lower in the first quarter, having decreased each month in 2014 to multi-year lows. Client trading volumes, however, were slightly higher year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Other non-interest income was $65 million in the first quarter, down 10% year-over-year when adjusting for last year\u2019s fee receivable write-off, and down 7% sequentially primarily reflecting the other than temporary impairment item. Net interest income, which I will also discuss in more detail later, was $254 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially.","With that backdrop, let\u2019s look at the components of fee revenues on Page 5. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $379 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $252 million in the first quarter, up 13% year-over-year and flat sequentially, while assets under custody for C&IS clients were $5.2 trillion at quarter-end, up 15% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Growth in fees and assets primarily reflects higher equity markets and new business. The sequential quarter comparison also reflects lower sub-custodian recoveries.","Investment management fees in C&IS of $75 million in first quarter were down 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Assets under management for C&IS clients were $698 billion, up 16% year-over-year and 5% sequentially due to higher equity markets and higher cash and securities lending collateral levels, as well as the transfer of $7.6 billion in assets under management from wealth management to C&IS in the first quarter. The transferred assets represent defined contribution accounts and target date funds which emanate from our growing third party distribution and are more appropriately categorized as institutional assets.","C&IS investment management fee growth was dampened on a year-over-year basis by higher waivers on institutional money market mutual funds. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equaled $15 million in the first quarter, $6 million higher year-over-year primarily reflecting the lower gross yield achieved in the underlying funds that I previously mentioned. Additionally, investment management fees in C&IS reflect the impact of a reduction in AUM from a central bank client which occurred in the fourth quarter. Since 2008, we had been managing approximately $7 billion for this client. Those assets moved out of our funds in the middle of the fourth quarter and therefore diminished fee growth in the first quarter.","Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, up 2% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volumes as securities lending collateral increased 15% year-over-year and 14% sequentially to $117 billion. Other fees in C&IS were $29 million in the first quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 27% sequentially, in both comparisons due to higher benefit payments and investment risk in analytical services.","Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $300 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Assets under management for wealth management clients were $217 billion at quarter-end, up 5% or $11 billion year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter we transferred $7.6 billion in assets under management from wealth management to C&IS, the major in equity assets. This reduced the growth rate in assets under management by 4 percentage points year-over-year and 3 points sequentially. In addition, cash balances within wealth management AUM were $5 billion lower year-over-year and flat versus year-end. The year-over-year increase in wealth management fees was primarily due to higher assets under management partially offset by higher wage fees in money market mutual funds and the impact of fee reductions in certain of our mutual funds. The sequential decline in wealth management fees was due to the reduction in assets under management as well as two fewer days in the quarter, higher money market fund fee waivers, and the impact of fee reductions in certain of our mutual funds. Fee waivers in wealth management totaled $17.6 million in the current quarter compared to $13.4 million in the first quarter of last year, and $16.2 million in the prior quarter.","Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $254 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in net interest income was driven by a larger balance sheet as clients\u2019 interest-bearing deposits averaged $63 billion in the quarter, up approximately $7 billion or 12% year-over-year, and short-term borrowings and non-interest bearing demand deposits were each higher by approximately $1 billion. This higher level of funding compared with the year ago was primarily invested on the asset side in Federal Reserve deposits at 25 basis points.","Partially offsetting the impact of a larger balance sheet was a lower net interest margin which at 1.12% in the first quarter was down 3 basis points year-over-year. In the sequential comparison, average earning assets and the net interest margin were both essentially flat. As a result, the 2% decline in net interest income reflects two fewer days in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter.","The yield on the securities portfolio decreased 4 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting smaller adjustments to premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio due to changes in prepayment speed assumptions. Adjustments to premium amortization were less favorable in the first quarter at approximately $3 million, $7 million lower than the $10 million in the fourth quarter. The adjustments in the first quarter increased the net interest margin by approximately 1 basis point compared to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter. Offsetting the less favorable impact to the premium amortization adjustments to net interest income was a shift in the mix of earning assets from lower yielding interest-bearing deposits with banks and Federal Reserve deposits to higher yielding securities.","Turning to Page 7, expenses were $768 million in the first quarter, up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Similar to previous periods, expense growth is primarily driven by a combination of the costs and investments to supports the growth of the business and those required to meet more stringent risk management compliance and regulatory requirements, along with other expenses that can vary by quarter. Compensation expense increased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting staff growth and annual merit increases. Staff levels increased 5% year-over-year with about half of staff growth supporting the growth of global fund services in C&IS, a business which is experiencing above-average growth and in which we are investing for future growth across traditional hedge and other fund structures. The majority of the remainder of staff growth was in our operations and technology area, as well as in control functions.","On a sequential basis, compensation expense increased 2% primarily driven by the accounting for annual equity-based awards. Recall that there is a requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement-eligible employees. Staff growth was less than 1% sequentially.","Employee benefit expense was 6% higher year-over-year and 1% higher sequentially as higher payroll tax expense more than offset lower pension expense. The year-over-year comparison also included higher expense associated with medical benefits.","Outside services expenses increased 11% year-over-year and decreased 5% sequentially. Consulting, sub-custodian expense, and technical services expense were all higher year-over-year but lower in the sequential quarter comparison. Certain categories within outside services expense are seasonal or vary by quarter, and as you recall, consulting expense was higher in the second half of 2013 primarily related to regulatory initiatives. While we expect these trends to continue, they moderate in the first quarter of 2014.","Equipment and software expense was higher by 11% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Spending on a variety of technology initiatives continues as we keep apace with supporting a variety of data and reporting needs for our clients and implement tools to enhance the efficiency of our partners while also managing a full docket in the regulatory and compliance arena.","Occupancy expense was up 2% versus the prior year and 1% sequentially. Other operating expense decreased 14% year-over-year and decreased 13% sequentially when adjusted for the fourth quarter settlement charge. Both comparisons primarily reflect lower charges associated with accounts servicing activities, which can be uneven from quarter to quarter. The sequential quarter comparison also included seasonally higher business promotion and marketing costs associated with the Northern Trust Open.","Turning to Page 8, we continue to be focused on enhancing productivity and efficiency in order to improve profitability and returns. This takes the form of specific initiatives such as those included as part of driving performance over the last two years, which produced quantifiable results; however, it is also achieved through a chance in the mindset of every Northern Trust employee to incorporate productivity into every aspect of our respective roles. Whether someone is in client servicing, portfolio management, product development, operations, technology, or one of the corporate functions, all of us have the opportunity to execute more efficiently. Deploying our capital productively is a component as well.","The financial benefit created through greater productivity allows the company to simultaneously increase profitability and invest in future growth opportunities that we expect will produce targeted returns over time. Ultimately, our success in achieving our overall productivity goals can best be measured by our return on equity, and pre-tax margin is a significant contributor. We track both closely; however, given the impact macro-environmental factors can have on pre-tax margin, we also closely track the ratio of expenses to fees. Although by no means immune to external factors, we believe it\u2019s a useful metric to gauge our progress. As Page 8 demonstrates, in 2011 when our return on equity was 8.6%, our pre-tax margin was 24.2% and the expenses to fee ratio was 131%. Since then, we\u2019ve made progress in reducing the ratio to 115% last year and 113% in the first quarter.","Capital, outlined on Page 9, remained very strong with common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratios of 12.8% and 13% respectively. Based on our interpretation of the final Basel III rules released by the Federal Reserve, on a fully phased in basis our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would be approximately 11.1%, and under the advanced approach would be approximately 11.7%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer. The supplementary leverage ratio is estimated to be approximately 5% at the holding company, which is above the requirement applicable to Northern Trust.","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased in Basel III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under final Basel III rules. As we announced in March, our 2014 capital plan received no objections from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.33 per share. At its regular meeting later today, our board of directors will consider formal approval of the planned dividend increase which is expected to be payable July 1.","In the first quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at a cost of $163 million. In addition, our 2014 capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to $425 million of common stock between April 2014 and March 2015.","In closing, the first quarter demonstrated continued progress on a number of fronts but with more work to do as we progress through 2014. With institutional clients, momentum was strong across regions. Announced wins in the quarter included Australia\u2019s Energy Industry\u2019s superannuation scheme and Canada\u2019s IWA Forest industry pension plan. Our hedge fund servicing business continues to manage through a period of rapid growth and client take-on as well. In addition, in early April we closed out the $55 million contingent purchase consideration related to our 2011 acquisition of Omnium from Citadel. In completing this about two years earlier than contemplated in the original purchase agreement, we solidified our relationship with this important client of our hedge fund servicing business. At the same time, we also expanded our partnership with Citadel\u2019s technology arm, which has become a key strategic partner of Northern Trust.","With wealth management clients, new business was better than last quarter in all geographic regions and the global family office group, although it fell short of the prior year which was particularly strong due to uncertainties of the changing tax and investment environment. While our performance in wealth management this quarter was hampered by higher money market fund fee waivers and other factors, the business is well positioned both strategically and competitively. From a financial perspective, while we have improved our profitability across recent periods, we remain focused on achieving returns in our target range.","Before I conclude and as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today\u2019s call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our annual meeting, which begins at 10:30 Central time this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the Q&A period earlier than our normal practice.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call today. Paula, please open the line for questions.","Question and Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) ","We\u2019ll take our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Hi Mike and Bev, how are you? Good morning. Mike, can you give us a little more color on the custody business? Obviously there\u2019s great growth on a year-over-year basis and there\u2019s really good AUC growth sequentially, but the revenues were only up just slightly and I was wondering if you could detail whether some part of it might have been transaction activity or any other pushes and pulls that there might have been that would have withheld it from a better growth rate.","Michael O\u2019Grady","So the custody business continues to grow well, and as you saw from the custody and fund administration fees is actually a nice quarter as far as growth, and that just reflects the continued strong new business that we talk about as it works its way through the fee line. I would say that as far as factors within the quarter, keep in mind that as strong as the equity markets may be, only about half of the assets under custody relate to equity so they don\u2019t\u2014they won\u2019t fully reflect that. So having a growth rate in fees that is similar to assets under custody is actually the positive impact of net new business.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, but was there something that either was strong in the fourth or that didn\u2019t come through in the first, because all that, given the growth that you\u2019re mentioning and the onboarding of new clients, the revenues were only up less than $1 million sequentially. So I\u2019m just thinking about from a prospective, is there something that either wasn\u2019t in there that might be going forward, or just something that maybe is lagging in terms of its revenue recognition? You had the good positive comp locked in from this quarter as well.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yeah, so on a sequential basis, all the trends that I mentioned there continue. However, Ken, one of the things that also runs through that line is sub-custodian recoveries. So where we\u2019re utilizing sub-custodians throughout the world, when we get certain charges we pass those charges along to our clients, given that we\u2019re the global custodian, and those can tend to vary, as we\u2019ve talked about, from quarter to quarter, and recoveries were higher in the fourth quarter of last year and lower in the first quarter of this year, which trimmed a little bit from the growth rate.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, got it. My second question \u2013 Mike, the outside services and the other expense lines were much better controlled on a year-over-year basis than they had been. To your point about seasonality, I just want to understand, how do we understand especially for those two lines which have been the biggest growth areas over time, you mentioned trends expected to continue but I want to just ask you what you mean by that. We can expect continued growth in outside services and in other, or are we now coming off of a peak-ish type of number that we saw in the fourth?","Michael O\u2019Grady","So outside services includes a number of sub-categories within that, so that\u2019s everything from consulting fees to technical services, which we use the technical services often as part of onboarding new clients. That includes legal expenses in there as well, and just any other third party service that we\u2019re contracting for. That\u2019s why the trends can move around from quarter to quarter.","What we\u2019ve seen, though, over the last several quarters, particularly I\u2019d say about the last two quarters, is that consulting has been a big driver for an increase in that category overall, and if you recall, the first and second quarters of last year, consulting was relatively low, whereas it picked up a fair amount in the third and fourth quarters as we addressed a number of the regulatory projects that we had underway. What we saw in the first quarter is that the consulting expenses were lower than the fourth quarter, and I think you can expect that in the sense that there were a number of initiatives that we needed to complete by the end of last year, and yet we\u2019re higher than we were a year ago and that\u2019s just because the list of regulatory projects that we\u2019re working on still remains relatively long.","The mix has changed, so many of the things that we were working on last year are different this year, so last year a number of the projects included things like the resolution plan and certainly more of a focus on CCAR, whereas in 2014 we\u2019re spending more time and resources on such initiatives as AIFMD, which has ramped up somewhat in the fourth quarter but also in the first quarter.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. So\u2014okay, I get it. So maybe we\u2019re at this new level, but not necessarily going back to where we were, and it just depends on the progression of this mix shift that you\u2019re alluding to.","Michael O\u2019Grady","It definitely depends on all of those categories and what that mix is. The other thing I would say about the consulting line and just regulatory costs in general is that at this point in time, we don\u2019t necessarily know what all of the requirements and projects will be between now and the end of the year, so it\u2019s really difficult to be able to know exactly what those costs will be.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, I understand. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Good morning. So question on the AUM- it sounds like ex-noise in your C&IS and wealth management, I get to maybe roughly a 2% C&IS sequential growth rate and then just slightly positive in wealth management. Is that right? I was trying to note down all the noise you were walking through there, Mike.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yes, sequential, I think if you take into account the transfer that we talked about, on C&IS you would be closer to 4% and on wealth management you\u2019d be closer to 1%.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Okay, and it also looked like the asset management fee rate in C&IS took a bit of a hit, so can we talk about whether or not this noise, was it the timing of some of these re-classes that might have had an impact there, or did these changes happen in the beginning of the quarter and therefore is this the new run rate that we should think about for the asset management business in C&IS?","Michael O\u2019Grady","So as you point out, the fee rate is still shy of that, and there are a number of factors that contributed to it. One is just slightly higher money market fee waivers. Two is that at the beginning of the quarter, we did re-price some of our mutual funds in the multi-manager space. That was as of January 1, so that\u2019s in the run rate, if you will, now. Then also, the day count in the first quarter does impact the fees that are generated from the mutual funds, and then there\u2019s a slight mix change which we\u2019ve been talking about over time, which is even as clients take on more equity exposure, they\u2019re doing it more through passive product as opposed to active products, which have different fee levels. So those are really the factors that are driving the difference between AUM growth and fee growth.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then the other question here, maybe could you give some color on demographics of your wealth management business and how that compares today versus maybe five or so years ago? Have we seen a meaningful change there at this point?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Well, I can\u2019t quote specific statistics for you based on demographics, but I can tell you that we clearly have evolved our strategy with regard to the target market that we\u2019re focused on, and so certainly the expectation is that the demographics are slanting more and more up market. So even putting aside the global family office business which deals with the largest families and wealth, the wealth business overall in all of the regions has also turned its focus to the level above $20 million of liquid net worth. Importantly, it\u2019s not just approaching more clients within that target range; it\u2019s also trying to provide the types of services that are particularly of interest to that target market, so whether that\u2019s from a banking perspective, a fiduciary needs perspective, or also just their approach to their investments, it is more up market-focused. So as a result, just the new wins and the clients that we\u2019re bringing on fit that demographic more than they do what I would consider a much broader wealth or high net worth demographic five years ago.","Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim","Good morning, Mike. I was going to ask a technical question about the share repurchase. The $163 million was about over 2.5 million shares, but when you look at the outstanding shares in the report, they\u2019re only down about 800,000, so I was curious what the difference was between that.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yeah, the difference is just that in any time period, there are exercises of employee-related shares and options, and so that can offset some of the shares that we repurchase; and that\u2019s the case in the fourth quarter as well.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim","But that was stronger than what you would typically have probably seen\u2014we\u2019ve seen in past quarters.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yes, and part of that, Marty, is it is going to be related to the level of the stock price, so options that were granted a number of years ago were out of the money for some time period. In the fourth quarter with the stock price being higher, that provides a greater incentive for employees to exercise the options. It also just depends on the remaining time that\u2019s in the options as well, and certainly as options get closer to expiration, which will happen towards the end of the year, then the employees tend to exercise those options before they expire.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim","And then lastly, the shift from the shorter term money with banks and the Fed into the treasury portfolio, what kind of duration are you buying into? What\u2019s your thought process there at this point?","Michael O\u2019Grady","So our duration on the securities portfolio was very stable with where we were in the fourth quarter, so right now, as I\u2019ve mentioned previously in the fourth quarter, we were at about 14 months as far as the duration for that portfolio and we\u2019re still in that range. We did increase the size of the securities portfolio during the quarter just because we\u2019ve seen increased custody deposits and stability in those deposits, and I would say at this point that obviously like everyone else, we\u2019re looking at interest rates and what the expectations might be, but our position is relatively stable as opposed to one where we\u2019re necessarily looking to either increase or decrease the duration on that portfolio.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim","Got you, so just a shift between the shorter term and then the securities, given what you\u2019re looking at as more long-term funding out of the deposit base?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Exactly.","Marty Mosby \u2013 Guggenheim","Thanks. All right, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to our next questioner, and that will be Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning, Mike. First, a question on regulation. As we come towards the end of the SLR rule-making process, do you believe that the rule as it stands today will impact business decisions in any meaningful way? And then an update on how you\u2019re thinking about other regulation, especially in Europe \u2013 I know you addressed the expense angle with AIFMD, but maybe some thoughts on revenue opportunities as well.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Sure. So with regard to the supplementary leverage ratio, I do believe that that will have an impact on business decisions, not necessarily because it has such a great impact on Northern Trust but I think that it will impact the market. And the areas where I would expect to see impact would be certainly just with the size of the balance sheet being very relevant and having higher levels for the largest banks, just being able to take on deposits, for example, as a different capital implication than it previously did. So I think that will affect the market overall and certainly will affect the way we think about client deposits and what the appropriate pricing is for that deposit.","At this point, the supplementary leverage ratio does not present limitations to us, so it hasn\u2019t caused us to do anything that we wouldn\u2019t have previously done; but I think that that will evolve, as I mentioned, with the market over time. And then a second area that I think it could potentially have an impact is on what I\u2019ll consider off-balance sheet commitments, whether that\u2019s line of credit or just credit facilities to corporations; and again, given the fact that those are included in the denominator of that ratio, I think that it could have an impact not only on the extension of credit to corporations but also the pricing of that credit, and certainly that\u2019s something that, again, we look at very closely because that is a way in which we\u2019re deploying our capital for our clients.","And then I think the other question, Ashley, was with regard to regulation more broadly, things like AIFMD. I would say that we, like others, are investing in that area to make sure that we\u2019re in a position to provide those services to our clients. So far, that\u2019s gone very well as far as the implementation of what we think the required needs are. What is being required being a depository in that marketplace is very similar to services that we\u2019ve provided for clients for a long time period, both in the U.S. but also in Europe for USDs (ph), so this is really an expansion of that and it is just requiring an expansion of our capabilities to serve the clients. But overall, we think that that\u2019s actually something that will be a positive because it\u2019s more that we can do for our clients and also a service that they\u2019ll value and will also pay for.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thanks for all the color there. My quick follow-up is on other expenses. Typically you would expect 2Q to be a bit lower, given the non-trust expenses roll off. Should we be expecting the same magnitude of a drop that we\u2019ve seen historically given the lower than usual account services expenses this quarter? Thanks.","Michael O\u2019Grady","As you pointed out, we had a particularly good quarter, I would say, with regard to the charges associated with operating activities, and that\u2019s something that is impossible to predict. Certainly our objective is to minimize those, but it\u2019s not something that we have visibility into. But as I mentioned, it was very good in the first quarter, so hard to determine whether we\u2019ll be able to repeat that. That category includes, as you know, a number of other items as well and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a broad other category, which when you look over time there\u2019s more variability to that category. So there\u2019s no particular increase or decrease that we necessarily would expect.","Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Morning guys. Just a quick one on CCAR. Now that you\u2019ve been through the process, just any lessons you\u2019ve learned, things that maybe you would do differently or could have done differently for next time. And then also along with that, perhaps you could comment on whether the uncertainty going into this time, maybe more conservative on your capital return request than you might have otherwise been.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Sure. So CCAR, as we talked about a lot last year, we needed to make a number of changes and enhancements to our process relative to the CapPR process and feel that we were successful in implementing those and we\u2019re certainly pleased with the outcome. Having said that, we still have more work to do on that front. As has been much talked about, there\u2019s the quantitative aspect of it, which we think that we perform well, but then there\u2019s also the qualitative aspect, and in those areas we continue to improve the modeling that we do. We continue to improve the way in which we communicate our plan to the regulators. We definitely involve a broader group of people within the company, whether that\u2019s different parts of business management as we develop stress scenarios but also the engagement of our board, so it\u2019s a very comprehensive, as it\u2019s titled, process and I think that we learn the importance of making those investments to be able to meet with the regulatory expectations, but we also understand that those expectations continue to move up. So we have plans in place, even though we have not received specific feedback with regard to our plan at this point, and we\u2019ll get that later in the month. That hasn\u2019t held us back from continuing to improve on our processes.","As far as the second part of your question, Luke, it\u2019s clearly too early in our minds to think about what our capital action request will be. Again, we haven\u2019t even either sat down with the Fed to get a detailed set of points for feedback, nor have we received a letter, so just very, very early in the process.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then perhaps just a quick update on Bridgewater \u2013 I think that\u2019s still coming on next quarter, right? So maybe a reminder about how we should be modeling the revenue impacts since the assets won\u2019t be in assets under custody, and then a general sense of any trend toward shadow servicing deals in general \u2013 do you think there will be more opportunity there? How difficult has this deal been to onboard, and has it changed your appetite to bid for those in the future?","Michael O\u2019Grady","So I\u2019ll actually start with one of your last points there, which is just the complexity of onboarding a situation like this. It has gone well, albeit coordinating between the client and another provider is complicated, so at this point our expectation is that we will go live on that in the third quarter. To your point, when that happens, those will be assets under administration and then we\u2019ll begin to recognize the revenue and expenses related to that as well.","At this point, I would say that there is more discussion than activity with regard to shadow administrators. We think it\u2019s something that will be applicable in the marketplace going forward, albeit it for a select set of large institutions or hedge funds like Bridgewater. So we definitely think it\u2019s a positive. We\u2019re clearly pleased with that opportunity, and so we continue to look for more opportunities like that.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to our next caller, and that will be Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks a lot. Maybe just circling back to the fee reductions on multi-manager mutual funds, can you give us a sense of how many assets and funds that involves and some of the thinking behind that? Also, I think you had mentioned\u2014previously mentioned maybe last quarter that you were reversing discounted fees in wealth management, so wouldn\u2019t that offset some of that?","Michael O\u2019Grady","So the first part, Cynthia, this related to three multi-manager funds which had AUM of approximately $4 billion related to that, and the rationale for the change in pricing was to just ensure that those products continued to be priced competitively within the marketplace. As you would expect, we constantly are monitoring pricing and the costs of our funds, and from time to time feel it\u2019s appropriate to look at reducing the fees on the fund. So that\u2019s what it related to.","As far as the discounts, the discount is what I would consider kind of an ongoing initiative. We did not necessarily reduce discounts, for example, across the board in the first quarter. It\u2019s something where right now, it\u2019s happening more on what I would consider kind of an account-by-account basis where if we determine that the level of work and value that\u2019s being delivered is not aligned with the discount, then that\u2019s an opportunity. But we didn\u2019t really see any benefit, significant benefit from that in the first quarter that would offset the change in pricing.","Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. I apologize if you mentioned this, but how is your pipeline looking for C&IS?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Pipeline continues to look very good. I would say that the level of market activity is good, so there are many opportunities which we are currently either in dialogue in or that we\u2019re actually in the RFP process for those, so that\u2019s really a positive. We\u2019ve been very pleased with our win rate on that front as well, so on the institutional side, I would say very good.","As I mentioned on the wealth management side, if you go back a year ago, we were really coming off a time period where it was very high level of activity and new business in the wealth management business, and then it tailed off through the end of the year. Coming into 2014, it\u2019s improved off of where it was at the end of the year but it\u2019s still not at the very high levels that we saw a year ago. Overall, though, I would say that if you think about the risk appetite for our client base and if you were to talk to some of the investment professionals for us, like various people within asset management or within the wealth management business, I think what they would tell you is that the beginning of this year, there was a fair amount of uncertainty in the marketplace which caused a little bit of a pause in activity, whether that\u2019s some of the geopolitical activities or just the volatility in the equity markets. So we didn\u2019t see a pullback necessarily but we didn\u2019t see as much advancing on that front.","Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Glenn Schorr with ISI.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Thanks very much. I guess I\u2019m trying to tie together all of the pieces of the puzzle for investment management because we heard about a transfer, some price cuts, and then some internal transfer stuff. If I look at assets versus fee growth over, let\u2019s say, the last five years instead of worrying about the last quarter or year, fees grow less than assets, but that\u2019s a function of active to passive which you should be capturing. So I guess I\u2019m looking for any kind of summary comment of how the asset management business is doing in your mind, the passive as it should be well positioned, especially with your client base, but it\u2019s hard to see with a lot of the different moving parts \u2013 sorry.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Sure, I think it\u2019s certainly a fair question, and over time\u2014over a longer time period, as you suggested, assets under management have certainly grown at a nice growth rate for us, which is a result of, as we\u2019ve talked about, a strong equity market environment but also new business.","On the fee side of the equation, we\u2019ve had the negative impact of the fee waivers which right now, we\u2019re at basically the highest run rate level that we\u2019ve seen. It did go down if you went back a year ago, obviously, and some quarters before that, but it\u2019s gone back up to a higher level now just because the very shortest end of the curve is very low, and that\u2019s where a lot of the funds within those funds are invested. So that\u2019s been a drag on the growth rate, and I would agree that we certainly have benefited because of the move from active to passive, so you\u2019ve seen that in the asset growth, and a category that is growing the fastest within that is the equity index business, and that\u2019s a combination of both the equity markets again going to a high rate, but also that\u2019s a particular area where we\u2019ve had success with inflows.","The other part of that, however, is that the index business comes at a lower fee rate than our average fee rate, and certainly lower than active equity, so it does bring down the revenue yield, if you will, on the assets under management. I think those are the longer term trends.","I think that within wealth management, you did see through 2012 and 2013 the benefit of fee simplification, which was a lift to that yield on the assets under management. As I mentioned before, at this point it\u2019s been two years since we did have an overall increase in those fees, but you\u2019ve seen that now the growth or the positive benefit of that trail off. As I mentioned, we look at incrementally addressing discounts on the accounts, but we have not looked at actually increasing fees.","Finally, I would just say, again, benefiting from some of those trends but also part of the trends more broadly are just fees on investment product overall, so it\u2019s very important for us to make sure that we\u2019re offering products at competitive fees and so that\u2019s resulted in some of the activity this past quarter, but if you went back, there\u2019s been other quarters where we also have reduced the fees on some of our investment product.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Got it, and maybe I\u2019ll do one quick, short one on expenses as well. Again, you went through a bunch of moving parts, but the results are actually pretty good both sequentially and year-on-year in terms of positive operating leverage. Do you sense a turning of the corner, and I know that\u2019s market dependent, I know it\u2019s rate dependent, but things look like in the most control you\u2019ve had in a little while. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m reading too much into things, but just curious to get your thoughts.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yeah. I definitely am not in a position to be able to comment on whether we\u2019ve turned a corner. I would just say that 2012, 2013, we were very focused on driving performance, which was primarily initiative-based, as I talked about. We continue to have a number of initiatives on that front, but more importantly I would say some of the things that were more initiatives before, Glenn, now are part of just business as usual. What I mean by that is going back two years ago, we looked at some of our procurement categories and said, how can we reduce our expenses here? What are some areas that essentially we can attack as a project to reduce those, and we were successful in that; whereas now, that\u2019s become just part of normal practice is looking at our expenses in procurement from a strategic standpoint and making sure that every negotiation that we do on a large vendor contract goes through the same rigor.","So in some ways, we\u2019re getting continued benefit just on an ongoing basis, so I\u2019d like to think if there\u2019s a corner that we\u2019ve turned, the corner that we\u2019ve turned is just in the mentality of how we approach efficiency and productivity, but not necessarily anything that enables us to say that the expense trajectory, by definition, will change.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we\u2019ll go to Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Hi. Could you just elaborate more on the sub-custodian fees fourth quarter to first quarter, maybe a dollar amount or who are you dealing with, if you can disclose that, and how are those relationships?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yes, so we deal with sub-custodians all over the globe, and it\u2019s particularly in areas where we are not inclined to actually be a primary custodian, so that\u2019s the nature of it. We\u2019re the global custodian, and then we have the sub-custodian networks. With regard to the costs, there are certain of those costs which are absorbed but there are certain which per agreements with our clients get passed on. With that network, the timing in which we receive the cost is not always as smooth and predictable as we would like, so I can\u2019t obviously comment on specific names of the sub-custodians that result in the higher levels, but I can tell you, for example, that there are certain just geographies that in the quarter ended up being higher than what we expected, so as a result we had less that we recovered in the fourth quarter.","But I would say, Mike, that\u2019s a line that just over time, quarter to quarter, moves up and moves down, but the longer term trend I would say is one where if anything, we\u2019re picking up efficiencies in the cost of our sub-custodian network.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Okay. Separately, your earning assets grew 12% this quarter, 11% last quarter, but before that it was kind of flat or down the prior few quarters. So is anything changing with the balance sheet?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yeah, there is no question that some of our larger custodian clients are placing more deposits with us, some just with the growth in the business but I would also tell you that some of these deposits are large, chunky deposits which even within that, I wouldn\u2019t characterize them as all being the same. As you would expect, we follow them very closely and when I say not the same, I would say some of them, for example, are money managers who at this point in time just have excess cash and placing it at the bank in a deposit is preferable for them at this point in time. As you would expect, if they have a different view on the market going forward, they may deploy more, and we\u2019ve seen that in the past with different clients.","But it is just a higher level of deposits with our custodian clients at this point that\u2019s driving the increase in the balance sheet. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily, Mike, look from quarter to quarter again to expect that it is going to necessarily go up or go down. It\u2019s just a longer term trend. It goes in fits and starts a little bit, but as long as we continue to expand the business, we certainly expect that the deposits will also expand.","Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Thanks, good morning. I\u2019d like to go back to the SLR for just a quick question. You mentioned you\u2019re 5% of the holding company. Can you just conceptually\u2014you know, if you guys have gotten this far, how should we be thinking about where you\u2019d like to run your SLR? What kind of cushion you\u2019re thinking that would be appropriate for Northern? Would it be running it at 5, 5.25, 5.5, and then maybe if you could kind of update us where you are kind of the bank level?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Sure. So as far as\u2014let me take the second part first, which is with regard to the bank level. The bank level is approximately in the same neighborhood that the holding company is as well. As you know, you can affect the level of capitalization at the bank differently than the holdco to the extent that you downstream from the holdco into the bank. But at this point, we\u2019re comfortable with the level of capitalization at both the bank level and the holding company level, and I would say as far as where we\u2019re targeting the SLR, I would say similar to our other ratios. We look at all of them collectively and just over time determine what is the level that we feel we need, first from an internal perspective, second from a regulatory perspective, and that\u2019s an area that particularly with the SLR right now, I would say we have a fair amount of room given that the requirement for Northern Trust is at 3%, and as we pointed out we\u2019re above 5% there. So there is room there on the regulatory front, but then the third category we talked about or consideration is just the level of our peers as well, which a number of our peers will be held to the higher level of 5%. So that\u2019s definitely a consideration as we look at it.","We have the ability to be below that 5%, so I think in some ways that gives us more flexibility, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that it allows us to not have to consider it. We definitely have to take it into our consideration.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Okay, great. That was helpful. Maybe shifting back to the asset management business, I\u2019m curious if you could update us\u2014I guess maybe it was 18 months or two years ago, I forget precisely, you had kind of re-launched your ETF initiative. I believe you have at least several billion of assets there now. Could you maybe update us on that on how that business is going, maybe kind of what extent you see that contributing to some of the organic growth there, and just kind of really just update us on where that stands.","Michael O\u2019Grady","Sure, be glad to. Our ETF business, as you mentioned, is FlexShares, and as of the end of the quarter the assets under management in FlexShares was $7.6 billion, so it\u2019s been very successful for us given that it was a re-launch, but it was a re-launch from a standing start and it\u2019s been an effort where we are focused on not necessarily competing in what I would consider the more commodity or general ETFs, but rather ETFs that we think are structured in a way that they are particularly appealing for our clients. It\u2019s important for us because as we talk about the trends within the asset management industry and talk about things like going from active to passive, we want to be in a position where we\u2019re able to provide the right products for our clients, so part of these trends have resulted in the ETFs going above the $7 billion, as I talked about.","It\u2019s something that we certainly like the strategy there. We\u2019ve rolled out a number of new funds which, at this point, are low levels of AUM but certainly that we have high expectations for.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Maybe just one follow-up question, if I could, on the ETF business. Are you sourcing most of those assets maybe through your private client business to the extent you\u2019re including them in your asset allocation or model portfolios or whatnot, or are you seeing more of those assets come in through a third party source?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yeah, it\u2019s a combination of both, so as I mentioned, part of it is we do structure these products so that they are appropriate and useful for our existing wealth management clients, but we also have a very focused third party effort here to distribute those funds directly to new clients of Northern Trust where the only product they may have, for example Robert, would be the ETF. So at this point, most of the AUM has come from our wealth management business, but the expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to grow the business both from that source but then also directly with new clients.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Thank you, good morning. Mike, you guys have the ROE target of 10 to 15% for Northern Trust, and as you pointed out earlier, you\u2019ve had some very strong growth in assets under custody as well as the global custody assets, and this quarter as well assets under management were quite strong. Is it\u2014and your ROE, unfortunately when you back the last five years with the exception, I think, of \u201909 has been consistently under 10%, below your range. Is it simply a matter of interest rates, because I know you have the fee market waivers as a drag on earnings, so it is really we\u2019re waiting for interest rates to rise for you to get into that 12, 13% ROE consistently?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yeah, I would say that we are not waiting on interest rates to rise. They may rise, they may not rise, and at this point as to when they\u2019ll rise, we wouldn\u2019t know even if you told me it was certain that they\u2019re going to rise. So our focus has been on improving the profitability absent that. Certainly, the low interest rates have presented the drag they have, but part of the reason why we have the slide there that points out the expenses to trust fees ratio is because although, again, that\u2019s not completely immune from external factors so the money market fee waivers does impact that ratio, because it lowers the fees. But it is a way that we think we can control the profitability more, and that\u2019s why we are focused on trying to bring that ratio down to make the core fee business more profitable for us. Over the last nine quarters, we\u2019ve been successful looking year-over-year in bringing that ratio down to 113% now from 131% going back to 2011.","So to get into the target range of 10 to 15%, we need to continue to focus on bringing that down absent what may happen in the environment.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Where would that ratio have to go to get you, because I\u2019m looking at your trends package here and it\u2019s just been so challenging for you folks and your peers \u2013 it\u2019s not just Northern Trust. Does that expense to fee number have to break 100% to get you over the 10% into 12% ROE territory?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yeah, as you mention, there\u2019s lots of other factors related to it, so there\u2019s not a specific number I would give you. But at the same time, I would say we do not necessarily need to reach a particular point \u2013 you mentioned 100% or to go below that \u2013 in order to get into our range.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Okay, and then the second question is on your stock buyback this year that you were approved for. Are you expecting to spread that out over a 12-month period, or is it going to be more front-end loaded, back-end loaded? And then the second part of that \u2013 what do you see for your incentive comp for this coming year for your employees? How much stock will you be distributing to eligible employees?","Michael O\u2019Grady","I\u2019ll take your second question first just with regard to incentive comp and the composition there. As you would expect, that is ultimately determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors, and they finished up the past year but they are early stages of how they would look at this year, going into it, and ultimately I don\u2019t know what their thinking is on that front. But clearly they are trying to provide the right mix to reward employees for the right type of activity and performance, and there\u2019s nothing that really changed significantly in the past year with regard to the mix there other than, I would say, making it more performance-oriented and making sure that it\u2019s aligned with our corporate targets.","As far as the share repurchase, as we\u2019ve talked about before, there are a number of factors that go into determining the amount of stock that we\u2019ll repurchase in a particular quarter, and we do not have a particular strategy that we\u2019re going to communicate with regard to whether it\u2019s even or front or back-loaded, just given the fact that there are a number of factors that go into it.","Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hello. In terms of the shift from assets from active to passive business, particularly on the wealth management side, what can you do to ensure that as clients\u2019 risk appetite returns, that still (audio interference).","Michael O\u2019Grady","Geoffrey, I think I missed the last part of the question. Geoffrey?","Operator","Just one moment. I\u2019m sorry, please continue, Mr. Elliott.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hello. So the share of equities in wealth management AUM has been increasing pretty significantly, but I guess because of the shift from active to passive products, that hasn\u2019t really been benefiting the fee rate, so what can you do to ensure that you benefit as clients\u2019 risk appetite returns?","Michael O\u2019Grady","So we clearly benefit to the extent that our clients benefit, and so our objective is to provide the best wealth management services and expertise to them, and we feel that as it has been true historically, we\u2019ll benefit along with them to the extent that they do well.","As far as the trends, though, we also try to position ourselves well for the trends, and with the shift from active to passive, we actually think we\u2019re well positioned in the sense that we capture a large portion of the assets as they shift them around, given that we\u2019re well positioned in passive, but then further, very specifically the ETFs were directed at ensuring that we have products that meet those needs as well. So we will continue to do things like the ETFs where it\u2019s in product development in our asset management group. They\u2019re very focused on what are products that our clients will find useful as we go forward so that we can not only make sure that they are successful but that, as I mentioned, we can financially share in that success.","Operator","Was there anything further, Mr. Elliott?","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","Hello, can you hear me?","Michael O\u2019Grady","Yes.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","On the last call, you mentioned that you expected to get back into the 10 to 15% ROE target range this year. Do you still expect to do that after reporting the 9.3% for the first quarter?","Michael O\u2019Grady","The 10 to 15% range is our target range, and clearly the objective for not only me but for the company and management and all the employees is to be in our target range, so that is definitely what we continue to endeavor to do.","Geoffrey Elliott \u2013 Autonomous Research","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","I\u2019ll turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.","Beverly Fleming","Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our second quarter performance in July. Have a good day.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations, Bev Fleming, for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead.","Beverly J. Fleming","Thank you, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.","Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'Grady, Northern Trust's Chief Financial Officer; and Jane Karpinski, our Controller.","For those of you who did not receive our second quarter earnings press release or financial trends report via e-mail this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com.","In addition and also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call.

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.","Michael G. O'Grady","Thank you, Bev. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. As usual, we've organized today's call into 3 sections. I'll review our second quarter results, update you on our Driving Performance initiative and comment on our capital. Bev and I would then be pleased to answer your questions.","Starting with some overview comments on Slide 2. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $191 million and earnings per share of $0.78. In the second quarter, we were successful in growing the business and revenues, while improving productivity, profitability and returns. Our value proposition continues to resonate with clients and we grew both our personal and institutional businesses.","Wealth management clients continue to build confidence and we remain well positioned as a valued adviser. With institutional clients, we're seeing a good pace of activity across global regions, products and client segments. The operating environment continue to be mixed, with both positive and negative implications on our business.","Equity markets in the U.S. and Europe were generally higher and supplemented our strong new business results. However, lower fixed income markets detracted from client asset values. The S&P 500 was up 18% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, while the EAFE Index was up 15% year-over-year, but down 2% sequentially. The Barclays Aggregate Bond Index was down 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Client assets under custody ended the quarter at $5 trillion, up 9% over last year; and assets under management ended at $803 billion, up 14%. On a sequential basis, client custody and managed asset levels were both down 1%.","Currency volatility increased for the second quarter in a row, combined with higher client trading volumes to positively impact our foreign exchange trading income. Short term interest rates remain low despite an increase in longer-term rates at the end of the quarter. This placed continued pressure on our net interest margin and also resulted in ongoing fee waivers in connection with our money market mutual funds.","We continued to successfully execute on the Driving Performance initiatives announced in early 2012, further improving our productivity and profitability and enhancing our capacity for investment and future growth regardless of the macro environment.","The net effect of all these factors was a return on equity of 10%. The first time we've been within our target range of 10% to 15% since the second quarter of 2010.","Let's move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the second quarter. As I mentioned, earnings per share was $0.78 for the quarter, an increase of 7% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, exhibiting solid improvement in both comparisons. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 3% and expenses were up 2%. Revenue growth was the result of trust, investment and other servicing fees increasing 8% and foreign exchange trading income increasing 20%, but being offset by a 14% reduction in net interest income. Expenses were up only 2% due to the impact of Driving Performance and good expense control across categories.","Year-over-year, our loan loss provision was unchanged at $5 million. As a result, net income was 6% higher than last year's second quarter. Compared to last quarter, revenues were up 5% and expenses were essentially flat. Higher trust, investment and other servicing fees and foreign exchange trading income were again offset by lower net interest income. Flat expenses on a sequential basis primarily reflect higher compensation and outside services expenses, offset by lower business promotion and other expenses. As a result, net income was 17% higher sequentially.","Our return on equity of 10% for the second quarter was higher than both comparable periods and was at the lower end of our longer-term target. With that background and summary, let's get into more detail behind our second quarter results.","Beginning on Page 4, second quarter revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were $1 billion, up 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues, were $657 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Higher equity markets and new business were both drivers of the increases. I'll go into further detail on trust fees shortly.","Foreign exchange trading income was $71 million in the second quarter, up 20% both year-over-year and sequentially, with higher currency market volatility in most major currencies and a higher trading volume both contributing to the improved results.","Other operating income of $36 million for the quarter increased 6% year-over-year and 47% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was due to various miscellaneous items, including higher income on employee benefit assets held in trust. The sequential quarter increase reflects a $12.4 million write-off of certain receivables in the first quarter.","Net interest income of $228 million in the second quarter was down 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, primarily due to a lower net interest margin, which I'll discuss in more detail as well.","Moving to Page 5, let's look at the components of our fee revenues. For our Corporate & Institutional Services business, fees totaled $364 million in the second quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $234 million in the second quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher equity markets, new business and favorable results of our Driving Performance revenue initiatives, offset partially by lower sub-custodian recoveries.","In the sequential quarter comparison, strong equity markets in the first quarter combined with new business to drive the increase. Assets under custody for C&IS clients were $4.5 trillion at quarter end, up 9% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher equity markets and new business, offset partially by the negative impact of currency translations. The sequential decline reflects higher equity markets and new business, being more than offset by the impact of lower fixed income markets and currency translations.","Investment management fees in C&IS were $74 million in the second quarter, up 3% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects the impact of higher equity markets on our index and multi-manager business and new business primarily in index management and mutual funds, partially offset by higher money market fund fee waivers. The sequential quarter decline reflects lower AUM levels, which I'll discuss shortly, and slightly higher money market fund fee waivers. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equaled $10 million in the second quarter, slightly higher year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting lower gross yields achieved in the underlying funds as repo and short-term rates were lower in the second quarter.","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $600 billion at quarter end, up 14% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher equity markets and new business. Sequentially, C&IS AUM declined 1% as higher equity markets were more than offset by lower fixed income market, outflows from institutional money market and fixed income mutual funds and lower securities lending collateral.","Other fees in C&IS were $25 million in the second quarter, up 19% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects a number of items, the largest of which is growth in investment risk and analytical services. The sequential decline reflects a normal seasonal pattern where fees associated with benefit payment services are typically lower in the second quarter.","Securities lending fees were $31 million in the second quarter, up 1% year-over-year and 39% sequentially. The sequential quarter increase reflects the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads.","Moving to our personal business. PFS trust, investment and other servicing fees were $293 million in the second quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. The growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, reflects strong new business and higher equity markets. Money market fund fee waivers in PFS were up slightly in the second quarter to $13 million. Assets under management for PFS clients were $202 billion at quarter end, up 15% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. In the sequential quarter comparison, a $4 billion decline in cash balances drove the decrease. PFS assets under custody were $453 billion at quarter end, up 10% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The sequential decline, again, reflects lower cash and fixed income balances.","Moving to Page 6. Net interest income was $228 million in the second quarter, down 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Earning assets averaged $83 billion in the quarter, essentially unchanged year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. The net interest margin was 1.10% in the second quarter, down 18 basis points year-over-year and 5 basis points sequentially. The lower margin reflects lower yields across earning asset categories as short-term interest rates continue to decline. For example, average 3-month LIBOR was down 19 basis points year-over-year and declined further in the second quarter. Overnight repo rates were also lower.","More specifically, looking at the sequential decline by earning asset category, the yield on interest-bearing deposits with banks declined 2 basis points, with the biggest impact being a 15 basis point drop in overnight rates in the Australian dollar. The yield on the securities portfolio declined 13 basis points, primarily reflecting higher premium amortization in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio due to changes in prepayment speed assumptions, as the overall yield on the loan portfolio declined by 6 basis points as over half of the portfolio is floating rate and new loans and leases are coming on our balance sheet at lower yields than those rolling off. These declines in earning asset yields were partially offset by slightly lower cost of funds.","Turning to Page 7. Expenses were $730 million in the second quarter, up 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Let's take a look at the trends in expenses by category. Compensation expense was up 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting staff growth and pay adjustments. Staff increases have been mostly in our Global Fund Services business in C&IS, which is growing rapidly, and in certain corporate areas, which are requiring additional resources to meet increasing regulatory developments and requirements.","Employee benefit expense decreased 1% year-over-year and was up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline primarily reflects a lower level of health care expense, while the sequential increase reflects higher FICA insurance expense.","Outside services expenses increased 2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, with higher consulting expense driving both the year-over-year and sequential growth in this expense category. As we've discussed, this category generally includes cost for third parties that we contract for services such as sub-custodians, technical services contractors, consultants, lawyers and others. The expense level can vary both with client activity levels in a particular period, as well as corporate needs, such us regulatory projects and initiatives. Depending on the specific circumstances, we occasionally engage external resources to supplement internal staff working on these initiatives, increasing requirements related to CCAR, resolution planning and AIFMB and other initiatives resulted in higher expenses for certain components of outside services this quarter and we anticipate this to continue through the remainder of the year.","Equipment and software expense was lower by 7% year-over-year and relatively unchanged sequentially. The second quarter of last year included a $10.5 million software write-off. Absent that item, equipment and software expense increased 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting depreciation and amortization of ongoing investments in technology. This growth is lower than we've experienced in previous quarters as we benefited from lower maintenance cost this quarter. However, we would expect the longer-term trend we've experienced for this category to continue going forward as it reflects the higher level of investment we are making in our technology platform.","Other operating expense increased 6% year-over-year, with the largest item being an increase in expenses associated with employee benefit assets held in trust. As I mentioned earlier, this expense is offset in higher other operating income. Sequentially, other operating expense decreased 17%, due primarily to seasonally higher first quarter cost associated with the Northern Trust Open and lower charges associated with account servicing activities in the second quarter.","Occupancy expense increased 2% year-over-year and was unchanged sequentially. On Monday, we announced plans to relocate our Florida headquarters in Miami later this year. And in conjunction with that, we have sold our current building and expect to report a gain on that sale in the third quarter of approximately $30 million. This is an exciting move for our clients and colleagues in Florida, but going forward, will result in higher rent expense associated with the new location.","In sum, expense control was particularly good again in the second quarter. While our expense base fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter for various reasons, it generally tracks with longer-term trends of our fee revenues. Given the continued success we've had in adding new clients, our current objective is to grow our expenses at a lower rate than the growth rate of our fee revenues. We were successful in achieving this for 2012 and to date in 2013. However, we do expect expenses to fluctuate for various reasons and we will continue to experience expense growth pressures.","Let's move to Page 8 to discuss Driving Performance a little more. In the second quarter, we produced over $65 million in pretax operating income improvement from Driving Performance initiatives. The positive impact from revenue initiatives were similar to last quarter, primarily the result of successful pricing and cross-sell efforts in C&IS, as well as incremental pricing actions in PFS.","On expenses, increased benefits were primarily the result of continued success in our procurement effort. This effort addresses a broad range of categories, including market data, print and IT contract labor, to name just a few. And savings are based on sustainable actions in vendor and demand management.","Going forward in 2013, we expect that process optimization and revenue efforts will drive increasing benefits from quarter-to-quarter. Based on the results achieved to date, we remain on track to achieve our Driving Performance target of $250 million in 2013. We are pleased with these efforts and believe that we are creating sustainable improvements to our operating model.","Given the environment, we will continue to pursue meaningful efforts to improve productivity beyond our original Driving Performance target and embed this practice in the ongoing management of the business.","Capital, outlined on Page 9, remain very strong, with Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios of 12.6% and 13.1%, respectively. Based on preliminary interpretation of the final Basel III rules released by the Federal Reserve on July 2, our Tier 1 common capital ratio based on the advanced approach on a fully phased-in basis would be a 12.8%. Under the standardized approach, the Tier 1 common capital ratio is estimated at 10.3%. Both of these ratios are well above the fully phased-in requirement of 7%, which includes the capital conservation buffer.","Additionally, the supplementary leverage ratio is estimated to be approximately 5.5% at the holding company and approximately 5% at the bank. Both of these are above the requirements applicable to Northern Trust.","In the second quarter, we repurchased 281,000 shares at a cost of $15 million. Our capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to $385 million of common stock between July of 2013 and March of 2014.","A few thoughts in closing. The second quarter again demonstrated the continued execution of our strategy of providing exceptional service, expertise and advice to our clients around the world. Noteworthy on that front in the second quarter was our announcement that ATP, the largest pension fund in Denmark, had appointed Northern Trust to provide custody and related services for $106 billion in assets. We also established an office in Frankfurt, Germany as part of a continuing commitment to serve clients in the markets in which they operate. Our Frankfurt presence will provide investment operations outsourcing services to Allianz Global Investors, a firm with which we have a strong existing global relationship.","We also achieved our objectives in the second quarter of growing the business and improving our productivity, profitability and returns. Growth in our trust fees more than offset the lowest level of net interest income we've experienced in over 5 years. A very modest increase in our expenses resulted in higher pretax margins and we produced a return on equity just within our long term target range. We feel we have good momentum across our businesses and remain focused on executing our strategy in order to continue to serve our clients, grow our business and improve our financial performance.","Thank you, again, for participating in Northern Trust's second quarter earnings conference call today.","Beth, please open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So Mike, appreciate your comments around the margins and the fact that you guys are progressing nicely on the cost initiatives. But if I look at, I guess, the first half of '13 versus the first half of '12, just the core fees relative to core expenses. So when you kind of exclude the noise with software write-off, et cetera, I see core fee revenues up a little over 2%; and expenses, x these one-offs, up a little bit more than that. And again, I understand there's a mismatch between, I guess, the business wins and when -- the timing of the revenues coming in and then expenses associated with it. You guys are going through lots of regulatory change, et cetera. But from our perspective, what we see from kind of the outside looking in is, you guys are almost through with the cost cutting program but the core margins haven't really moved. So maybe you could kind of provide your thoughts on what incremental you could do to actually improve the profitability of the business from here. And also, if you could potentially size maybe some of the revenue, telling us that you could get that are not flowing through the model yet, but the expenses are, I think that would be helpful.","Michael G. O'Grady","Okay. Let me try to answer that, Alex. So when we look at it, as I mentioned and I think you were headed there, we're looking at the growth in our fees. And for the first half of 2013, our fees grew about 9%. Now again, some of that has been benefited by the positive equity markets, but the remainder of that has been through additional growth, new business, organic growth. And at the same time, we've grown total expenses basically this year at a little over 1%. So that type of growth on the fee side relative to what I would consider pretty modest growth on the expense side is the type of productivity where we think we have the ability to control it. Now outside of the fees, so foreign exchange, net interest income, we certainly look to maximize those revenues as well within the environment. But those revenue streams have less in the way of marginal or incremental costs associated with them. So that's how we've been driving these initiatives. Now even with that said, Alex, we have been successful in executing on the Driving Performance initiative so far this year. We'll certainly be running through the tape on those through the end of the year. But we plan to continue to look for and add new initiatives that will play through in 2014 and beyond and are already in the process of beginning a number of those initiatives. So we look at the opportunity to improve the margins and the overall profitability of the business to just continue as we go forward. What we can't control is interest rates, market volatility, et cetera. And yet to the extent that improves, we think that the bottom line will benefit proportionately.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So maybe just as a summary and I guess as a follow-up, flat markets, flat rates, flat volatility, given the project spend that you have planned, do margins go up or down next year?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, our objective would be that they go up. Because our objective is to continue to grow the business organically, markets aside, and to not allow our expense growth to exceed that.","Operator","Moving on now to Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I think it was early to see some better trend in FX this quarter wasn't really a surprise either, though it's still a fairly depressed revenue line by historical standards. And I assume some of the structural challenges that were -- and cited by others, they perversely have been hurting you the most, are still an issue. So I was wondering if you had given more consideration to what response you might pursue to mitigate the loss of those standing instruction FX revenues, and how you're managing through the changes in client behavior about how and where they want to execute FX.","Michael G. O'Grady","9","Yes. I think you described the situation well, Luke. And this is something that we began to respond to quite a while ago within the business and are beginning to see the benefit of that. And what it is primarily, is first of all, really looking to expand the client base in which we do FX with. So as you mentioned, traditionally our business has been focused on almost exclusively our custody clients. And what we've been attempting to do is expand that to more third party. There are a number of our clients, for example, in the Global Fund Services business, where we're their fund administrator, but we may not be their custodian. And yet, we haven't been doing much in the way of FX with that client base. So that when I say a third party, it's not necessarily institutions that we don't have relationships with. It's just that we haven't been transacting foreign exchange with them. So that is the primary area that we've been focused on. Now, there are some resource requirements around that, which we've been making, both in the way of the systems and platforms around that, which we continue to further enhance what we have. And then also with regard to client service, so that if we're going to cover a broader set of clients, we need people to do that and those people are on board. And then finally, it's a whole new set of counterparties that we're dealing with. And so we need to make sure that we've underwritten the additional counterparties in a way that we're comfortable with. So all of this work well underway. And as I mentioned, just beginning to see the benefit of it. Such that a quarter like this, the 20% improvement that you saw is almost exclusively from the benefit of the markets. But going forward, we would expect to also have the benefit from these initiatives on that front.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Helpful. And I guess while we're on ad valorem revenues, a quick question on securities lending. I know it's not a big a revenue item for you guys. But you do get a nice bump every second quarter from the dividend arbitrage season in Europe. I know recently there's been a lot of talk about eliminating discriminatory tax treatment that makes those trades possible in the first place, with France leading the way and other countries are expected to follow possibly. So do you have any insight on how that situation is developing? And what's your current thinking about the continuation of that seasonal benefit going forward?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. Clearly, there are developments on that front and the regulation around that. And we do believe that it could have an impact on the business. And there are a number of things that can impact that business, as well as others. But I would say at this point, we don't have any particular insight as to the direction. Frankly, we were pleased with the level of activity in the second quarter here. As you saw, it was up significantly, obviously, from the previous quarter, but also relatively consistent with where we were a year ago, which in our minds just demonstrates, at least from a client perspective, the level of engagement and activity we've had has not diminished.","Operator","And with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, our next question comes from Howard Chen.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, on the latest capital rules and proposals from a U.S. regulator perspective, it seems like Northern will not be held to the same level of standards that maybe many of your competitors will. I realize it's in management's DNA to be really conservative. But do you agree there's potential gap? And how do you think about that as a competitive advantage in winning business?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. Clearly, with some of the most recently proposed rules around the supplemental leverage ratio, they've created a line of delineation between the 8 largest banks and ourselves and other banks. And I did mention our supplemental leverage ratio at 5.5%. So again, even on a fully phased-in basis, we would be above even that 5% level at the holdco. So we feel very well positioned for that, Howard. As for as, does that difference create a competitive advantage for us? I don't necessarily think so. We don't look at that as some type of capital arbitrage that's been created because it's important for us to have strong capitalization, both as we determine it internally, but also in a way that compares favorably with our competitors. And so we're observant not only of those regulations that apply directly to us, but also those that apply to the industry.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And my follow-up, just given the very conservative risk profile and shorter duration nature of your investment portfolio, can you just give us an update on how you think about treasury management in this transitory period for rates? Maybe if rates don't change from here, is this kind of the floor for core net interest margin and can we see an inflection upwards?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So on net interest margin, we certainly can't necessarily say it's a floor because as much as the majority of our balance sheet is either floating rate or very short duration, there are still parts of the portfolio, and both the securities portfolio and the loan portfolio, that roll off over time. And as we originate new loans, they come on at the current rates. Which even the long-term rates with recent move, are lower than some of the longer-term rates where they were historically. So we can't say that we're at the lowest level. Having said that, we've seen the longer end of the curve move up. To the extent that, that eventually moves down to the shorter end, we would certainly benefit much more given the nature of our balance sheet.","Operator","Moving on now to Robert Lee with KBW Securities.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","First question I had was really just on deposit growth. I mean, one of -- you clearly had pretty good new business growth in both C&IS and PFS, yet you've seen deposits really kind of flatline for the better part of last year or so. And I guess normally you would have assumed there'd be even some modest growth just as you expand client relationships in both sides of the business. So is it by choice you're trying to kind of limit that? Or maybe is there any kind of color you could provide on why you wouldn't see even kind of some modest growth in the deposits the last 1.5 years or so with all the new business wins?","Michael G. O'Grady","So I think that you've described the environment well and what's occurred. And yet I would say, so far, that's actually met up with our expectations. And what I mean by that is, the environment that we were in before was more conservative, if you will, from our client's perspective. And so they were placing more deposits with us. And as a result, our deposit levels went up. And what we've seen more recently here is a greater comfort level to deploy those deposits. And so whether that's into some of our funds, or frankly in certain cases with either the corporate or particularly some of our largest wealth clients, they deploy that into businesses that they may have and other activities. And we saw some of that here in the second quarter. So it definitely is not something that we look to move one direction or the other. It's up to our client's preferences as to how they want to deploy their liquidity. And basically, we want to be able to work with them to do that. And that's what we've seen over the last several quarters.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right. Great. And maybe as my follow-up. Curious in the -- the investment management revenue in C&IS, I mean, understanding there was a slight tick up in money fund fee waivers sequentially. But it does seem like, at least the way I calculate it, kind of the fee rate certainly has been trending down for the last 4 or 5 quarters straight. And maybe talk a little bit about some of the underlying mix that you're seeing. Obviously, I know the index business has been growing. But I guess, I had also thought that some of your manager -- managers and tactical allocation have been growing with maybe a little bit higher fee rate, so maybe you talk about that a bit.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. So I think you somewhat asked your question and began to answer it there as well, which is as we see the mix of our assets under management on the institutional side change and evolve over time, that is impacting the average fee that we earn on those assets that we're managing. And as you've mentioned, we've been very successful in growing our index business, in particular our equity index business. And as a result, we've seen the average fee come down. So even looking year-over-year at the strong growth, I believe that our assets under management on the C&IS side was up over $80 billion. And over $60 billion of that was in equity and most of that is equity index, both as a result of the market, as well as new business. And that brought down the average fee. So again, we saw greater growth in the AUM level than we did in the fee level. And then you also mentioned in there the fact that we had higher money market fund fee waivers, which also brought that growth down a little bit.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will now move to Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Hey, guys, it's Ken. And I wanted to ask you guys about -- just, Mike, can you elaborate a little bit more on that GSA portfolio and talk about -- you mentioned premium amortization was up this quarter, but given where rates are going, I would think that, that would start to go down over time. So I guess 2 different parts of the question. One is, can you talk to us about how much of an effect that was specifically? And then the second point is, it also looks like your end of period balances were quite lower than the average. So can you just talk to us about portfolio strategy and how you're just thinking about reinvestments given the rate environment?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So on the premium amortization, our mortgage-backed portfolio is about $5 billion, or at least securities that relate to having premium is about $5 billion. And as I mentioned in the note there, we had greater premium amortization in the time period. It was $15 million in the second quarter, which compared to $7 million last quarter. And that was the result of prepayment speeds. The methodology we use is a 3-month trailing average.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","There you go.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. And so as you can imagine, with the activity in the quarter, that reduced the -- or increased speeds reduced the estimated lives and, therefore, the amount of amortization went up. So based on your view now with rates going up, what the implications could be there. We'll have to see how it plays out. But we have $94 million of premium at this point on that portfolio and the average life is a little bit under 4 years. So that's, essentially, the rate that we have and the amount that would ultimately go through.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then if you'd just elaborate in terms of how you're just positioning the portfolio, because it looked like it kind of moved out of that GSA bucket into other. So what -- how are you thinking about reinvestments? And where are you kind of moving the book to? And are those yields coming in better than at least what's coming off at this point?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. The yields that we reinvested in the quarter were just about on top of what the average yield was for the portfolio. So we're at 75 basis points and we came in just a little bit higher with our reinvestments in the portfolio. And I would say, the mix of securities, largely are the same. We do look across the categories that we have and from time-to-time we have more opportunity. But really what we're trying to do is, beyond making sure that we have the best credit quality, is looking to maintain right now the duration in about the same place that we've been. So last quarter we were a little over 1 year in index duration and we are at this point as well. So we've maintained about the same duration, same credit quality. And that's why to the extent that rates do move up, we're likely to benefit.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just I noticed that the buyback really slowed this quarter. I just wanted to make sure that you're kind of compelled to just continue to complete the use it or lose it context from the approval and why you might have slowed it this quarter?","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. When we look at share repurchase, we take into account a number of factors. First, certainly, is our capital position and determine if we have the capital both for our current needs and our anticipated needs. Second is our authorizations, whether that's from the board or it's our capital plan. And you mentioned, we still have plenty of capacity there and our capital position is very strong. And then third, we look at the return that we would expect to get relative to other opportunities we may have, whether that's acquisitions or others things. And then finally, we look at the market price, which fluctuates day-to-day. And our objective, of course, is to buy back as many shares as we can with that authorization that we have. So taking that all into account, as you mentioned, we repurchased about $15 million in the quarter and we still have the $385 million in capacity. And certainly, our intent to distribute that to shareholders, one way or the other.","Operator","And next going to Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","My question relates to the Driving Performance program in a couple of parts. One is, I'm just looking at Slide 8, so it seems like you're already at your $250 million of benefit in 2013, is that right? I mean, $55 million plus $65 million, if you just stay at $65 million for the last 2 quarters, then you're there at $250 million. So I'm wondering if I'm doing the math wrong or if there's anything more?","Michael G. O'Grady","Your math is correct, Mike. And we'll count it when it's in the bank, but we have every expectation, yes, to hit that number and to exceed it.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. But the $65 million from the second quarter, that's a run rate now, right? So in a way, you've already achieved it.","Michael G. O'Grady","That's right. We've been doing it internally here as a in-year benefit. But on a run rate, yes, we're already exceeding that level. And there's nothing about the $65 million, Mike, that we would expect that it goes down. These are recurring benefits.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","So my question really relates to what's next? I know you said you'll review this over time, but what's the end game? You said improve the margins. And I'm looking at Page 1 of the supplement and I guess you have profit margin, pretax here, of 28.6% in the second quarter. Is there an end goal to achieve in 1, 2 or 3 years?","Michael G. O'Grady","Not on the margin per se. We are looking to increase that margin. But as you know, the nature of some of our revenues, such as spread income or FX, is that the margins on those are much higher and yet our ability to determine or control those levels is also less. And so that has a significant effect on the margin. So where we've been focused on is the expenses relative to our fees. And we've continued to drive that down and we did again this quarter, with the objective that to the extent we can do that, that not only will it make us more profitable, if nothing else changes. But to the extent that the environment gets better that, that will drop to the pretax margin that you talked about.","Michael Mayo - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And so what is your goal for expenses to fees over time? In other words, for those of us on the outside, we want to see if you guys achieve your targets or not. What kind of target should we think about to see if you're achieving what you wanted to achieve?","Michael G. O'Grady","We don't have a set margin or a set ratio other than to continually improve on that. So we've brought that down from the from the mid-120s, down to this quarter, it was at 111%. It's not going to go down every single quarter lockstep. But certainly over time, that, that is what we're looking to continue to move down. What you're balancing that with, of course, is we also want to continue to invest in the business. So it's being able to create additional Driving Performance opportunities that create capacity for us to invest in the business. And it's that balancing going forward, but it's not a set number or a target ratio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about the organic growth trends in the second quarter, how they related to prior periods? Were they up from the first quarter or at record levels as they had been in some of the last several quarters through the 3 different businesses: the C&IS servicing, C&IS management and then the PFS business? And then just describe, if you will, how you think about expenses going forward related to initiatives to generate organic growth? And when I say going forward, I mean, really, over the next, say, couple of quarters.","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. So as far as the growth, I would say that it's been consistent across the businesses. So within the personal business, PFS, we continue to have very healthy growth there. The second quarter was another good quarter for us. And I would say that in addition to it being in each of the regions, our Global Family Office, part of the business saw particularly strong growth in the quarter. So again, very good. That would be an area that I would highlight where we're servicing the largest of our clients there. On the C&IS front, again, there's a number of businesses within that, that are also doing well. I talked about expanding into Frankfurt. That's our investment outsourcing business. So continued growth there. We also had some clients that we've talked about that have been in the transitioning phase, which came on board during the quarter. So that helped the growth specifically quarter-over-quarter in that line of business. We've also continued to be very successful in the health care and not-for-profit area. You've seen some of the announcements there as well. We've added Emory University and we've added some others in that space, as well, and have had just a very high hit rate in that space. And then certainly, in thinking about core custody and admin business, the ATP win outside of the U.S. there is a very large new mandate for us at over $100 billion. So very broad based. In previous quarters, we talked about Hedge Fund Services doing very well. That continues to grow, I would say, at basically the same pace that it has before. And we expect that to continue. That will experience some lumpiness in the growth in the sense that a lot of the new business there can be midsized firms and then we can have very large new clients, like Bridgewater, which we've previously announced. But it's not in the numbers now and doesn't come in until next year. So relatively broad based at this point is the way I would characterize it across the businesses. And I failed to mention, but on the asset management front, institutionally, also have been successful in the quarter here. I talked a little bit earlier in the call about a number of the wins we've had in the indexing business, particularly the equity indexing side. So continued momentum on that front as well. And then I think your second question was around expenses and how to think about that. It's something where if we win an ATP, as an example, there are more people that we need to hire to service that business. That's different than some of the other areas where I would say that the growth is more leverageable, if you will. So as we win new business in PFS, for every new client, we're not adding new individuals on that front. And that's why with some of the headcount growth you've seen, you've seen more on the C&IS side than you've seen on the PFS side. So that gives you some idea as to what happens with the people. As far as some of the other expense categories, we mentioned what we're doing -- excuse me, in Florida with regard to our headquarters. Which that's -- again, it's nice that we're able to sell that property for a nice gain. And we're going to move into some very nice space down in Miami. But there'll be some incremental cost that goes with that. As you know, we expanded into Washington, D.C. recently. There's the investment for that. And when we expand into a Frankfurt or we open up an office in Saudi Arabia, those all are investments in the sense of expenses that come online as a part of that. So and then I would be remiss on the investment side without talking about technology, where our technology spend will continue to be healthy and it's very much related to the business growth and being able to serve these clients. It's important that, not only on the client front are we able to provide mobile applications and things like that, but that we also are spending on the infrastructure side to be able to have strong, stable systems to service the clients, as well as have high levels of security in the environment that we're in right now. So hopefully that gives you a little more color on where the incremental expense growth comes from.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. It's very helpful. And just to follow up on the -- you talked about potentially extending the Driving Performance program, right? You think about it as sort of a core operating principle. Can you describe the revenue component of that versus the expense component? And I guess what I'm really driving at is, is there ability to, basically, capture more revenue across your businesses on a fee-based basis by either changing pricing or changing or charging differently for the mix of services that you do?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, there definitely is, going forward. I mean, we've had the balance between -- in Driving Performance between revenue and expense at about 40% revenue, 60% expense, which we've been pleased that, that balance has held up. And going forward, whether it's exactly that same proportions, not clear, but all the same initiatives on both of the fronts. And with regard to the revenue side, as I mentioned, with PFS, we have had further improvements there. And that was less with a across-the-board change in our fee structure, which we did going back to the beginning of this program, but it's more around specific areas and specific relationships where we have different discounting practices. And we've been able to better align, as we've talked about, the value proposition that we're delivering with the fees on a more granular level with our clients. And then with C&IS, I would say, as I mentioned, again, we saw the benefit of some of the early work that was done in trying to align certain relationships where the economics or the financials did not match up with the level of service that we were providing. And frankly, that's been a good exercise as we've gone through it because I think it helps -- beyond the financial impact, it helps with the client relation aspect of it, to make sure that we are providing services that they want. And that when they appreciate that level, I think, they're more inclined to pay for it. So we expect to continue -- that's an ongoing process as we go through the various relationships because in this business, none of it is static, and so you have to constantly do it.","Operator","And with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we'll hear from Cynthia Mayer.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Question on the loans and leases. It looked like they decreased in the quarter. They decreased last quarter, too. And I'm just wondering what would it take to get that moving in a positive direction? I mean, I know it's net, but maybe if you just talk a little about what it would take.","Michael G. O'Grady","Sure. You are correct. And that is something that has been sluggish on the lending side, not due to lack of effort and focus on our part there because we do believe that there's an opportunity and much of it is going to be based on the market demand and need for that. We are more and more -- excuse me, on the PFS side, looking to tailor our lending to our core client base. And so there will be some transition as a result of that. And what I mean by that is, as oppose to on the mortgage front, for example, looking to lend to a very broad market or audience. We're very focused on those clients that are or will be investment management clients and be able to take advantage of the full suite of services. So that further narrowing in could cause some decrease in the near term for us. But longer term, we not only think that there's growth, but we think that the overall client relationships will be that much more profitable for us. And it's not with -- the PFS side, it is definitely not just with mortgages as well. I mean, we are looking and have been looking to lend to our clients across their needs. And the client base that we go off of have much broader borrowing needs beyond just mortgages, but certainly for businesses that they own and other needs that they may have. And then on the C&IS side, I would say, likewise, we look to offer a complete set of products and services for our client base. And really on that front, it has more to do with their ultimate demand and the utilization of the facilities that we do provide them. And frankly, with the economy growing at the slow pace that it has, we just haven't seen the pickup on the demand side at this point.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then maybe for a follow-up, just a question on asset management. And it's a question on your ETF. Although they're small, it looks like they've had relatively good organic growth, including in the second quarter. And I'm just wondering, are the flows from PFS clients or are they from institutional clients that you have? Or are you attracting money from investors who are totally outside of Northern?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. So the growth, as you mentioned, has been very strong. So we were over $5 billion in assets in that category and that is after basically 1.5 years from the launch. So it's one of the fastest-growing ETF families of funds. And the growth has come from a number of sources. Definitely, a significant contributor to that is our current PFS client base, but it also very much is balanced with new clients to Northern. And those new clients, at this point, have been mostly personal clients as opposed to institutional. But it is a part of the investment management product offering for our institutional clients. So it is different sources. But so far, it's been mostly existing clients and then new personal clients to Northern.","Operator","And moving on, we'll now hear from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to drill down a little bit into the prepayment speeds and the yields on the securities portfolio. Last year, we were defending the securities yield at around 1% and that was kind of a goal that we had talked about. And then since then, as rates dropped even lower, you really got those prepayment speeds coming in which look like -- took out anywhere from 15 to 20 basis points on the yield, which puts you kind of where you're at today. As those prepayment speeds are slowing, is the yield going to go kind of -- do you see it move back towards at least 90 basis points, somewhere in that range? And are you willing to, now that rates are a little bit higher, start to extend a little bit into duration because you were probably just avoiding the low interest rates that you had up until this point?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. So I think you're correct on the impact of the prepayment speeds. A pretty significant impact on the portfolio, approximately 10 basis points just on the securities portfolio on a sequential basis. So meaningful. And to the extent, yes, that it goes the other way, we will see that impact. We use a constant yield methodology. So to the extent that the lives are shortened or extended, we have to make the adjustment in order to remain on that constant yield. And as far as the portfolio, overall, as I mentioned earlier, we're little over 1 year in that index duration. And you're correct that we've been reticent to do too much when rates are at very, very low levels. But it's certainly something as we see the longer end of the curve move up, it's something that we watch closely because it has provided opportunities for us to be able to add at higher yields than where we were adding. So very much an opportunistic strategy that fits within the broader parameters that we have for managing that conservative portfolio.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then as a follow-up over on the expense side. We had the $6 million uptick in that outside services, consulting expenses. You really cited a lot of regulatory pressures. Are you kind of in the cusp as you get into CCAR and kind of get into some of the larger bank types of requirement, is this kind of a transitional year for you that might require an elevated cost level for a year or so? But then after that, you might be able to accomplish most of those requirements and see that come back down?","Michael G. O'Grady","We did see, as you mentioned, higher level of consulting expenses in the quarter. And because of this transition, which I think is a fair characterization, where we have been a CapPR bank, we are now a CCAR bank or our capital plan will be under the CCAR framework. That has definitely caused an increase in the requirements on our side, both ongoing requirements in the sense of hiring additional internal resources, but also external resources. And to your point, difficult to determine which of those are permanent or ongoing. But there's no question that we are in this transition period. I just can't predict whether there will be future transition periods. But this year, there's no question that there are a number of either transitions like that or first-time projects, like resolution planning, that just didn't exist in the past, but require both internal and external resources.","Operator","And we are now moving on to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A couple of questions, Mike. One, how much was the stock option expense in the first quarter? And how much was it this quarter? So just looking at comp excluding that.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, Bev, do you want to give those numbers?","Beverly J. Fleming","Well, share-based compensation in the quarter, if you're looking at the year-over-year, so we had share-based compensation was...","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I'm looking at linked quarter, meaning, first quarter versus second quarter, because that tends to be higher in the first quarter.","Michael G. O'Grady","Right. So I believe it declined, sequentially, $7 million.","Beverly J. Fleming","Right.","Michael G. O'Grady","Last year. And this year, it only declined $2 million.","Beverly J. Fleming","Right.","Michael G. O'Grady","So part of it...","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","From Q1 to Q2. Okay.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. And your observation is consistent with some changes in our compensation. Whereas previously, there was a greater proportion of the share-based compensation that was in options. And as a result, when we had the first quarter, there's a higher level of expense related to options to retirement eligible employees. This more recent year, we've had a lower proportion of that share-based compensation in options. And as a result, the first quarter level was less, and therefore the step down to the second quarter was less. So it creates about a $5 million difference.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Got it. Second question, going back to the buyback question. Since you laid out what are the -- what it is you would use your capital for and given that stock prices haven't been going down, so it's not like you're waiting for -- to timing for stock prices, I'm sure. What are you seeing in terms of acquisition opportunities? Is the chatter picking up? Is there -- are you seeing more things? Is there any increased activity on that front?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. I would say it's consistent with what we would normally see. As our history has demonstrated, we are very selective on acquisitions. But from time-to-time, there are opportunities for us to acquire strategic businesses or capabilities. And I would say, we continue to see on -- with all of our businesses, meaning, PFS, C&IS, as well as on the asset management front, various opportunities, not necessarily significant in size, but potentially interesting to us that to the extent that they can be both strategically attractive after we've done due diligence and we can acquire them at a price that is financially attractive, that we would consider proceeding on.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So nothing different? Because I'm trying to still understand why the buyback was so slow this quarter. If there wasn't an uptick in, at least the opportunities to look at, because at least if you start to see more stuff, that makes you want to hold back for that. But given that you're not seeing that, your balance sheet growth isn't accelerating, I'm sort of still struggling with why the buyback was so soft.","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. We're -- as far as the buybacks, I mentioned the framework with which we think about those. And as a result, that does not result in a consistent level of repurchases, either week-by-week, month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter. And it's something that -- our objective if we are going to repurchase stock, as I mentioned, is to buy more stock when we perceive the price to be lower and less when we perceive it to be higher. So it really is, it's about buying more shares in with the total amount that we have to deploy. And so that has not changed and that will still be our objective going forward here.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you're waiting for the price to come down. Okay. Got it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just following up on maybe that line of questioning in terms of capital. Did I hear you right in terms of, when you were reviewing the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is 12.8% on the advanced approach, 10.3% on the standardized?","Michael G. O'Grady","Correct.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And which is the constraining factor? Is it the lower of the 2 or...","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, well, ultimately, one of the things, Andrew, that changed between the proposed rule and the final rule was the application of buffer requirements. Previously under the proposed rule, there were no buffers that were added to the standardized ratio in determining capital adequacy. So at that point, for example, as long as your standardized was above 4.4% Tier 1 common, then to determine your adequacy relative to buffers, you would look at your advanced ratio if you were an advanced approach bank, which we were. With the final rule, they're applying the buffers to both standardized and advanced. And so you need to look at both of those ratios and use the lower of the 2. And so that's why we thought it appropriate in this call to give you both ratios. As far as the constraining factor or limit, that is a very difficult -- it's not that it's a difficult question, it's just that it changes over time based on any number of things. Because the ratios are calculated, as you know, in very different ways. The numerator side of the equation, you have 3 different determinants for what's in the numerator, whether it's common or Tier 1 or total capital. And then now we have 3 different methodologies for determining the assets or the denominator. And importantly, those 3 different ways, so whether it's leverage or it's standardized approach or advanced approach, is impact -- first of all, they're calculated in different ways, but then they're impacted by different types of risks. And so at any point in time, you could theoretically have a different constraint. So our approach is very much looking at all of those combinations to ensure that we're comfortable with our capital levels. And needless to say, we are very comfortable with all of the ratios at this point in time.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then related -- I mean, how do you guys view your own capital in terms of adequacy versus your own internal hurdle rates based on either of these new calculations and outputs or otherwise? What's the right level that you think you should be running at?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. I mean, I would certainly say, as the rules get finalized, that it helps us move forward with looking at the various ratios. But given what I just laid out there for that framework, there is no single ratio by which we say this is our single target ratio. But rather for each of those that we go through, we determine what is the required level and then we determine levels above each of those at which we would want to maintain our capital. And at this point, again, we're above all of those such that we have the opportunity to deploy capital either in new investments or to return capital, which we're doing. And I would say nothing in the final rules really change significantly such that we feel differently about our actual position.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then back to expenses, in terms of the Driving Performance already at your all-time -- all-in goal and you're going to do more than that. But when we review and go back and we look at the original premise of it was to improve operating margins 500, 600 basis points. Do you feel like you've achieved that at this point, even though maybe we're a little bit shy of kind of that ultimate goal in the kind of the low-30s, since that was kind of an all-else-equal type framework?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, I think you're right, Andrew. Which is, we do track what the impact has been. And at this quarter's level, we're over 5.5% or 550 basis points plus benefit to the margin relative to where we were. And again, that analysis is done on an all-else-equal basis. Obviously, not everything else has been equal. And we don't need to go through some of the environmental factors that have actually worsened during that time period. And certain things have been better, like equity markets. But the net impact of that has been a drag over that time period. Our objective is to make sure that not only do we hold what we have achieved here, but that we continue to improve on that. And that's a combination of both approach, generally speaking, but it's also making sure that we are planning for and executing on specific initiatives, like we have over the last 1.5 years.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on that point. Given the initiatives that you've laid out in terms of the ongoing investments, but then also coupled with still NIM pressure, but maybe a little bit better fees. Do you think that in this environment you can -- you feel confident in achieving positive operating leverage going forward and maybe for the year?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes, I mean, I look at whether, Andrew, it's the quarter or year-to-date. Even in this environment where year-over-year for the second quarter, with the lowest level of net interest income in over 5 years, as I mentioned, causing us to have net interest income down 14% and creating a drag on revenue such that revenues are only up 3% and yet we can still generate positive operating leverage as a result of all the things we just talked about, I feel pretty good about that.","Operator","And with RBC Capital Markets, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Coming back to your comments about share repurchases and such. And I assume this would be a board decision. But if you feel that your stock price is too high and you're accumulating this capital and you cannot redeploy it, would a special dividend ever be considered as a way of returning that excess capital, but not having to buy your stock price at elevated prices?","Michael G. O'Grady","As you mentioned, ultimately, the board has to determine all of our capital actions. But depending on the circumstances, we'd certainly consider other means of returning capital to shareholders. Special dividend is one of those alternatives. With the capital plan that we submitted, that was not a specific component of it. But again, things change over time and we're constantly looking at ways to either deploy the capital, as we've talked about, or return it to shareholders through various means, be they share repurchase, dividends or something like a special dividend.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I was thinking more for 2014, understanding that a special dividend -- or guessing a special dividend was not in your '13 plan. Following up on the acquisition commentary. When you are out there maybe -- and we know acquisitions are episodic and you can't really predict them. But is there any line of business that you're more interested than others? You do a great job in private wealth management, would you consider purchasing something there here in the U.S. or overseas? Or is it more in the institutional side? Is there any area or color you could give us and maybe what could be interesting to you guys?","Michael G. O'Grady","Yes. It really isn't in any one particular area. And the reason why I say that is, we feel good, as you can imagine, about our competitive position within each of the businesses. And it's really a matter of, are there areas where we can create new opportunities by being in a new geography, for example, or gaining a capability that we didn't have. And as oppose to speculating on different things that would be of interest to us, I think if you looked at some of the deals that we've done, they give an indication of the types of things that we would be interested in going forward, frankly. So in HFS, which was largely through the Omnium acquisition, is a perfect example of our ability to gain a technology and a capability, really, within the hedge fund administration that is part of the broader set of services that we're offering. So there's a lot more. You can look at the BoISS acquisition where it enabled us to grow further and faster in a part of the world, in Ireland, that we previously didn't have. So I would think about it the same way. And it is with each of the businesses. So we haven't done a lot of acquisitions in, for example, PFS. That doesn't mean that we don't look at opportunities, it just means that the screen is very tight.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Bev Fleming, for opening remarks and introductions.

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'grady.","Michael G. O'grady","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev and welcome you to Northern Trust First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During today's call, I'll review our first quarter financial performance and provide an update on the Driving Performance initiative we introduced last quarter. Before we get into the details, I'd like to make a few overview comments on the quarter.","Our first quarter results of earnings per share of $0.66 and a return on equity of 9% reflect progress across a number of fronts against the backdrop of a mixed operating environment. New business was strong, including success with both personal and institutional clients. For example, our Institutional business announced custody wins with UnitedHealth Group and BJC Healthcare as well as another ETF from Source. And just last week, we announced the excellent momentum we are seeing in the hedge fund administration space, which I'll discuss in more detail later in the call.","In our Personal business, we continue to see strong growth across all regions. Equity markets improved for the second quarter in a row. This had a positive impact on the market value of client assets and on our fees where they're calculated on the basis of current period, month-lagged or quarter-lagged asset values. Assets under custody ended the first quarter at a record $4.6 trillion, up 6% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, and assets under management ended at $716 billion, up 8% year-over-year and sequentially. ","Volatility trended lower in the first quarter, resulting in reduced level of foreign exchange trading income. The low level of interest rates continue to pressure net interest income and has also resulted in fee waivers on our money market funds, remaining at high levels, albeit lower in the first quarter than the prior quarter.","The U.S. economy's slow recovery continues, which can be seen in the improving credit quality of our loan portfolio. With nonperforming assets declining for the third quarter in a row, our loan loss provision decreased to $5 million. Execution on our driving performance initiative is off to a strong start for the year on both the revenue and expense fronts. This corporate-wide effort, which began at the end of 2011, focuses on improving our productivity, profitability and returns in order to deliver greater value to our clients and shareholders.","Let's move to Page 2 and discuss the financial highlights of the first quarter.","Net income of $161 million and earnings per share of $0.66 both increased approximately 7% year-over-year and 24% sequentially. Our return on equity of 9% was better than last quarter and one year ago, but still below our historical returns and our future aspirations. The year-over-year comparisons for both revenues and expenses were impacted by the inclusion of the Bank of Ireland Securities Services and Omnium acquisitions, which closed in June and July of 2011, respectively.","The year-over-year comparison was also favorably impacted by higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, higher net interest income and a lower loan loss provision. These favorable factors were partially offset in revenues by reduced foreign exchange trading income and expenses by higher compensation employee benefit and equipment and software expenses. The sequential quarter comparison was favorably impacted by higher trust, investment and other servicing fees, a lower loan loss provision and lower expenses in general, offset partially by reduced net interest income and foreign exchange trading income.","I'd like to highlight 2 additional items which impact the comparison between periods. First, we recorded $3.9 million in restructuring and integration charges during the first quarter. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded $61 million in restructuring, acquisition and integration charges. There's a schedule of the components of these charges in the appendix. Second, there were no Visa-related adjustments in the first quarter. However, our results in the first and fourth quarters of last year included expense credits related to Visa of $10 million and $13 million respectively.","With that background and summary, let me get into more details behind the first quarter results beginning with trust, investment and other servicing fees on Page 3.","Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $575 million the quarter, up 12% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees in C&IS, our Institutional business, totaled $317 million in the first quarter, up 17% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. ","As I mentioned, equity markets were higher in the first quarter, with the S&P up 12% sequentially and the EAFE up 9%. As you recall, some of our custody and investment management fees are calculated based on a one-quarter lag methodology. Given that markets were also up in the fourth quarter, with the S&P 500 up 11% and the EAFE up 4%, sequential performance also benefited from quarter-lag markets.","C&IS custody and fund administration fees were $210 million in the first quarter, up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Both increases were primarily the result of higher fund administration fees, including the acquisitions, as well as new business.","C&IS investment management fees were $62 million in the first quarter, down 8% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, new business was insufficient to offset higher money market fund fee waivers. The sequential quarter increase of 1% reflects a mixed picture: improving market values, new business and lower fee waivers, partially offset by several factors, including product mix and timing. ","Waived fees associated with institutional money market mutual funds and impacting C&IS were $10.6 million in the first quarter, up from $4.6 million in last year's first quarter but down from $12.3 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential quarter decline in institutional fee waivers reflects higher yields in the underlying money market mutual funds.","Securities lending fees were $21.5 million in the first quarter, up 26% compared with last year and 11% sequentially, driven by higher spreads. Borrower demand remained soft, however, as securities lending collateral of $97 billion decreased 12% year-over-year and it increased only 2% sequentially.","C&IS assets under custody were $4.2 trillion at quarter end, up 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, while C&IS assets under management were $537 billion at quarter end, up 9% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.","Asset growth was primarily driven by higher market values and new business.","We continue to be pleased with the pace of new business in C&IS. We had success in the first quarter expanding relationships with existing clients and also bringing in relationships new to Northern Trust. That said, our net new business results were lower than the year-earlier quarter and the fourth quarter, as one significant client was acquired and its assets were consolidated with another custodian. One area where momentum is noteworthy is the hedge fund administration space. In the last 7 months, Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services has secured 22 client wins across the globe, including 6 new clients in the Asia Pacific region. We now have more than $180 billion in hedge fund assets under administration, including clients of Omnium, which we acquired last year. The innovative technology-driven hedge fund administration capabilities that we have brought to the marketplace via Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services clearly provide an attractive proposition for clients in all but one [ph] area where we see very good momentum.","Moving to our Personal business, PFS. Trust, administration and other servicing fees were $258 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and 9% on a sequential quarter basis, reflecting new business, higher market values and the impact of the change in our fee structure, which was effective January 1. ","Money market fee waivers in PFS were $14.8 million in the first quarter, which is $2.5 million higher than the prior quarter but $6.5 million lower than the fourth quarter. The sequential quarter decline in PFS fee waivers reflects 2 factors: first, we reduced fees on our retail mutual fund products effective January 1, coinciding with the implementation of our new PFS fee methodology; second, yields on the funds improved in the quarter. ","With respect to market impacts, our PFS regions used a one-month lag methodology. And on that basis, equity markets were up 8% on a sequential basis in the first quarter. Wealth Management fees are calculated based on a one-quarter lag methodology. While the S&P 500 was up 11% in the fourth quarter, wealth management fees were essentially flat as the impact of markets in new business was more than offset by the internal transfer of certain client accounts out of Wealth Management and into PFS regions and C&IS. ","PFS assets under management were $179 billion at quarter end, up 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting new business and higher markets. During the first quarter, as I just mentioned, we transitioned a large foundation client from PFS' Wealth Management Group to the Foundations and Endowments Group in C&IS. This client account encompasses both custody and managed assets. New business in PFS remains quite strong across all regions and [ph] the Wealth Management Group.","Total revenues are summarized on Page 4. Total trust, investment and other servicing fees, which I just highlighted, were $575 million for the quarter, up 12% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $62 million in the first quarter, down 27% year-over-year and 14% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year decline reflects downward trending volatility and lower client volumes. The sequential decline reflects lower volatility offset partially by slightly higher volumes. All the other fee revenue categories were up 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially.","In the first quarter, we recorded $3 million in credit-related other-than-temporary impairment with our balance sheet securities portfolio, compared with $5 million in the first quarter of last year. And we recorded no such impairment in the fourth quarter. ","Net interest income was $266 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Our net interest margin was 1.24%, down 8 basis points year-over-year and 4 basis points sequentially. Recall that net interest income in the fourth quarter included a $7 million increase associated with the settlement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of certain structured leasing transaction. Absent that benefit last quarter, net interest income would have declined 3% sequentially, and the net interest margin would have declined just 1 basis point.","The sequential quarter decline in net interest income was primarily the result of a reduction in average demand deposits of about $1 billion and one less day in the quarter. So in total, revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were $975 million, up 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Now let's look at first quarter expenses on Page 5.","Total expenses were $724 million in the first quarter, up 11% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of the 2 acquisitions completed last summer; higher equipment and software expense; and the prior year's Visa benefit, which I mentioned earlier. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 31.9% compared with 24.1% last quarter. The low tax rate last quarter primarily reflects the favorable resolution of a number of outstanding items with both the IRS and state tax authorities, as well as benefits from adjustments to our intercompany service allocation methodology.","To assist in your analysis of expense management, Page 6 depicts sequential quarter expenses adjusted for restructuring and integration charges in both quarters, as well as Visa in the fourth quarter. We adjusted the first quarter for the $3.9 million in charges associated with restructuring and integration activities. We've adjusted the fourth quarter for the $61 million in charges, as well as the expense credit related to Visa of $13 million. On this adjusted basis, expenses were lower sequentially by approximately 1%. The 2% sequential increase in adjusted compensation expense is primarily attributable to higher share-based compensation. Recall that stock option expense is typically higher in the first quarter of each year, due to the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement-eligible employees. Staff levels on a full-time equivalent basis, however, were down 1% compared with year end. The 4% adjusted sequential quarter increase in employee benefit expense primarily reflects higher FICA insurance expense, which is normal season -- which is a normal seasonal pattern, as well as higher health care expense. Adjusted for charges, Outside Services expense declined 13% sequentially, reflecting reductions in sub-custodian, legal, technical services and consulting expenses. The increase in equipment and software expense primarily reflects a $4.6 million write-off of software that is no longer supported by a vendor. ","Other operating expenses were flat on an adjusted basis, despite the impact of costs associated with the February Northern Trust Open. While our early progress on managing expenses is positive, we have more work to do and remain focused on the goals outlined last quarter in our Driving Performance initiative.","Let's move to Page 7 for an update on Driving Performance, and our actions and successes to-date. On our last earnings call, we indicated our goal to improve pretax income by $250 million by the end of 2013. We're on track to meet this goal and to reaching at least half the $250 million by the end of 2012. In the first quarter, we achieved approximately $25 million in pretax income improvement, roughly half each in revenues and expenses, which equates to approximately $100 million on an annualized basis.","On the revenue side, we have already implemented a number of initiatives designed to align our offering and pricing with that of our clients. On January 1, we successfully instituted a new pricing structure in PFS that provides greater transparency to our clients. This initiative was launched at the beginning of the year and is delivering enhanced revenues in 2012. Outside of PFS, our other businesses are taking a coordinated set of actions to deepen relationships with clients, ultimately increasing our share of wallet. We are pursuing these initiatives in a very customized way, generally on a client-by-client basis, with selected revenue successes in the first quarter. ","On the expense side, process optimization will, over the long term, be the most significant contributor to our profit improvement plan. However, process optimization efforts are complex, involve a high degree of change management, and the planning and implementation has to be coordinated over multiple quarters in order to ensure the customer service levels are not negatively impacted. While we do intend to realize meaningful financial benefits in 2012 from these initiatives, the majority of this value will be delivered in 2013.","One process area where we've already begun to deliver savings in 2012 is the optimization of our office footprint in PFS. In this instance, we are aligning our brick-and-mortar infrastructure to support our Personal clients more efficiently.","Technology initiatives are underway and delivering value in 2012 in line with the long-term expectation. As we have noted in the past, we have an efficient technology platform due to our integrated operating model and history of organic growth. Actions driving improvement in 2012 include managing internal demand for IT services and hardware and migrating our IT resourcing mix to lower-cost sources without compromising service or risk. We will continue to pursue these efforts in 2013 and also begin to realize benefits from realizing overlapping IT applications.","Corporate-wide initiatives are delivering significant value in 2012, as many of these initiatives can be implemented quickly and the financial impact realized immediately. The simplification of our organization's structure is a major driver within this bucket. As of the first quarter 2012, our organization's simplification plan is on schedule. We have made meaningful progress in eliminating positions associated with the 2011 restructuring charges, and additional positions have been eliminated via attrition. Aligning our retirement benefits with market is another significant component here.","Finally, given the importance of continuing to execute on these initiatives, we have made an important organizational move to help ensure that Driving Performance and ongoing productivity improvement efforts are successful. We've created a small group to manage the overall Driving Performance program and build the capabilities we need to sustainably increase our productivity and efficiency. This group, called Enterprise Productivity, will focus on these efforts and facilitate strategic corporate-wide investments in technology and capability development. As announced on March 19, our Controller, Aileen Blake, will assume leadership of this group on May 1, and we have staffed it with some of our finest talent. We are confident that Enterprise Productivity will not only help us to deliver on the full $250 million target by the end of 2013 but will also drive meaningful ongoing productivity improvements beyond that.","Let me wrap up with a few comments on the strength of our balance sheet, which has differentiated Northern through the challenging economic cycle. On Page 8, we outline the 3 components of earning assets, all of which have been consistently managed with a conservative orientation. Our lending strategy represents $29 billion in earning assets and is focused on our clients, with the majority of loans to PFS clients. Conservative underwriting practices across a diversified portfolio have resulted in loan quality better than industry averages.","In the first quarter, nonperforming loans decreased $32 million sequentially to $262 million at quarter end. Improvements were evident across the board, including residential and commercial real estate and Commercial and Institutional. Non-performing assets were 0.98% of total loans and Other Real Estate Owned, down from 1.08% in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs were $6 million, down from $18 million last quarter. Our loan loss provision was $5 million in the first quarter, down from $15 million recorded in the first quarter of 2011 and $2.5 million recorded last quarter. As a result, the allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases was $295 million at quarter end, representing 1% of total loans and leases and 1.1x our non-performing loans.","Our Securities portfolio, which is about $32 billion at quarter end, continues to be managed in a high-quality fashion, with 85% of the portfolio invested in U.S. Treasury, Agency and AAA securities. The portfolio at quarter end had a maturity duration of a little over 2 years and repricing duration of about 11 months, slightly higher than the prior quarter. ","Interest-bearing deposits with banks at $19 billion, our third largest earning asset category, continued to be managed conservatively as well. Duration remains short, at less than 2 months on average. Eurozone exposures within this portfolio have been monitored and managed closely. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $3 billion in exposure to banks in the eurozone, primarily those located in the Netherlands and the Nordic region. We continued to place deposits with a select group of stronger banks at short tenures. ","Capital, outlined on Page 9, remained very strong, with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios at 12.4% and 11.9% respectively. As we estimate that our -- and we estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III framework, as we currently understand the regulations, would equal 12%, exceeding all anticipated requirements.","In mid-March, we announced a number of capital actions, including the 7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share and a new common stock repurchase authorization of up to an aggregate 10 million shares. We also announced that the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan, including the dividend increase and the repurchase of up to $240 million of common stock through March 2013.","Capital strength is a hallmark of Northern Trust and a key point of differentiation. We were one of only 2 large U.S. banks that did not cut its dividend during the financial crisis. The capital plan that we submitted to the Federal Reserve demonstrates our capital strength, focused business model and conservative risk profile.","Let me summarize by reiterating a few key points made during the call. Our first quarter financial performance demonstrates progress on executing our strategies. Northern Trust core businesses, asset servicing, asset management, wealth management and banking, are performing very well on a global basis. We are delivering client-focused, value-added solutions and growing relationships accordingly. Driving Performance is already having an impact by improving profitability and returns, while maintaining our differentiated client-service experience.","Our strategy, our brand and our financial strength continue to position us very well to serve our clients, grow the business and deliver value to our shareholders.","And one final comment, we recently announced that Vice Chairman Sherry Barrat has decided to retire at the end of June. Sherry has been with Northern Trust for 22 years, and her passion for our clients had been instrumental in positioning Northern Trust as a premier wealth management firm in the U.S. Sherry has had a deep impact on Northern Trust, and she will be missed.","Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we'll need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for all of us to get to our Annual Meeting, which is this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call. Jennifer, you can open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, Bev, using some of the figures you mentioned, it sounds like first quarter had approximately $12 million to $13 million of revenue enhancements related to the program. Is that -- well, and am I doing the math right too? Is that entirely related to the new PFS pricing schedule adjustment?","Michael G. O'grady","You're doing the math correctly, in that it was approximately half of the $25 million I mentioned. And I -- the majority of that has to do with the PFS initiative, but there are some other items in there also, Howard, just related to C&IS, where that process is going to take longer. And they're in the earlier days of that, but we did see some benefits in the first quarter.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And I know it's very, very early but just curious to what extent, on both sides of the house, are you seeing any sort of like client pushback. Or are you needing to make the difficult decisions to maybe sever or reduce relationships as you try to look to optimize returns in client profitability?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. Let me comment on both the Personal and the Institutional side. On the Personal side, I would say the evidence that this has gone well is that so far, our lost business in the quarter is at levels that's very consistent with previous quarters, which is a low level, certainly relative to the new business that we have. That's not because I -- that's because it was managed very carefully, and it did involve the relationship managers reaching out to all of our clients and explaining what we're doing on the fee front and the fact that the change in the structure of the fee is intended to give them greater transparency around the services that they're receiving, the products that they're using. So I would say that it's gone very well on that front. And with any situation, we do, even on the Personal side, take it client-by-client when there are concerns or issues. On the Institutional front, I would actually say that I -- beyond just going well in the early days, that it really has enriched the dialogue with a number of our clients because it's something where it's caused both us and the clients to sit down and talk about the status of the relationship and, frankly, how their needs have changed over a number of years where we've been servicing them, and different things that we can do for them. So again, early days on that, but there's a tremendous amount of preparation that has gone into these individual meetings that are happening, so that they are very comprehensive when they happen.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful color, Mike. And just one last one for me, now that the 2012 capital plan's complete and there is no objection by the Fed, can you just provide us a sense of how you've arrived at that plan and how you're thinking about -- how you thought about the balance between buyback, dividend and just maybe retention to either continue to grow the business or do strategic acquisitions?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So on the capital plan, as we all know, this is an evolving process with the banks and with the Federal Reserve. And certainly, our objective was to put together a capital plan that we felt that was providing capital return to our shareholders and was a capital plan also that would be not objected to by the Fed. And given that there's a lack of history there and knowing the nature of the process here -- it's either object or not object, it was very important to us that, that plan is approved. As far as the balance, as I mentioned in my comments there, Howard, as you know, Northern did not reduce its dividend through the last several years here. And as a result, our dividend payout ratio is one of the highest and is above the 30% guidance that is out there. And so from that standpoint, we did feel like it was appropriate on our end to raise that dividend, which we did, knowing that, that further pushed our dividend payout ratio relative to others and relative to the guidance. We also then wanted to further, I'll call it align our capital structure with our needs. And doing that with the share repurchase, it was an amount again that we felt, on top of the dividend, would not be objected to by the Fed and gives us some flexibility. And I would just say going forward, it's something certainly that we always think about capital management. And as the circumstances change going forward, we'll continue to analyze that and have the dialogue with the Fed.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Jeff Hopson with Stifel, Nicolaus.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You mentioned in terms of the new business, particularly on the Outside, good momentum. Any sense on the driver there in terms of, I guess, geography? And then are you taking share from, say, local competitors? Anything to kind of understand what's driving that for you guys relative to, say, the market at large.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So I think, Jeff, you're referring to the comments I made with regard to our Northern Trust Hedge Fund Services. And I would say the success there is -- it's a couple of things. One is with the Omnium acquisition. The platform that we acquired there, the technology, in our view, really is differentiated and it's certainly the strategic rationale behind that transaction. That's really been proved out in the marketplace and with these wins. So we think that we're providing a solution that is competitive certainly and frankly, something better than what they may be using, which leads to the second factor, which is in a number of these cases, the hedge fund manager is currently doing this on their own. And so it's really an outsource opportunity as well. And so they look at this as an opportunity to get not only the best technology but also to move certain activities outside the firm and to focus on their investing activities.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just overall in terms of new business activity, particularly, I guess, in Europe and other places. Obviously, there's a need to do more outsourcing because of the pressures. But any sense of kind of the pipeline and what clients -- are clients investigating, and do they seem action-oriented? Any change in kind of the new business pipeline, I guess?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, what I would say as far as the new business pipeline that the tone is good. There are a number of different opportunities that we're working on, and it's always difficult to truly quantify what the pipeline is. But the activity level, again, I would say very positive. And I would say, Jeff, that the mix is very diversified geographically. So it's both opportunities here in the United States, but then also in Europe as well as in Asia. And then I would also say, as far as the size of the opportunity, it really is a broad spectrum of large and small and medium-sized opportunities in there. So at this point, we feel good about the pipeline opportunity.","Operator","And we'll now go to a question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Mike and Bev, just a question to follow up on the productivity plan. Mike, I know you said that you're kind of on track to get the half of the $250 million this year. But I was just wondering if you can clarify again, like, your belief on -- do you see potential upside to the $250 million in terms of how -- where's your confidence level in terms of either getting to that $250 million? And also, I just want to make sure I didn't -- I heard right what you're saying, like is there a potential upside to that already in terms of how well things have gone in your first couple of months implementing?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I -- at this point, we're still focused on hitting our goals and hitting our targets. And I would say, Ken, that importantly, that some of the initiatives that we've kicked off here, you do see a immediate impact to them. So with the fee simplification, for example, that's a January 1 item. We essentially had the full quarter benefit from that. Likewise, with some of the changes on the organization, even if we didn't have a full quarter, we did have the better part of a quarter given the reductions that we had in headcount. So some of those right out of the gates, we'll get a benefit. So I wouldn't necessarily expect the same pace of improvement going forward. Having said that, it is a major focus that we execute on this, and at this point, feel very confident about achieving both our longer-term objective of the $250 million, as well as our near-term objective of over half of that in the first year.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just -- my second question just relates to -- just want to ask you about the foreign exchanges. I know you made it very clear that there's a volatility challenge in FX, and that continued to pressure FX revenues. But can you just comment on if there's anything changing underneath the surface in the business of FX, whether it's either clients transacting differently or moving away from using Northern or any other trust bank provider for transactions? Or is it really just led by what's happening in the market environment?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I would say it clearly is primarily driven by what's happening in the market. As I mentioned in the comments there, our client volumes were actually up a little bit in the quarter. Having said that, that is our traditional business with our core custody clients. And so that's going to be impacted by the volatility levels. I would also say that, like any market, there are always changes that are occurring. And it is something that we are taking a hard look at strategically to just determine are we approaching the business in the right way, given the way that it's evolving. So as much as there's no fundamental underlying secular change in the business in our view, we do view it as a service we provide to a current set of clients and look at ways that we can grow that.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And this last clarifying thing in the Other Services within C&IS, I'm sorry if I missed this in your prepared comments. It was up a good chunk, $3 million kind of -- to a little bit of a breakout level. I'm just wondering if you have any color on what was strong within Other Services.","Beverly J. Fleming","Ken, this is Bev. That was primarily a seasonal factor related to the benefit payment [ph] business.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's -- so it's seasonally strong in 1Q?","Beverly J. Fleming","In this year, it was. Yes.","Operator","And we'll now move to a question from John Stilmar with SunTrust.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Bev, Mike, real quickly, just with regards to the balance sheet. As I look at -- one, can you help identify sort of the re-risking that has occurred in sort of the evolution of deposit flows on your balance sheet; and kind of from your perspective, given your client mix, what inning we're in; and sort of where customers' deposits are sitting and how you're thinking about your balance sheet positioning?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So as you're alluding to, John, we have seen over a more extended period, say, the last 2 years, that clients both, again, Institutional and Personal have moved more assets on to our balance sheet in the form of deposits. And I think that, that is largely the result of just the broader environment, so in a position of low risk, if you will, and looking for maximum principal preservation. And so that's the underlying dynamic that we saw before this quarter, for 7 quarters in a row. I think what you're seeing now is that, with an improving equity market environment and at least until in the last several weeks here, investors feeling better about developments in Europe, that they're more comfortable in moving off the balance sheet and essentially putting some of that to work. Now having said that, you saw it had a modest impact on our balance sheet, where average assets were down 1% quarter-over-quarter. And going forward here, it's not perfectly clear to me that we're necessarily going to go into a period where the balance sheet continues to go down for quarters. It could go both ways, just as the risk environment changes. But I think you're seeing that dynamic. I would be surprised if we saw a return to the growth levels in the balance sheet that we had in the previous 2 years, though.","John W. Stilmar - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just to -- for a point of clarification. The $12 million to $13 million that -- from revenue opportunities that you saw in the quarter, those are actually in the reported results even with the kind of one-quarter lag effect on some of your different segments, correct?","Michael G. O'grady","Correct.","Operator","We'll now hear from Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just drilling down in PFS a little bit, a couple of questions within there. So obviously, on the pricing side, to what degree are clients adopting some of the -- I guess, the way to ask it would be adopting some of the different procedures that -- or I should say, the different types of services that you're charging more for? I guess, if I have it correct, you're charging more for the advice component that you're giving versus the actual asset management component. Is that the correct way of thinking about it?","Michael G. O'grady","I would think about it different. I wouldn't say that we're charging more for that component. What we're doing really is moving from a bundled fee, if you will. So a single fee for the client to a unbundled fee, one where there is an account management fee that is separate from product fees, so that all clients have the account management fee. But depending on the level of activity and the types of activities that the client has, they'll have different levels of product fees. And so that's the biggest difference. It isn't necessarily an increase in the fees on any of those components. And in fact, as I mentioned, on some of the product fees, we actually brought those fees down as a part of this initiative.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So you're charging basically more for the advice component of your overall services, which I think is better aligning it with the overall service that you're delivering. And so I guess my question was are clients feeling that it's more valuable? And do you think there'll be a better adoption rate of that going forward? So in other words, will we see greater contribution from that price increase in future periods, do you think?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. The way I would think about it, again, is that we didn't have a separate advisory or advice fee. So now this -- the account management fee is segregated. I wouldn't say that, that has changed the view of the advisory part of this. I would say if there's any change in view, it's that they have greater transparency and a greater recognition of the pricing of various types of products. So a actively management -- managed fund, an alternative product versus passive versus cash versus fixed income. And that transparency, I think, can have an effect on how they think about their account.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","All right, great. Okay. And then just on the asset mix, are you seeing more clients shift to equities? We did obviously see an increase in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Was that to some degree due to clients shifting into equities or is it mostly market-based?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. When you do the analysis, it's mostly market-based. The equity allocation is slightly higher, above the change in markets. So we saw some movement, but I would say it was not a significant shift in asset mix absent markets.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is it your sense that the clients will begin re-risking into equities over the course of the year? Or is it -- or is that really market-dependent? I guess, are you advising clients to shift more into equity?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I mean, again, we're continuing within NTGI to provide the asset allocation mix that's consistent with where we've been, but does include a large equity component.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just very lastly, on the impact of the transitioning from that Wealth Management client into C&IS, is that material at all? Is that really not evident in the results?","Beverly J. Fleming","Well, you would see it in both the fees for Wealth Management as well as the AUM for PFS overall. So it would have an impact on -- it's one of the reasons why our Wealth Management fees didn't show the growth that you might have expected and also why it's [indiscernible] AUM. So yes -- clearly, if it was moving from PFS to C&IS, it was a very meaningful account.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great, okay. And then just very last question. On the balance sheet investment strategy, it looks like some of the yields in the government side and the GSC -- the agency paper is bottoming out. Are you investing at yields now that are higher than those first quarter levels?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So basically, what we saw in the first quarter is that we were able to reinvest at a yield that was roughly equivalent -- within a couple of basis points of the yield of the securities that we're rolling off. So overall, it happened to be, as you saw, that the yield on the investment portfolio is the same quarter-over-quarter. And the activity underlying that, roll-offs versus add-ons, was also at the same. So don't know where rates are going to go, but at the same time, certainly there was stabilization in the quarter.","Operator","We'll take a question from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just maybe a follow-up to Brian's question. On the PFS AUM, it looks like it only went up 3% and Other AUM and AUC went up, like mostly 6% to 10%. So is all of that difference due to that one client moving over to Institutional or are there other factors as well that we should think about? Did you have -- aside from that, did you have inflows to PFS?","Beverly J. Fleming","We definitely had new business in PFS this quarter. Of course, the timing would be spread out across the quarter. But a significant portion of the AUM movement was affected by that large account that moved out of PFS and moved into C&IS.","Michael G. O'grady","And just recognizing in general that equities are only a portion of the total AUM numbers. And so the equities piece of it did go up, I would say, corresponding with the market absent what Bev just mentioned there. The other portions of assets under management there obviously did not see the same type of appreciation quarter-over-quarter. So I would say what we saw there was consistent with changes in the market for the different asset classes, positive inflows plus the adjustment Bev mentioned.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then, I guess, one more question on the fee schedule, if you can stand it, which is, does -- is the new fee schedule any more or less sensitive to the equity market? It doesn't sound like it would be. But for instance, if the equity market rises 10% now, would it have any more impact on PFS fees than it used to have?","Michael G. O'grady","Not necessarily, I guess. It -- having said that, Cynthia, I do think that I -- that the fee levels, meaning in dollars, can behave differently now that we've unbundled that fee. So as our clients move to different products, those products can have different fee levels on that, whereas we wouldn't have seen that same level of sensitivity to asset mix when we had a single bundled fee.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, okay. And lastly, if you don't mind, just maybe your outlook on money market fee waivers given where rates are now and where you see them for this quarter.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So you saw in the quarter that they were actually down relative to the fourth quarter, and that was a result on -- at least on the retail mutual fund side, money market mutual fund side, where we did bring down the pricing overall. So that was one component that resulted in the decline. But in addition to that, we saw, both on the retail side as well as the Institutional side, with just the slight lift in rate in -- on the very short end of the curve, that the yields on the actual mutual funds went up and therefore reduced the fee waivers. To the extent that we continue right at the rate levels we have right now, I would say we would stay consistent with what the fee levels are -- fee waiver levels. But obviously, to the extent that, even on the short end, they go up by 1 or 2 basis points, we do see that benefit in reduced fee waivers.","Operator","We'll hear from David Long with Raymond James.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","In the PFS business, with the branch rationalization that's going on, are there any specific closures or sales that you can point to in the quarter?","Michael G. O'grady","No. We took a few actions at the end of last year where we're basically recognizing the benefit of that this year. And again, I think what's important there is that I -- what we did is in certain areas, such as north of Chicago here in the northern suburbs, we had 2 branches, for example, in a particular neighborhood. And what we were able to do is consolidate into one branch, which we could then invest more in, both from the standpoint of the physical presence but also in the expertise that we would put in to that presence. So far, that has gone well. And so we've done the same thing in certain other parts of the country. So we did some of it at the end of last year. We will also continue to look at opportunities this year to do the same thing in other markets.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then with the Driving Performance and the change in the PFS fee structure, were there any changes to the internal guidance that you can talk about -- or the internal guidelines that you use to distinguish -- you used to have groups where it'd be $1 million to $10 million are in this group and $10 million in higher in that group. Has anything changed with those guidelines?","Michael G. O'grady","Not as a result of the change in fee structure. I would say that we continually look at how we serve clients and the different level of service need -- as you mentioned, the segmentation that we've had, to make sure that we do have the right segmentation so that we can be providing the right services with the right level of efficiency for the needs of that particular client base. So not related to the fees, but in general, continually look at that. And frankly, look to move clients to the segment where they can get the best and most appropriate service, which is -- you heard in some of my commentary there, we did move some clients from one part of PFS to another in order to get that.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And then lastly on the global initiative that you have talked about and made some changes in the management there, can you talk about any progress there? And then also where and how you're targeting the prospects outside of the U.S.?","Michael G. O'grady","Are you saying changes with regard to the Enterprise Productivity that I mentioned, or something different?","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","This is related to the Global Family & Private Investment Offices group.","Michael G. O'grady","Okay.","Beverly J. Fleming","I'll take that, Dave. One thing that -- the answer is a follow-on to your previous question. With respect to private client, wealth advisory and wealth management, the segmentation in how we serve those clients has not meaningfully changed. But in the second quarter, you will see a change in our regional description. So when we issue our earnings next quarter, for example, we have consolidated our Northeast and our Southeast into the East region. We've renamed the Midwest Central, and we have the West region. So we will, next quarter, have 3 regional breakdowns for PFS. And we have renamed, effective April 1, what used to be the Wealth Management Group, into more of a family office group. So that has more to do with kind of naming and structure than it does with service model.","Operator","We'll now move to a question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Quick follow-up on the capital. So it feels like you guys went through the process -- and I understand that obviously the first point that you guys wanted to make sure happens is that the regulators have no opposition to whatever it is you propose. But if you look at some of the other banks that are as strong or -- as you guys are, even some that are a little bit weaker, total paid outs were higher. Some of them were near 100%. You guys are still closer to like the 60%, 65%. Do you see yourself over time returning more capital that -- now that it seems the regulators are, I guess, a little bit more open to higher payouts for the industry?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I think the most important thing on capital, Alex, is that, that changes over time depending on what our capital needs are. So to the extent that we're able to continue to grow the business and have opportunities -- and I don't just mean balance sheet growth, but areas where we can deploy capital because we believe we can get attractive risk-adjusted returns, we would look to deploy capital there first. Second, to the extent that we see opportunities to acquire other businesses that would be strategic for us, as we did in 2011, and achieve attractive returns as well, we look to deploy capital that way. And then as far as the dividend, as I mentioned, right now, we're at a level -- not only is it above the level for other banks, but is above our long-term level. Our expectation certainly is to grow into a dividend payout ratio that's consistent with where we've been historically. And then that leaves you with where is our capital position relative to where we think we need to be and where the regulators think we need to be. And that's where, with the share repurchases, the approval that we have -- or the non-objection, if you will, gives us the flexibility then to get the capital structure into the right place after you've gone through that waterfall that I just talked about. Certainly having more flexibility on that front is better for us from a management standpoint. So we wouldn't sit here today and necessarily tell you, yes, we're looking to change our payout ratio per se, because if we have better uses for it, then we'd rather deploy in that way and get better returns on it. But to the extent that we are in a position that we feel as though we do have excess capital, we'd like to have the flexibility to have the board make that decision and be able to return that capital through dividends and share repurchase.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you, understood. And then I've just a couple of questions on expenses, on the one-offs, and I apologize if you guys already mentioned it. But could you quantify the kind of the seasonal pickup in comp due to options? And also, what's the one-off this quarter also for the Northern Open?","Beverly J. Fleming","We have not quantified what the total cost of the Northern Trust Open is, but I can tell you that for the stock option expense in the quarter, the amount that was associated with the immediate expensing to retirement-eligible employees was $5.3 million.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. So that $5.3 million arguably goes away in the second quarter?","Beverly J. Fleming","Correct. We would get back to a normal quarterly run rate. The first quarter is typically higher because of the fact that we immediately expensed options that are issued to retirement-eligible employees.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Mike, just one last one for me, and this is a follow-up to Cynthia's question. The money market fee areas, it looks like -- if I look at the Treasury fund at least, the real pickup in yield happened in kind of like late Feb, March and sort of continued here into April -- and this is, again, really, really short end of the curve. So to an extent where this dynamic rolls through your money market funds, shouldn't we think about that kind of $25 million net fee waiver number this quarter getting better in the second quarter, kind of holding everything else equal, just as securities mature and you add the ones that have --with a little bit of high yield on?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. You're correct in the trend that we saw during the quarter there, which is -- started off with yields on the funds being lower. So the fee waiver amount did go down kind of to the latter part of the quarter. And so we're entering into the quarter at a better level than we'd started the first quarter. And if it maintains that level, Alex, then, yes, we would see that benefit -- not knowing, again, where rates will be the rest of the quarter.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","First, the easy question. You had $720 million of run rate expenses. You're looking for a $250 million reduction over 2 years, half this year. So where should expenses exit this year? Would that be $690 million per quarter, or does it not all hit the bottom line?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. It's -- the reason why we quantify the initiative the way that we have, Mike, is because the expense level that we have over time is not static and definitely relates to the business and the growth of our business. So I -- we will capture the amounts that we talked about there, $250 million by the end of '13 and over half of that this year. But underlying that, our expense level could change depending on how fast we grow the business.","Beverly J. Fleming","And I'd also want to remind you that the $250 million is a pretax number, which includes the revenue side of the equation as well. It's not just expenses.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And this quarter, you had $5 million of option expenses, $4 million for a software write-down. So would that be $9 million of expenses that should not occur in the second quarter?","Michael G. O'grady","We would expect that those 2 items would not occur in the second quarter, yes.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now the tougher question, which is not a new one. So the good news is the markets, stock markets were up 10%. Your assets under custody were up 8%. The bad news is your custody fees were up only 2% and Institutional asset management revenues were up only 1%. It seems like a huge disconnect. I know there's a lag and everything else, but still, it just doesn't seem close. And I hear what you're saying about going from bundled fees to unbundled fees. But -- and you're not alone. I mean, your competitors, the assets under custody markets are up big and the core custody fees aren't up much. So are you guys just beating each other up? Is it like one big Hunger Games among the processing banks?","Michael G. O'grady","Your analysis is correct and certainly something that we look at as well, Mike. And what I would say is that first of all, there still is definitely a correlation between assets under custody, assets under management and our fee levels. Having said that, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, it's not always going to be a one-for-one correlation, even after you adjust for things like the asset mix that underlies that. What are the other factors that come into play? Part of it is the timing on those flows. So we're giving you a reported asset level as of the end of the quarter. For some of those fees, they may be calculated based on end of the quarter, or the client may have come in earlier in the quarter, okay? So it doesn't fully capture the fee activity in the quarter. The other part is, as I mentioned, we did have one large client that was consolidated, meaning that it was acquired and their assets were consolidated with another custodian. It depends on the timing in which that client goes out in the quarter. So there are some timing issues that underlie that. And then also, that -- with clients, the asset mix that they have or product mix also has a different fee mix to it. So on that front, we can have large new client wins, but they may be in our passive area, which is going to be a lower level than, say, something that's in our Personal business or even a smaller client within the Institutional business. So what I would say is that the longer-term trend is still intact. Having said that, from quarter-to-quarter, it's not always going to be a direct correlation.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Should we expect higher custody fees in the second quarter, assuming markets hold the current level, giving the -- given the lag effect?","Michael G. O'grady","The lag effect, definitely, yes, will be a positive factor. Just given, as you point out, a lot of these fees are on a quarter-lag basis. The other thing I would say is that fees in there are not all asset-based, so there are some that are activity-based as well. And so for certain portions, just in the quarter, we saw either a flat or slightly lower level of activity -- transaction activity. That also comes into play.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then just the Institutional asset management area, it's down 8% year-over-year. It's hardly up this quarter. It seems like something else is going there -- going on there, that's not good. I don't know what it is, though.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes -- no, I would say similar what I'll call dynamics to what I just described for the broader fee levels. But you're right, there is not the direct correlation to the AUM levels.","Operator","And we'll now hear from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to circle back once again, I guess, on the Driving Performance discussion. Can you just give us a sense of how much flexibility is there, or how conservative were you in coming up with the number? And what I'm getting at is if indeed revenues are tougher than folks expect or you guys expect, is there more room to -- more levers to pull? And conversely, obviously, that maybe we wouldn't see as much drop to the bottom line as you had implied earlier, which begs the question: do you think you can actually get positive operating leverage this year in this environment?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So as far as more levers, the area I would point to, Andrew, if you think about one of the slides -- or that second category about process optimization, that's an initiative where we looked at all the major processes within the bank in order to determine if there are opportunities to improve the -- both, I'll call it the effectiveness and the efficiency. So we would want to do it if we felt that it has a better client outcome; we can do it more efficiently; we can increase our profitability, if you will, on that as well. And with that, the initiative that we have -- that we're pursuing right now are in the equivalent of a first wave, if you will, and then we'll move on to a second wave. So the additional levers are the exact reason why we set up this Enterprise Productivity group because we expect to continue to pursue these. We're going after what we consider the greatest opportunities first. But as we go forward, we'll look to do more of those. And that's probably, of those categories, the area where there's the greatest opportunity.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And on getting a positive operating leverage in this still-tough environment, is that achievable? Is that achievable this year? Do you think it's achievable this year?","Michael G. O'grady","Well, we had positive operating level on a sequential basis. And I think -- and again, everybody will do their adjustments in their own way. But I think even if you look year-over-year, if you take out the acquisitions -- because the acquisitions, while a positive contributor to profitability this quarter, are still in the early stages or middle stages, I'll call it, of being integrated. So I think you take those factors out, you basically have slight operating -- positive operating leverage even on a year-over-year basis. So there's no question that we are looking to continue to improve our margins going forward, and that entails getting positive operating leverage.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. In terms of the margin, how should we think about the margin going forward if kind of the re-risking comes back? How much of the deposit inflows that you've received in the last several quarters really is kind of a flight to safety, flight to quality that may reverse at some point? How do you think about that, in the context of kind of a normalized margin and balance sheet?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I think that, well, we definitely saw the benefit of flight to quality because we know that those deposits likewise can get redeployed on short notice as well. That causes us to reinvest those at the shorter end of our maturity spectrum. So even within the securities portfolio, or other parts of our balance sheet outside of that, in overnight funds, just to make sure that we have adequate liquidity. And at those levels, yes, those are going to be lower margin. Right now, the overnight rate closer to 25 basis points, which is obviously below the 1% that we get on our securities portfolio. So as those roll off, we'll see the first funds, if you will, being rolled off at the lowest part of the margin. Now what I can't comment to is not only the rest of the securities portfolio and just where rates are, but also just our loan portfolio, which is 1\/3 of our earning assets, and also the deposit book as well. So I can't tell you that it definitively would cause our net interest margin to go up. But the aspect that you're talking about is a positive contributor to it.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","The margin. And how much would you think about that access deposit? Is it $10 billion, $15 billion?","Michael G. O'grady","No. One, I can't quantify what it is because a lot of this is it -- this is decisions being made by institutional and personal clients, so hard to know how they think about it. But I wouldn't expect it to be the magnitude you mentioned there.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question, just on -- to get back on credit. It seems like you had unusually strong recoveries this quarter, which led up to the provision being materially lower this quarter versus last. Is that a fair characterization that, that might not repeat going forward, in terms of the recovery levels?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, that's correct. So I would say that charge-offs -- so gross charge-offs were down, but you're correct that our net charge-offs were down even more because of the recoveries and no, would not necessarily expect to have that level of recoveries in future periods.","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions today. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Bev Fleming for any additional or closing remarks.","Beverly J. Fleming","Thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter earnings conference call in the middle of July. Thank you very much. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Ms. Bev Fleming, for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Beverly J. Fleming","Thank you, Allan. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to Northern Trust Corporation's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'Grady, Northern Trust's Chief Financial Officer; Rick Kukla, our Controller; and Allison Quaintance from our Investor Relations team.","For those of you who did not receive our first quarter earnings press release or financial trends report via e-mail this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com.","In addition, and also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call.

Let me turn the call over to Mike O'Grady.","Michael G. O'grady","Thanks, Bev. Before I start, I wanted to say that our thoughts go out to all of those impacted by the situation yesterday in Boston. As usual, we've organized today's into 3 sections. I'll review our first quarter results, update you on our Driving Performance initiative and comment on our capital. Bev and I would then be pleased to answer your questions.","Starting with some overview comments on Slide 2. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings per share of $0.67 and a return on equity of 8.8%. In the first quarter, we were successful in growing the business, adding both Personal and Institutional clients and improving our productivity. New business from Personal clients was very strong, reflecting our position as a trusted advisor to our clients and the impact of improving confidence on client and prospect decision-making.","With institutional clients, we're seeing a good pace of activity across global regions, products and client segments. The macro environment was mixed, with both positive and negative implications for our business. Equity markets in the U.S. and Europe were higher, which supplemented our strong new business results. The S&P 500 was up 11% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, and the EAFE Index was up 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Our client asset levels increased, as over 45% of our assets under custody and assets under management are equities.","Assets under custody ended the quarter at $5 trillion, up 9%, and assets under management ended at $810 billion, up 13% over last year. On a sequential basis, client asset levels were also up 5% and 7%, respectively.","Currency volatility increased in the first quarter for the first time in over a year, positively impacting our foreign exchange trading income. Interest rates, however, declined further. Low short-term rates continue to pressure our net interest margin and also result in ongoing fee waivers in connection with our money market mutual funds.","We continued to successfully execute on the Driving Performance initiatives announced in early 2012, which are focused on fundamentally improving our productivity and profitability while enhancing our capacity for investment in future growth regardless of the macro environment.","Overall, although we made further progress in the quarter, we are still not satisfied with our returns and continue to focus on executing our strategies in 2013.","Let's move to Page 3 and discuss the financial highlights of the first quarter.","Earnings per share of $0.67 increased 2% year-over-year and were down 3% sequentially. The current quarter included a $12.4 million write-off of certain fee receivables resulting from the correction of an accrual methodology used in prior years. This prior period adjustment is recorded within other operating income. We also recorded restructuring and integration charges of $1.8 million in the first quarter, primarily in occupancy expense, compared with $3.9 million a year ago and $8.2 million last quarter. Excluding these items, earnings per share was would have been $0.71 in the first quarter, representing an increase of 6% year-over-year and flat sequentially.","On a year-over-year basis, revenues and expenses were both up 1%. Trust investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of revenues, increased a strong 10% due to new business and higher markets, but this growth was offset in the year-over-year comparison by lower net interest income and the impact of the receivables adjustment on other operating income.","Expenses were up only modestly due to the impact of Driving Performance and good expense control across categories. Year-over-year, our loan loss provision was unchanged at $5 million. As a result, net income was 2% higher than last year's first quarter.  Compared to last quarter, revenues were up 1% and expenses were down 2%. Higher trust investment and other servicing fees and foreign exchange trading income offset lower net interest income and the impact of the receivables write-off on other operating income. The lower level of expenses on a sequential basis primarily reflects the decline from a higher level of outside services and other expenses during a very active fourth quarter.","All in, although pretax earnings increased 9%, net income was 2% lower due to a lower effective tax rate last quarter. Our return on equity of 8.8% for the first quarter was below our long-term target range of 10% to 15%. With that background and summary, let me get into more details behind our first quarter results beginning on Slide 4.","First quarter revenues, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, were $984 million, up 1% both year-over-year and sequentially. Trust investment and other servicing fees were $631 million in the quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. As mentioned, new business and higher equity markets drove the increases. Foreign exchange trading income was $60 million in the first quarter, down 4% compared with last year but up 46% compared with last quarter. A primary driver of foreign exchange trading income is currency volatility. As measured by an index of major currencies, volatility was lower by about 12% year-over-year and higher by approximately 20% -- 21% sequentially.","Other operating income of $25 million for the quarter was down 36% year-over-year and 30% sequentially, primarily reflecting the receivables write-off that I mentioned earlier. Absent this prior period adjustment, other operating income was down 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower commercial lending fees, and up 4% sequentially.","Net interest income was $234 million in the first quarter, down 12% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, primarily due to a lower net interest margin, which I'll discuss in more detail later, as well as lower levels of earning assets.","Moving to Page 5, lets look at the components of our fee revenues. For our institutional business, C&IS, fees totaled $349 million in the first quarter, up 10% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $224 million in the first quarter, up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher equity markets, new business and favorable results from our Driving Performance revenue initiatives.","In the sequential quarter comparison, higher fourth quarter international markets and new business were offset by lower sub-custodian recoveries and the currency translation impact of the stronger dollar.","Investment management fees for C&IS were $75 million in the first quarter, up 22% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Both comparisons benefited from new business, primarily in our institutional Index and Mutual Fund businesses, and higher markets. The sequential quarter increase was partially offset by higher waive fees associated with the institutional money market mutual funds. Waivers impacting C&IS fees equaled $9 million in the first quarter, $2 million lower year-over-year but $3 million higher sequentially. The sequential quarter increase in fee waivers primarily reflects lower gross yields achieved in the underlying funds as repo and short-term rates were lower in the first quarter.","Securities lending fees were $22 million in the first quarter, up 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects higher volume and spreads. The sequential quarter increase reflects higher volume. Securities lending collateral of $101 billion increased 5% versus last year and 15% sequentially. C&IS assets under custody were $4.6 trillion at quarter end, up 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, while C&IS assets under management were $604 billion at quarter end, up 12% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.","Moving to our personal business, PFS trust investment and other servicing fees were $282 million in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year and 1% on a sequential quarter basis. The year-over-year increase reflects strong new business, higher month lag equity markets and lower fee waivers. The sequential quarter increase primarily reflects the impact of higher markets and new business, partially offset by higher fee waivers. Money market fund fee waivers in PFS were $13.4 million in the first quarter, down $1.4 million year-over-year but up $3-point million (sic) [$3.8 million] from the fourth quarter, reflecting lower gross yields achieved in the underlying funds.","PFS assets under management were $206 billion at quarter end, up 15% year-over-year and 4% sequentially, in both cases, reflecting higher equity markets and new business. PFS assets under custody were $455 billion at quarter end, up 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. In the first quarter, PFS assets under custody were reduced by approximately $13 billion as we re-categorized certain assets that appear on client statements for their convenience but on which we have no advisory or custodial oversight.","Moving to Page 6, net interest income was $234 million in the first quarter, down 12% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Earning assets averaged $82 billion in the quarter, down 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The level of earning assets reflects our liability-driven balance sheet. Demand deposits averaged $17 billion in the quarter, down 13% year-over-year and $4 billion or 21% sequentially, reflecting the expiration of the transaction account guarantee or TAG program.","Interest-bearing funds averaged $64 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially, replacing most of the decline in demand deposits. The net interest margin was 1.15% in the first quarter, down 9 basis points year-over-year and 2 basis points sequentially. The lower margin primarily reflects lower yields across earning asset categories as interest rates continued to decline. For example, the average for 3-month LIBOR declined another 3 basis points in the quarter after declining 11 basis points in the fourth quarter and was 22 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2012.","By earning asset category, the yield on interest-bearing deposits with banks declined 3 basis points sequentially due to lower short-term rates, with the biggest impact being a decline in overnight rates in the Australian dollar of 19 basis points. The yield on the securities portfolio also declined 3 basis points, primarily reflecting maturing securities being reinvested at lower rates, and the overall yield on the loan portfolio declined by 5 basis points, as some of our loans are linked to LIBOR and new loans and leases are coming on our balance sheet at lower yields than those rolling off. These declines in earning asset yields were partially offset by a slightly lower cost to fund.","Now let's look at expenses on Page 7. Expenses were $729 million in the first quarter, up 1% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, and as shown in the slide, we recorded restructuring and integration charges in each of the periods.","Let's take a look at the trends in the expenses by category. Compensation expense was essentially flat year-over-year and increased 1% sequentially, primarily due to higher share-based compensation. Recall that stock option expense is typically higher in the first quarter of each year due to the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement-eligible employees.","Employee benefit expense decreased 7% year-over-year and 1% sequentially as the lower level of health care expense offset seasonally higher FICA insurance expense. Outside Services expenses increased 1% year-over-year but decreased 8% sequentially due to lower consulting and sub-custodian expenses. Recall that Outside Services expense was elevated in the fourth quarter due to higher costs for contracted services related to increase new business activity and seasonally higher sub-custodian expenses, which were reflected in revenues as well.","Equipment & Software expenses were higher by 1% year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting depreciation and amortization of technology investments. Occupancy expense was up 3% year-over-year due to the restructuring charge but was down 7% sequentially, primarily reflecting a lower level of charges associated with reductions in office space in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.","Other operating expense increased 10% year-over-year due to a higher level of charges associated with account servicing activities. Other operating expense decreased 4% sequentially. Recall that the fourth quarter had $3 million in restructuring and integration expense in this line. Absent those charges, other operating expense was essentially unchanged sequentially, as seasonally higher cost associated with the Northern Trust Open were offset by lower staff-related expenses.","Expense control was particularly good in the first quarter. As we discussed in our fourth quarter call, while our expense base fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter for various reasons, it generally track with the longer-term trend in our fee revenues. Given the continued success we've had in adding new clients, our objective is to grow our expenses at a lower rate than the growth rate of our fee revenues. We were successful in achieving this in 2012 and in the first quarter. However, we do expect expense fluctuations to continue for various reasons.","Let's move to Page 10 to discuss Driving Performance a little more. In January of 2012, we indicated our goal to improve pretax operating income by $250 million by the end of 2013. In the first quarter, we produced over $55 million in pretax operating income improvements from Driving Performance initiatives. Positive impacts from revenue initiatives were similar to last quarter, primarily the result of successful pricing and cross-sell efforts in C&IS.","On expenses, in the first quarter, increased benefits were primarily the result of continued success in our process optimization efforts, especially in procurement, and our office network optimization in our PFS segment.","Going forward in 2013, we expect that process optimization and revenue efforts will drive increasing benefits from quarter-to-quarter. Based on the results achieved to date, we remain on track for our 2013 target for Driving Performance. We believe that we will continue to successfully implement the initiatives already identified to enhance our revenue and improve our productivity and that we will continue to identify incremental initiatives to drive future performance.","Capital, outlined on Page 9, remained very strong with Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios of 12.8% and 13.3%, respectively. We estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III advanced framework as we currently understand the regulations, including the impact of the proposed rules issued by the Federal Reserve, would be approximately 13%, exceeding all anticipated requirements. As we announced in March, our 2013 capital plan received no objections from the Federal Reserve. In it, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common dividend to $0.31 per share. At its regular meeting later today, our Board of Directors will consider formal approval of the planned dividend increase, which is expected to be payable July 1.","In the first quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of $74 million. In addition, our capital plan provides for the repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock between April 2013 and March 2014.","I'd like to provide a few thoughts to close. The first quarter demonstrated the continued execution of our strategy of providing exceptional service, expertise and advice to our clients around the world. We also achieved our objectives of growing the business and improving productivity. Progress was evident across our businesses. Wealth management, asset management and asset servicing fees are all growing nicely while banking battles through challenging operating conditions.","Driving Performance is ingrained. The productivity improvements from last year have carried into 2013, providing us with the capacity to fund our growth in trust fees with lower growth and expenses. And we are deploying our capital effectively in our businesses and have received approval from our regulator to return more capital to our shareholders in the coming year. All this will increase the return on our capital and move us closer towards achieving our long-term financial target.","Before I conclude, as is customary for our first quarter earnings call, we will need to end today's call to allow sufficient time for us all to get to our Annual Meeting, which is this morning. Please accept our apologies in the event that we have to close off the question-and-answer period earlier than our normal practice.","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call. Allan, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Howard Chen with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, as you look across your C&IS and PFS client base, how would you broadly characterize the level of re-risking and re-engagement that you saw in these set of results and then subsequently since then?","Michael G. O'grady","Howard, I would say, particularly focused on the personal side, that we did begin to see activity of  re-risking that we've been talking about in previous quarters, in previous calls. I think it's a result of a number of things. But one is certainly that looking at cash and high-quality fixed income is really an insurance policy, but it's becoming a more and more expensive insurance policy, and that for investors to really achieve any type of real return, they understand that they have to take on greater risk. So we did see, I would say, the beginnings of that. I think that's supported by, if you look at some of the asset flows that we had in the quarter and for example, within PFS, the equities category for us was up 13%. So up, up stronger. And if you looked at the flows behind that, you would see that equities, we had positive inflows, and on the money market side, we had outflows. So I think that we're beginning to see it, although I would say it's still in the stage where it's somewhat fragile, in our view. And while we've had a nice run, when you have days like yesterday, it certainly can have an impact on the psyche of the investor.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And my follow-up, now that the CapiR  [ph] process is in the rearview mirror for this year, I was hoping you could just talk about how you arrived at the capital plan of the dividend boost and the $400 million buyback that your regulator had no objection to.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. Well, as we've said before, we're very comfortable with our capital adequacy, and our objective, of course, is always to have sufficient capital and to have the appropriate and robust processes in place so that we can weather through whatever conditions may be in front of us. So with that in mind, as you see from the results of the capital plan, our objective was to increase the amount of capital that we return to shareholders. So doing that both through increasing our dividend somewhat and then also significantly increasing the amount that we could do through share repurchase. So I would say, overall, try to balance all those objectives to get to that position. And I would also just say, Howard, with regard to capital, as I've said before, it's a situation that continues to evolve. The final rules for Basel III are expected to be coming out in the near future here. That's something that certainly we'll have to digest, and you have other aspects of regulation that are still in flux. And so we take all that into account as we look to continue to improve our processes around capital.","Operator","And next we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you give us more color on the deposit outflow? You mentioned it was due to the expiration of the TAG program. Was that large corporations or countries? Who were the customers that took the deposits out?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So our demand deposits were down $4.4 billion on average for the period, and most of that was in our C&IS business. So about 3.5 of the total was from institutional clients, and it's a mix of clients, but it is definitely clients that had placed the deposits with us as a result of the TAG program. And so with that expiring, they looked to move those to other alternatives. What we saw on the Institutional side there is that a decent portion of about $1.5 billion really just flowed into our money market funds. So they decided to switch from having deposit to putting it in, for example, one of our government funds. And then the remainder for the institutional clients really split between either just purchasing government securities outright or, in some cases, just diversifying amongst other larger banks. So we still have what I would consider significant deposits from them, but they've reduced the amount and placed deposits at other banks. On the Personal side, we saw about a $1 billion decline in the demand deposits during the month -- or excuse me, during the quarter, and I would say, that's mostly just a shift into either interest-bearing deposits, and you saw that in the change in the average balances. And then also, as we've talked about, I think some of that also is reflected in the re-risking.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. The second question was your return on equity targets of 10% to 15%. In this low interest rate environment -- and obviously, you're working very hard to manage your operating expenses, which showed up again in this quarter, is it -- and your ROE came in less than 10% in the quarter, and the last 2 years, it's been less than 10% as well. Is it possible to get to a 10% -- to 11% ROE if this rate environment remains this way through '15, as the Fed has pointed out that's what they plan?","Michael G. O'grady","So as we've said, the 10% to 15% is definitely a long-term financial target. And so it's intended to be across different macro operating -- macro environments. It is clearly difficult to do in this low interest rate environment, as is being demonstrated through our results and, I would say, results overall. What we're focused on is, as we've talked about, trying to grow the parts of the business that we can. You've seen that in the stronger growth in our trust fees, which is the largest component. So we look to grow that, we look to control the expenses. That improves profitability in and of itself to get there. Net interest income was a drag in this period, and I think we have also foreign exchange trading income, which has also been a drag in other time periods. So if both of those remain constant, do I think we could get there? We could, but it's going to be difficult, and it's going to take longer to get there without some improvement in the macro environment. So again, I would just emphasize, it's a longer-term target. We still think it's the right target to have, and even in this environment, were working towards it. It's just a significant challenge if the operating conditions, particularly low interest rates, continue to persist.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then lastly, on the buyback, with the $400 million being approved last year, you pretty much completed what you expected in terms of your approval from CCAR last year. You completed that buyback. Should we count on all $400 million being done over the next 4 quarters, or what event could happen where you choose not to execute on the buyback completely?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. Well, with the capital plan, what we're looking to do is to provide an outlook for our regulators as to what our expectations would be and what we would like to be able to execute. But to your point, it doesn't necessarily mean that we need to execute on those or have to. There are a number of things that could happen that would change that. Some of them very opportunistic. If there are other opportunities for us to deploy our capital, that certainly is something that we would take into account on whether we end up executing the full authority, I will say. And then also, the operating conditions. I mean, when we put the plan in, it's with our best view on what those operating conditions are. All else equal, then yes, we'd look to move forward with executing on those. But the operating conditions, obviously, can change. And we also -- we do look at the relative alternatives that we have and how we can deploy the capital. And my point being, we do look at the value of the stock and when we think it's the best alternative to repurchase and the best time to do that relative to other things that are going on. So our plan is to move forward with that, as you mentioned, just as we did last year. But certainly, things can come up along the way that could change that.","Operator","Next we'll go to Jacob Troutman with KBW.","Jacob Troutman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","My first question just goes back to Howard's question on the PFS and the client re-risking. Overall, it sounds like new client activity was very strong, but PFS revenues were only up about 1% linked quarter. I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little color on how much of those revenues are asset based versus how much are client activity based?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So in the Personal business, most of those fees are asset based, and we did have the drag of the money market fund fee waivers in the period, which caused the fees to be reduced relative to the prior period. The other thing is, within PFS, it depends not only on the asset mix, so we've talked about how that's shifting around, but the actual products and the pricing on the various products. And within our multi-manager products, we also reduced the fees on a few of those products, which had some impact in the period-over-period comparison.","Jacob Troutman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one quick follow-up along that vein. From the increased client activity there, do you expect to maybe see any increased demand for loans going forward?","Michael G. O'grady","Well, it's certainly something that we are offering to our clients and trying to be supportive of what their borrowing needs would be. So I would say it's in the forefront of the client service offering that we have. At the same time, it has to be driven by their demand. And that's really been the situation, I would say, both on the personal and, certainly, on the commercial or institutional front as well, which is demand has just not been significant enough and\/or sufficient enough, really, to offset the natural roll off of the portfolio. So it's not as though we're not -- first of all, not -- very interested in lending to our clients, and it's not as though we're not originating new loans. It's just that the level of roll-off has been close to or, in some times, exceeding the new origination.","Operator","And next we'll go to Cynthia Meyer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just another question on the PFS. I guess the AUM is up pretty strongly versus 4Q, and you guys mentioned new clients. Is it possible to sort of parse out how much of the growth is due to new clients versus money from existing clients? And just in terms of asset growth or account growth, how do the trends compare to last year? And is there a seasonal aspect to that, people switching advisors in 1Q, and where do you think you're taking share from if you're taking share?","Michael G. O'grady","Okay. Cynthia, you were very clever to embed multiple questions in there, so we'll try to address them. But first of all, I would say as far as the seasonality aspect, I'm not sure that it's going to repeat every year per se. But there is no doubt that the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter of last year continued into the first quarter. So it -- as a result of, I think, the fiscal situation, anticipated changes in taxes, that just began a process with clients to look at their situation and potentially make changes. And we saw a strong end to the fourth quarter last year, and then also, we've seen that carry into this year. So that would be one. Two is, I would say, that we continue to be successful as we move up-market. So the size of the accounts or the relationships that we're adding on average have been larger as we move forward. We have a nice breadth of business. But I would say, as far as particular momentum, we've seen it more on the upper end there. And as far as just the balance between new business and equity markets, it's really been relatively balanced between the 2. And so on that front, it would be great to have the markets continue to support that, but where we're mostly focused is the area that we can have a greater influence on, and that is adding new clients.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Well, I don't know if I'm allowed to ask a second question, but...","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, sure.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, if rates and balance sheet levels didn't change from here, what would be the implications for net interest income in 2Q and the balance of the year?","Michael G. O'grady","Great. So obviously, difficult to predict where rates are going to go. And so if you do take it the way you asked the question of no change in rates, the way I look at it is by our earning asset categories. So on the loan front, we do continue to originate loans as loans roll off, and the trend has been that they're coming on at lower rates than what's rolling off. And you've seen that with a slow decline in the yield on the loan portfolio, which is now still over 2.5%. So it's the highest-yielding portion of the portfolio. But all the same, we've seen decline there. The securities portfolio, there, likewise, as securities roll off, the reinvestment rates are lower. Now we've moved our duration out as we've gone over time and did so again in the quarter here. So it moved from basically an index ratio of a year to about 1 year and 1 month. So just slightly moving it out, because there's obviously trade-offs in doing that, that's enabled us to at least slow the decline in the yield on the securities portfolio. And then deposits with banks, it's very much dependent on the shortest end of the curve, if you will, the overnight rates, and it depends on the currency. And so as long as it's U.S. dollar, the overnight rates have been relatively stable, and I think it's largely because the Fed has 25 basis points. But if you look over in Europe, we have seen a steady decline in overnight rates for the euro, but now they're at 3, 4 basis points. So it's -- we'd like to think less room to decline. In sterling, the short-term rates are closer to 50 basis points, and the Bank of England has not been as aggressive in their easing. If they were to change that, that's what would cause an impact. And then finally, as I mentioned in the comments, the Australian dollar, which yields a much higher rate but has been declining over the last several quarters. So those are some headwinds to the yield. We've been able to offset some of that with lower borrowing costs, essentially, in the rates that we pay on our deposits. But again there, there's just less room as we're closer to what appears to be the floor. And I guess I look at it, and if you just go back over the 4 quarters here, we've seen the NIM decline a couple of basis points on average over those quarters. Not knowing where rates are going to go, we think that we'll continue to pressure on our NIM.","Operator","We take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to tackle the organic growth question for both, I guess, C&IS and PFS. When we look at some of the businesses you guys are growing more rapidly, and whether it be hedge fund outsourcing or middle office solutions, that stuff that doesn't really show up in assets under custody -- in addition to that, obviously, you have the market impact, you have the FX impact, you have the money market fee waiver impact. So when you guys kind of try to x all that out, and when you think about the core growth in the business, how should we think about that organic growth rate for you?","Michael G. O'grady","So Alex, you're right. There are a number of factors that ultimately impact what the fee growth is there, some of them less in our control than others. And so where we're focused is on that organic growth rate. And I think as you -- over time, as you sort out all these other factors, what we've achieved for that organic growth rate is kind of mid-single digits for both businesses. Now we get there in both -- in different ways historically. And what I mean by that is in the Personal business, just the size of the accounts on a relative basis is just smaller to the overall base. There's less client concentration, if you will. And so it tends to be a less volatile organic growth rate as long as we're executing on our strategies. Whereas on the Institutional side, as you know, we can have some moderate clients, smaller-size clients, but then we can also have some very significant clients that can tend to move the organic growth rates more in particular periods. So it is a little bit more volatile. But over time, the average growth rate in that business has been very similar to what we've seen in the Personal business. So that's kind of how we think about it. And as you've mentioned, it's also, particularly on the institutional side, a very diversified set of clients. So whether that's sovereign wealth funds, whether it's hedge funds, whether it's defined benefit plans in the U.S. or superannuation funds in Australia, it's diversified by client type, geography, et cetera, and there are just different dynamics with each of those markets.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then my follow-up is on the expenses, and I guess maybe to clarify some of the questions that we got over the course of this quarter from last quarter's call. But with that kind of mid-single-digit organic growth rate in mind, is it fair to think that your core expense growth, again, over time, should be somewhere below that, given your comments earlier? I mean, and I guess looking more in the near term, first quarter tends to be seasonally high. So should we expect a similar quarterly pattern this year as we've seen in the past of kind of lower second quarter, lower third quarter, and then maybe high in the fourth quarter?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So to the first part of the question, I would say the way you state it, Alex, is the way that we think about it, which is the expenses and the growth in our expenses needs to be below our organic growth rate on revenues. And so to the extent we can grow faster, then yes, our expense growth rate can be faster, but then -- and vice versa, of course. But that is the relationship, is focused on the organic growth versus the growth in the expenses. That does mean that over time, total expenses are going to fluctuate and revenues are going to fluctuate because of external factors that may cause positive or negative operating leverage outside of that. As far as your second question on the pattern, I think -- and I've said the expenses fluctuate from period to period. And as much as there are certain expenses that we do experience, so for example, the Northern Trust Open in the first quarter, and are more predictable, there are other aspects that are not necessarily predictable by quarter. So I definitely would not hold to a set pattern where, just because last year, our expenses went down from first quarter to second quarter, does not necessarily mean they're going to go down this year from first quarter to second quarter. That -- many other factors which we've talked about as far as the growth in the business, the level of business activity, any number of things that can cause fluctuation from period to period.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I'd like to ask you how seriously the firm is taking its competitor's cloud technology initiative and its claim that it's going to become the low-cost producer in the industry. And given that your clients share a common technology platform, would a similar transformation actually help Northern? Or would it be superfluous? And then, are you contemplating a competitive response there?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. As much as some of our competitors may talk about their cloud computing strategy more than we do does not mean that we are not utilizing and executing a cloud computing strategy ourselves. I mean, in fact, without being able to quote various numbers, it is something that we look at as to the number of applications that we've moved to the cloud, to our cloud. So it's a technology that we're very much using. It's just from a way that we characterize or position our technology strategy to the outside world, it's not centered around just cloud computing. It's much broader than that. You did mention our single operating platform, which is more about how we think about technology. And so I would say that, as far as how we present ourselves to our clients and, more importantly, reacting to strategic moves by our clients, there's no doubt that technology is one of the key competitive criteria. And needless to say, in both parts of our business, meaning both Personal and the Institutional side of the business, it's critical that we continue to invest in technology and be at the front edge of that. We've demonstrated that both by the dollars that we've invested, we've demonstrated that by some of the acquisitions we've done where we've acquired what we believe to be leading-edge technology. And with Driving Performance, one of the things we've talked a lot about, both internally and externally, is what we're doing there really is trying to create the capacity to be able to continue to invest in technology. So recognizing the fact that it's an area that will require investment and, as a result, have a higher growth rate than maybe some of our other expense categories.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's really helpful. Following on Alex's question a bit, some of our channel checks are saying that the pipeline for large mandates have been driving up -- drying up a little bit, particularly in middle office outsourcing. You have a very credible offering in that business. So I'm wondering if you would agree with that view and if you might comment on where we are in the replacement cycle for middle office and whether you're seeing continued growth in demand from new large customers who want that service.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. I'm not going to be able to specifically give you a view on what the pipeline is, broadly speaking, in the industry and just the opportunities that's out there. I will say that, given that the nature of those types of transactions, it can be more sporadic, right? So it's not just a constant stream at a certain level. And so I think it's -- you need to be cautious when you think about either the pipeline really building up or coming down. We definitely are continuing to see opportunities of all sizes, so including very large opportunities in that business. But I will tell you it is sporadic in the sense that at times, there can be multiple large opportunities that we're pursuing and are competing with others to win. To your point, we think we have a compelling offering in that marketplace. We think there is a what I call market dynamic that's out there that is very positive longer term. So even if there are periods where it may slow down as to companies deciding to go that direction, we're still a believer that over time, more asset managers will pursue that strategy.","Operator","Okay. And next, we'll go to Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I want to ask about the balance sheet size again and going back to deposits and excess deposits, potentially. It was helpful, the tag color. But can you go back and give us some reminders in terms of excess deposits from flight to safety, how much of that may be left? Should we continue to expect, if indeed kind of re-risking holds here, more broadly that we could see that reversal continue?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So Andrew, you saw in the quarter that the size of our balance sheet or average earning assets was about the same as it was in the fourth quarter, but the mix did change, as I talked about, with demand deposits going down. I think that what we have seen is a period of time where the \"excess deposits\" in the system did increase. And now we've seen, for the most part, that, that has dispersed out more broadly, as I talked about, both to funds, both to securities and to other asset categories. And as much as our balance sheet is liability driven, so to the extent that our clients move back into a position that they want to place more deposits on the balance sheet, we'll be there, and you'll see the effect of that. But I think that, at least in the current period here, we've seen a little bit of a stabilization of the balance sheet closer to what I would consider normal levels as opposed to times before we've talked about really being in a higher level of deposit situation.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And related, should we then expect from here that there actually could be growth in the overall balance sheet this year?","Michael G. O'grady","I wouldn't necessarily say that. I think, again, combination of -- on the one side, Andrew, where we are seeing this re-risking, some of that comes off of the balance sheet. And so we have, on the Personal side, for example, for a while anticipated that with some of our clients that have significant balances, that they will essentially invest that either in funds or other investment products or businesses, et cetera. So that trend could continue, which is not a negative thing, by the way, but that would be a decrease in the balance sheet. At the same time, I would say, as we grow our business overall, that tends to and has grown our balance sheet overall. So I look at the confluence of those 2 factors as having us in a range here, really, more than necessarily saying it's going to go up or it's necessarily going to go down.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. And then just lastly, back to expenses. It looks like on Slide 8 of your slide deck you're Driving Performance initiatives on a pretax basis. You're largely through your initial target in terms of an annual impact already this quarter, 85%, 90% through, if you will. How much more room is there to go in terms of that target $250 million above and beyond when we get through this year to -- I assume you're targeting kind of positive operating leverage this year and going forward.","Michael G. O'grady","Right. So there definitely is more room just with the initiatives that we're executing on right now. As I've said before, some of these initiatives are more challenging. These are the end-to-end initiatives where we look at major processes within the institution and essentially reengineer them, which results in really better outcomes for the clients, for the partners and also from a cost efficiency standpoint. So those are the areas that we're executing. And I would say that the gains come, but they come spread out over time. So we definitely expect to see that Driving Performance benefit increase each quarter throughout the rest of the year. The level, difficult to put a pin in exactly what the level is going to be, but we do expect the trajectory to continue. And then longer term, we look to add additional initiatives, particularly in the area of this process optimization. We went after the areas that we thought had the most opportunity in the near term, not just from an expense standpoint but from a process improvement standpoint. But there are additional processes which we've begun to execute on, but then we can also begin to execute on later in the year and into next year.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the split on that, where we are today in terms of the run rate in terms of expenses-revenue, it had been 60-40 last year when you were kind of 60-plus percent. And now you're closer to 85%, 90%. Is it still 60-40?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, it's still pretty close to 60-40. It may drift a little bit to the expense side just because some of these process optimization initiatives are more -- definitely more expense oriented than revenue oriented.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mike, a couple of questions, I  guess, now that we have the CCAR results. Your capital ratios keep growing. You've always been industry leading, and you just keep widening out the gap. So how much capital is too much, if  [indiscernible] ?","Michael G. O'grady","Well, I -- as I -- as you know, we do feel good about our capital position. But as I mentioned, the situation continues to evolve. And frankly, a lot of these things, in fact, are out of our control. So as much as we feel very comfortable with our capital positions, the final rules as to what's required have not been determined. And with regard to the CapR  [ph] and then the CCAR process, there's a process we have to go through with our regulators in order to return capital to our shareholders. So needless to say, we feel very good about the level of capital we have for our business. We feel very good about the level of capital we have relative to our competitors. This year, we'll look to return more capital than we did in the previous year, and we'll look to improve our processes around our capital plan and capital adequacy so that, regardless of how the rules may change and how ratios may get affected by changes in those rules, that we're well positioned to continue to be able to do that. But it's too difficult to be able to quantify exactly what that's going to be when you have so many uncertainties.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there any particular issue or item in what's not been clarified that you're particularly concerned about?","Michael G. O'grady","I would say that there's no particular ruling that we're concerned about per se. There are always various either parts of the business or parts of the balance sheet that can be more favorably or less favorably impacted by what the requirements may be and various things that, with the regulators, you spend more time on. And so there's constantly things that are a part of our dialogue, but there's no one factor or rule, I should say, that at this point we're concerned about the outcome of a particular rule.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And one request. This will sync with a question that was asked earlier. If you can start doing something that a lot of your peers do, which is break down inflows versus market impact when you give us details on things like assets under management, that'd be very helpful.","Michael G. O'grady","Okay, we'll take that into account.","Operator","Okay. Next, we'll go to John Moran with Macquarie Capital.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to sort of revisit the money market fund issue. I guess news out today that one of the big players here is sort of resigned to floating NAV as an eventuality, and I think we've got some expected action coming later this year. So just wondering if we could kind of get your updated thoughts on how you guys are positioned for what may be coming from a regulatory perspective there.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. Well, overall, we think we're well positioned in the sense that, regardless of the direction of any type of money market reform, we should be in a position to be able to serve our clients' needs. So whether that's -- if they decide to continue in money market funds, we obviously offer them a number of alternatives. If those no longer become attractive, we can offer them other products, certainly balance-sheet-oriented deposit products that can meet with their needs, and we're constantly trying to think of innovative new ways to meet those needs. So there may be types of funds that can -- that right now are not structured, but we can structure them in a way that will meet with needs if the others get changed. So that's the first part. The second part, as far as the specific proposals that are out there, we think that all of them, in one way or another, either have flaws or would require further work in order to be something that would be workable overall. So as much as a floating-rate NAV has some applicability, in our view, maybe to certain funds, so more of the prime funds, for example, there are various tax and accounting requirements that need to be worked through before a floating-rate NAV would work for the prime funds. We think some of the other proposals, like holdbacks, are more difficult, not from our perspective but from our client's perspective. As we talk to our clients on both the Institutional and the Personal side, that's not how they utilize the money market funds for the most part. They like to think that they have complete access to those funds. So we think that's a commercial issue overall for everybody. And then certainly, from a capital standpoint, as Vivek mentioned in the previous question, things that are changing or what are things that are out there, certainly money market reform is an area that we watch. We're a very large provider in that marketplace. And to the extent that capital is required specifically for funds or in some form, that's certainly a way that our capital would have to be utilized. So we think we're prepared for the various directions it could head, and we think that you're correct in that something is likely to come out here in the near term, and we'll certainly be a part of that.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","Got you, that's helpful. And then just kind of a, I guess, a nitty-gritty one here. On the fee waiver part of that business, I think in the past, you guys have said we start to abate or get a little bit of relief with not a whole lot of movement on the short end, and then we would kind of be done waiving fees at 75 to 100 basis points. Is that still the case?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. Basically, it is. I mean, we're down now where repo rates, I think, are 12, 13 basis points depending on which securities you're repo-ing. But very low levels. That's caused the money market fund fee waivers to go up this past quarter. But to the extent that the short end were to move up, as you mentioned, kind of 50, 75 basis points, without knowing all of the other dynamics around that, that would have a very material effect in us trying to get out of the money market fee waivers.","Operator","Okay. Next we'll go to Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On the -- the expense control, obviously, was very good in the first quarter. And Mike, I appreciate your comment that they can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. But it seems like we do have some higher seasonal expenses in the first quarter. Just curious to get your take on whether they were business conversion expenses in terms of the large main office asset servicing image [ph] such as Bridgewater and how that might influence your expense pattern during the year.","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So we did, as you pointed out, Brian, in the fourth quarter talk a lot about having a very active quarter for onboarding, and that often happens at the end of the year, where we're trying to get things completed for clients. And we did see some relief on some of those expenses in the fourth quarter that I mentioned, things like consulting expenses, where we're hiring third parties to help us onboard in order to get it done more quickly; some of the legal expenses that we talked about in that time period as well because of setting up new trusts for clients and things like that. Those expenses were lower in the first quarter, and yet they can increase as the business activity increases. But at this point, there's nothing in particular that we're expecting to change the trajectory of what they would normally be. The larger onboardings, we have a number of those. Bridgewater is one of them. The expenses from that will proceed once -- will proceed when we begin to recognize the revenue. So we'll have some impact. But it doesn't really fully flow in, in that impact until more into 2014.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","In 2014?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, there will really be a greater impact from those onboarding expenses.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So the revenue expense calibration is certainly positive by the time we get to, say, the end of this year or into 2014 on that?","Michael G. O'grady","I'm sorry. Ask that part again?","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The revenue expense sort of calibration on the large main office deals such as Bridgewater are -- become positive sort of by the end of this year or into 2014?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. It's difficult to ask that -- answer that specifically just as to what exactly you mean by calibration. But, I mean, what I would say is we always have onboardings that are happening, and we always have, as a result of that, expenses that come in advance of it. And it's the fact that we have a portfolio of these that allows us to, frankly, be able to take on new clients with expenses in advance. And there is a negative drag maybe on a per client basis. But overall, if you're referring to kind of overall profitability of that, we definitely have that.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great, great, that's helpful. And then just lastly, the $13 billion of reclassification of PFS company assets, does that have any revenue impact? Or is that just optical?","Michael G. O'grady","It has no revenue impact.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions and answers today. So at this point, I'd like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael G. O'grady","No, we're done here. So I just want to thank everybody for dialing in or on the Web for today's call and look forward to talking a quarter from now.","Operator","Thanks. And that does conclude today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation."],"16612":["Northern Trust (NASDAQ:NTRS) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 18, 2012 12:00 PM ET","Executives","Beverly J.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, Bev Fleming, for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead.","Beverly J. Fleming","Thank you, Lisa. Welcome to Northern Trust Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call this morning are Mike O'grady, Northern Trust Chief Financial Officer; Rick Kukla, our Controller; and Allison Quaintance from our Investor Relations team.","For those of you who did not receive our second quarter earnings press release or financial trends report by email this morning, they are both available on our website at northerntrust.com. In addition, and also on our website, you will find our quarterly earnings review presentation, which we will use to guide today's conference call. This July 18 call is being webcast live on northerntrust.com. We only authorize rebroadcast of this call as the replay that will be available through August 15. Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.","Now for our Safe Harbor statement. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results, of course, could differ materially from those indicated by these statements because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties. I urge you to read our 2011 annual report and our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results.","Thank you again for joining us today, and let me turn the call over to Mike O'grady.","Michael G. O'grady","Good morning, everyone. Let me join Bev in welcoming you to the Northern Trust second quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Our second quarter results of earnings per share of $0.73 and a return on equity of 9.9% reflect continued progress on many fronts. Growth in trust, investment and other servicing fees was strong, driven by new business from both personal and institutional clients.","Execution on our driving performance initiatives remains a critical priority, and we made further progress in the second quarter on both the revenue and expense side, and profitability improved with our pretax margin increasing to 27.7%. This performance was against the ongoing backdrop of a mixed operating environment.","Equity markets were weak in the second quarter, following positive performance in each of the 2 preceding quarters. The S&P 500 was down 3%, and the IFA was down 7%. This weakness had a negative impact on the market value of client assets, as did the strengthening of the dollar. Assets under custody ended the second quarter at $4.6 trillion, down 1% sequentially but up 3% year-over-year, and assets under management ended at $704 billion, down 2% sequentially but up 3% year-over-year.","Fees, overall, benefited from the prior quarter's positive market performance, given that some fees are calculated on the basis of month or quarter lag asset values. Foreign exchange volatility in volumes continue to be low, impacting our foreign exchange trading income. Interest rates remain low, placing continued pressure on our net interest margin and resulting in ongoing fee waivers on our money market funds, albeit lower in the second quarter than the first quarter.","The U.S. economy's slow recovery has led to continued improvement in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. Nonperforming assets declined for the fourth quarter in a row, and our loan loss provision was $5 million, unchanged from last quarter and down from $10 million one year ago. And we saw some modest loan growth both sequentially and compared to last year.","Let's move to Page 2 and discuss the financial results for the second quarter. Net income of $180 million and earnings per share of $0.73 both increased approximately 11% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Our return on equity of 9.9% was better than last quarter and one year ago and just below our long-term target range of 10% to 15%, signifying good progress on our productivity and profitability efforts. The sequential quarter improvement was primarily the result of revenue growing 2% and expenses declining 1%.","Trust, investment and other servicing fees, the largest component of our revenues, grew 5% but were offset partially by reduced foreign exchange trading income and net interest income. The decline in expenses was primarily due to lower compensation benefits and other expenses. Higher trust, investment and other servicing fees and net interest income drove the year-over-year comparison, which was again impacted by the reduced level of foreign exchange trading income.","The year-over-year comparisons for both revenues and expenses were also impacted by the inclusion of the Bank of Ireland Securities Services and Omnium acquisitions, which closed in June and July of 2011, respectively. Before getting into more detail, I'd like to highlight 3 items, which impacted the comparisons between periods.","First, we recorded $3.6 million in restructuring acquisition and integration charges during the second quarter. This compares to $3.9 million last quarter and $22.6 million one year ago.","Second, our results for the quarter included software write-downs at $10.5 million. Our first quarter results also had an unrelated software write-downs of $4.6 million. There was no such item in the year earlier period.","Third, our second quarter results included net investment security gains of $500,000, reflecting $21.5 million in realized gains from the sale of treasury notes and $21.1 million in realized losses from the sale of auction-rate securities.","In the comparison periods, net investment losses of $2.4 million and $16.6 million were recorded in the first quarter of 2012 and second quarter of 2011, respectively, primarily due to other-than-temporary impairment charges in our securities portfolio.","With that background and summary, let me get into more details behind our second quarter results, beginning with trust, investment and other servicing fees on Page 3. Trust, investment and other servicing fees were $606 million in the quarter, up 5% sequentially and 9% year-over-year.","For C&IS, our institutional business, trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $338 million in the second quarter, up 7% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. While equity markets were weaker in the second quarter, some of our custody and investment management fees are calculated based on a quarterly lag methodology.","Given that markets were up in the first quarter, with the S&P 500 up 12% and the IFA up 9%, sequential performance benefited from the quarter lag market. C&IS custody and fund administration fees were $215 million in the second quarter, up 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. And the sequential quarter increase was attributable to new business and higher first quarter equity markets, offset partially by the impact of a stronger dollar.  The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of higher fund administration fees related to the acquisitions, as well as new business, offset partially by the impact of a stronger dollar.","C&IS investment management fees were $72 million in the second quarter, up 16% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The sequential quarter increase reflects lower fee waivers, new business, primarily in index management, and higher quarter lag markets. In the year-over-year comparison, new business, primarily an index and fund management, drove the increase.","Waived fees, associated with institutional money market mutual funds and impacting C&IS, were $7 million in the second quarter, down from $10.6 million in the first quarter and $7.5 million in last year's second quarter. Lower fee waivers on our institutional money market mutual funds primarily reflect higher gross yields achieved in the underlying funds.","Securities lending fees were $31 million in the second quarter, up 43% sequentially, reflecting the traditional second quarter impact of the international dividend season, which resulted in wider spreads, but down 1% compared with last year. Borrower demand remain soft as securities lending collateral of $94 billion decreased 3% sequentially and 12% year-over-year.","C&IS assets under custody were $4.2 trillion at quarter end, down 1% sequentially but up 3% year-over-year, while C&IS assets under management were $528 billion at quarter end, down 2% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the pace of new business in C&IS, with our results in the first half of 2012 being our best ever. That said, new business was unable to offset weak second quarter equity markets and the impact of a stronger dollar.","Moving to our personal business, PFS, trust, investment and other servicing fees were a record $267 million in the second quarter, up 4% on a sequential quarter basis and 7% year-over-year. The sequential quarter increase reflects new business, lower fee waivers and the impact of equity markets on fees. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects new business, the impact of a change in our fee structure, which was effective January 1 and lower fee waivers.","Money market fund fee waivers and PFS were $10 million in the second quarter, which compares with $14.9 million in the first quarter and $15.2 million in the year earlier quarter. Lower PFS fee waivers reflect higher gross yields achieved in the underlying funds as well.","With respect to market impact, our PFS regions use a one-month lag methodology and on that basis, equity markets were up approximately 5% on a sequential quarter basis in the second quarter. Global family office fees are calculated based on a one-quarter lag methodology. The 12% increase in the S&P 500 in the first quarter favorably impacted global family office fees which, along with lower fee waivers and new business, drove a 12% improvement in fees for the quarter.","PFS assets under management were $176 billion at quarter end, down 2% sequentially but up 2% year-over-year. New business in PFS was solid across all regions, and the global family office group yet was unable to offset the impact of weaker markets on asset level in the second quarter.","Total revenues are summarized on Page 4. Total trust, investment and other servicing fees, which I just highlighted, were $606 million for the quarter, up 5% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. This growth was offset by clients and other revenue categories.","Foreign exchange trading income was $59 million in the second quarter, down 4% compared with last quarter and 27% year-over-year. The sequential declines reflect a continued low level of currency volatility. The year-over-year decline also reflects lower client volumes. Other operating income was $34 million for the quarter, which is down 11% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. The sequential quarter decline was primarily due to lower level of commercial banking fees, as well as lower other miscellaneous items. The year-over-year reduction also reflects lower commercial banking fees, as well as a leasing gain recorded in last year's second quarter.","All the other fee revenue categories collectively were down 3% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, our second quarter results included net investment security gains of $500,000 resulting from the sales of the student loan auction rate securities and treasury securities. Net investment losses of $2.4 million and $16.6 million were recorded in the first quarter of 2012 and second quarter 2011, respectively, primarily due to other-than-temporary impairment charges.","Net interest income was $264 million in the second quarter, down 1% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. The sequential quarter decline in net interest income was primarily the result of lower level of average earning assets, which declined 3% or almost $3 billion sequentially. This decrease in earning assets more than offset the 4 basis points sequential increase in our net interest margin, which was 1.28% in the second quarter.","The margin improvement reflects a mix shift in both earning assets and funding. On the funding side, demand deposits represented a higher proportion of our total funding in the second quarter compared with the first quarter as interest-bearing deposits declined.","On the asset side, average deposits held with the Federal Reserve Bank declined $4 billion. So in total, revenues on a fully taxable equivalent basis were $999 million, up 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.","Now let's look at second quarter expenses on Page 5. Total expenses in the second quarter were $717 million, 1% lower than the prior quarter. Compensation expense, the largest component of expenses, declined 2% sequentially, primarily due to lower share-based compensation. Recall that stock option expense is typically higher in the first quarter of each year, due to the requirement to immediately expense options granted to retirement-eligible employees. Staff levels on a full-time equivalent basis were up less than 1% with last quarter, with hiring in the second quarter concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. Excluding acquisitions, staff levels are essentially the same as one year ago.","Other operating expenses also declined sequentially by 14%, primarily due to our traditional level of higher first quarter expenses associated with the Northern Trust Open. Partially offsetting these sequential declines was higher equipment and software expense, due primarily to the software write-down. Equipment and software expense, absent software write-downs in each of the last 2 quarters, would have increased 3% sequentially, reflecting ongoing investments in technology.","Outside services expense also increased sequentially reflecting higher sub-custodian and consulting expenses. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of last year's acquisitions, as well as higher equipment and software expense due to the write-down.","Our progress in the first half of 2012 on managing expenses has been positive, and we remain focused on the expense-related goals outlined in our driving performance initiatives.","Let's move to Page 6 for an update on Driving Performance. In January, we indicated our goal to improve pretax income by $250 million by the end of 2013, with over half the $250 million coming in 2012. In the second quarter, we achieved more than $35 million in pretax income improvement, split roughly 40-60 between revenue and expense.","On the revenue side, we have already implemented a number of initiatives. As we mentioned in April, a new pricing structure in PFS was successfully instituted on January 1 and is on track in providing revenue enhancements in 2012. In C&IS, we have begun to see success as we take a coordinated set of actions generally on a client-by-client basis to explore clients needs, evaluate how we are servicing them and determining opportunities to broaden or deepen relationships. We expect these efforts to continue to drive incremental revenue growth going forward.","On the expense side, process optimization is the most significant contributor to our profit improvement plan over the long term. Because process optimization efforts are complex, the majority of this value will be delivered in 2013. One example of a process area where we've already begun to deliver savings is procurement, and we expect to continue to identify opportunities to reduce procurement spend going forward.","Technology efficiency initiatives are well underway in delivering value in line with the long-term total but as we've mentioned, this will represent 5% to 10% of the total.","Finally, corporate-wide initiatives are already contributing significant savings in 2012 as many of these initiatives were successfully implemented in the first half of the year. Based on the financial results a for driving performance achieved to date, we remain on track to meet our 2012 and 2013 targets.","Let me turn to make a few comments on the strength of our balance sheet. On Page 7, we outlined the 3 key components of earning assets, all of which have been consistently managed with a conservative orientation. Just to remind you, our lending strategy, which represents $30 billion in earning assets, is focused on our clients with the majority of loans to PFS clients. While the loan growth has been moderate through this economic cycle, we did grow loans by over $400 million in the second quarter and by $1 billion compared with last year.","Conservative underwriting practices across the diversified portfolio have resulted in loan quality significantly better than industry averages, and our credit quality metrics improved again in the second quarter.","Nonperforming loans decreased 22% sequentially to $240 million at quarter end. Improvements were most evident in the commercial real estate portfolio. Nonperforming assets were 0.89% of total loans and Other Real Estate Owned, down from 0.98% in the first quarter. Net charge-offs were $3 million, down from $6 million last quarter. Our loan loss provision was $5 million in the second quarter, unchanged from last quarter and down from $10 million recorded in the second quarter of 2011. As a result, the allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases was $300 million at quarter end, representing 1% of total loans and leases and 1.3x our nonperforming loans.","Our Securities portfolio, which was about $29 billion at quarter end, continues to be managed in high-quality fashion, with 87% of the portfolio invested in U.S. Treasury, Agency and AAA securities. The portfolio at quarter end had a maturity duration of a little over 2 years and repricing duration consistent with last quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, during the second quarter, we sold certain lower rated student loan auction-rate securities, thereby, reducing the overall risk of our Securities portfolio. You may recall that these securities were purchased from clients beginning in late 2008 when the market for auction-rate securities became less liquid. As of June 30, 2012, the remaining balance of auction-rate securities in our Securities portfolio was $107 million.","Interest-bearing deposits with banks at $18 billion, our third largest earning asset category, continued to be managed conservatively as well. Duration remains short at less than one month on average. Eurozone exposures within this portfolio had been monitored and managed closely. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 5 billion exposure to banks in the Eurozone. We continued to place deposits with a select group of stronger banks at short tenors [ph] .","Capital, outlined on Page 8, remained very strong with Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios at 12.9% and 12.4%, respectively. We estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III advanced framework, as we currently understand the regulations including the impact of the proposed rules issued by the Federal Reserve on June 7, would equal 12.9%, exceeding all anticipated requirements.","Under the common stock repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in March, we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of common stock for $36 million during the second quarter. And following our Board of Directors meeting yesterday, we announced the declaration of our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share which, as you recall, we increased in the second quarter.","Let me wrap up by reiterating a few key points made during today's call. Our second quarter financial performance demonstrate solid progress on executing our strategies. Northern Trust's core businesses, asset servicing, asset management, wealth management and banking are performing very well on a global basis. We are delivering client-focused, value-added solutions and are consistently recognized in the marketplace for superior service to clients.","For example, Northern Trust was named Custody and Securities Services Provider of the Year for the third consecutive year at the UK Pensions Awards and received the Global Custody Award, also for the third year in a row, at the UK Financial Times Pension & Investment Provider Awards.","In our personal business, we were recently named Best Trust Company by Family Office Review, and we continue to hold the award for Best Private Bank in the U.S. from the Financial Times Group. These awards symbolize our commitment to providing our clients with excellent service and innovative products, which are the key drivers of our sustained new business success.","Two initiatives that exemplify recent successful growth strategies are the continued build-out of our growing presence in Australia and the launch of FlexShares, our family of exchange-traded funds. Since entering the Australian market in 2006, assets under custody have grown to AUD $137 billion. And we have been selected as asset servicer by such prominent clients as the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, the Military Superannuation Board and Queensland Investment Corporation. And FlexShares recently surpassed $1 billion in assets, a milestone achieved less than one year after launch.","Our strategy, our brand and our financial strength continue to position us very well to serve our clients, grow the business and deliver value to our shareholders. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Lisa, please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to start with, I guess, your commentary on cost savings and the progress made so far. So if you strip out, I guess, a couple of one-offs, I mean, it looks like the pretax margin this quarter was around 29%, maybe a little over 29%, Mike, how should we think, I guess, about that as we progress through the next kind of 1.5 years? And what do you guys see yourself kind of finishing 2013 from a pretax margin perspective?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So clearly, you've seen, Alex, that we have had a focus on managing our cost and have had success in doing so for a couple of quarters here. We will continue to do that, continue to focus on that. You also saw the driving performance initiatives delivering the savings that we had hoped for. The breakdown there for this period was 40% revenue, 60% expense. So beginning to see more of it coming from the expense side of the equation. So that helped on the margin side. The other thing I would point out, though, is each quarter does have certain items that -- or they're seasonal or just impact particular quarter. So in the first quarter, as you know, we have Northern Trust Open, we have certain equity awards that get expensed in the quarter. So it's never going to be just a complete, smooth trend across all quarters but certainly, our objective is to stay on the path that we've been on in trying to manage those costs closely.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, I guess, the second part of the initiatives, and I'm not sure if that's come in through already. Maybe there's a little bit more to go, but from the revenue perspective, it looks like your fee rates increased almost across every sort of category, whether you look at C&IS custody fees, investment management fees or on PFS side. Can you help us understand, I guess, how much of that is a reflection of the new fee schedule? How much of that is a roll-off from the fee waivers? And is there anything else going on with the type of business that you're winning that just kind of comes in with a slightly higher fee rate versus what you've seen before?","Michael G. O'grady","I think you've hit on the key categories. So for PFS, no question, and we talked about it there. We are seeing the benefits from the new fee structure that was implemented on January 1. And I would say importantly there, Alex, is the fact that it's been executed in a way that it has essentially worked the way that we had planned it out. So from a client retention standpoint and from being able to maintain that fee level, it's gone well. I think on the C&IS front, you're beginning to see the positive impacts of a similar program on that front, albeit structured very differently. So that process, as we've talked about very much client-by-client, but we've put a very organized program around that such that we make sure that we're measuring not only how we roll that out but our progress on that front. And so you saw in this quarter some benefit on the fee side from situations where we've been able to have those discussions with the clients and be able to, what I call, realign the value proposition with them. So that -- those are the primary drivers. As far as the mix of business, I would say on the PFS front, if you look at the asset mix for that client base in the quarter, it was, for the most part, in line with where it was in the previous quarter. So not much of a shift, if you will, in the asset allocation. So it's largely consistent. And similarly on the C&IS side, I wouldn't say that there's any particular trends in the type of business because we are winning kind of across all the sectors. I would say that we've had particular success with hedge fund services, and so we expect that we'll have higher growth there, which will affect that mix.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just the last one for me. NII, I guess, obviously tends to be, I guess, a little bit volatile with the rates and the size of the balance sheet, but it seems like you guys exited the quarter with earning assets a little bit higher than the average. How should we think about the progression, I guess, of NII from here between, I guess, you trying to manage the NIM, and as well as the growth trends and the balance sheet overall?","Michael G. O'grady","Well, as you saw in the quarter, we saw the impact of when the assets do go down, the earning assets, during that time period. So essentially, what happens, there's a number of factors always but if you boil it down, on the funding side, we had lower interest-bearing deposits, and those are coming off on average about 24, 25 basis points for those. Those were largely being deposited at the Fed. So you saw, likewise, a similar decrease in the average balance of our Fed deposits. And those, as you know, are 25 basis points as well. So essentially, that part of the earning asset mix that's coming off is a lower yielding portion of it or spread for it. So that's what benefited primarily -- I would say, that's what benefited the net interest margin during the period. Going forward, as you correctly pointed out, Alex, we actually entered the quarter with a higher level. Having said that, it continues to move around just as it moved around in the first quarter. As our clients, both personal and institutional certainly, deal with the situations in the marketplace, both in the U.S, but certainly what we're seeing more of recently is in Europe with the euro, those balances can move around. So as I've said before, difficult to give you a particular trend that we're seeing and just we will continue to manage each component of both the funding side and the asset side to try to maintain the NIM.","Operator","And we'll now go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Mike, I just wanted to ask you for a little more color on the Institutional Asset Management business. I know there was some help from fee waivers but you had a really good revenue result on down average assets. So can you talk a little bit about product mix in that business, mandate flows, et cetera?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, as you pointed out, there were a couple of items there on the fee waiver front that helped in the market, helped a little bit. But we did see the impact of net new business on that. And if you recall, last quarter we talked a little bit about just the timing of when new clients come on. And so we did have the benefit of some of that activity happening earlier in the time period. So nice wins. As far as the mix, as I mentioned, we had a couple large wins in the index area. But if you look at our asset mix in the institutional business, as well as the personal business, very diversified, which is something that has been a conscientious strategy to move that direction. And I think you're seeing the benefit of that as the markets move around.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question just on capital, you mentioned 12.9% on the Basel III under the NPR. That's -- if I'm recalling, that's not much of a delta. Could you just confirm that? But secondly, of the 13% still growing each quarter, there wasn't really that much buyback this quarter. When do we start to see the share count start to really come down? And how do you -- do you think any differently about future CCAR submission and capital usage?","Michael G. O'grady","Let me try to take those in a couple pieces. First of all, as far as the change quarter-over-quarter in that Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, the primary driver for the change is that during the period, we did, obviously, have a profitable quarter. And if you recall, we had 2 dividends declared in the prior quarter, in the first quarter, so all of that net income, or virtually all of it, essentially went to equity. So we saw an equity increase from that. As I mentioned in selling the auction-rate securities, that also reduced our risk weighted assets. So those were the 2 biggest drivers of the increase in the ratio itself. As far as the new NPRs that are out there, for us, as the advanced approaches bank, the NPR is generally aligned with prior guidance from the Basel Committee. There's certainly changes. So the simplified supervisory formula approach definitely impacts part of our risk-weighted assets. But on balance, the increases and decreases from that particular approach essentially have a neutral impact for us on a risk-weighted assets perspective. So that's how it's affected. To you next point on the share repurchase, we so far had been repurchasing the shares consistent with the capital plan that we submitted and was approved by the Fed, and we'll continue to do that. If you recall, we said that we would be -- we have the authorization to repurchase $240 million up to the end of the first quarter, so there's still $190 million remaining on that. And we will continue to look to repurchase according to the plan.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And there's one little thing, just on other fees. You mentioned there's a miscellaneous stuff, was that a bit of an anomaly this quarter? Just give a little color on that.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. So that category, as you know, does include a number of miscellaneous items. So it is difficult to forecast, whether it's internally or externally. As I mentioned, we did have a reduction in the commercial banking fees. And really what that is, is just there was less pure refinancing activity in the time period, and that's one of the drivers of fees for the commercial banking area. So frankly, that component in and of itself can change just depending on the level of activity. Beyond that, the year-over-year comparison, as I mentioned, included a gain that we had on a lease residual on the prior year period. So you have items like that, that just cause the numbers to move up and down. But I would say no particular fundamental change in what's in that category.","Operator","And we'll go next to Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, just wanted to clarify 2 points on capital. One, do you have a Tier 1 common Basel III target and then second, is your expectation to exhaust that $240 million by March 2013?","Michael G. O'grady","So as far as the target, what I would say, Howard, is, similar to what we've said before, we don't have a specific target. We certainly like all the other banks to continue to work through all of the new rules and regulations, try to address those that we think are not appropriate or don't necessarily measure capital or risk in the right way. So that will continue to evolve and will need to continue to evolve with that and as to what the regulatory requirements are. We do feel that we are very adequately capitalized as you could imagine at this point in time. And we certainly have to look at the competitive environment or marketplace with regard to capital levels. So we take into account a number of factors. We do not have one single point target. And as you know as well, there are multiple ratios as well which not only the regulators in the marketplace but we also take into account. So that's on the target front. As far as the $240 million, that's our authorization. As always, we evaluate share repurchases based on circumstances at the time in the sense of our view on the state of the business, our capital levels, other alternatives, et cetera. But at this point in time, I would say, as far as the capital plan, our expectation is all else equal to continue to execute on the plan that we've submitted, which is up to the $240 million.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great, Mike. And then on the loan growth, you cited I hear you on the disciplined underwriting standards, but I was just wondering if the growth we've seen over the past few quarters is related to any specific initiatives that you have in place, or is it focused on any particular region or customer profile?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. It's not a specific initiative. Having said that, where the loan growth has come from, Howard, is mostly from our commercial and industrial area. So we have had success in adding new clients on that front, and that's where you've seen more of the growth. There other categories on the personal side as well, but that's the largest driver.","Howard Chen - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then final one for me. I asked you this last quarter, I thought I'd check in again. Just post some of the fee schedule adjustments you've made as part of a long-term plan, are you seeing any customer attrition?","Michael G. O'grady","It's actually been, I would say, very good on the customer attrition front. And I give credit to my colleagues both on the personal side and the institutional side for just how they've executed the new fee arrangements on the PFS side. And then certainly with C&IS, how they're actually going about this in a very organized, programmatic way.","Operator","And we'll go next to the Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I'm looking at Slide 2. So assets under custody are down 1%, assets under management are down 2%, but your revenues are up nicely, the processing asset management fees are up. Is the sole reason the new fee schedule, or is there something else happening?","Michael G. O'grady","The new fee schedule is definitely a part of it. It's one of the factors. Another factor is certainly that relative to markets, fees -- some of our fees, Mike, as you know on a quarter-like basis, some of them are on a month-like basis. For example, in the PFS region. And there are also other fees that are not necessarily asset-based. So as much as I do think there are longer-term trends in those ratios, they're not necessarily lockstep from quarter-to-quarter. But I would say that you have those factors that, overall, it's also the underlying just growth of the business, net new business that we're seeing over time.","Beverly J. Fleming","And also, Mike, I would just add the impact of the fee waivers as well, which were lower this quarter than they were last quarter. So that would be another element as well.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Do you want to give any cautionary language around the upcoming quarters because to the extent that the fee reflect the onetime step-up and the markets weren't as strong and you have a lagging pricing, does that mean the second half of the year might not be as good?","Michael G. O'grady","Definitely don't have a specific view nor would we give one on the second half of the year, Mike, but needless to say, and everybody on this call knows the environment that we're currently in continues to be challenging with regard to interest rates, FX volatility, choppy equity markets. So we continue to be in what I consider a challenging market, but don't know what the rest of the quarter will hold for us.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Are you getting some sort of flight to quality benefit? Why are you getting the new business that you're getting?","Michael G. O'grady","We think that's part of it, but we think this is part of our broader franchise and strategy and brand. So it's everything, and it's a lot of effort in trying to add to our business and build on it.","Michael Mayo - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, you saw that Goldman Sachs looks to expand its private bank. I mean, to me, it says they're going after your client. And then you have JPMorgan looking to accelerate its growth in the private bank, how do you think about those longer-term threats?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, well, they're also near-term competitors for us in the sense that we compete against both of those institutions right now on the personal side. We did note, of course, the article yesterday with regard to Goldman Sachs. But I'm not sure that, that necessarily is going to change the competitive environment. Frankly, we think that we're in a very attractive business, and we're not surprised that other banks would look to try to compete in this business. But we feel pretty good about our own competitive positions and have been doing it for quite a while.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brian Bedell with ISI Group.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","On the -- just on the balance sheet. If could you talk a little bit about -- Mike, you were talking about obviously trying to keep the net interest margin roughly stable. If you could talk about some strategy as we move into this second half? Again, not predicting it for the second half, but with regard to what types of rates you're reinvesting on, any GSE part of the book? And also, the improvement on yields on the other securities going from 121 to 138, what was the main driver of that?","Michael G. O'grady","Okay. Let me try to take it here, Brian. As far as overall and how we look at it, as I mentioned when I kind of break down the balance sheet for you. First, this is part of the loan portfolio. There's no question that the loan growth that we've seen in this quarter and year-over-year is a positive when it comes to the yield on our portfolio or our balance sheet overall. So that is a positive and to the extent that we can continue to grow that with our clients, we would look to do that and would expect to get a positive benefit on that portion of the portfolio. In the Securities portfolio, you asked the question as to where we're reinvesting in the quarter? Reinvestment rate was basically in line with the yield on the portfolio right now. So by balancing duration, because you saw the duration didn't really move in the quarter in different types of securities, we been able to maintain that approximate 90 to 100 basis points on the Securities portfolio. And then finally, on the last portion there, which is the deposits with bank, that part, very short term in nature. As I mentioned, that is an area where it's certainly a challenge, given that it's going to impact -- be impacted by short-term interest rates. In the second quarter, we all know that longer-term rates came down more significantly than the short end, the very short end of the curve. So much of it just depends on what happens on the very short end of the curve. And we are first and foremost focused on liquidity and credit quality as we make those placement decisions.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, that's very helpful. And then just if you could talk a little bit about the initiatives or the efforts to reprice the custody and fund administration business. I know it's more -- you make it more of an effort with the pension plan. If you can talk about where you stand in that relative to -- earlier in the year, the conversation is going better. We started to see more effective repricing of that.","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, let me take that and kind of give you a description, if I could, of what we're doing on that front because you are correct. I think that this area is picking up more momentum relative to on the personal side, which started right out of the gates this year. But as I've mentioned a number of times, this is a very structured global program that we've rolled out that has multiple work streams to it. The first one is definitely trying to assess the individual relationship. So much has changed over the last several years as we know in the environment. So it's trying to line up the services we're providing now relative to what the expectations were before. So a lot of analysis goes on that front end. The next piece of it is we've actually been training all of the RMs, if you will, in how to handle these situations with the clients. And so, right at this point, for example, there's over 200 of the RMs that have specifically gone through the program in order to make sure that we're doing this in a way that we maximize on client retention. And then as far as client communication, we've been having those discussions with the client. And I would say roughly now, we probably had about 1\/3 of the conversations that were ultimately going to have, and we're tracking those very closely. Not just that we're having the conversations, but the type of feedback that we're getting and using that knowledge, if you will, for the future conversations that we have. And then finally, I would say that we're trying to do this in a way that it isn't just a once every several years that we look to align or realign the value proposition with client. So it's trying to do it in a way that is sustainable. And what we're seeing so far as far as the early successes I mentioned, they kind of fall into 3 categories. One is that you have situations where we look for and with the client find other opportunities to serve them. So if we're already providing something on the asset servicing side that there are opportunities in the asset management side. Second is there are specific circumstances where it does involve a fee increase, given that the mix of business had changed. In other words, there's certain activities whether it's securities lending or FX or something else that they are doing less of that they anticipated on doing more, and then we adjust the other part of the relationship equation. And then finally, there are certain things that are not necessarily revenue-oriented but they may be services that we're providing that are costly on our end that are not necessarily viewed as high-value add on the client end. And so we work through with them as to where they do value the services and to the extent there are certain things that are not as important to them. We can look to modify that in a way to reduce our cost. So very comprehensive and, as I would say, not only has it started to pick up momentum here but this will carry through not only through the end of the year, but we'll see the benefits, I think, mostly in 2013.","Brian Bedell - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That 's great. That's very helpful. Just lastly, on the new business on the C&IS custody and fund admin side, can you just give us a sense of where you're seeing it mostly, I guess in terms of global, in terms of hedge fund administration and middle office outsourcing relative to straight custody arrangement?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, I would say, it's a very nice mix across what you said there. So we are winning new business. I mentioned the growth and success we've had in Australia. So certainly Asia Pacific has been a positive. In Europe, we had a number of wins during the quarter in Europe. And then likewise, in the U.S., in North America, as far as the type of business, as much as it continues to be broad-based, I would say we've had particular success, as I mentioned, with the hedge fund administration part of the business there. So relatively broad-based, and I would expect that, that type of mix will continue, although you never know where you're going to be more successful.","Operator","And we'll go next to Greg Ketron with UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Mike and Bev, question on the margin. I know you covered this a number of different ways, Mike, but when you look at the earning asset yields and think about repricing risk, is your sense that we're pretty much through the repricing risk as you look across the loan book and into the securities area. And if not, and if you go to the interest-bearing fund side, you're down to 25 basis points that you're paying net cost on interest-bearing liability side. Is there a further room that you think you could reduce this cost?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, so if we go through it the way you suggested, first of all, on the loan side of the equation, we did see the yield come down there a little bit as we do continue to see some refinancings. And the refinancings are coming at lower rates. However, I would like to think that we're towards the back end of that certainly. It doesn't mean that there can't be more pressure on that, but as I even mentioned the impact we've seen on the commercial banking fees, it's because most clients have -- who are interested in refinancing, whether that's personal or institutional, have largely done that or had the opportunity to do it. So I'd like to think bank end on the loan portfolio side of it. The Securities portfolio, again, is more market-driven. We're certainly continuing to look at how we balance duration in that portfolio in a way to maintain the yield as best we can. It certainly gets challenging as we see treasury rates come down essentially across the curve. And then on the shortest end, as far as the deposits, we have been able, certainly in the U.S., with the Fed deposit, the 25 basis points, that certainly provides some level, if you will, I think not only at the Fed but also in the marketplace for the short end. As we've seen, though, in Europe, with the euro now overnight rates being 0, that has an impact on the marketplace and can bring those short-end deposit rates down. So that's how I would see the kind of the trends, if you will, that we're seeing on the asset side. On the deposit side, as you mentioned, we're already relatively low on our deposit rates and our funding side. Is there room to go lower? Probably a little bit, depending on where market rates go based on some of the comments I just made previously where we see on the other side of the equation. But there really isn't that much room on the funding side as well. So that's the balance or the challenge that we have on that front.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And looking down the road, which seems like a long ways off and rates eventually do go up, say, if the short end were to go up 100 basis points, you have the money market fee waivers and then the balance sheet repricing. Do you have a sense for how much asset sensitivity you would have under that scenario?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, we are asset-sensitive as you pointed out. And without quantifying it, I would say that as you pointed out, the money market fee waivers which -- we give those numbers so it's easy enough to quantify what those dollars are that essentially would -- if we hold the waivers there. And I think, to your point, if we saw 100 basis point move in there, our expectation is that we would no longer have those waivers. So you can quantify that. And then on the margin side of the equation, we're at 1.28% right now. Our historical average is closer 1.75%. I don\u2019t necessarily think if market rates go up 100 basis points that we would see that full impact, but again I think there's -- anybody could do math around what the impact would be to the extent we're even to get a 25 basis points increment in our net interest margin.","Operator","And we'll now go to Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the asset management side, can you give any sense of whether the flows are increasing or decreasing relative to previous quarters? And also, are they mostly passive at this point?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes. I would say that because of the very diversified nature of our assets under management, there are positive and negative flows depending on the category. There's none of them, Cynthia, where I would say we're seeing significant flows one way or the other. I do think when you look at our overall levels though, it does indicate, particularly given that markets are down, that on a net basis, we are continuing to win business.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And any -- what's your outlook there in terms of, I guess, in terms of private client flows?","Michael G. O'grady","Private client flows, again, I would point you the same direction as far as just looking at our asset levels with the markets down sequentially, the assets were also down sequentially but not as much as the markets. Some of that is mix and some of that though also because the net new business has been positive. And again in this quarter, it was likewise a very good quarter.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Okay. And then just a quick question on other operating expense. I apologize if you mentioned this, but what drove most of the sequential decline? I think in the release it mentioned reduced business promotion other miscellaneous expense, but I'm just wondering is that a sustainable level, or is there something else in there?","Beverly J. Fleming","Well, Cynthia, the sequential quarter comparison this year and in recent years would've primarily been the result of the Northern Trust Open.","Michael G. O'grady","That drives the majority.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. Right. So I should really look at it year-over-year.","Michael G. O'grady","Correct.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And last question is just on the new fee schedule for PFS. Is there, under the new fee schedule, more of a delta in fees between fixed income and the equity than there used to be so that if equity markets were to rise or people were to become more risk-drawn, would you get more of a lift there than you used to?","Michael G. O'grady","Well, I'm not going to necessarily comment to the specific levels of the fees on the products, Cynthia, just because I don't have them and I don't know them. But I would say that I -- that it does change that dynamic that you're talking about, and it is something where we move from a bundled fee, which to your point is going to be more kind of on average, if you will, to one that now is more differentiated because as much as we have an account management fee, that account management fee is smaller, obviously, than what the overall bundled fee was. And then the remainder are based on products. Now those product fees are very much just market-based. So equities versus fixed income and all the various different types of products are just consistent with market level fees. So to your point, you could make whatever assumptions you wanted about changes in markets, and I would have the expectation that our fees would behave differently than they did under a bundled fee.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mike and Bev, question for you coming back to capital. Clearly, you guys have one of the best Tier 1 common ratios out there, which obviously you want to maintain. Once we all understand what the final capital rules are, do you think you would come out to shareholders and point out where you want to be relative to those rules, so we could look at the return on equity and get some judgment on how you're going to get to that 10% to 15% target that you have?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, I think as you pointed out, Gerard, I think you made the phrase, once we all understand how all the rules are going to work, I think we and everybody else looks forward to that day. And in fairness, not only are all the banks but the regulators I think are working through this as well to get to the right place. So that is certainly something that we continue to not only monitor in the sense of how are the rules developing but then to your point, where do we want to be relative to the regulatory required levels. So that's also evolving. And then as I've mentioned earlier, we don't necessarily have a target ratio so we don't pick one particular ratio, and then say that we try to drive everything because we do think that it is a multidimensional, multi-variable situation that you need to look at. I mean, obviously leverage ratios are very different than risk-based ratios and you have different risks that required capital within the risk-based ratios depend -- based on the advanced methodology. So I think it's tough to necessarily have a single point target. And we also take into account, and will take into account at that point what I consider the competitive marketplace, right? So we have to make sure that we are positioned from a franchise standpoint for our clients and for our businesses in a position that continues to give clients and prospective clients the appropriate view on Northern Trust that we have a very strong balance sheet and strong capitalization. So my point in all that is there's a lot of factors even now, and difficult if not impossible to predict how those are going to develop and then based on that, determine where we would end up with that. And so we'll continue to take all that into account as we think about the appropriate amount of capital for us in order to also generate the return range that you just mentioned.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","In terms of, I guess this is more philosophically right now because things are still uncertain, both in the macro environment we live in plus with the rules. We all don't know what the final rules are. But once we get there, conceptually, could Northern actually look to give back to shareholders on an annual basis upwards to -- if the capital is not needed, again, you're at the level you feel very comfortable at, give back to shareholders up to 100% of earnings and buybacks and dividends? Or is that something that conceptually or philosophically just wouldn't fly?","Michael G. O'grady","Well philosophically, the way we look at the dividends is that we do provide a certain portion of our earnings back to our shareholders on ongoing basis. The way we look at share repurchases though is more around our capital structure at the time or the level of capitalization and other alternatives. And so to the extent that we feel that we are either below where we want to be or above where we want to be, that can affect the amount of share repurchases that we think are appropriate in returning capital to shareholders. And the outcome of that could certainly be that if you calculate a ratio of whatever actions you take, it could be above 100% of our net income. So in other words, we don't look at all of our capital actions just relative to net income. I view that more as kind of an output for the overall capital return to shareholders. It's more around making sure our capital position is in the right place. And so the answer to that would be yes.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Good. And then another source, of course, of excess capital, as acquisitions with Northern over the years has done successfully, what are you -- are you guys hearing anything in terms of opportunities that in the spaces that you look to, to grow through acquisition, or is it pretty quiet right now?","Michael G. O'grady","Yes, there's certainly activity. I mean, we saw one of our competitors make an acquisition yesterday in a space that we compete. So there is some level of activity. I expect that we'll continue to see that, but there's nothing I would say, Gerard, that's unusual in the sense of either being extremely low or quiet or being extremely active. To me, it's a natural flow of opportunities, which we certainly take a look at and evaluate and determine if we think that they can add to the franchise. If they fit strategically or provide for us the capability that we don't have and if we can do so in a way that we find financially attractive.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just finally, a side question, when does the contract for the Northern Trust Open come up for renewal with the PGA?","Beverly J. Fleming","Gerard, I might have to follow up with you on that. I think we have 2 or 3 more years, but I'm not positive on that.","Operator","And now we'll take our last question from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just back to expenses, can you just give us an update on the driving performance, and I know you're, I think, on track to meeting your goal of over 50% this year. But given the tough kind of macro environment that all are facing, is it possible to have additional levers there to still meet what I think you said in the past in terms of getting to positive operating leverage this year, is that possible?","Michael G. O'grady","The way I would answer that, Andrew, is the driving performance initiative that we have, the focus there is, as we've said, to be more productive over time both on the revenue side and on the expense side. On the expense side, it's to do things that will produce recurring benefits. And so all of those categories are things that we expect to continue going forward. Depending on the economic environment and the market environment and financial performance, we also have to look at near-term levers, as you mentioned, that can be pulled in order to react to that, but those are viewed in a separate category. So regardless of the environment, we'll continue to execute on driving performance and then beyond that, we also are certainly focused on the current environment to determine if there's other things that we need to do. So hopefully, that addresses your question there.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And do you think that in this type of environment where it does seem like the top line is getting tougher, is it possible, is it reasonable to expect positive operating leverage as the driving performance is currently laid out? And what kind of run rate you're at right now? Should we expect that?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. Well, operating leverage obviously has to do with revenue growth rate and our expense growth rate. So yes, it becomes more difficult to the extent that you're in a challenged revenue environment. But that's why we've launched into driving performance earlier this year is because not knowing what that revenue environment is, we want to be able to create positive operating leverage even in a difficult revenue environment. And I think you saw an example of that this quarter on a sequential basis and on a year-over-year basis but sequential basis where we had positive operating leverage about 3%. So that's still the focus, is to try to achieve that, not knowing or not being able to predict exactly what happens on the top line.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. So it sounds like it's still someone on the table that may be less confident in getting to positive operating leverage this year, is that a fair characterization?","Michael G. O'grady","I would just say that everything that we've talked about with driving performance and improving productivity and improving profitability, absolutely still on the table, we feel very good about how we're executing on it, and that hasn't changed. What we don't know is what's going to happen in the broader environment the back half of the year.","Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. That's helpful. Just one last to kick that question on credit and asset quality. Obviously, not that big. Obviously, a little bit I guess flat in terms of credit cost this quarter. Is that a good kind of run rate? Sorry, if I missed that, if that was commented earlier in terms of what -- how should we think about the provision cost?","Michael G. O'grady","Sure. So as you mentioned, we had $5 million of provision in the quarter, and that reflected the fact that our nonperforming loans came down 9%, nonperforming assets down 7%. So continued positive trends. We had $16 million of gross charge-offs in the quarter, and we had recoveries of $13 million. So net charge-offs only $3 million, which we had a good quarter on that front as well. In the first quarter with $6 million, so that's what that reflects to the extent that we continue to see that -- those types of trends, I would expect that the provision will continue to track like that as well. What we can't do, as you know, is predict what is going to happen on the credit front. But so far, as I did mention a little bit earlier, Andrew, this is our fourth quarter in a row of positive developments on the credit front. It's not always that smooth. It can tend to be a bit choppy. So difficult to say if that trend will continue, but we certainly hope so.","Beverly J. Fleming","Lisa, I believe you said that, that was the end of the questions. So we thank you for joining us today and look forward to speaking with you on October.","Michael G. O'grady","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call.

Northern Trust disclaims any continuing accuracy of the information provided in this call after today.","Now, for our Safe Harbor statements. What we say during today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, which are Northern Trust's current estimates and expectations of future events or future results. Actual results of course could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements, because the realization of those results is subject to many risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.","I urge you to read our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for detailed information about factors that could affect actual results. ","During today's question-and-answer session, please limit your initial query to one question and one related follow-up. This will allow us to move through the queue and enable as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions as time permits.","Thank you again for joining us today. Let me turn the call over to Biff Bowman.","Biff Bowman","Good morning everyone. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. ","Starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported third quarter net income of $384.6 million, earnings per share were $1.69 and our return on common equity was 14.9%. ","For the quarter our effective tax rate of 24.4% was higher than prior periods, primarily reflecting higher U.S. taxes payable on the income of the corporation's non-U.S. branches. Our current expectation is that this quarter's tax rate is indicative of our ongoing core rate for future quarters. Although it is possible that clarifying guidance from the IRS could favorably impact the corporation\u2019s effective tax rate if and when issued. ","Before going through our results in detail, I would like to comment on some macros factors impacting our business during the quarter. Equity markets performed well during the quarter, but were mixed on a year-over-year basis. ","Compared to the prior year, the S&P 500 ended the quarter up 2.2%, while the MSCI EAFE was down 1.5%. On a sequential basis, end of period markets were favorable with the S&P 500 and EAFE indices increasing 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Recall that some of our fees are based on lag pricing, and those comparisons were favorable on a sequential basis, the mix versus one year ago.","On a month lag basis, the S&P 500 and EAFE were up sequentially 3.7% and 0.9% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the S&P 500 was up 4.9%, while EAFE was down 2.3%. On a quarter lag basis, the S&P and EAFE were up sequentially 3.8% and 1.6% respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the quarter lag S&P 500 was up 8.2%, while EAFE was down eight-tenths of a percent. ","U.S. short-term interest rates were lower during the quarter on average as reflected in the sequential declines in average one-month and three-month LIBOR, up 26 and 31 basis points respectively.","Currency rates influence the translation of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses. The British pound and euro versus the U.S. dollar, both ended the quarter down 6% compared to the period year. The year-over-year declines favorably impacted expense, but as an unfavorable impact on revenue. On a sequential basis, the British pound and euro ended the quarter down 3% and 4% respectively. ","Let's move to page three and review the financial highlights of the third quarter. Year-over-year revenue increased 4% with non-interest income up 5% from one year ago and net interest income of 2%. Expenses increased 3% from last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $7 million in the current quarter compared to a credit of $9 million one year ago. Net income was up 3% year-over-year. ","In the sequential comparison, revenue increased 2% with non-interest income up 3% and net interest income flat. Expenses increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Net income declined 1% sequentially.","Return on average common equity was 14.9% for the quarter, down from 15.1% one year ago and 15.9% in the prior quarter. Assets under custody and administration of $11.6 trillion increased 7% compared to one year ago, and were up 2% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $8.8 trillion were up 7% compared to one year ago, and up 3% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates. ","Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 3% on a year-over-year basis and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance reflected higher markets and new business, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. ","Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four. Third quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $1.5 billion, up 4% compared to last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust, investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $976 million in the third quarter, up 4% from last year and up 2% sequentially.","Foreign exchange trading income was $60 million in the third quarter, down 17% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily related to lower foreign exchange swap activity in our Treasury function. ","Other non-interest income was $85 million in the third quarter, up 54% compared to one year ago and up 16% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by income relating to a bank-owned life insurance program implemented in the prior year, higher brokerage related revenue and an $8.1 million investment impairment recorded in the prior year. ","The sequential performance was driven by the full quarter\u2019s impact bank-owned life insurance program, as well as strong brokerage related revenue. Net interest income which I will discuss in more detail later was $425 million in the third quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year and it was flat sequentially.","Let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five. For our corporate and institutional services business, fees totaled $560 million in the third quarter and were up 3% year-over-year, and up 2% on a sequential basis. ","The translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year-over-year C&IS fees growth by just over 1.5%. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees were $392 million and up 5% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven by new business, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation. On a sequential basis the impacts of new business and favorable markets were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. ","Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $10.9 trillion at quarter end, up 7% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was primarily driven by new business and favorable markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable moves in currency and exchange rates.","Recall that lagged market values factor into the quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees. Investment management fees in C&IS of $115 million in the second quarter were up 6% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performances were driven by new business and favorable markets",". ","Assets under management for C&IS clients were $901 billion, up 3% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business, and an increase in securities lending collateral levels, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. The sequential increase was primarily driven by sequential growth in securities lending collateral levels and favorable markets, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.","Securities lending fees were $20 million in the third quarter, down 17% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower spreads. Securities lending collateral was $170 billion at quarter end and averaged $176 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 4% year-over-year and were up 7% sequentially.","Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $460 million in the third quarter, and were up 4% compared to the prior year quarter and up 2% sequentially. Assets under management were $300 billion at quarter end, up 2% both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. The year-over-year and sequential performances for both fees and AUM were drive by a combination of new business and favorable markets. ","Moving to page six, net interest income was $425 million in the third quarter, up 2% year-over-year. Earning assets averaged $105 billion in the quarter, down 7% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged $89 billion and were down 5% versus the prior year. Interest bearing deposits declined 2% from one year ago to $72 billion. ","Non-interest bearing deposits which averaged $17 billion during the quarter were down 14% from one year ago. Loan balances averaged $31 billion in the quarter and were down 3% compared to one year ago. The net interest margin was 1.61% in the third quarter, and was up 14 basis points from a year ago. ","The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects a balance sheet mix shift, the impact of lower foreign exchange swap volume and the impact of higher short-term interest rates versus one year ago. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was flat. Average earning assets declined 1% on a sequential basis and deposit levels were down slightly from the prior quarter. On a sequential basis, the net interest margin remained flat. ","Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the third quarter U.S. dollar deposits represented 69% of our total deposits. This is flat versus one year ago and up from 67% in the prior quarter.","Turning to page seven, expenses were $1 billion in the third quarter and were 3% higher than both the prior year and sequentially. The impact of favorable moves and currency translation benefited expense by almost 1 percentage point on a year-over-year basis. ","Compensation expense totaled $458 million and was up 5% compared to one year ago. The year-over-year growth was primarily relating to higher salaries driven by staff growth and base pay adjustments, partially offset by the impact of favorable currency translation. On a sequential basis compensation was up 1%. ","Staff levels increased 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The majority of staff growth continues to be attributable to staff increases and lower cost attrition, which include India, Manila, Limerick, Ireland and Tempe, Arizona. ","Employee benefit expense of $88 million was up 2% from one year ago and was down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven primarily by higher payroll withholding in medical costs, while the sequential decline was primarily due to lower withholding costs, partially offset by higher medical costs. ","Outside services costs of $194 million were up 4%, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher technical services consulting and legal expense, partially offset by lower sub-custody expense. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher technical services, which had included a $6 million vendor credit in the prior quarter, as well as higher third party adviser, consulting legal expense, partially offset by lower sub-custody expense. ","Equipment and software expense of $152 million was up 4% from one year ago and was up 3% sequentially, both the year-over-year and sequential growth was driven by higher maintenance and support costs and higher depreciation and amortization costs. The year-over-year growth was partially offset by higher software disposition costs in the prior year. ","Other operating expense of $92 million was down 5% from one year ago and up 20% sequentially. The decline from a year ago was primarily relating to lower FDIC premiums. The sequential increase was driven by higher business promotional spend, primarily associated with the Northern Trust Golf Tournament which was held during the quarter.","As we have discussed on previous calls, through our value for spend initiative which we started 2017, we have been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. We continue to embed a sustainable expense management approach. ","Our third quarter results reflect approximately $56 million in expense savings, reducing the year-over-year expense growth rate by approximately 2.5 points. This will equate to approximately $225 million on an annualized basis against the $250 million. ","Turning the page eight, our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns. This slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio, pre-tax margin and ultimately our return on equity. The ratio of expense to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control. We remain focused on continuing to drive organic growth in our business and managing our expenses to improve our efficiency and productivity.","Turning to page nine, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.9% under the standardized approach and 13.7% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7.6% and at the bank was 7.0%, both of which exceeded the 3% minimum requirement. ","As Northern Trust progresses through fully phased-in Basal III implementation, there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of final rule, which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final Basel III rules.","During the third quarter we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock at a cost of $307 million. We also increased our quarterly dividend to $0.70 per share. These two actions combined represented a payout ratio of approximately 125% for the quarter. ","In closing, Northern Trust performed well in the third quarter. Our 4% year-over-year growth rate for both Trust investment and other servicing fees and total revenue compared to our 3% growth and expense generated positive fee and total operating leverage. Our results produced a pre-tax margin of 33.4% and a return on average common equity of 14.9%. ","Our balanced business model continues to generate organic growth and we remain focused on providing our clients with exceptional services, improving our productivity and driving profitable growth. ","On a personal note, I just want to offer a quick thank you. As recently announced, I will be stepping down from my role as CFO effective January 1, and retire from the Northern Trust on February 28. I've enjoyed my five-plus years as CFO and working with each one of you. ","Jason Tyler who is currently the CFO of our Wealth Management Business will become CFO as of the first of the year. I wish Jason the very best as he takes on this new role and I am confident he will be very successful in that role. ","Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust third quarter earnings conference call today. Mark and I would be happy to answer your questions. Hanna, please open the line. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Yes sir, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll now take a question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Glenn Schorr","Hey, thanks very much. A question on net interest margin. This comes up in conversation and I don't know if this is even a good way to look at it, so I want to throw it to you. If you look at you versus your peers, you NIM is highest relative to prior cycle lows when rates were near zero versus peers. Now I don't think we're even going towards zero rates, to zero rates, but whatever. Do you think that is an okay way to even evaluate things and (b) if so, what do you think explains that? It's just that your durations are a little longer than it used to. I\u2019m just curious on what you think has changed in the mix to \u2013 that you would have been able to sustain that better? ","Biff Bowman","That our NIM is higher than other peers, that's your question? ","Glenn Schorr","Versus prior cycle lows. In other words, where everybody bottomed out when rates were zero, you\u2019re in the range of like 37, 40 basis points above that. Others are like a lot closer to it now. ","Biff Bowman","I believe that's probably the mix of our clients and the mix of our balance sheet is probably the difference there. (NYSE:A) Our retail deposits and our wealth business make up a greater proportion of our balance sheet. You've got to look at a mix between our on \u2013 foreign office deposits and U.S. deposits and then the loan portfolio relative to the size and I know it's been flat for us, but all of those combined, I think produce a slightly different net interest margin versus peers, because we are not absolutely the same and look and feel as all of those. So I would say that it\u2019s probably a difference in the mix of the balance sheet that lends itself to that.","Because on the institutional side, the pricing is competitive, so we would likely have deposit costs of a similar nature, but we have a little bit bigger piece of what I would call the wealth side of the business and I think that may help mute the lows. ","Glenn Schorr","And maybe just a follow-up. As you look forward, there's a lot of puts and takes on deposit betas as not being as close to 100% as everybody hoped they would be on the way down. But you know knowing what we know today with forwards and what's expected in terms of rates, just how do you help us think about next year and beyond given all those puts and takes around the NIM. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, I think you have to probably pull our balance sheet apart a little bit to understand the beta. So if you look at for instance on the retail side of our deposit beta, the beta would look low-ish. But we had some, the discontinuation of our anchor suite and we had promotional pricing so the beta would be quite low on that. ","If you look at the foreign office deposits and remember, about half of the foreign office deposits are in dollars, but if you look at the move down and then extrapolate well, how much of that was dollars, the beta was actually quite high. ","I would say the beta was relatively symmetrical with what we saw on the way, where we were as we have rates rising. So it's coming down I think in general along that rate. It\u2019s a little cloudier to see this quarter because of some of the promotional things we had in the wealth space and others that work themselves through at the end of the third quarter and we would anticipate a more symmetrical beta for that in the fourth quarter, but I think if you look at that, the beta was actually fairly high on what I would call institutional dollar based deposit. ","Glenn Schorr","Awesome! Thanks so much Biff. ","Biff Bowman","Thanks. ","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. ","Biff Bowman","Hi Brian. ","Brian Bedell","Hey Biff, and congrats and best of luck. The question is on the net interest income. Obviously the NIM was better than we thought. Can you talk about the drivers on the short term side of the balance sheet? So the asset yields on the short side seem to be down less than we would have thought maybe and talk about the resiliency of that and sort of how should we think about that you know going into the fourth quarter? ","Biff Bowman","I hope that was your phone breaking up there, I couldn't tell if that was you or us. Can you hear us okay, your phone broke up. ","Brian Bedell","Yeah. [Cross Talk] Can you hear me better now? ","Biff Bowman","I can, yes, sorry about that. ","Brian Bedell","Did you hear my question?","Biff Bowman","You wanted to know about, I think it was around the short term. Can you repeat it for everybody? ","Brian Bedell","Yeah sure, the yields on a short term side of the balance sheet, on the asset side seem to go down less than we had thought, so I just wondered if you could talk about some resiliency in that relative to short term rates basically. And then is there a catch up coming in the fourth quarter, you know assuming we have obviously an October Fed cut? ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, so if you think about that on the rates and the resiliency, one you still have to remember that our rates are lapping a period where in general a year ago they are higher today than they were a year ago, so that's part of it. And then if you look at the sequential resiliency or how that would hold up, I think there's probably a series of factors in there in the asset yield. ","One is, we've extended some of the duration in our portfolio, which I think has helped mitigate some of that across those yields. Currency mix and other things can help mitigate some of the currency yield impact that you see across the portfolio and then just a variety of investment strategies that we have and the instruments we have and held up pretty well cross the short term end of the portfolio. ","We got more in securities than we do sort of shorter duration, money market type bank rates at this point, so all of those have held up. And then lastly I\u2019d add is, from our own projections, from where we thought we would have in the quarter, the spread between LIBOR and Fed funds was actually a little bit better, even though it compressed our own projections, it didn't compress as much as perhaps we had forecasted.","In terms of the fourth quarter, I think you had asked, you know are we just storing this up for the fourth quarter. I think perhaps it might be beneficial if we give you a quick thought on the fourth quarter as we move in. Right now we would suggest that \u2013 and there is obviously a lot of puts and takes in the fourth quarter yet to come, but if we assume one cut from the Federal Reserve this month, we would think that our net interest income would be down approximately 1% to 3% sequentially. ","So while there is still pressure on the asset yields and sensitivity to that, we still think it\u2019s relatively modest in terms of its impact sequentially. There is obviously a lot of underlying assumptions in the forecast and we're going to give you an update on that in December as we see the size of the balance sheet and other factors being much more clear two months into the quarter and in fact whether we get a hike or not, we\u2019ll obviously be in there, but that 1% to 3% is off of the $425 million we had this quarter and it assumes one cut in October. ","Mark Bette ","And Brian, this is Mark. Just to add one comment. When you are really looking at the real short end on the balance sheet for the short term, let\u2019s call it interest bearing deposits, so that would be the interest bearing deposits with banks, the Central Bank Deposits, the mix of U.S. currency within that, let\u2019s call it money market kind of category is actually more like a third of the total. So the lower U.S. rates will not have as much of a drag when you're looking at the very short end of the balance sheet for those line items. ","Brian Bedell","Right, right, so the geographic diversification definitely helps you. Great and then just on expenses, your most of the way through the program, another $25 million. I know you\u2019ve said in the past this is going to be an ongoing effort. So just on the third quarter, I think expenses were up 3% sequentially versus the 2% revenue, but was that all due to the Northern Trust open and related expense and then going forward are we still in that position where you are trying to achieve expense growth, you know at a pace that is higher than your organic revenue growth, and maybe if you want to just comment on organic revenue growth in the quarter. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, so the last part of your question is our thinking. We still are having our organic growth rate provide if you will as the governor over the organic expense growth rate that the firm should, and tends to stay in to produce that. The Northern Trust on a sequential basis drives about half of the growth rate of expenses, maybe a little less than that, but in the vicinity of about half of that, so you can take about half of the growth rate out, because of sort of the one-time seasonal event. ","But probably more important to your question was around the organic expense growth rates that we're seeing. Again, in line I think with generally in line with our organic expense growth rate we've done a good job of getting the organic growth rate in the firm and the organic expense growth rate in the firm better aligned and that continues to be an internal target and goal that we strive to get those very much in line. ","If we see organic growth slow, then we try to do as quick as we can to increase the pace of saves in our expense base to achieve that organic leverage or at least organic neutrality and we are trying to get organic leverage. ","Lastly I think you asked about our organic trends in the quarter. Again, on the fee side we saw good new business, good growth and generally in the ranges we\u2019ve talked about or at the near the ranges we talked about and so you know I think you kind of see that from our numbers and the growth rate is outstripping markets and it's pretty strong versus the competitors and a lot of that is organically driven.","Brian Bedell","And that's about mid-single digit pace in terms of organic growth is that correct? ","Biff Bowman","I think we\u2019ve talked about four to five range. ","Brian Bedell","Yeah exactly. ","Biff Bowman","Over time, I think we've explained to you in the past we have years that it's three, we have years that\u2019s its five and we\u2019ve tried to circle that range. It's in that, what you want to call that, low to mid-single digit ranges, that\u2019s where we are tracking. I think you could back market out and currency out and probably get there in your own analytics. ","Brian Bedell","Yes, perfect! Thank you very much. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Biff Bowman","Hi Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey, thanks a lot and best of luck Biff. Can I ask a couple of just clean up ones? Can you help us understand the amount that the BOLI increase in both NII and fees, what the visa expense was, and if there was any change in premium memorization sequentially? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","Yeah, I got to write those down to make sure we get all those. The BOLI impact in the third quarter probably reduced net interest income by about $7 million, but it produced $9 million or so in other income, and then it has a tax benefit too. It helps the tax rate by approximately two-tenths of a percent.","A - Mark Bette","And that was about half reflected in the prior quarter Ken, so if you are looking at it sequentially, we picked up another about $4.5 million on other operating income and we had a drag of call it $3.5 million on the NII side sequentially. ","A - Biff Bowman","So you wanted BOLI, Ken?","Ken Usdin","Yeah, the visa and if there was any change in premium Am. ","Biff Bowman","Yes, on visa, on a year-over-year basis the mark for visa was pretty comparable. It was actually I think slightly lower this year. On a sequential basis the mark on visa was up just a little under $7 million sequentially and that was driven by \u2013 you know the factors that we evaluate are the visa stock price, the time to maturity of the litigation and then our ownership interest in that or the conversion factors. Those can move from time to time and so it was a\u2026","Mark Bette","It was a $7 million this quarter, but $3 million last quarter. $7 million was the number, but yeah, so for us its $4 million. Sequential was a $4 million increase. It was $7 million in total in the quarter and a $4 million increase sequentially and year-over-year roughly flat. ","Ken Usdin","Understood! Thank you, and then just last\u2026 [Cross Talk] yeah, good ahead, just go ahead. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, so with the premium amortization for us, we've given you guys a range of 10 to 12. Our portfolio, it has a series of exposures to Jenny Mae, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae exposures that by and large have a larger concentration of security to have structural attributes for the loan balances that help minimize prepay variability. So we don't see maybe as much as you might see across other portfolios where you've seen maybe greater movement. It's just the nature of the instruments we hold in our securities portfolio. ","So that range is still \u2013 we can see it maybe widen a little bit. We might see it move closer to between 8 and 12 then back, but generally we trade continually in that range and it hasn't been I think a market impact in terms of this impact on our NII. So hopefully that explains it. ","I know intuitively you may have thought that you would see some pick up in that, but the nature of the portfolio we have and some of the features of that portfolio still tended to be keeping the amortization in a band that is generally in line with what we've guided you guys to. ","Ken Usdin","Got it, alright. Thanks for all that Biff. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Biff Bowman","Hi Alex. ","Alex Blostein ","Hey Biff, hey Mark! Congrats on the retirement as well. A real quick on NIR, thanks for the update there. I guess if I look at the size of the balance sheet and your guidance, what do you guys sort of contemplate there for Q4? So in others words, like the balance sheet kind of stays flattish. Is that the idea? ","And then if the bulk of the decline is really driven by the NIM contraction sequentially, if we sort of look at LIBOR effect on spread in the quarter so far and you kind of look at the forecast, it actually looks to widen. It was flattish for the last couple of quarters. Now it looks like sort of a positive spread of about 20 basis points. Is it crazy to think that the NIM could actually be a little bit better than what you guys are contemplating because of this wider dynamic between LIBOR and capped [ph] on spread? Thanks. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, so Alex what I would say is we've made an assumption about that spread that you just talked about. The indicators would be that it could widen out wider than our forecast. So if that holds true, your comment about our assessment of the balance sheet is generally right about the size of it and if that spread turns out to be closer to what you described, which is what the markets are indicating, we'll compare that to what we forecast and to your point, that would probably lead to a little higher NIM. ","So could there be upside variability? There could, but there are an awful lot of variables, that's why we\u2018ll give you guidance at the Goldman Sachs conference in December where we\u2019ll have a lot greater line of sight into the quarter. ","Alex Blostein ","Totally, that all makes sense. And then my follow-up around expenses a little bit again and sort of you know bigger picture, maybe beyond this year, but as you guys are kind of coming close to the end of the 250 program, are there additional areas of savings that you can help us sort of ring fence as we think about sort of the levers you can pull on to make sure that beyond 2019 the expense growth remains kind of in this, I guess low to mid-single digit range as you try to align that with organic fee growth. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, there certainly are and there\u2019s programs underway and I think it's important as we\u2019ve talked. We really are embedding a discipline here of when we look at our expenses of looking at it and I\u2019ll call it four categories: ","One is, we need a certain amount of expense growth to support the type of organic revenue growth we\u2019ve talked about, so some of that is just needed. So we got that factored in. We've got inflations in our business that comes about. You can put your own inflation factor on that. We add that to that amount needed to grow our business and then we've got investment, and when you add all of that up, I will tell you that generally adds up to greater than the organic growth rate that we see for fees. ","So we are driving \u2013 there has to be productivity baked into any expense planning that will drive us back to that organic leverage on that and so there has to be productivity of some level, probably at least equal to inflation, to make our business model work. So whether we call it value for spend or 714 where there\u2019s that level of expense driver in our business. ","To tie that into your question, are there still buckets or opportunities in the expense base and the answer is absolutely, and I would say there's still lots of areas of procurement that are \u2013 and we cited lower sub-custody expenses in the quarter, we've done some good work around our sub custody expense for instance in the quarter that's meaningfully changed some of the trajectory there from a procurement perspective. ","We still have many projects and capital investments that help drive automation and robotics into our business and we're doing one in our finance group as we speak right now, modest in size, but it's the type of thing that we think are still available to help drive those expenses down. So I think there's the opportunity to drive that productivity that's necessary in the model I outlined for you. ","Alex Blostein ","Got it, great! Thanks again. ","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. For the last year or so, deposit in interest earning asset growth has been you know a bit weaker versus organic growth trends. I realize partly you know the rate backdrop, but any other factors you know that are driving that and then what do you think could potentially you know shift you know maybe the demand by client? ","A - Biff Bowman","Well, I think the deposit growth has flattened out, your absolutely right or maybe even gone in a slight decline, but I think again you probably have to pull apart our businesses here a little bit. On the wealth side, some of the initiatives or the initiative we did around the discontinuation of our anchor sweep product has actually brought \u2013 if you look, go back to the first quarter, somewhere a little over $3 billion, $3.5 billion of deposits. It\u2019s actually probably slightly higher than that, but the part that's most visible that is seen on the balance sheet is probably a little over $3 billion, so we have grown that side. ","On the institutional side, I think we can see the type of variability you'll see there, particularly in foreign office deposits as a normal course of business. We've seen these cycles before as people maybe shift currency, they shift investment strategies, particularly in the reasonably volatile market. So we have seen some of that playing itself out in particularly the foreign office deposits, in the institution deposits where we\u2019ve seen that. ","We don't have feedback that it's a pricing related issue where our pricing is even not at market. We get that feedback pretty fast and pretty clearly from our clients, so it's not a pricing related item and it generally over time will grow with our organic growth rate. So I would say there's not any other, because what I will say is what you've seen is \u2013 I think you've seen the rundown of some of the \u2013 what were excess deposits or those things that were sitting here for rate related reasons. ","The second part of your question is what could change that trajectory? I would suggest it's early, but some of the actions the fed\u2019s taking now and if rates continue to be aggressively lower, as a general rule, the lower they get, the more likely we are to see balance sheet growth. That's what's happened historically. I don't know if that will play out the same way this time through, that would be speculation, but historically as quantitative easing or further easing moves, trust banks tend to be the recipients of balances. So that could drive growth at an outsized rate versus say organic growth.","Biff Bowman","And then Mike and Mark, if I could add one other thing. When you're looking at the deposit trends, one thing that isn't clear looking at it externally, if you were to look at the non U.S. office, deposits say on average as of the fourth quarter of last year compared to where we are now, three quarters later, a little bit more than half of that decline has actually been from some of the leveraging activity we do in our treasury group, so that\u2019s doing some short term borrowings. ","That will show up on the short term borrowing line, but it also shows up in the mix of when we go out and get wholesale deposits and the trade there has not been you know the spread that you can get on that his narrowed quite a bit, so we've actually kind of pulled back on some of that activity. So like I said, over the last three quarters when you look at average non U.S. office deposits, a little more than half of that decline has been lower leveraging activity. ","Q - Michael Carrier","Okay, it makes sense. And then just a small follow-up; the security commission revenues that came in stronger, I realize there's more volatility in the quarter, but I think you've also been investing in some of the areas of that offering. So just any color on what drove you know the increase this quarter? ","A - Mark Bette","Yeah, that's a good question. So it is \u2013 we\u2019ve talked here about for instance in our Oak Ridge business, the integrated trade solution where effectively we can take on the trading functionality of some of our clients who we may also have relationships with as a fund administrator or others and we've seen that grow meaningfully. The number of clients has grown meaningfully and it was a prime driver of that growth, so that line as you know is really made up of what I would say brokerage activity; it's made up of fees that we get around certain credit relationships that we have and it's made up of\u2026","Biff Bowman","So yeah, interest rate swaps.","Mark Bette","Interest rate swaps, excuse me.","Biff Bowman","Which also saw all three of those. ","Mark Bette","Thank you, I had to think of the third one there for a second. Interest rate swaps, all three of those saw growth in the quarter, but the two of those are more episodic in nature. Interest rate swaps are probably triggered by rate movements and I would say generally the brokerage business that we saw, some of that is client growth, not just activity in the market.","Biff Bowman","Yeah, when we look at it sequentially and we noted in the release that for brokerage activity, interest rate swaps and referral fees, it's probably one-third, one-third, one-third and certainly the last two of those are more episodic. Sometimes we have transition revenue that comes through that\u2019s a little bit more episodic too, although that was fairly comparable this quarter versus prior. ","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ","Biff Bowman","Hi Betsy.","Betsy Graseck ","Hi, good morning. Biff, I'm going to miss you. I really enjoyed our conversations over the years. ","Biff Bowman","I\u2019ll sit in the conference.","Betsy Graseck ","That will be great. Okay, well thanks so much for all the time and insights over the years. So a couple of other questions, a little bit of clean up and a little bit of strategy questions. So on the cleanup questions, you know the long term debt cost of funds coming down nicely, I'm assuming that's all swapped. Is that where we\u2019re seeing you know almost a lockstep with the rate cuts here and so as a result we should expect that to continue to move down. Is that an accurate statement? ","Biff Bowman","It is swapped, yes. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay, and then on the fed growing the balance sheet, I mean it's obviously been doing some temporary open market operations just recently going to the promos. You know I heard you said about the QE. Have you seen any benefit from this? I mean it's been about a month or so. ","A - Biff Bowman","I would say not; we have not seen any extraordinary size flows from that at this point. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s still pretty early would be my intuition. It's pretty early to see and hopefully in a couple of months we will have a better line of sight to that, but right now I would say no, we\u2019ve not seen any impact. ","Betsy Graseck ","Okay, and then just lastly, a little bit more strategic question, but you know we talked a little bit about how you're investing in a variety of different technologies to improve your own processes, as well as in some areas of \u2013 because they were growing more rapidly. I wanted to understand the rationale for transferring the private equity block chain technology platform to broad-ridge. You know how is that enhancing your strategic, you know focus and drive. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, at that point in time I think we felt that the distribution opportunities and the growth opportunities with Broadridge were just, better moved through their pipe if I can say that, than they were through ours. ","But we know we have a client base that helped us deliver that product and capability it\u2019s one that we think we can and have commercialized inside our own group, but the ability to grow that I think more assertively through Broadridge was really beneficial for everything. Mark do you have anything else? I think that's the best color, it was the best commercial decision for us and that's what we decided on. ","Betsy Graseck ","But your focus on using block chain technology or you either utilizing it or enabling if for your clients is still intact, is that accurate even though you transferred this? ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, for sure. ","Betsy Graseck ","Because you\u2019re a user of their platform, right.","Biff Bowman","Yeah sure, and I want to be clear that was just one application as it related sort of to all fit the private equity field for using it and much broader applications in just that field. But that was one where we thought there would be perhaps a commercialization that would be better enhanced through that vehicle, in ownership structure than directly owned by us, but we are using it in a variety of other type of clearing and product capabilities for clients. ","Betsy Graseck ","Thank you. ","Biff Bowman","Thanks. ","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Biff Bowman","Hi Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning, and Biff congrats on your retirement, wish you the best. I\u2019m sure the golf game will improve and you'll get tickets to the Northern Open in the future. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, it's got a lot of room to improve Brennan. ","Brennan Hawken","Tell me about it. So on NII, just circling back there, thanks for all the color on that, I really appreciate it. Curious about a couple of different components. Number one, when we look at the forward curve, it looks like the forward curve suggests also a cut in December and so I know that will be late in the quarter, so probably wouldn\u2019t have a big impact on 4Q. ","But should we count on an impact, a comparable impact going forward or are your assumptions around beta such that further cuts beyond the next one will have an increasing impact, because you would be getting a little bit lower on the deposit cost side and therefore less room on that front. Just any additional color you could give there would be great.","Biff Bowman","Okay, so I'll try to peel that apart a little bit. So December cut would have nominal fourth quarter impact, you're right on that, but it wouldn't have zero impact. I want to be clear and that's why we gave a range earlier, because it depends on the pricing start to anticipate that earlier than the actual cut itself and you know how that works. ","In terms of the impacts in the 2020, we're not going to give guidance out to 2020 at this point, there are just so many variables to that. But that being said, I think we talked about the beta as we think being relatively symmetrical, and I think we think that's how it is, and they are as is you will pull apart. If you look again at the institutional dollar betas, they were pretty high and that's where they were on the way up, they were pretty high now. ","I think they would have some symmetry on the way down, so they would probably start to pull back a little bit. I don't know if that's with one or two or three hikes. I know it would be speculation. I don't know where that point of symmetry sort of hits, but I think we would just sort of model something that looks relatively symmetrical from what we saw all the way up. ","Brennan Hawken","Okay so and just to clarify, like on the way up we saw the ramp in betas steadily increase and so therefore you guys are starting high and then would you see in the mirror of that, so betas would decrease. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, so I think Brennan if we go back, if you remember the betas were quite low for several hikes, and then the curve starts to steepen, right, through all the symmetry around that. So perhaps the betas are quite high for some period and then start to come down. ","I just don't know is that one hike away, is that two hikes away or excuse me, one cut, two cut or three cuts away, I don't \u2013 that would be speculating, I don\u2019t want to do that, but I think it\u2019s a symmetrical look to way they float on the way up, and then the flow down. ","Brennan Hawken","Okay, got it. That\u2019s clear and totally logical. My next question is on the excess reserves commentary. Just curious, it seemed like Northern didn't really get hurt, especially versus some of the larger Trust Bank competitors when reserves were getting drained from the system. So I'm kind of curious as to why you would think the inverse would happen, you know why would your benefit with an expansion of reservists, especially relative to some of the larger competitors? Thanks. ","Biff Bowman","I think as a general rule, as the rates gets closer \u2013 I think this is your question as the rates you know pull back down closer and closer to zero, because we are an asset servicing provider to $11 trillion of assets under custody and administration, we because somewhat of a natural home for what I will say our cash balances that may be in different but want a very financially strong liquid provider. ","So there's just some natural benefit of that. The tide floating all boats kid of things, like that and coming with it, and so you\u2019ve got large hedge fund clients or others who say I'm in different now through a series of investment options. ","I will say this time Brennan what I think is different is money market reform has happened and government funds and things like gates and another things that were in place, some of those things have been addressed in money market reforms. So the ability to have those bounces not sit on any bank balance sheet that go through a fund, so they can get paid roughly zero and a financial institution or get paid roughly zero on a fund. They may consider that more than they have in past, cycles were rates have gone well. ","So we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out and depends on how low areas get. I think the rates have to get lower than one or two more cuts before we would see that kind of impact. It would have to be something that gets back close to where we were, right after the crisis. ","Brennan Hawken","Thanks for the color Biff and good luck on the golf course. ","Biff Bowman","Thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.","Biff Bowman","Hi Brian. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Hi, good afternoon or good morning still. A quick question on the comp expense. So you said it was up and staffing was up 1% quarter-on-quarter. If you look back the past couple of years, you will see an uptick 4Q to 3Q as well in comp expense. Is there any reason to think that would be the same case this year?","Biff Bowman","So, I\u2019d have to look to see. I mean there may have been \u2013 there is some incentive compensation that\u2019s verbal. A some point in the fourth quarter that might be driven by how pretax income goes. ","As far as the comp sequentially this quarter, one thing that\u2019s definitely is different than prior years is that we and the prior years have had \u2013 we\u2019ve had I think last year I about $10 million of equity retirement eligible expense that was in the second quarter that fell off in the third quarter. We did not have that this year, all that was in the first quarter. So second to third this year is a different picture than what it would have been in 2017 and 2018. ","The other thing I would say about compensation as well, you know last quarter we did mention that we had charges of $5 million of charges, only $2 million of that was in compensation, about $3 million of it was in outside services.","We did have charges this quarter as well. Now we've gotten away from calling those out, because we think we're more in a business as usual environment with those charges, but I would say when you look at compensation, the charges this quarter, we are actually pretty comparable to what we had in the prior quarter and so that's another part. ","So if you were expecting a decline because of charge is going off, we did have some charges in the quarter. But like I said, until they \u2013 if they were to rise up again to a higher level certainly we\u2019ll call them out, but at this point we feel like it's more just business as usual activity. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Okay and then just a separate question. In C&IS is there any way to kind of give any color on what new business wins were the quarter, uninstalled pipeline, I know you kind of gravitated away from doing that in the past, but any type of color would be greatly appreciated? Thanks.","Biff Bowman","Yeah, you're right. We gravitated away from that and we don't provide that. I would say, we continue to see strong new business wins installed in the quarter. We continue to see a very solid and strong pipeline really across the globe, but particularly we\u2019ve seen real strong interest in the Asian market, in Australia in particular and a substantial win. I think we\u2019ve published \u2013 we did press release World Bank as a win, so that was a very high profile win that was issued in a press release in the quarter. ","So, we continue to have strong growth, and as we said, we really look at it more as an organic growth story for us across the fee line and we were pleased with where we were from a trajectory standpoint in the quarter. ","Brian Kleinhanzl","Alright. Thanks and best of luck Biff! ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.","Biff Bowman","Hi Jim ","Jim Mitchell","Good morning. Hey, maybe just one last kind of follow-up on NII and just thinking through, it seems to me that there's been pretty high betas in Europe. So just get kind of your view on if there are further cuts there, is that \u2013 you are actually liability sensitive in Europe or is it neutral? ","And then when I think about looking further out, do you haven\u2019t even talked about extending duration and offsets and things like that. Do you have any further kind of ability in the asset yield side to kind of offset some lower rates, given how sort of your balance sheet has been? ","Biff Bowman","Yeah, so in Europe you're right. On the euro in particular the beta was high and that can be both a factor as we moved obviously relatively high betas or very high beta with the euro move, and some of that could have been that our rate was actually attractive in that market and that we were catching up from the rate being slightly ahead of the market if you will or slightly better than the competitive landscape which could move that beta a little bit higher than perhaps even the move that you there. ","So that\u2019s a driver there, and then I think it's important to understand our client base. We have clients that are some are on standard rates and some that are on, I\u2019d call it more specialized rates, custom rates. ","Some of them moved immediately with sort of Central Bank rates, IOER, ECB. So they will move rally with almost a 100% beta right with those. ","In terms of the duration of the balance sheet, we moved the duration of the portfolio out to about 1.6 years from an index duration perspective, which as you know we typically have run a very short duration portfolio closer to one, 1.1, but we have done some things in light of what we think could be you know a continued decline in rates. And so we have moved that duration out in the portfolio to help soften some of that and help deal with asset yield issues that you talked about. ","Jim Mitchell","And is there room for that to do anything else to \u2013 whether you see duration out more or flip some of your cash into U.S. rates. That is from Europe how do you think about what you can do in your mix to help offset that pressure? ","Biff Bowman","So the answer to the first part of that is yes. That is a decision that our ALCO committee makes every month, but there is I think still room to take that duration out and for the benefit of the call, we're really not taking any credit risk in that duration. We typically extend the duration of our balance sheet through the use of longer dated treasuries, so that's the way we get there and we do. But we evaluate that through our co-committee regularly, but there is still capacity to take that duration out. ","In terms of swapping currencies you know into dollars or whatever to get the yield enhancement, you know the swap rates on that have made and the cost of doing that quite frankly have make that in many cases an unattractive trade, and we always have \u2013 excuse me, we have generally tried to invest largely in the currency, in currency in support of our clients and the balance sheet. So they've invested in euros, they'd laid the balance off in euros, the balances being euros or sterling, etcetera. But there are occasionally opportunities that can do that swap, but right now the swap rates could make a neutral [inaudible] action group. Yeah. ","Jim Mitchell","Great, thanks! ","Operator","We\u2019ll now move to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi. So I think I heard that value per spend is 90% done and that you're spending initiatives for revenues, inflation technology should outpace organic growth, therefore you need to find productivity savings, so got that. So under the category of productivity savings, what do you have in a way of potential technology dates? For example, how many data centers do you have? Where were they at peak? Where could that go or maybe want to measure that in terms of you know number of servers. ","You know moving to the cloud, what percent are you in, you're have to enable together a cloud, where are you know, where you would like to go? But just more generally what are the technology driven productivity savings that you could see going ahead, especially now that value for spend in the late stages. ","Biff Bowman","There's a lot to that question Mike. So you're right, so we have absolutely have an ongoing process to look at all the things you described in there. For instance number of data centers. We outsource the manage services for instance that we talked about here, where we have looked at things like our main frame maintenance and another that we\u2019ve used. There\u2019s opportunities to do that technologically with someone else at a lower cost. ","We are looking at very strategically with our board and our technology group is the cloud strategy for the firm. Not going to comment on this call, but that's something that is actively engaged with the board and others. So it's going to be the primary driver of our productivity. It has to be in the space of technology, because it's the largest part of our spend. ","So I know that's obvious to you Mike, but I mean if we don't get the kind of savings you talked about, the consolidating datacenters, cloud based solutions, etcetera. I will say we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of Mike is not running as many duplicative systems. I think we\u2019ve looked and consolidated across our organization and where we were running multiple applications to do similar services. ","I think we've done a pretty good job of consolidating that, although I know that we're still looking at the number of apps that we have if you will inside the firm and trying to maximize and reduce that. So probably the single largest effort we have right now is around understanding that technology spend and how we can drive that through productivity. ","Mike Mayo","Well, that helps you get useful contacts around that. Just one more time on specific numbers. I\u2019m not saying many do, but the number of apps that you have and the number of data centers that you have or at least what you mean when you mainframe maintenance move to like a third party, a data provider, a datacenter provider, are you thinking of using one of those? ","Biff Bowman","So the \u2013 for instance if we used a provider of that main frame, we had our own staff that did the upgrades and maintenance on that. There are firms who provide the hardware and other items for that mainframe who also have staff that can provide that maintenance. We\u2019ve done that instead of having our own staff, but that's a productivity pick up for us, because we had our own staff to do that and there's others who can do it for better cost advantages. So that's how I would describe that, is what that means.","Mike Mayo","Okay. Alright, thanks a lot. ","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a question from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.","Biff Bowman","Hey Rob. ","Rob Wildhack","Good morning guys. One more on organic growth and appreciate the commentary on the alignment of expenses and revenue growth there, but can you remind us on the level of organic growth where those two can start to decouple a little more and positive operating leverage would really start to show up? ","Biff Bowman","Could you ask that one more time, I want to make sure I follow that? ","Rob Wildhack","Yeah, I think you're talking about aligning expense growth and organic revenue growth and so I'm wondering if there's a given level of revenue growth where, the expense growth might not need to stay as closely in line and you can really see some operating leverage. ","Biff Bowman","Yeah okay. I don't know exactly where that point would be, but in general in our two businesses it could be a little bit different. So in our asset servicing business for instance, there is a required level of expense to generate probably every point of organic growth. Right now for most of that it depends on which business line. If it's traditional custody that's highly leverage, there\u2019s less expense needed; if it's fund administration, fund accounting, it needs more expense, it has a little bit more, I\u2019d say a larger expense base that needs to go with it. ","In the wealth space, pretty highly leveraged there. So the expense required to grow that point of organic growth there could be different. So I think that's what you're asking, is if we could get continued growth? ","I don't know that there's ever a point where the expense growth stops and the organic revenue continues. I think there's always a piece of that that's needed to get that through that, but there is certain lines of businesses that are more leverage able than others that widen that gap out and we\u2019ve had great success in some of those lines. Particularly wealth has had a strong growth rate that you can see in their line versus their industry and their competitors. ","Rob Wildhack","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. ","Biff Bowman","Thanks ","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions. So we would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. ","Biff Bowman","Thanks everyone. "]}}
