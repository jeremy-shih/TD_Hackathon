Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jasmine, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, to Mr. Mark Smith, Executive Director, Investor Relations. You may proceed.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Jasmine. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; and our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future.","Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because there are a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with the copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","With that out of the way, we'll begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Well, as my first teleconference as Chief Executive, I'm conscious of my now retired boss' parting piece of advice which is, don't screw it up.","I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, and then I'll also talk about our outlook for 2012. Pat will then take you through more details of the fourth quarter financial performance and our current forecast for the year.","We delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter, finishing off an outstanding year for the company. Revenues for the fourth quarter were $4.9 billion, an increase of 19% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a new quarterly record. Fourth quarter EBIT, excluding onetime items, was $677 million, an increase of 25% over the same quarter last year, continuing our trend of increasing profits faster than sales. Including onetime items, EBIT was $768 million. ","All 4 businesses reported higher sales than Q4 2010, and the Engines, Components and Distribution businesses all reported record sales in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter EBIT percent was 13.8% with the Engine and Components businesses delivering significant improvement from a year ago. The Distribution and Power Gen businesses had declines in EBIT percent from a year ago due to currency, commodity costs and a number of onetime items that we do not expect to repeat. As a result, we expect to see margins improve in both businesses in the first half of 2012.","For the full year, Cummins sales topped $18 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year, which is terrific performance given the economic uncertainty in a number of regions in 2011. Our revenues have grown a total of the 67% over the last 2 years, and we ended 2011 with revenues 26% above our pre-recession peak.  Full year EBIT margin, excluding special items, reached 14.2% in 2011 and was also a new annual record. All 4 businesses delivered double-digit EBIT margins for the year, with the Engine and Components businesses delivering record EBIT percent. In addition to strong revenues and profits, we also had a solid cash flow performance in 2011. Cash from operations totaled $2.1 billion, driven by both our strong earnings results and improvement in our working capital efficiency.","Our strong cash flow performance has allowed us to continue to fund our investments in future growth, while increasing returns to shareholders. We increased our dividend by 52% in the third quarter and repurchased 6.4 million shares during 2011. Our strong performance was also recognized by all 3 major credit rating agencies, with all 3 upgrading our rating during the year.","Before I turn to our outlook for 2012, I'd like to make a few comments about some of our key markets in 2011. Let me start with North America.","Our revenues in North America grew 50% in 2011. The North American heavy-duty truck market reached approximately 230,000 units in 2011, an increase of 77% over 2010 levels. Working very closely with our key OEMs and supply chain partners, we were able to quickly ramp up shipments of our heavy-duty engines while increasing our full year market share to 38%.  Fourth quarter shipments of 15-liter engines to the U.S. and Canada were just 14 engines short of our all-time record. Total 15-liter shipments to all markets globally did reach a new record.","The U.S. medium-duty truck market size reached approximately 98,000 units in 2011, an increase of almost 40%. We maintained our leadership position in 2011 with market share above 50% for the fourth quarter and the full year, and we ended the year with very encouraging order trends. As we approach the launch of our engines for EPA 2010, we said that it would take 18 to 24 months for the market to assess the different technologies and competitive offerings. We were confident in our technology then, and now, 24 months later, we are delighted with the strong customer acceptance of our products. We believe that our market position demonstrates that we delivered on our promise to provide significant fuel economy benefits, while meeting the toughest performance and emission standards in the world. In addition to delivering industry-leading fuel economy, our engines are proving to be extremely reliable. And our warranty costs, as a percentage of sales in 2011, were the lowest we have experienced in more than 15 years.","We take a long-term approach to our technology development to ensure that we deliver the right technology to the market. For example, 10 years ago this month, we announced the formation of our Emission Solutions business to develop after-treatment products, well ahead of market demand for the technology. This business has been a key enabler to the success of our Engine business and now has leading market share in the U.S. and Europe, achieving revenues of more than $1.2 billion in 2011. Today, we have shipped over 209,000 engines equipped with our Selective Catalytic Reduction or SCR systems, and customer feedback continues to be extremely positive. ","Our international revenues increased by 27% in 2011. We achieved record full year revenues in Australia, in China, India, Latin America and Russia. We received a lot of questions over the past few months about market conditions in China and India. In China, demand softened in construction markets in the fourth quarter, while sales of truck engines improved modestly from third quarter levels. As a point of reference, during 2011, the truck market in China for heavy- and medium-duty trucks combined declined 9% to just under 1.2 million units, still 3.5x the size of the U.S. market. Our market share in 2011 in China was 11%. The excavator market in China continued to weaken in the fourth quarter, although the full year market size of 174,000 units was 5% higher than 2010 and this still remains the largest single market for construction equipment.  Across all construction segments, our market share reached 13% in 2011.","The market for Power Generation equipment increased 25% in 2011, driven in part by power shortages in the country. Our revenue increased by 40% over 2010 levels. In the fourth quarter, demand for Power Generation equipment came in a little ahead of our third quarter guidance, offsetting weaker demand for excavators. Full year revenues from our China operations, including joint ventures, reached $3.7 billion in 2011, an increase of 21% year-over-year and in line with the guidance we gave during the third quarter earnings call.","In India, the truck market remained strong all year, with the industry sales growing by 12% to 370,000 units. Our market share reached 44% in the fourth quarter. As expected, our sales of Power Generation equipment declined in the fourth quarter in India, although new order intake has already started to improve. Full year revenues from our India operations overall, including joint ventures, were $2.3 billion, also up 21%.","Now I would like to provide our overall outlook for 2012 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are currently forecasting total company revenue growth of 10% in 2012, and we expect EBIT to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% of sales. This would represent good progress towards our 2015 goals of reaching $30 billion in sales and 18% EBIT.","In North America, we expect strong demand to continue in 2012 in a number of end markets. We expect that the market size for heavy-duty trucks will increase 21% to 278,000 units, and the medium-duty truck market is expected to grow 25% to 117,000 units.","Mining and oil and gas markets are expected to remain strong, with OEMs reporting stronger order backlogs. Shipments of our engines for the Dodge Ram pickup are expected to grow by more than 10%. Power Generation revenues are expected to grow by 20% in North America, driven by data center demand, improving nonresidential construction and the launch of some new products.","We expect our consolidated revenues in Latin America will decline by approximately 6% next year. The decline in revenues is driven by an expected 5% decline in the Brazilian truck market and the impact of the MAN engine transition that we discussed during our third quarter earnings call. Growth in the Components and Power Generation businesses will partially offset the decline in on-highway engine revenues.","In China, we expect domestic revenues to be flat in 2012, with demand for construction equipment and trucks projected to be stronger in the second half of the year than the first. For the full year, we expect the truck market, heavy and medium combined, to be down 5% from 2011 and the excavator market to be about flat year-over-year.","Inflation concerns appear to be moderating in China, and there's a growing expectation that the government will start to ease monetary policy, which would be a positive move for our end markets. Demand for Power Generation equipment and mining engines remain strong, and we expect good growth in engines for oil and gas applications in 2012.","In India, the market for commercial vehicles remained strong throughout 2011, and we expect the commercial vehicle market size to grow a further 7% in 2012 to 398,000 units. Order trends for Power Generation have improved recently. And after relatively soft first quarter, we now expect 2012 revenues to grow by 10% driven by continued government investment in infrastructure.","Inflation concerns in India also appear to be moderating. We do not have a clear picture of full year 2012 demand patterns across our end markets in Europe. Our current expectation is that our full year revenues in Europe may be down 5% year-over-year, with demand for trucks and construction equipment expected to decline. We do expect to some segments in end markets such as mining and Power Generation in Russia to show good growth. In 2011, our European revenues accounted for less than 15% of total company revenues, and we have very limited exposure to Southern Europe.","We expect -- we continue to make progress in the execution of our growth strategy in Africa. In 2011, our revenues grew by 49%. For 2012, we expect to generate growth of further 30%, driven by -- primarily by our Power Generation and Distribution businesses in Africa.","Cummins delivered good performance in 2011, and we continue to benefit from our leadership position in a number of end markets and geographies. As we have discussed, we have plans in place to generate continued strong growth, and we remain focused on further improving profitability across our businesses. None of this would have been possible without the commitment of our customers and partners, and I would like to personally thank them for their confidence in Cummins. I would also like to thank all of our employees around the world for their dedication and hard work in 2011. I want to give special recognition to the Cummins employees in our manufacturing plants, parts and logistics operations and our supply chain organizations, whose dedication enabled us to meet rapidly growing customer demand in several regions and end markets.","Now I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our 2011 performance and 2012 guidance in more detail.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The results which we are reporting today represent the best year in our company's history in terms of revenue, profitability and operating cash flow. We experienced strong growth across all 4 business segments and in every major region. In fact, the company saw record revenue in the U.S., China, India and Brazil, which represents a significant achievement when we consider the uncertain macroeconomic environment that we faced in 2011.","Full year revenues for the company were $18 billion, an increase of 36% over the prior year. Earnings before interest and tax, excluding the gains from the divestiture of 2 businesses and from the flood insurance settlement, increased 54% in the year to over $2.5 billion or 14.3% of sales, up from 12.5% in the previous year. Net income was $1.85 billion or $9.55 per share. Excluding the gains from the divestiture of the 2 businesses and from the flood insurance settlement, net earnings were $1.75 billion or $9.07 a share, up from $1 billion or $5.28 a share in 2010.","We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, with revenues of $4.9 billion, 19% higher than the previous year and 6% higher than the third quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by stronger demand from on-highway markets in North America and Brazil, in construction and Power Generation markets in China, as well as in oil and gas and mining markets globally. Compared to the prior quarter, we benefited from growth in the heavy-duty truck market in North America, increased shipments to Chrysler and Power Generation demand in North America and in Latin America, offsetting the lower demand in China and India and the negative impact of currency as the U.S. dollar strengthened.","Gross margins for the quarter were 25.2% of sales, up from 23.8% last year due to better operating leverage, lower product coverage cost improved price realization. Sequentially, the margins decreased 0.5  points from the third quarter's record level, primarily the result of a lower mix of aftermarket products, unfavorable currency movement and some one-off costs are not expected to repeat. Selling, admin and research and development costs increased compared to both the prior year and the prior quarter, primarily due to additional spending on research and development and on our strategic growth initiatives.","Joint venture income was $101 million, 12% higher than last year and on par with the prior quarter. The improvement over the prior year was driven by the North American Distribution business and increased earnings at Tata Cummins in India. Earnings before interest and tax, excluding the gain on the sale of the Light Duty Filtration business and the flood insurance settlement, increased 25% to $677 million or 13.8% of sales, up from 13.1% last year and on par with the prior quarter.","Currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on earnings for the company in total. Net earnings for the quarter were $548 million or $2.86 a share. Excluding the onetime items mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter net earnings were $491 million or $2.56 a share, which included a lower tax rate of 22.8% as a result of certain discrete tax adjustments that we booked in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to the operating segments. Let me highlight their performance in the year and in the fourth quarter and conclude with the revenue and profitability expectations for each of them in 2012.","Starting in the Engine segment, full year sales were $11.3 billion, up 43% from last year. EBIT increased 71% to $1.4 billion or 12.2% of sales, compared to 10.3% of sales last year. Fourth quarter revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 23% over last year and 4% over the prior quarter. Stronger demand for on-highway engines in North America, as well as for oil and gas and mining engines offset weaker demand in China for construction equipment. Segment EBIT margins were 12% in the quarter compared to 10.3% last year and 11.8% in the third quarter. Compared to the prior year, stronger volume and higher joint venture income more than offset additional investment in research and development.","In 2012, we expect 10% revenue growth in this segment as a result of strong demand in North America truck markets and signs of improving demand for engines used in nonresidential construction. In addition, oil and gas and mining markets continue to be strong around the world. While some markets are clearly strengthening, we anticipate construction markets in China to be relatively flat with 2011. And as you heard from Tom, we expect year-over-year revenue in Brazil to decline following the introduction of the Euro 5 emissions and the changes at MAN that we discussed in our third quarter call.  2012 EBIT margins are forecast to be in the range of 12% to 13% of sales, and pre-volume leverage and joint venture contribution will be partially offset by continued investment in new products.","In the Components segment, full year revenue was a record $4 billion, up 33% from last year as the truck markets strengthened in North America. EBIT for the year increased by 69% to $470 million with EBIT margins improving to 11.6% of sales, up from 9.1% last year.","Fourth quarter sales were $1.1 billion, an increase of 19% over the prior year, driven by stronger demand in the North America on-highway markets. Sequentially, revenues increased 8%, driven by continued strong demand for components in North America and improved demand for turbochargers in China. EBIT margins for the quarter were a record 12.1% of sales compared to 9% in the prior year and 11.1% in the third quarter. The improvement in margins was driven primarily from higher volumes, improved productivity and lower product coverage costs.","We expect revenue growth of 12% in 2012 as a result of strength in North America on-highway markets, additional content in Brazil for Euro 5 emissions and strong aftermarket sales. EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% of sales, with the additional volume and continued productivity improvements in our plants being partially offset by increased spending on new product development.","In the Power Generation segment, full year sales were $3.5 billion, up 20% over the prior year. EBIT increased by 25% to $373 million, with EBIT margins improving to 10.7% of sales, up from 10.2% of sales last year. Fourth quarter sales were $920 million, an increase of 2% from last year, as improved demand in China and North America was partially offset by weaker demand in India. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased 5% driven by the improved demand in North America and Latin America, offset by weaker demand in both China and in India.","EBIT margins were 9.5% in the quarter compared to 10.2% last year and 10.5% in the prior quarter. Compared to last year, improved pricing and joint venture income were offset by investments being made for new growth initiatives and the impact of commodity price movements. Sequentially, the benefits of increased volume were offset by higher product coverage costs, more joint venture income due to typical seasonality in the Middle East and the impact of commodity price movements.","For 2012, we expect the Power Generation segment to grow 10% as a result of improving demand in North America, Europe, Latin America and India. Demand in China will remain relatively flat with 2011 levels.  We expect EBIT margins to improve and to be in the range of 11% to 12% of sales. The benefits of increased volume and better efficiency at our assembly plants will be partially offset by further investment in growth initiatives.","And finally, for the Distribution segment, full year revenues were $3 billion, up 31% compared to the prior year. EBIT increased by 30% to $386 million and remained relatively flat at 12.7% of sales for the year. Fourth quarter revenues were $834 million, an increase of 19% over the prior year. This increase was driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region, Power Generation demand in North America and from oil and gas and mining markets, as well as from pre-buy activity in Europe ahead of the Tier 4 Interim emissions change.","Compared to the prior quarter, sales increased 7%, driven by strong growth across several regions, which more than offset unfavorable currency movements, which had a negative 4% impact on segment revenue. EBIT margins for the quarter were 10.4% compared to 11.7% last year and 13.3% last quarter. Compared to the prior year, margins were impacted by a mix shift away from the aftermarket towards whole goods from unfavorable currency movements, increased spending as we expand our footprint and upgrade certain facilities and lower joint venture income as a percent of sales. Sequentially, the margin decreased due to the same factors, with currency even more of a headwind relative to third quarter levels. For 2012, we are forecasting 20% growth over the prior year with approximately 9% of this growth coming from acquisitions. We expect EBIT margins in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of sales.","As Tom mentioned, we're projecting total Cummins revenues to be up 10% in 2012. And similar to last year, we anticipate the second half of the year to be slightly stronger than the first as on-highway markets in Brazil normalize following the Euro 5 implementation and as the China construction and truck markets strengthen in the second half of the year.","Gross margins will improve as a result of a stronger volume and from price realization of between 0.5% and 1%. Material costs are currently projected to be flat relative to 2011, and warranty costs are forecast to increase slightly to 2.5% due to the mix of product sales in 2012. The benefits from our forecasted growth will be partially offset by continued investment in new product platforms and other growth initiatives across the company.","Joint venture income is expected to grow 10% and remain flat at 2.3% of sales. And as a result, we are projecting an EBIT margin of between 14.5% and 15% of sales, which at the midpoint means 21% incremental EBIT margins year-over-year. We are currently projecting the tax rate to be around 29% in 2012, excluding any onetime discrete items. ","Finally, let me turn to the balance sheet and cash flow. As you've already heard from Tom, we had a very strong year from a cash flow perspective, generating a record $2 billion in cash from operating activities and then using that cash to reinvest back into the company and also to return value to our shareholders.","Our balance sheet remains strong. Our pension plans remain very well-funded and our debt-to-capital position at the end of 2011 was 11.8%. Our strong balance sheet allows us to increase the level of investment we make in the research and development of new products and technologies, on strategic growth initiatives and on capital expenditure programs. We plan to increase our capital expenditure from $622 million in 2011 to between $800 million and $850 million in 2012.","The majority of this investment will continue to be targeted towards capacity expansion and new product development such as expanding our natural gas offerings and developing new large displacement engines. In addition to investing for future growth, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and sustainable dividend growth. 2011 was a terrific year for the company, and we look forward to continuing our track record of profitable growth in 2012.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Pat. We're about ready for questions. [Operator Instructions] So with that, we'll turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Henry Kirn with UBS.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","As you look out to 2012, could you give some color on what you expect for seasonality?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, I think \u2013- Henry, the seasonality is not [ph] going to work unlike what we seen in 2011. First quarter tends to be a little bit quieter for demand in our Power Generation business and parts of the Distribution business given the holidays in Asia. So that tends to be the weakest quarter of the year relative to the other 3. And as I said in my comments, I would expect revenues in the second half of the year to be slightly stronger than the first. I think last year, there was like a 47-53 spit. This year, it's going to be very similar to that.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And the related follow up, was there any impact to your expectations for first quarter demand as a result of brake supplier issues?","N. Thomas Linebarger","No, no change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays Capital.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, in Power Generation, it seems like your tone actually has gone quite a bit better, I'd say, over the last 3 months, especially in North America. What are you seeing specifically in North America that maybe has changed your tone? And how does it look in '12 in general?","N. Thomas Linebarger","It's mostly just been driven by better order intake. We -- I think we discussed on previous calls, we started to see a little improvement in maybe the second quarter of 2011, and we thought things were going to get better, and then they kind of didn't. We just -- U.S. economy just seemed to go back flat again. And then what we saw towards the end of the year was better order intake in North America. So we're still -- it's still a tenuous recovery, as you well know, in nonresidential construction. But it's just looking better, and our tone\u2019s matching that improved order intake.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And -- sorry, and then in North America in general, Tom, your visibility around the oil and gas markets in particular, I mean, natural prices have gone down, but we know you're doing oil shales and all kinds of business like that. So how do we sort of view that market in '12?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, we are -- of course, reading the same stories with interest about natural gas prices going down. And we -- our view is it can't help but have an effect on demand. We will see effect on demand in North America. But what we're seeing as the upside is that international markets are getting going in the oil and gas markets. Examples are China, Argentina\u2019s another where exploration is really getting going. So we're kind of looking across the world and saying, \"Hey, we think it looks better.\" But I do agree that the prices and the stuff you're hearing in North America can't help but temper demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Michael Shlisky - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Mike Shlisly filling in for Ann Duignan. Just a quick question on pricing in 2012. I did notice there were some gains in pricing you had in 2011. I was wondering sort of globally if you could just kind of maybe just walk us through","[Audio Gap]","pricing in the various regions over the next couple of quarters?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, overall, we're looking at pricing of between 0.5% and 1% of sales. That's not too dissimilar to what we've seen back in 2011. Most of the placing actions you're going to see in the parts and service business, in our industrial business with mining, oil and gas, commercial marine, less so on the on-highway businesses be they in North America or anywhere else.","N. Thomas Linebarger","And if I know, that structure there -- so with OEMs, we typically have structure agreements that go over the period of an emission cycle or something like that. So there, we do not see price realization within the cycle, whereas Power Gen aftermarket and things like that, our Distribution sold businesses, they go right to end-user customers. And there, we have more pricing flexibility. So where we see costs increasing, we are able to pass on some price increases assuming the markets accept -- can accept it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Vertical Research Partners.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Two quick questions. One is just on materials. I think I heard materials impact on Power Gen margins. Engine margins are pretty good. Was there something just timing-wise in materials spend or commodity and is the outlook comparable to that too?","Patrick J. Ward","We took a lot of overhead in the fourth quarter and some copper price movements with regards to our forward contracts. But other than that, there wasn't anything significant with material with regards to the fourth quarter. As we look into 2012, again, back to the remarks I made in the script year-over-year. We're looking at material costs being flat, which probably means in the first half of the year, they will be a little bit better than the first half of 2011. And our expectation is metal markets will appreciate as we go into the second half of the year and the comparisons will not be as good, second half to second half.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Great. And if I can just do 2 on the warranty, I know we'll see this when the K comes out, but did you -- where did you end up on warranty expense, warranty experience? And do you have a cushion going into next year if experience was better than you thought? And if you wouldn't mind, oil and gas, are you having positive conversation with people on the QSK95 and on offshore, or is that too soon?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, I don't think I\u2019ve got any cushions going to next year. On warranty, it turned out to be really good. I think the quality of the new products that we launched in 2010 in North America has been terrific. And if you look on warranty expense last year in total for the company, it was 3% of sales. This is 2010, sorry. 2011, that dropped to 2.3% of sales. As we look forward into 2012, we're projecting a slight increase to 2.5% and naturally just due to the mix of products in 2012 relative to 2011 as the growth in products carry a slightly higher warranty rate than the mix we experienced in 2011. But overall, warranty, I'm really, really pleased with the performance of those new products that came out last year. And then sorry the question on oil and gas, again, was what?","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","It was just whether you're having any conversations on -- what the reception was for the engine launch if you're having conversation on planning out of sort of offshore rigs that might be built over next several years really?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Well, again, we're still in, as you know, in the middle of that program. We announced the program and the timing and -- but we are having discussions across our segments, including oil and gas, on 95, and the reception was terrific. I mean, I personally attended the events and met with the -- I mean, 70 or 80 customers from around the world, including many from oil and gas and people were really excited about the engine. As we talked about it, it will be the largest high-speed engine. And so for places like oil and gas where getting more power in a single package is a big focus, they're excited about that. So my expectation is that we'll have very good reception, and we're now committed to meeting targets in timing on that Engine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you, gentlemen, talk about the major pieces of your CapEx program? Any new capacity expansion or new product plans beyond what you discussed in September, or is the Africa distribution build out meaningful portion there?","Patrick J. Ward","I think it's very similar to what I talked about back in September. We're expanding capacity in North America. We're seeing increased demand for our heavy-duty products and we're ramping up capacity at our Jamestown plant, which manufactures our 15-meter engines. Elsewhere around the world, we're investing facilities in Brazil and Turkey and China and India, all pretty much focused on adding capacity given what we see ahead of us. And I think, Jerry, you're pretty familiar with the investments we're making in the development of the new larger displacement engines as one example of what we're doing from a new product development perspective. So I'd, say, what 70%, maybe 75% of our total capital in 2012 will be focused on new product development and capacity expansion.","N. Thomas Linebarger","And the only thing I'd add, Jerry, to Pat's comments is that there is a fair bit rate in [ph] new products, which again is capacity, but it's targeted. A lot of our investments in emerging markets are targeted at new products where we're launching in those markets, new -- cost reduced or new technology products to meet new emissions targets and so a lot of that investment is going in over the next couple of years in both India and China.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on that note, we've got national 4-engine standards coming up. And obviously, you're investing capacity ahead of that. I wonder if you could talk about your market share expectations on the after-treatment side? And maybe talk about the light-duty diesel turbo product and how the uptake there is going if it's not too early to talk about those items?","N. Thomas Linebarger","It is early on both those items. As you maybe know, the NS4 deadline was actually announced by the government, which was both good news and bad. On the not as good news, they said they pushed it back to the middle of 2013, which -- and we were sort of -- I guess the industry was sort of anticipating January 2013, although we didn't know. The good news part of it is that the 2 rival government agencies who were the ones kind of battling with each other and was creating all the uncertainty jointly announced the deadline. So from our point of view, that adds certainty and sort of adds -- it makes you feel like it's actually going to happen that way, which is a big deal for us. So we now feel like we have a target to shoot at as do our customers, which we think helps drive the capacity investments, the target dates on new product releases, which is terrific. With regard to how much share we'll have and those kind of things, it's definitely premature. But you can bet that on both the turbocharger and the after-treatment side that we are in active discussion with just about every significant OEM there about how we can be a part of their technical solution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Looking at the guidance, the industrial revenues, the up 5%, I wanted to discuss a little bit, the up 5%, you would think there could be a little upside there, but maybe we need to talk a little bit more about the base case you have for North America with oil and gas and maybe some capacity constraints? But I would think the up 5% looks beatable, while the medium-duty outlook, is there a little downside risk there just looking at Brazil down 9%? And maybe I'm overstating the MAN platform loss and -- but I'm trying to think through Brazil is a big piece of that international part of truck medium bus? So can you first discuss the industrial engine revenues, the up 5%? Is there more capacity constraint than I realize, or do you have more of a decline baked in for North America oil and gas in that piece? I'm not sure why that shouldn\u2019t be up more in '12.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Well, I think there's a couple of factors when you're looking at the global industrial demand, David, and number one, our base assumption is that China is flat year-over-year, which is an important market in this part of our consolidated revenues. The second piece, in Europe, we saw some pre-buy activity on some of the smaller engines around the Tier 4 Interim emissions regs, which we expect will be -- lead to some lower revenues in that segment. So those are down. Mining, we've got strong back order backlog in mining, clearly, globally, U.S. and international markets. Oil and gas remained strong. We've heard some rumblings of some tight capacity on the frac-ing rigs themselves, but the order rigs [ph] remained strong. So I think it's a combination of all those different factors that have us up 5%, which sounds less than your expectation.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the medium, the -- you say up 7% in total. But Brazil truck shipment\u2019s down 9%. Is that an -- I'm sorry, maybe I missed it. Was that an industry comment? I'm just thinking some share loss?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. Brazil truck, our assumption is down 5%. We talked about the MAN transition with our new engines ramping up in the second half of the year.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So you're down 5% for the industry, and you're down 9% for yourself even with some platform loss?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Right, with some different factors in there, yes.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, then I'll just wrap up with the balance sheet. Obviously, we are","[Audio Gap]","very strong net cash here over $1 billion. The share repo for the quarter was actually a little less than I would have thought. How should we think about the balance sheet usage for '12?","Patrick J. Ward","Well, David, if you think it was similar to what I said before. That somewhere between 65% and 70% will go back into the Company in the form of capital investment programs, joint venture investments, working capital, and then the 30% that's left, we will look to return to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and growing the dividend. So the reason why the share repurchases may have looked a little bit low  in the fourth quarter was that we're fairly hefty in the third quarter. We bought back 6 million shares in 2011, which is a higher number than what we've done in the past. So when you look at what we did from a share repurchase perspective and what we did with the dividend in 2011 and compare that to total profit after-tax, about 30% [ph] of what we earned after tax we returned to the shareholder in one of those 2 forms. So we felt quite good about that.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And those percentages you were giving, those were of what, of your expected cash flow for the year?","Patrick J. Ward","Of my cash flow.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well, that's I'm saying. The balance sheet is net cash $1 billion. I'm not even considering any future cash generation.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, I like having a strong balance sheet, David. My intent is to keep a strong balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The model seems pretty strong with formal baton toss, so, Tom, I'm sure you'll adhere to Tim's wisdom. So a couple of questions. If I could return to the last question that David just asked, if you have roughly $5.5 in net cash today and you could add maybe another $5 after CapEx in dividends next year, can you give us an idea as to what metrics you're looking at to manage your cash level? And how strong is strong, I guess, is the question?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. Well, again, we don't have plans to grow our cash balance indefinitely. So we're very conscious of the fact and we talked to our investors all the time. And what they look for us to do is, first and foremost, reinvest back into the company where we think we've got good profitable growth opportunities. They see the track record, and that's the feedback we get any time without talking to investors. Obviously, we look to increase the dividend. We look to buy back stock when it makes sense, and we did a little bit more of that in the third quarter, given where the price dropped to. When I look at our plan over the next 4 or 5 years and what it takes to get to $30 billion in sales and what that means for capacity investments, and we've got that quite well modeled out. Now as we talked through in our September analyst day, there are different scenarios that can come into play here. So I think we've got good plans with regards to cash management. We watch that relative to our peer companies to make sure it doesn't get out of sync. I think the balance sheet is in good shape. Just know that pensions are incredibly well-funded, and our goal is to keep it that way and invest back into the Company where we see these really good opportunities for future profitable growth.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Thanks for that, Pat. And then if I could turn back to, I guess, a little more near term, the 2012 guidance. When you talk about some of the emerging markets strengthening in the back half of the year, can you indicate whether that's due to more comparisons, or if you're including an assumption that the various economies reaccelerate?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. I think that's -- Andy, that's really related to the comments we made about interest rates and moderating of inflation. So our view is China has got a couple of things going that suggests that GDP will begin to improve again. Number one is that, as I mentioned, inflation is starting to moderate and we're just watching a lot of signs that suggest that the government may begin to ease cash flow restrictions. Of course, they'll do what they're going to do, but that's what it looks like. And the second thing is they've got a new government coming in. And again, I think it's going to be -- and a whole bunch of things they want to do like add to the housing stock and things like that, that I think is going to be able to drive demand. China, like every other economy, has its own set of challenges and has to manage them. But I think those signs point to improvement in the economy in the second half. The India story is a little bit more complicated in the sense that they don't have as clear signals about moderating inflation, but there are some signals there. And again, what our folks are telling us and what I'm reading and seeing suggest that, again, we'll start to see improvement in the Indian economy as inflation moderates, interest rates come down. And that allows economic growth. And again, their government is also continuing their infrastructure build-out, especially in roads, which is, of course, pumping investment in the economy. So both those things are telling us that markets -- those markets just look stronger in the second half.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Would the same be true of Brazil?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Well, Brazil, the main issue there is that the truck market had a pre-buy, and so we think they've just got to swallow that for one. And, as you know, it's a pretty big one. They're going from Euro 3 to Euro 5, pretty big change in technology. So there's a little bit of -- that affects us pretty significantly there separate from the economy. So there's the economic trend going on there, but there's also that -- one of our heavy end markets is having that sort of non-economic driver as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer with Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","A quick question on Emission Solutions in the quarter. I'm not sure if I missed this earlier, but it was up about, I think, 22% quarter-to-quarter. Can you talk about what drove that? I'm guessing that it's not really anything in terms of Brazil Euro 5 related yet, is it?","Patrick J. Ward","No, that was North America truck demand that drove that.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. So that's -- even though it grew 20% and North America grew sequentially 10%, it's just you're getting just more content there?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. It's primarily North America.","Mark Smith","Yes. We can get some timing issues there. But, yes, it's North America.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then just as a follow up to -- can you give a sense of your expectations for next year in terms of North America heavy-duty market share?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, we still expect to stay in that sort of -- we've kind of said we think we'll be 35% to 40%, and that's still \u2013- of course, we ended with that 38% for the year. And that's still the range we're expecting to be in. A lot of it depends on the success of our customers. So the more successful our customers are, the more [indiscernible] of our share. So we're really working really hard to make sure our customers do better. Those are our partners like PACCAR and others, making sure they're winning share in the market using our engines.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","My question has been answered.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Tom, you let your numbers do the talking. You don't have to worry about anything else. Just a couple of minor fine points. Pat [ph], what was the FX impact on the fourth quarter both in top line and bottom line? And what are your assumption for the impact \u2013- until you guys have some foreign currency assumptions in 2012?","Patrick J. Ward","That's a good question. So let me take you through the fourth quarter, and then I'll talk about 2012. So the fourth quarter relative to a year ago, we had about $40 million, $45 million impact in the top line, so a little bit less than 1%. And that was below $10 million in the bottom, so it was not significant at all. It was more significant on the top line relative to the third quarter. If you remember, the rates in Q3 compared to Q4 were very different. The impact on revenues in the fourth quarter was about $130 million lower because of FX. But again, given the mix of currencies and how we operate around the world, it was less than $10 million in the bottom line. So not significant year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter from an EBIT perspective. From -- let me just backup for a second. There was one exception to that and that was Distribution. So within the 4 segments in total, we're okay. Distribution, though, are very exposed to currency given that it tend to have a cost structure U.S. dollars and revenue in all local currencies. So they took a bigger hit and that was one of the reasons why their margin suffered a little bit in the fourth quarter. In terms of 2012, for guidance, based on the rates we were seeing about 10 days ago, we were looking at a $300 million headwind in currencies on the top line year-over-year. And again, probably less than 0.1 point impact on EBIT. So not material year-over-year from an EBIT perspective, but about, as I say, $300 million on the top line, so 1.5% of sales.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And just a follow up, you talked about pre-buys in Europe and pre-buys in Brazil. Did you see any evidence of any pre-buys in the United States from the tax issues?","Mark Smith","No, not significant, Eli.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Industry was pretty busy.","Operator","Your next question is a follow up from Mr. Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. First, on the Brazil side, Mark, it sounds like you've picked up some market share relative to, I guess, what you were afraid you'd lose on the MAN platform. Can you just talk about where you're picking up the incremental business from? And just give us some more context there?","Mark Smith","Maybe I mischaracterized things, Jerry. So the market is down 5%. We will be down more than that because of the engine change. There's really been no change in which platforms we're on. Of course, we're getting more content on the Components side with the SCR system going into Euro 5. And in general, we've said in Latin America, our revenues will be down about 6%. Trucks will be down more than 5%, but the content for Components plus continued growth in Power Gen and some other on-highway markets get us back to about down 6%.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Remember, Jerry, the basic structure we -- with MAN is that we're launching a smaller engine with them and larger engine with them. And in the 6, 7 there -- we are 6, 7 which has been kind of the mainstay of our business with them over many years. They are using their own engine to replace that. So that's why we talked about the transition that we're building volume on the small engine and the large engine and -- but we're losing a bunch of volume in the 6, 7. And so that's what's happening over the course of the next 4 quarters or 6 quarters. And our hope again as we -- or our plan is to grow business with them over the years and surpass any peak we ever had. But we've got to transition here where we've got to build demand for those -- on those other engines.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. Pat, can you talk about now your expectations for SG&A and engineering spending growth this year relative to sales growth? And also touch on your input cost assumptions? I think last year, you delivered 50 basis points from productivity improvement. Are you dialing that in into your base case guidance as well?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, we are. I mean, we continue to push our manufacturing plants to continue to look for further productivity improvements. So that's a given every year. With regards to selling admin and research and development, as we look forward into 2012 -- I mean, we're going to go at 10% next year on the top line. We're going to grow our SAR at a faster rate than sales next year. And that's deliberate -- that's choices we are making that we think are important for our future growth in 2013, '14 and '15. So I would expect our SAR to increase as a percent of sales by maybe just over 0.5 point of sales. The research and development part in particular, I think for 2011, we ended up at 3.5% of sales, and our forecast for 2012 call that to increase to 3.8% for the full year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, for the Distribution business, can you step us through the mechanism through which you're going to get the margin back? Is that -- are you pushing pricing over the next couple of quarters, or just help us understand how you drive that back into balance in '12?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, well to keep that in perspective, distribution had a terrific year overall. I mean, record sales, record profits. And for the first 3 quarters of the year, they were performing north of 13% of sales. In the fourth quarter, they were impacted by the -- there were really 3 items in the fourth quarter. One was the impact on foreign exchange, which as I described earlier on, was far more significant for them than any of the other 3 business segments. So that was probably a 1 point-of-sale impact for them. Secondly, there was a mix shift from aftermarket to whole goods. Through the first 3 quarters, somewhere around 55% of their sales were aftermarket, and that dropped to 50% in the fourth quarter. So between the mix shift, foreign exchange and then some onetime costs that we had in Distribution around some warranty issues, some severance costs that we took in Europe, that was really the drop in Q3 to Q4. And we expect most of that will kick back right away in Q1. So I expect the first quarter to be much better for Distribution than what you've seen in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-up questions. Most have been answered. One, just back on the market share in North America, your market share was -- I mean, I know you ended at 38, but the first 2 months of the quarter was exceptional. Can you talk about what drove it? Was it constraints from --  some of the other truck OEs on the engine side that we heard about, or was it issues with other concerns on engines with running out of emissions, credits, et cetera? And then just a quick follow up, Pat, you talked about seasonality, but what about seasonality with regards to the JV income line? Just with everything that's going on in China, et cetera, I just want to make sure there's no surprises in the first half.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. So, Jamie, let me just talk about market share. It is a little difficult from where we sit, sort out all the month-to-month changes because as you know, OEM build schedules, how they're dealing with backlog, a whole bunch of that stuff plays in there. And so we -- that's why we're pretty careful about saying which are real market share gains and which are not. So, again, I feel like the more average numbers are more instructive. So my view is 38 is a good number. The month-to-month ones were aberrations. They have lots to do with production. I don't see a lot of these big -- the things you mentioned, all of those reasons, they all may have had some effect, but they're not all visible to me how they play out. And again, our view was that the challenge for the industry through most of this year was trying to ramp up to meet the demand and do it in a cost effective way. And I think we feel good about how we did that. We think we helped our OEM customers across the board ramp up, and we dealt with our own constraints in supply chain and work through them and, of course, we tried -- did everything we could to help them be flexible to work through their constraints. So we feel pretty good about that. And I'm sure it helped that we were ramping up quickly, but how much, in which month, I just don't -- can't say.","Patrick J. Ward","And on the JV question, Jamie, last year, we were 2.3% of sales. It's not going to move an awful lot off that mark each quarter in 2012. So there'll be fluctuations in different areas, but we've got joint ventures in China, India, a substantial footprint in North America, as you know, so somewhere between 2.3%, plus or minus, 0.1 point is what you would expect through the year.","Operator","Your next question is a follow up from David Raso with ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","The question is on the JV income. I thought it's pretty impressive that the Chongqing growth could offset the Dongfeng decline, and really looking at the whole year, it's kind of how it played out, right? Chongqing was always there to kind of offset the Dongfeng declines. When you look at '12 JV income for those 2 businesses, can you give us a little color on that? How are you thinking of those businesses year-over-year maybe in the context at a minimum of the up 10% for total JV growth?","Patrick J. Ward","I think year-over-year, David, Chongqing will continue to grow. CCEC will continue to grow for us. I mean, that's been a remarkable story. It\u2019s one of the JVs that doesn't get any of the spotlight, but their performance over the past few years and their growth, top line and bottom line, has just been terrific. So I would expect them to continue to expand their contribution to the company. With the Dongfeng-Cummins joint venture, year-over-year, I think that's going to be fairly flat. We expect volumes to improve in the second half of the year from where we are in the first half of the year. So, all-in, it's going to be around the same type of number that we've seen in 2011.","N. Thomas Linebarger","I think just to add a little color to the Chongqing, David, so the Chongqing engine plant, its primary customer base is off-highway, construction markets and Power Gen market, and it's a joint venture that we manage. And what we've been able to do there is figure out a way to adapt our technology to local market requirements, I think, pretty effectively. Whether it was, we've kept cost down. We've kept moving technology but at a rate and pace that at least allows us to be competitive from a cost point of view. And I think that's really the primary driver of the success of our business there. So, again, as Pat said, it really has been a terrific joint venture and our view as it will continue to grow and have success.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And lastly, the nat gas strategy. There's obviously some off-highway aspect to it, but particularly on the on-highway from big-bore to the smaller engines. Can you take us through -- obviously, Pat's alluded to some pretty heavy investment around it. So either it be through Westport, independent, just give us a little color on how the company is thinking about the nat gas opportunity, particularly on-highway?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Right. So, first of all, a significant amount of our investment, as you guess, is off-highway in things like Hedgehog and things like that. There's a lot of investment there and technology driving off-highway. In fact, the market is more significant for Cummins off-highway today than on-highway. But, as you know, there's a fair bit of momentum building on-highway. It's historically been primarily a bus market in North America from an on-highway point of view. And now there is growing interest from truck companies to see if given the low prices of natural gas, this can be a way to reduce cost of trucking. And we're excited about that because we're -- we've been in it for 10 years now, and from -- so we've got a bit of a lead over others and we work -- we've been working most of our efforts in that through our Cummins Westport joint venture, and that's still the way we're doing it. And our view is, although it's still a relatively small market, just to give you a sense, it's less than 5% of our North American truck sales today are natural gas. So it's not a big number today, and it's unlikely to have a big effect on 2012 revenues or profits. We consider it an area of growth and opportunity for us and for our customers.","Mark Smith","Okay.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sienna, and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mark Smith, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Sienna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2012. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and Vice President and President of our Engine business, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.

Our press release with the copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","With that out of the way, we will begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I will summarize our first quarter results and comment on the outlook for our key markets. Pat will then take you through more details of our first quarter financial performance and provide an update on our full year guidance.","We delivered very strong results in the first quarter. Revenues were $4.5 billion, an increase of 16% over the first quarter of 2011. Three of our 4 businesses reported higher revenues than a year ago, with the Components business achieving record revenues. First quarter EBIT was $658 million, an increase of 24% over the same period last year, continuing our trend of growing earnings faster than sales.","Both revenues and EBIT represent a new first quarter record. We delivered incremental EBIT margin of 21%, consistent with our plan to meet our long-term targets. EBIT percentage for the first quarter was 14.7% with the Engine and Components businesses delivering record EBIT percentage. The Distribution business delivered significant improvement in EBIT percentage from the fourth quarter levels, due to better mix and lower costs. EBIT percent in our Power Generation business also improved from the fourth quarter, despite a drop in revenues of $140 million. Based on the improvements we saw in the first quarter, we remain confident that EBIT margins for both the Distribution and Power Generation businesses will improve during the remainder of the year. We are maintaining our full year guidance for the company of revenue growth of 10% and EBIT margins of 14.5% to 15% of sales. ","In the first quarter, we saw mixed economic conditions across our markets. And although our guidance for the full year remains unchanged, our outlook has changed in some markets. Overall, demand for our products has increased in North America, in heavy, medium and light duty on-highway markets and in the construction market, offsetting weaker-than-expected demand in China. We now expect our domestic revenues in China across all end markets and including joint ventures to decline by 5% in 2012 compared to our previous guidance of no change year-over-year. In India, our forecast for revenue growth of 7%, including joint ventures, remains unchanged from our previous guidance. In Latin America, our revenue guidance is also unchanged with a weaker outlook for trucks in Brazil offset by stronger demand in our other businesses. ","Now let me discuss some of these markets in more detail. Revenues in North America were very strong, increasing 40% from a year ago. The Engine and Components businesses delivered strong growth in on-highway markets. We benefited from strong market share for our Engines in the North American heavy-duty truck market in the first quarter, with our share reaching 45% compared to 33% a year ago. We shipped to more than 20,000 15-liter engines to the North American market, setting an all-time record. ","Our total Engine shipments to this market, including our 12-liter engine, increased by 118% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Through close cooperation with our OEM partners and strong execution from our manufacturing and supply chain teams, we were able to quickly ramp up our production to meet strong demand for our products. We now expect our market share to reach 40% for the full year, the top end of the range of our previous guidance. And we are maintaining our forecast for the market size for heavy-duty trucks in 2012 at 278,000 units.","In the North American medium-duty truck market, we also delivered very strong performance in the first quarter, with our market share increasing to 52% from 50% at the end of 2011. Our engine shipments to this market increased by 62% year-over-year. We are maintaining our full year market size projection of 117,000 units, and we expect our market share for the full year to be at least 50%. ","We continue to receive very positive feedback about the performance and reliability of our North American on-highway engines. We have now shipped 256,000 engines equipped with our SCR technology, and our customers are pleased with the fuel economy improvements that we have delivered. ","At the recent Mid-America Truck Show on Louisville, we announced that we will meet the 2014 efficiency and greenhouse gas regulations a year early. And we will deliver a further 2% improvement in fuel economy above current levels. Also in North America, demand for our light-duty engines from Chrysler increased by 27% this quarter, and we now expect full year volumes to increase by a full 30%.","In North American off-highway market, the Engine business experienced strong growth in mining and construction engines with unit growth of 53% and 52%, respectively, versus the first quarter last year. The Power Generation business delivered 24% revenue growth year-over-year in North America against a relatively weak first quarter last year. ","Our international revenues declined by a little under 2% with growth in Australia, Mexico and Eastern Europe offset by softer near-term demand in China and Brazil. In China, our domestic revenues across all end markets, including the revenues of our joint ventures, declined by 16% compared to the first quarter of 2011. ","We experienced a decline in our shipments to the construction market, primarily engines for excavators as monetary tightening by the government impacted construction activity. We now expect the market for excavators to decline by 15% for the full year 2012 compared to our previous guidance that the market would be flat year-over-year. We expect to see improvement in demand later this year, with fourth quarter volumes expected to be the highest for the year as excavator manufacturers increase engine orders in order to complete production of excavators ahead of this peak spring selling season next year.","The truck market in China started to soften in the third quarter of last year following a number of years of very strong growth. Fortunately, OEM and dealer inventory levels have dropped significantly over the last 4 quarters. As we start to see improvement in the Chinese economy in the second half of this year, we should see production volumes at our Dongfeng Cummins joint venture increase. For the full year, we now expect the truck market heavy- and medium-duty combined to decline by 10% compared to our previous forecast of down 5%.","In the Power Generation market in China, our revenues including joint ventures increased 13% compared to the first quarter of 2011. We are maintaining our previous guidance that revenues will remain flat for the full year. As you will recall, we experienced very high demand in the second and third quarters of 2011 due to widespread power shortages in the country. We now expect domestic revenues in China, including joint ventures, to be down by 5% for the full year. ","In Brazil, our revenues across all businesses declined 18% year-over-year, driven by lower demand in the truck market. We planned for low first quarter production volumes in the on-highway market with the change in emission standards from Euro 3 to Euro 5, and with the engine transition occurring at MAN as we have previously discussed. Our shipments declined by 48% in the first quarter as OEMs continued to sell Euro 3 compliant trucks that were produced last year. We now expect industry production to decline by 19% for the full year. ","We did begin shipments to MAN in Brazil of our new Euro 5 compliant 9-liter and 3.8-liter engines and SCR Systems in the first quarter. I recently visited our operations in Brazil to see our progress in ramping up production, and I'm excited about the prospects for these new products, as well as our aftertreatment systems. I look forward to updating you as sales of our Euro 5 products increase in future quarters. ","Our Power Generation business delivered 37% revenue growth in the first quarter in Brazil and we expect strong demand to continue, driven by instability in the grid and ongoing investment in infrastructure. The economy in Brazil softened a little in the second half of 2011, but we are encouraged by the recent interest rate cut by the Brazilian Central Bank.","In the rest of Latin America, we continue to see strong demand for trucks and mining equipment. Our total revenues in Latin America, including Brazil, are expected to reach $1.7 billion this year, a decrease of 6%, in line with our previous guidance as increases in Power Generation and Components revenues are projected to partially offset the lower truck demand in Brazil. ","In India, our revenues, including our joint ventures, were flat year-over-year. First quarter revenues for our Power Generation business were 4% lower. We have seen an improvement in order intake recently in our Power Generation business following a period of weaker demand in the second half of 2011. Power shortages in the south of the country are driving increased demand for our products. During our previous earnings call, we projected that our Power Generation revenues would increase by 10% for the full year 2012, and we remain confident in that guidance.","Our unit shipments are expected to increase by more than 10%, but the depreciation of rupee will result in 10% revenue dollar growth in U.S. dollar terms, based on the current forecast and the exchange rate. Truck engine shipments at our Tata Cummins joint venture were strong in the first quarter, up 9% year-over-year, though it is clear that we will have some softening in the Indian truck markets for the next several quarters. In total, including joint ventures, our revenues in India are expected to grow 7% in 2012, unchanged from our previous guidance.","Despite softness in some of our key emerging markets, we remain confident that the prospects for growth in Brazil, India and China -- and we continue to invest in the products, distribution footprint and infrastructure that will support that future growth. We do expect our revenues in China, India and Brazil to be higher in the second half of this year than the first.","In Europe, our forecast is largely unchanged from prior guidance although we continue to closely monitor our markets there. We project that total revenues in Europe will decline by 5% for the full year. In the first quarter, total company revenues actually increased 7% year-over-year but against a very weak comparison. We have seen some modest downward revisions to OEM forecast for on-highway markets. Construction volumes declined sharply from the fourth quarter of 2011 as expected, due to the pre-buy in 2011 ahead of Tier 4 emissions change. ","Our Power Generation business got off to slow start in Africa and the Middle East, with first quarter company revenues down a combined 9%. However, we are confident that our revenues will increase in these markets as the year progresses. ","As I've just described, we have experienced a mixed picture across our market in the first quarter. I'm very pleased that the company has been able to adjust to shifting demand patterns across geographies and end markets, and still deliver very strong performance. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we have made in expanding gross margins through efficiency gains, cost reduction work and improved quality. Improvements in gross margins are critical to both fund our investment in future growth and expand our EBIT margins.","As an example of our investment in new growth opportunities, we recently announced that we have begun development of a new 15-liter spark-ignited natural gas engine for the North American truck market. We are excited about this program, and we've already received very strong interest from end users and OEMs in this new Cummins 15-liter product. ","That concludes my comments, now let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect our very solid start to the year, including record profits in both our Engine and Components segments. First quarter revenues were $4.5 billion, an increase of 16% from a year ago. Our sales in the U.S. were up 43%, driven by strong demand in both on-highway and off-highway markets in the quarter. Sales in the rest of the world were essentially flat compared to a year ago as a result of weaker demand in China, Brazil and India and due to a stronger U.S. dollar.","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, sales were down 9%. The decrease was driven by seasonality in our Power Generation business in Asia, weaker construction markets in China, the impact of a fourth quarter pre-buy for industrial engines in Europe and lower demand for on-highway engines in Brazil.","Gross margins were a record 26.8% of sales, up from 24.8% last year. The improvement over the prior year was driven by stronger volume, improved pricing and lower warranty costs and to a lesser extent, slightly lower material costs. Margins also improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 despite lower volumes, as a result of operational improvements across all 4 segments, improved pricing and lower material costs.","Our products have been performing very well in the field, which is evidenced by a reduction in product coverage as a percent of sales over the prior year. This percent, however, has increased from the fourth quarter due to the product mix shifting towards more advanced engines in North America as we discussed on our last call.","Selling, admin and research and development costs were up $138 million from last year and were down $19 million from the previous quarter. As we've discussed before, we are focused on executing our growth plans, which have driven additional spending, particularly building out our distribution footprint in Africa, for example, and investing in new products across the company. Research and development spending increased 40% over the prior year as we continued to invest in the development of new products and technologies.","Joint venture income of $104 million was 8% higher than a year ago and 3% higher than the prior quarter. Strong performance by our North American distributors and in the Chongqing Cummins joint venture in China drove the year-over-year improvement, which was partially offset by a lower contribution from the Dongfeng Cummins joint venture as a result of the softer truck market in China. Sequentially, the improvement in joint venture income came from our North American distributors.","Earnings before interest and tax were $658 million or 14.7% of sales. This compares to 13.8% of sales last year, reflecting a 21% incremental EBIT margin. Compared to the fourth quarter, EBIT margins improved 90 basis points, despite the lower sales revenue.  Earnings per share in the first quarter were $2.38 compared to $1.75 from a year ago with a tax rate of 27% in the quarter. ","Now let's move on to the operating segments and further discuss first quarter performance and the outlook for the full year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 20% over last year. The increase was driven by strong demand for on-highway heavy and medium-duty truck engines in North America and global mining markets and improved Chrysler shipments. This was offset by weaker demand for on-highway engines in Brazil following the emission change and lower demand for excavator engines in China. Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down 7%. Sequentially, we experienced stronger demand for our on-highway engines in North America, which was offset by softer demand for construction engines in China and weaker demand in Brazil.","Segment EBIT was a record $381 million or 13.3% of sales, up from 12.1% last year as a result of stronger volumes, improved operating leverage, better pricing in off-highway markets and lower product coverage costs. This was partially offset by an increase in research and development spending and lower contribution from our joint ventures in China. ","Compared to the fourth quarter and despite the lower volumes and higher product coverage costs, EBIT margins improved from 12% to 13.3% as a result of ongoing productivity improvements, lower material costs and improved pricing.","For the full year, we continue to forecast that revenue for the Engine segment will be up 10%, driven by improved North American on-highway demand and strong mining markets, offsetting weakness in the China construction, Brazilian truck and North American oil and gas markets. EBIT projections for the full year remain unchanged at 12% to 13% of sales.","In the Components segment, first quarter revenue was a record $1.1 billion, up 19% from last year and up slightly from the prior quarter. Revenue growth in U.S. on-highway markets more than offset weakness in Europe and in China. ","The Cummins Emission Solutions revenues grew 48% from the prior year, and the Fuel System business grew 28% as a result of strong demand in the North American truck markets. The turbocharger business was flat compared to the prior year due to weaker on-highway markets in China. Sequentially, new demand for aftertreatment following the implementation of Euro 5 in Brazil, more than offset lower demand in Europe and the impact from the fourth quarter sale of the Light Duty Filtration business.","Segment EBIT was a record $143 million or 13% of sales, up from 11.4% last year. Stronger volumes and improved operating performance in our plants were the key drivers behind the profitability improvement. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins improved by almost 1% on relatively flat sales with operational improvements being a key contributor. We expect revenue growth of 12% this year as a result of strong demand from the on-highway markets in North America and the additional content required to meet the new Euro 5 emission standards in Brazil. EBIT margins are now expected to be in a range of 12% to 13% of sales.","In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $780 million, down 2% from the prior year and 15% lower sequentially. Year-over-year, we saw strong growth in North America and Brazil. However, these improvements were more than offset by a lower demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the impact of the weaker Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. Sequentially, improvements in India and Brazil were more than offset by weaker demand in most other regions, which is typical for the first quarter.","EBIT margins were 9.7% in the quarter, down from 11.2% last year. Compared to last year, improved pricing was more than offset by lower demand and additional investments being made in growth initiatives. EBIT margins were slightly higher than those reported in the fourth quarter despite a 15% drop in revenue as a result of operational improvements, improved pricing and lower material costs.","For 2012, we expect the Power Gen segment to grow between 5% and 10% as a result of improved demand in India and in Latin America. Though North America demand was strong in the first quarter compared to a year ago, we are seeing a few signs of weakness in recent order intake, which we will continue to monitor. EBIT margins are expected to improve as we go through the year and are projected to be in a range of 10.5% to 11.5% of sales for the full year.","And for the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $775 million, up 21% compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by strong demand from mining and Power Generation markets in the Asia-Pacific region and construction equipment demand in North America. Sequentially, revenue decreased 7%, driven by lower demand for industrial engines in Europe as a result of the pre-buy ahead of the Tier 4 emission change last quarter, along with weaker demand in North American oil and gas markets.","EBIT margins for the quarter were 12.1%, down from 13.9% a year ago, due to the impact of currency and increased spending to build out our Distribution network, particularly in Africa. Compared to last quarter, we did see the operational improvements we expected, and EBIT margins improved by 170 basis points.","For 2012, we continue to forecast 20% growth over the prior year with approximately 7% of this growth coming from acquisitions, and we expect EBIT margins to be in a range of 12.5% to 13.5% of sales. As Tom mentioned, despite some movements in the different markets, we continue to project total Cummins revenues to be up 10% in 2012. EBIT margins for the company will be in a range of 14.5% to 15% of sales compared to the 14.2% we recorded in 2011. And as we discussed in the prior quarter's call, we expect material cost to be flat compared to last year with costs slightly higher in the second half of the year, and we expect pricing to add 50 to 100 basis points of margin for the full year.","The only changes in our EBIT forecast compared to 3 months ago are for warranty cost to be 3.4% of sales, which is slightly better than before, but this will be offset by lower joint venture income, which we are now expecting to be up 5% over the prior year. We are currently projecting a tax rate now to be around 27% in 2012 excluding any discrete items.","Finally, with regard to cash flow, we invested $126 million in capital expenditure projects with most of this targeted on new products development and investing in capacity ahead of demand. As we discussed in our last call, we expect to invest between $800 million and $850 million for the full year. The balance sheet remains strong and our pension plans are very well funded. ","So despite the challenging conditions in some geographies and end markets, we are off to a very good start in 2012. And as you can see from the guidance, we are forecasting another record year while at the same time, making the investments necessary for future profitable growth. ","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks, Pat. [Operator Instructions] I will, of course, be available right after the call for any follow-ups. Sienna, we are now ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tom, in the outlook for the Power Gen business, can you say more about which regions are driving the pickup from first quarter levels? And can you comment on how bookings trended over the course of the quarter?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. So as we talked about, in India, we are seeing stronger demand now, which is good. It's a big market for Cummins. China is still doing fine. It won't be as high as it was in the second, third quarter last year, but it's still going to be doing well. As we mentioned, we expect some pick up in the Middle East versus a pretty weak quarter. Brazil and Latin America continue to be doing fine, and we see good business there. The North America point we were making is we had -- North America was coming back, and this is sort of the second time we've seen this where North American orders picked up, and then they dropped off a little bit as the economy kind of flagged a little bit. They picked up again, as we talked about in some of our previous calls. And then we have just seen, in recent weeks, it's really just been weeks, some softening in the order book. We just don't really know what it means. We're not sure how much softening we're going to see in North America. But we've heard that pretty consistently from other folks as well. So we're just keeping our eyes on that one.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on the point on Africa and Middle East, can you just say more about what's driving the timing of soft 1Q and pick up in coming quarters?","N. Thomas Linebarger","We're not entirely clear, to be honest. Right? What we know in Africa is that we've got a very aggressive plan to establish distribution and build it out to grow share in markets in Africa, and we didn't meet our targets for the quarter. We know that much. All the reasons we meet -- met, that there were some market issues. In Nigeria, in particular, there was quite a bit of problem, political violence and things in Nigeria, which slowed everybody's business down. Some places we also just didn't execute as well as we'd like. So that's part of it. In the Middle East, we just saw a little bit of a dip. We don't see any economic reason why that should continue. So our view is it's going to pick up. So both of those, they're not huge numbers in the grand scheme of things. They just were disappointing relative to what we expected.","Patrick J. Ward","That is if you look into the second quarter, we see some significant step up in the order book across the world, but exactly what Tom spoke about in North America. So second quarter will be much more in line with what I think we were projecting for the full year [indiscernible].","N. Thomas Linebarger","And we do have order book already for a lot of that. So it's not like we're guessing that. We do know that second quarter will be better. The North American piece is the one where we're still -- we're just watching closely to see what happens.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful context. And on the new product side, a number of significant new product announcements this quarter. I'm wondering if you can touch on what kind of sales contribution you expect from these products in aggregate, and can you give us an update on China engine regulations timing? That's it for me.","Patrick J. Ward","Okay, Jerry. So the new products announcement that we've had out, we talked about our -- the QSF industrial engine that's going to be more 2014, 2015. We just announced that at the intramatual [ph]. And then we've also talked about the dual-fuel option for our -- starting with our 50-liter engine for oil and gas applications and high horsepower. So again, those are going to be building over time. They're not going to have a huge impact this year, but just some example of many of the things we're working on new product growth.","N. Thomas Linebarger","And we've really got several waves [ph], as you know, Jerry, in new products, if I can comment on the China regs in that light. So we've got a whole set of products that we're introducing related to Tier 4 product. We've got products related to emissions releases in other countries as in China, for example, the new NS4 regulator are expected to be July 2013. And again we've [indiscernible] others because of agencies who are battling over dates both jointly announced [indiscernible]. So there's a whole bunch of products [indiscernible] and other similar down the road and then as markets moved out, we're introducing product [indiscernible] highway. We talked about new [indiscernible] products, et cetera. So, we do have a lot more out, and I think what we're expecting is over the growth period, the period to reach our growth target, new products will make a substantial [indiscernible] sales. But they're kind of coming out [indiscernible] out a year or 2 ago or the ones that are going to impact 2013 [indiscernible] plus the ones we're announcing now.","Operator","Your next question [indiscernible] Andrew Kaplowitz.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, could you talk [indiscernible] heavy truck market. Obviously, some OEMs have talked about a slightly weaker market. You guys, the market looked very strong. Your market share is very high. So maybe you could talk about the visibility into that market that you see and recognizing that you've been sort of butting [ph] up against capacity anyway in that market.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Andy, I'm going to ask Rich to start with that one.","Richard J. Freeland","Andy, this is Rich Freeland. A couple of things. A couple of moving pieces here, but the fundamentals, I think, as we're all aware of haven't changed and we think remained very strong, so bullish. But what we have seen is the retail order aboard softening. So the retail sales -- so it was very high in Q4 and then has weakened here in Q1. And as we talk to people, and it appears it may have been a little overheated in Q4 as folks were concerned about delivery issues and lead time, and we're seeing some balancing. So we didn't overreact to the Q4 and didn't take our market projections up. And likewise, we're not over reacting to being a little lower than what the rate is right now. And so -- and we can look forward. Not out a long ways. As we look certainly into Q2, that tends to be playing out for us pretty well that where we're at with the 2.78. Just one other thing on North America. You may be aware of this, but we also -- we're benefiting some from export sales that we get. So production and NAFTA [ph] that shipped outside. So some of the offsets in the U.S., in fact, in Q2 have been covered by increased sales to Latin America, even into exports into Australia. So that looks -- so we think it's a pretty balanced view that we've got right now. Of course, we're monitoring close, and where we stand is pretty much in line with where our customers are and the feedback we're getting from them.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, Rich. That's very helpful. Tom, maybe if I could ask you about margins in the sense that you've got a lot of company initiatives around improving margins this year that you've kind of alluded to. You've talked in the past about supply chain initiative. Obviously, price cost looks pretty good. There's been a lot of focus on the weather in the first quarter. So maybe you could talk about -- the margins were very strong in the quarter. How much of this was maybe outside things versus the company really doing well in keeping costs down?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Pat, why don't you start and I'll finish?","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you. Yes, I'll be delighted to start. I was -- to me, the story of the quarter was the margin performance. And not just the incrementals that we talked about year-over-year, but if you look at what happened fourth quarter, the first quarter, our sales always drop off in Q1. But all 4 businesses just did a terrific job at managing costs, continuing to improve their productivity in the manufacturing plants. And we increased our gross margin and our EBIT margin in the first quarter. So I was thrilled with the performance of all 4 segments. It's still early days I think with regards to seeing real tangible benefits from the supply chain initiative. We are seeing some. I think in the last call we gave guidance of 0.2 improvement for the year, and we're pretty confident that we're going to see that. But most of the improvements that we see in the first quarter is down to what the manufacturing plants are doing in converting demand through their facilities and doing it in a very efficient manner.","N. Thomas Linebarger","I guess I would just like to add, I just like to highlight, even the 2 businesses that didn't see quite as strong of sales results, the Distribution business and Power Gen business, both also managed cost quite well. And the Power Gen business, as you know, we had better margins on lower sales as a comparison point, which is -- that's pretty a good performance. That's what we're looking for. And both of those business leaders and leadership teams are working hard on making sure that they're balancing their cost structure with what they're seeing. And I went through the markets and it's a mixed bag. There's a lot of volatility in our markets today. And what I think the businesses are doing well is they're capturing the opportunities that are there and they're executing and managing costs across the world, while still investing in growth. I just think that's a hard group of balls to keep in the air. And so I don't think it was a one-off. I don't think it had anything to do with the weather or anything else. I think pretty much folks have been doing what they need to do to keep margins growing while still investing for the future.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook, Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question, I guess, Tom, not too surprising you took down your forecast I guess in China and truck on Brazil. Within China specifically, can you talk about what gives you confidence that things should improve in the back of the year, and how we should think about your inventory levels in the channel? And also it -- also your customers' inventory levels, I guess, would be my first question. And then my second question when you think about your markets, your targets for North America, I think this year you said it will go back down -- on truck will go back down to 40%. What are you assuming in the market relative to your competition for your market share to go back down? Do you see a successful engine launch in mid-year or just how we should think about how you're getting to that 40% number.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Let me start first with the excavator stuff. I'll then let Rich fill on some of the others. There's no question that we were negatively surprised by the excavator. That was probably another one where you warned me and I didn't listen. I'm just guessing. But we had -- there was definitely more inventory in the customer channel than we had expected, especially with our domestic customers. We are pretty clear on what our international customers had, our domestic customers. I don't think we got very clean messages from them about what was happening in the market. So we were negatively surprised. The end markets have also not done as well as we're hoping. But I think we understand the customer inventory much better now. And there is still some there, for sure, that definitely dampened demand in the first quarter, and I think will have effect on the second quarter as well. But our confidence is primarily based on economic recovery. So again, I think it sort of depends on your view about what happens in China with regard to economic recovery, but our view is that inflation has curbed in China, that the balance that the government's trying to strike between growth and controlling inflation has shifted, that there is a consensus that it's soft landing. You've got a new government coming in place, and that's basically what's driving our view about some sort of economic turnaround, which we think will have an impact on the construction market and the truck market. And so that's really driving our confidence. And again, with regard to inventory, just looking at the numbers that we see, we don't -- first of all, we're not keeping any, and we're not -- we don't have any inventory issues. But just looking at our customers, our view is that it will get worked down over these next several quarters, which means if indeed economic activity picks up, we will begin to see improved production levels in the fourth quarter. That's basically driving our forecast. Rich, you want to talk about truck?","Richard J. Freeland","Yes. On truck, kind of unlike excavator where we really don't have as good a data on what inventory looks like, we're developing pretty good information on this. I just returned from there 2 weeks ago and looked at all the data especially around inventory, both at our OEs and dealer. And that's been cleaned out of the system now. So it's back where it should be. So the increase we've got in Q4, which is not a significant increase, but the increase we've got built in is tied more, again, to macroeconomic. And there is a growing consensus on this, as I circled around and talked, that we'll see that recovery in Q2. And so I think unlike excavator we've got it a little bit more into the back end of the second half of the year. I'd look on the truck side kind of mid-year that we'll start to see that recovery.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then -- sorry, my last question just on your market share assumptions for North America to get to the 40% for the year?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. We had a very strong Q1 and ended up at right around 45%. I think our guidance has been 35% to 40%, and so we're now projecting to the top end of 40%. Our market share is tied really to -- in the short term, to what the production rate is at our customers. So we think going forward, our market share with each of the OEs will remain very close to what it is right now. And what we will see is we'll see some short-term adjustments as our customers either increase or reduce their build rates. And so you've seen with some of the recent announcements on reduced build rates, that will have an impact on our market share in the short term. And that's why we're projecting 40% for the year, Jamie.","Operator","And the next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan, JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about your 15-liter natural gas engine spark ignition? Your competitors have been pretty vocal out there in the marketplace talking about the fact that 15-liter spark ignition simply won't work or would work technically, but you give up a lot of power and fuel efficiency. Could you just talk a little bit about your strategy of using spark ignition versus high-pressure direct injection, et cetera?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. Well, so we have, as you know, quite a bit of experience with spark ignited now in on-highway markets. Pretty much we're the only one with an on-highway presence today in spark-ignited engines or natural gas engines period, and we've been using that technology for some time. Our view, of course, is that the demand for spark-ignited natural gas engines is driven by the lower, much lower price of natural gas in the market today. It's still -- from a fuel point of view, there's not as much infrastructure. There's other adaptations that can be made for the truck to store the fuel that are difficult and still issues to be worked out. But the price of natural gas has come down low enough where there's a whole bunch of customers interested in trying natural gas to drive various kinds of fleets. They're already -- the ones that come back home every night are already using it. But some of the fleets that were doing regional hauls and things like that are interested in trying it. And of course, we have in our Cummins Westport joint venture, already -- we're already launching a 12-liter engine, which has got enormous interest. And the idea of the 15-liter engine is, as people continue to extend out the range with which they want to take natural gas engines, that's a natural extension to the 15 liter. So that's our logic. We have, as I mentioned in my words, people are -- customers are already telling us they're really, really interested in the product. So again, we'll see when we get there. But our view is if natural gas prices stay anywhere near where they are and infrastructure continues to build out, there will be significant interest in that technology. And we think it's the best match between simplicity, affordability, efficiency and performance for the customers. And all those things, of course, matter to our customers.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Indeed. And secondly, my follow-up is back to the Power Gen. You talked a bit about orders dropping off slightly in the last few weeks. Can you talk about which regions that happened in or which applications? Is it industrial, is it oil and gas related? Can you just give a little bit more color on what where specifically you're seeing the weakness in orders?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. The weakness is in North America and it tends to be on the large projects orders. So what we've seen is global softening in data centers and healthcare in particular. But outside North America, I don't think we're seeing anything in terms of softness, actually it's strengthening.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you're still seeing strength in oil and gas. Is that correct or have you seen some weakness in that segment also?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Are you talking about Power Gen or are you talking about Engine?","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Power Gen, yes.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Power Gen, no difference in oil and gas. Again, the comments we've made about oil and gas are primarily related to the frac-ing markets. So we have -- our growth in oil and gas from an Engine point of view has been across several, but the biggest growth in the recent times has been the frac-ing market, which, as you know, has slowed down quite a bit as natural gas prices have gone down. So that's the part that's sort of softening. All -- the rest of the Power Gen -- oil and gas markets including the ones that need Power Generation equipment are not particularly slowing.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. But frac-ing, you have seen some slowing? I just want to make sure that I don't misinterpret.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. Right. And the frac-ing, just in terms of how we count things, because again, everyone has to figure that out, we put frac-ing -- the engines that we use for frac-ing rigs are in the oil and gas segment of our Engine business. And that's the part that we mentioned in our remarks looks like it's slowing pretty significantly as a result of natural gas prices falling. Frac-ing units have been moved to other uses, which again they're still running. We're still servicing them and we're still doing a lot of aftermarket business there, but they're not buying new engines for more frac-ing.","Operator","The next question comes on the line of Timothy Denoyer, Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Can I ask a couple of questions on SCR in terms of Brazil this year and China next year? And can you give us any sense of your expectations for market share in those 2 markets?","N. Thomas Linebarger","I -- boy, market share in Brazil. I'm not sure I could give you market share in Brazil, Tim. Let me just comment a few pieces on SCR in Brazil, and then I'll let Mark see if he can get -- scramble to get some numbers for you. But in Brazil, our SCR systems are primarily being offered to a couple of our customers that we've been partnering with, MAN and Ford. We are trying to pursue other customers. But we're -- on a launch basis, we're primarily with them, and that includes the engines that we make but also some engines that they make we're pursuing SCR systems on. And so that's why we're seeing even -- we're seeing growth even as, for example, on MAN, we had -- they switched to one of their own engines but we're still able to sell them aftertreatment systems. So in that sense, our business, it looks like it's going to grow quite rapidly in Brazil. As I mentioned, I was just down there. I visited our aftermarket division. I also visited some customers, and the ramp up has gone very well. The transition -- it was a big deal for Brazil to go to Euro 5 because they skipped one level. So a significant increase in the complexity of their engines and aftertreatment systems. And the ramp up went very, very well, and our customers were really pleased with our performance. So I'm very -- really excited about that. In China, there's still a fair bit of room to cover. Since we're not really launching until the middle of 2013, we know that we'll be on the Cummins engines and the JV engines that we're making. We're still working on markets with other customers. We have some very good -- some very likely customers, but we really aren't in a place to announce anything with them yet, both from a confidentiality point and just a readiness point of view.","Patrick J. Ward","What I would say, Tim, is first quarter was fairly light on Euro 5 engines, but our aftertreatment revenues were approximately $20 million this quarter in Brazil, so that's all new. Previously we'd said $100 million to $130 million of revenue this year will be towards the lower end of that given the change in the market guidance. But that's going well. And we have -- we've got significant known customer wins not just in China, Russia. We're working with some in India for future products, and we've got some new customers in Japan. So clearly, working on all other new things in the aftertreatment business and to the parts and Components. And that's why we're still confident in the strong growth rates and Components going forward.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Right. And Tim, we just don't -- I mean, again, it's just not appropriate to announce new customers just because they haven't announced. When they announce, we can announce.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Sure. Understood. And then just a quick follow-up in terms of the India truck market. You said there was a little bit of slowness there recently, it seems like with interest rate cuts and starting there. What's going on there?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. Tim, so the government's kind of reimposed a 2% excise tax on trucks, so that -- we're seeing some near-term impacts of that. I think India we're clearly not back to full robust growth yet. So I think it's a little movement around the orders. But overall, we haven't changed our full year expectation for the market.","N. Thomas Linebarger","In India, Tim, a couple of things going on. First, unlike in China, what I mentioned, inflation is still high in India. So there's still -- while they've tried to -- they've had one rate decrease, it was a one small decrease against 11 or 12 increases previously. So they're still in this the tough balance between inflation and growth. They've also seen lower tax revenues. So they're doing a whole bunch of things to raise new taxes, all of which has kind of got the economy in -- it's not that it's not growing it's just not growing as robustly as it was previously. And there's still quite a bit of to and fro and to figure out how they're going to get back there. Again, we have confidence that they will, but I think the next couple of quarters are not going to be as strong as their previous kind of high. It'll take them a little bit longer, I think to, get back to where they're seeing robust growth. Our Power Generation business is still doing really well, and part of that is some improvement as you've mentioned in some capital purchases. But largely, what we're seeing is power shortfalls in parts of the country. And that's been the experience with our Power Generation business for many years is that we -- it's some combination of nonresidential construction spending and just power issues that drive the Power Generation business. And in this case, it's largely driven by the fact that they just have power shortages.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten, Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","I mean, just a clarification. So you've heard several times of lower product coverage and -- in the first quarter and lower material costs. Can you give us a magnitude -- we've got $0.07 break from a lower tax rate that was unexpected and we'll get that for the year. Can we get a little bit of some measure of what that is? I mean, I'm sure it's not that significant, but I just thought it...","Patrick J. Ward","Well, on the product coverage, it's down about 0.6 from the first quarter of last year. So again, I made some comments that went around, but really pleased with the quality of the new products and we're at 15-year lows now with regards to product coverage. So year-over-year, that was a nice boost for us. Material costs were not as significant in the first quarter. Year-over-year, we were somewhere, what, 0.2, 0.3 of a point, Mark?","Mark Smith","Yes.","Patrick J. Ward","Improvements. So that gives you a sense of the 2. The former one, it was much more of a tailwind than material cost year-over-year.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And one other comment, and I just want to apologize in advance, but Emerson reported a lousy quarter today, and they talked about China not getting better for an extended period of time. And in your forecast, you've had a rolling forecast for improvement in China as -- you had New Year, mid-year and now it's probably a little later. Can you give us some idea what the sensitivity would be, and I assume it's probably not more than nickels and dimes. And I just wanted to ask, if we don't get much improvement in China over Europe for the rest of the year, I just sort of get some idea that market is so sensitive. But am I right in assuming that it's sort of maybe nickel or dime or something like that difference between if you do or don't get the improvement for the rest of the year?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Eli, a couple of things. First, in Europe, we don't have any forecast for a significant improvement nor have we ever. So I think that we have not changed anything there. The only thing that happened, it was in actuals. We saw an improvement in Europe and that was just because we had a very low comparison a year ago. In China though, I would agree with your point to some degree, especially in the excavator market, where we underestimated I think the inventory that was in our customers' hands. That has, again, now dampened our views of demand. And to be honest, we should have had a better view of that than we did. But in terms of our view of China, we've sort of felt like a second half -- in terms of economic recovery, second half is when we would see it, and we still believe that. Again, timing and China recovery, to your point is -- we're not -- we can't foresee the future, but that's our view based on everything we look, and we watch it a lot. Rich was just there talking with customers and other leaders. I was -- I'll be there in June, and I was there late last year. So we're doing everything we can do to try to make our best view. And what you've seen is presented as our best view of what we think is going to happen in China. If things don't recover as quickly, we'll deal with it. Again, it's hard to give a forecasted estimate because it depends on how much and at what markets and all that kind of thing. And so I can't give you an estimate, but we'll deal with it and we'll adjust expectations as necessary. But right now, what you have is our best view.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman, Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","First just a quick clarification. I know it's small, but can you remind us how big the oil and gas business is in the Engine segment?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. So we -- it's about a $300 million business that we talked about growing to $1 billion over the next 4 to 5 years. And so -- and we've said that would be down 19%. So there's a piece of it. U.S. will be down more than that. The parts business remains strong. We're still adding -- we're adding frac-ing rigs still in China, in Argentina. So the net of that is the 19%.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Got it. And then, Pat, could you talk about the cash flow for the quarter and your expectations for the remainder of the year? And if you have any kind of working capital targets that you're trying to steer towards?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. So cash flow in the first quarter is always our weakest point of the year. We've seen that last year. You see that again this year. I expect cash to be a positive inflow now for the next 3 quarters. With regards to working capital, again, I'm really pleased with the performance of the businesses here. Although working capital to dollars went up by around $200 million in the first quarter, when you look at it as a percent of sales, Adam, and compare it to the same point last year, we're 2 percentage points better. So working capital probably got a little bit more as we go through the rest of the year and the business continues to grow. But overall, cash flow will be positive. Net cash flow will be positive for the full year. And I think we talked in the last call that our target for 2012 from cash from operations is just over $2 billion again. So very strong year with regards to cash.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann, Jefferies & Company.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Most of these have been answered, I guess, but I'm curious what you're seeing in the mining markets now, where I guess you've been focused in on some growth, but we're hearing some signs of weaker production levels in various parts of the world. Can you just update us there?","Mark Smith","Yes. Steve, this is Mark, I'll start and Rich can chip in. But I mean demands remain strong, both in our customers in the U.S. and across the board. Like everybody else, we're seeing negative headlines on the U.S. coal, but that doesn't represent a significant part of our business. So right now, we continue to experience robust demand across the globe.","Richard J. Freeland","Yes. This is one where we have pretty long lead times and pretty -- so we look at the order board and just back from our biggest customer. And again, we're looking at double digits, kind of the 10%, and that order board's pretty full, and so it's really sold out almost through the end of the year right now on the mining side.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And you haven't seen anybody asking to push out orders or anything?","Richard J. Freeland","We have not. We have not.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andy Casey, Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question. As Steve indicated, a lot have been answered already. In the North American exposure, your comments on Power Gen and the weakness that we've been seeing in truck orders, have you seen any sort of similar trends in your other exposure for that region?","N. Thomas Linebarger","No. If anything, our demand from client has actually increased since the last -- our last guidance, Andy. So that's strengthened, generally. Mining's actually gone up a touch. I mean, not significant. So generally no, we have not.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Timothy Thein, Citigroup.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just on the Components margin. As we move through the year, I'm curious as to the interplay within the various segments and how that -- how you expect that will impact the margin given that Emission Solutions drove the bulk of the growth along with fuel systems. How do you see the interplay as we move through the year? Presumably if, given your expectations for recovery in the truck market in China helps to drive turbos, but just curious how that impacts you from a mix perspective.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. Tim, we don't give specific guidance for profitability within the segment. But what I will say is that we expect it to remain very solid all through the remainder of the year. And so we had fantastic first quarter. That caused us to increase guidance for the full year. We will incur more investment and spending research and development projects as we go through the year. But putting that aside, we are still [indiscernible] and all 4 businesses [indiscernible] are performing exceptionally well [indiscernible].","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, Rich, on the on-highway market in China, does the -- I recognize this is a longer-term move, but just curious in terms of the capacity ramp up or start up at DCEC. Is that at all impacted [indiscernible] in terms of your term conditions to the truck [indiscernible]?","Richard J. Freeland","We'll follow through with that. We've -- quite frankly, over the last 1.5 years, we've been busting at the seams with what we had and working 7 days a week, almost 24 hours a day. So with the adding of about 50,000 capacity, we'll follow through with that, and that'll get -- be in play later this year, be available later this year.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Our view is that addition of capacity actually has the opportunity to not only improve capacity, but also improve productivity. Because we're just too stretched there. Working 3 shifts and that many days is not the right way to do it. So adding a little capacity so we can operate closer to where we want to even at current demand will be better in terms of productivity and quality.","Mark Smith","Okay. I think time's up.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Smith, Vice President of Financial Operations. Mr. Smith, you may begin.","Mark Smith","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins's results for the third quarter of 2016. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions after our prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in our slide deck today and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial metrics. Our press release today with a copy of the financial statements and today's webcast presentation are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Revenues for the third quarter were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter EBIT was $398 million or 9.5% of sales compared to $577 million or 12.5% in the same quarter last year. Our results this quarter included $99 million increase in accrual for our loss contingency. As we have disclosed in prior quarters, the loss contingency relates to the cost of the campaign to remedy quality issues with after-treatment systems sourced by one of our OEM customers from a third-party and paired with our engine in the OEM vehicles. The combination of a Cummins engine with the third-party after-treatment system is unique to this particular OEM. We increased our accrual on the third quarter to reflect recent testing results to indicate that similar quality issues are impacting a second population of vehicles manufactured by the same OEM. We have accrued the expected cost of the campaign; the final resolution of cost sharing with our OEM customer has not been finalized. All parties are committed to supporting the vehicle owners and the agreed plan to replace the after-treatment system is currently being executed.","Excluding the loss contingency, we delivered decremental EBIT margins of 23% in the third quarter better than our target of 25% reflecting strong operational performance in the face of very weak market. Benefits from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015, strong execution on material cost reduction initiatives and productivity gains all helped to mitigate the impact of lower volume in the third quarter. Engine business revenues decreased by 12% year-over-year, primarily due to lower industry production of heavy and medium duty trucks in North America. Earnings before interest and tax was 4.8% of sales, down from 10.3% a year ago. Excluding the loss contingency, EBIT was 10.1% compared to 10.3% a year ago. Restructuring benefits, material cost reduction and lower warranty costs all contributed to the strong operating results. Revenues in our components segment decreased 8% from a year ago, with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 37% as demand for our products continues to outpace end market growth. Despite the lower sales, EBIT percent improved from 12.6% to 12.9% as strong execution of our cost reduction programs more than offset the impact of weaker volumes.","Distribution revenues decreased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 were more than offset by the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. The distribution business\u2019 EBIT for the quarter was 6.4%, down from 7.9% a year ago, with results last year benefiting from gains on the acquisition of three distributed joint ventures. The positive impact of operational improvement and increased pricing were offset by the negative impact of currency. Revenues for the power systems business declined by 13% year over year with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in power generation, commercial marine, and oil and gas markets. EBIT decreased from 7.5% to 6.9% with decremental EBIT margin just 12% due in part to 15% reduction in operating expenses in the business.","Now I will comment on some of our key markets starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the third quarter due to weaker demand in off-highway markets especially heavy duty truck. We shipped 16,400 engines to the North American heavy duty truck market in the third quarter, a decrease of 33% from a year ago. Our market share improved from the second quarter of this year and stands at 31% year-to-date. We are forecasting full-year industry production to be 200,000 units and our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30%, unchanged from our projections three months ago. Frost & Sullivan recently recognized Cummins as the leading supplier of heavy duty engines to the US heavy duty truck market reflecting the results of its extensive survey of both truck fleet and owner operators. In the medium duty truck market we delivered approximately 18,000 engines in the third quarter, down 20% from last year. Our market share through the end of August was 73% within the range of our full-year guidance of between 72% to 75%.","Industry production dipped sharply in the third quarter is not expected to improve in the fourth quarter and as a result we have lowered our full-year forecast of market size to 108,000 units from 117,000 units three months ago. Our engine shipments to North American pick-up truck customers increased by 2% in the third quarter, shipments to Chrysler declined by 11% due to planned production changes at Chrysler plant but were more than offset by shipments of V8 engine in Nissan, which we launched in the fourth quarter of last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 10% in 2016, down a little from our prior forecast of 12% growth. Our engine revenues in North America construction market decreased by 21% compared to the third quarter last year, while housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, weaker demand in the oil and gas market has led to an excess supply of used equipment. Power systems revenues declined 8% in North America in the third quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas and mining customers.","Our international revenues declined by 3% year-over-year driven by lower sales in the Middle East and Africa which more than offset growth in China. Weak commodity prices and slowing economic activity negatively impacted demand for power generation equipment in the Middle East and Africa. Third-quarter revenues in China including joint ventures were $826 million, an increase of 6% due to growth in on-highway and construction revenues. Industry demand for heavy and medium duty trucks in China increased by 30% in the third quarter. Our market share in the third quarter was 16.5%, up from the second quarter but down from 17.9% a year ago. Some OEMs have been aggressively discounting trucks this year to gain share in the near term while our partner Dongfeng has experienced a decline in the market share. We expect our full-year engines market share to be 16% compared to 16.4% in 2015. We now project full-year industry sales to increase 16% to 870,000 units this year, up from our prior forecast of 820,000 units or 9% growth.","Shipment of our light duty engines in China grew 23% in the third quarter compared to 3% increase to the overall market. As we increase penetration at Foton displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was 7.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year unchanged from three months ago. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 43% in the third quarter and our volumes more than doubled off a very small base due to stronger investment in real estate, driving up-tick in equipment market. While this was a nice increase, construction equipment markets in China are still very weak in historical terms. Revenues for our power systems business in China declined by 11% in the third quarter reflecting weak demand in marine, mining and power generation markets. Full-year revenues in China across all segments including joint ventures are expected to grow 4% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 3% due to stronger demand in the heavy and medium duty truck market.","Third-quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $376 million and flat year-over-year with lower on-highway volumes offsetting growth in power generation construction and aftermarket revenues. Industry truck production dropped by 17% compared to a year ago after a very strong first half of the year. Truck OEMs lowered build rates to reduce inventories as sales slowed in the third quarter. For the full year, we now forecast industry track production to be 340,000 units, up 6% year-over-year but down from our prior forecast of 370,000 units. We currently project our market share to be 41%, up from 40% in 2015. We currently project full-year revenues across all segments in India and including joint ventures to increase 5% consistent with our prior forecast. Strong demand in construction and improving demand in power generation are expected to offset the weaker outlook for truck. Third-quarter revenues in Brazil were $85 million, up 9% from the third quarter last year, reflecting a modest improvement in sales to on-highway markets.","Our shipments of engine to truck customers increased 5% while overall industry truck production declined by 14% year-over-year. We project full-year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from three months ago. Our sales in the Middle East declined by 12% in the third quarter, primarily impacting our power systems business and reflecting weakness in infrastructure investment in the region. As a result of the slow pace of growth in the global economy, we continued to face persistently weak demand in a number of our largest markets, our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives are helping to maintain EBIT margins well above trough levels from pre-prior cycles. In addition to reducing costs and improving productivity, we\u2019ve also continued to invest in our business to improve our competitive position throughout this protected downturn.","In the fourth quarter, we will acquire our last remaining distributor joint venture in North America completing the strategic initiative that we announced in 2013 and allowing us to improve the consistency and quality of our service and support to our customer wherever they operate. We have also continued to invest in new products, for example, we\u2019ve grown sales in market share with our QSK95 engine even in extremely challenging markets. We currently expect our full-year sales to decline by 9% consistent with our prior guidance. EBIT percent is now expected to 11.3%, down from our prior guidance of 11.6% to 12.2% largely as a result of the increased accrual for the loss contingency in the engine business. Our EBIT expectation for the components, distribution and power system businesses are all unchanged from three months ago. We remain on track to deliver our goal of 25% decremental EBIT margin for the full-year of 2016. So far this year, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plans to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders.","Thank you for your interest today and now I\u2019ll turn over to Pat who will cover our third-quarter results and full-year guidance in more detail.","Pat Ward","Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. Third-quarter revenues were $4.2 billion, a decrease of 9% from year ago. Sales in North America which represented 59% of our third-quarter revenues declined 13% from last year, due primarily to lower demand in heavy and medium duty truck markets and declines in power generation and industrial engine sales. International sales declined by 3% from a year ago as increased sales in China helped to offset weaker demand in both the Middle East and in Africa. Despite the 9% decline in revenues, gross margins of 25.3% of sales were only down 30 basis points from last year with material cost savings, productivity improvement and the benefits from the restructuring actions helping offset the negative impact from lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix.","Selling, admin and research and development cost of $670 million or 16% of sales decreased by $57 million year-over-year, mainly due to restructuring actions executed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and more spending for research and development projects. But debt increased as a percent of sales by 40 [ph] basis points. Joint venture income of $74 million decreased $4 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to lower earnings from power systems joint ventures and the acquisition of North American distributors previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures. Earnings before interest and tax were $398 million or 9.5% of sales for the quarter compared to 12.5% in year ago. Included in the quarter was an additional $99 million charge related to the previously disclosed last contingency as Tom just discussed. Excluding this charge of decremental, EBIT margin was 23% compared to the same quarter last year, slightly better than the 25% that we previously committed to. We are benefiting from a lower cost structure due to the actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015 and strong execution on material cost reductions programs and productivity improvements.","Net earnings for the quarter were $289 million or $1.72 per diluted share. [indiscernible] loss contingency, net of compensation reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.30. Net income in the third quarter of 2015 was $380 million or $2.14 per diluted share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5% more than a year ago primarily due to changes in the geographical mix of pre-tax income. I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the third quarter and provide updated guidance for the full year. In the engine segment, revenues were $1.9 billion, a decrease of 12% from last year. On-highway revenues declined 13% due to lower levels of heavy and medium duty truck production in North America. Off-highway revenues declined 6% due to continued weak global demand. Segment EBIT was $89 million, up 4.8% of sales, which included $99 million charge to increase our estimate to the loss contingency previously disclosed. Excluding this additional provision, the engine segment EBIT was 10.1% of sales compared to 10.3% in the third quarter of last year. ","Material cost savings, lower warranty expense and benefits from previous restructuring actions partially offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. For full-year 2016 we now expect engine segment revenues to be down 11% from 2015 levels, primarily due to weaker truck production in North America compared to our guidance three months ago for sales will decline between 9% and 12%. EBIT margins for 2016 are now expected to be 8.75% when taken into account the $99 million loss contingency charge, down from our prior guidance of 10% to 11%. For distribution segment, third-quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, down 3% compared to last year. The decrease was driven by a 5% decline in organic sales and a 1% unfavorable impact from stronger US dollar, which were partially offset by 3% increase in revenue from acquisitions made a year ago. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $96 million or 6.4% of sales, a decreased from 7.9% a year ago, mainly due to the fair market value gains reported on distributed acquisition in the third quarter of 2015 and from the impact of negative foreign currency movements.","At the beginning of October, we completed the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor bringing the total acquisitions to 13 since we announced the plan in September of 2013. We now expect full-year revenue to decline 1% compared to last year as additional revenue from acquisitions will help to offset weak demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment as well as headwinds from foreign currency movements. We expect full-year EBIT margins to be 6% at the midpoint of our previous guidance range. For the component segment, revenues were $1.1 billion, a decline of 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 16% as industrial production in on-highway markets declined. International sales increased 7% with a 37% increase in sales from China more than offsetting weaker revenues in Europe. Despite the lower sales, gross margins improved by 18 basis points as material cost reductions and benefits from restructuring more than offset the negative impact of retail volumes.","Segment EBIT was $148 million or 12.9% of sales compared to 12.6% of sales a year ago. We expect full-year revenue in 2016 to decline by 8% and EBIT to be 13.25% consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance. In the power systems segment, third quarter revenues were $856 million, down 13% from a year ago. Power generation equipment sales declined 12% due to lower demand especially in the Middle East and in Asia. Sales to industrial high horsepower engine markets declined by 15% as weak demand continues in oil and gas, marine and mining markets. EBIT margin were 6.9% in the quarter, down from 7.5% last year, which equates to decremental EBIT margin of 12%. Material cost reductions, lower cost following the 2015 restructuring actions and the benefits from a weaker British pound helped offset the impact from lower volumes and joint venture earnings. We now expect full-year revenues for the power system segment to decline by 14% compared to a previous guidance of down to 12% to 14% and full-year EBIT to be 7.5% of sales at the midpoint of our prior guidance.","We are now projecting total company revenues to be down 9% in 2016 consistent with our prior guidance of down 8% to 10% as we face 31% decline in industry production of heavy duty trucks in North America and very weak global demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment. We expect EBIT margins to be 11.3% of sales this year, including the charges related to the loss contingency incurred during the year representing full-year decremental EBIT margins of 25%. We now expect our full effective tax rate to be 25.5% and to deliver earnings per share of approximately $8 per diluted share this year. Turning to cash flow, cash generated from operating activities in the quarter was $576 million, $14 million higher than last year. For the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow is $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion for the same period in 2015. Working capital levels of $482 million or 11% lower from this time last year. And we anticipate operating cash flow in 2016 would be around $2 billion, similar to 2015 levels, despite the 9% drop in revenues. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $530 million to $600 million in 2016 and we still plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year through a combination of dividend and share repurchases having returned $1.3 billion year-to-date. And as you know, we increased the dividend by 5% during the third quarter and year-to-date have repurchased 7 million shares.","Now I will return it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Okay thanks Pat, and we are ready now to turn over to the Q&A section. Operator please go ahead with that part of the call. If you can limit your questions to one question and a related follow-up, please then get back in the queue.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Can you talk about the contract structure regarding the warranty cost that impacted you for the past few quarters? Going forward, are you still underwriting the warranty risk for the third-party after-treatment or were you able to get the contract structure modified on new shipments. And can you talk about in terms of the size of the population now with additional charge, what proportion of the total field population has been provisioned for?","Rich Freeland","Hey Jerry, this Rich, let me take a shot at those series of question. So as you alluded to it, it\u2019s a unique situation, we\u2019ve got our engine with a third-party after-treatment, so the only one we had kind of in the company. What we didn't hear in this quarter was we increased the accrual for a second population of vehicles and so - as we did some additional testing, we now found that the second population is going to need to have a recall also. So that was the increase that you saw in Q3. So now we have - the population is set, we estimated the cost of those accruals - of those recalls and that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in our numbers. What we have not included is the commercial negotiations with the OEM customer. And so, while we don't expect the final outcome to be materially higher, in fact, it could be lower.","As far as you\u2019re ongoing kind of what we implied in there is there more to come I guess is may be what you were also asking. What we have is there are three populations and we have accrued two of those. The third population we have not accrued and it\u2019s a different duty cycle that\u2019s involved in this third population, it has a different emission stranded, it has in fact higher than this. And third we have concluded our emissions tests and all emission test to-date have passed. And so the third population is similar in size to the other two that we have taken an accrual on. And of course we are adjusting all the agreements going forward for the ongoing issue.","And I guess lastly maybe it\u2019s implied but the fix has been put in place for some time, so the production - the product being shipped today does not have this issue, we are talking about is a fixed amount that unfortunately we've had to come back to a couple of times. And I guess one last thing to just maybe close this out is, in fact the product that we are talking about is doing terrific and we are actually gaining sales, gaining shares, I was at the plant that produces this engine yesterday, we are in the process of taking up production at the end of the year to meet increased demand, so it's an unfortunate situation, it\u2019s disappointing, it\u2019s complex, its unique but at this point, we have accrued for kind of all the known issues and then we\u2019ll kind of move into the commercial negotiations to try to finish that one up to come.","Jerry Revich","I appreciate the context. And the second question on the Hedgehog engine, obviously the end markets have been tough. Can you talk about how the production plan has been tracking versus your initial product expectations as we head into \u201817 and if you're willing to quantify the topline contribution it will be significant enough to call out as we think about \u201817 versus \u201816? Thanks.","Rich Freeland","This is Rich again. So we\u2019re actually a little bit ahead above projection on the Hedgehog despite the weak markets. And so - and that's been driven primarily due to data center markets where this is - its proven to be a terrific product to meet those markets. We are also going - have gone into production in marine applications and rail applications, so we started the year building I think three a week, we are up to - we are right now at five a week as we go into the year. And so we have - I don't have a projection for 2017 but I\u2019ll just close and say, we\u2019re really pleased with how this has gotten - how we got a good start here and despite these bad markets coming out ahead of plan. And the total topline revenue kind of in the 150 million to 180 million range this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alexander Potter","I wanted to ask I guess a couple of questions on China. First it looks like the deadlines for compliance with the new NS V and NS VI emission standards have been announced. Just hoping you can give an update regarding the incremental content you expect to be capturing from I guess each step along the way as the emission standard gets more complex and then as well as your expectations for timing and severity of any pre-buy that we might end up seeing?","Tom Linebarger","Let me take a first shot at this. So for the NF V Jerry, not a lot of - oh sorry Alex, sorry Alex. The NS V not a lot of content increase and therefore not a lot of price increase and we don't anticipate a pre-buy on the NS V. So the big step up for the content and then get into those issues will be more in the NS VI range. And I guess given the experience on NS IV, we are more optimistic about enforcement and implementation of both NS V and NS VI.","Alexander Potter","And in terms of the timing of the pre-buy associated with NS VI that would be probably something like 2019?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. Yes. At least, yes.","Alexander Potter","Okay. And then I guess the last one on China, and then I will turn it over, is the status update regarding the revolutionary engine coming out of China, coming to the US, I guess any sort of progress update you could give there, any progress you've made negotiating with OEMs in the US, as well as on the production side, a status update? Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Okay, great. Yeah. Thanks for remembering the revolutionary engine. Yes, we are on track, we\u2019re going to bring that in late 2017. We have multiple OEMs signed up to use that product. It's going to be a terrific product in kind of -- where weight is important, so in the day cab area, in the vocational markets and those that have follow Cummins for a long time think back to our M11 product that was a real success there. This is -- so we are on track, we\u2019re moving ahead with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. Two questions. One, I'm just trying to think about sort of broadly 2017 and I know you don't want to give end market guidance, but can you talk to me about what leverage you think you can pull in \u201817, assuming the markets aren\u2019t improving, whether it\u2019s restructuring, whether it\u2019s market share. And then capital allocation, whether it be share repo and where we are on the M&A front? And then my follow-up question, just I think you said the charge in the quarter was offset by compensation. Did you lower your compensation assumptions for the year, I just wanted to clarify that as well? Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Let me just get the first one first, Jamie. It\u2019s Tom. We did lower our compensation estimates and again they are related to, they relate to our performance targets for the year. So when our performance target estimates change, then we adjust our compensation up or down accordingly. So we did adjust compensation estimates.","Jamie Cook","And do you quantify, I'm just trying to figure out how much that was or what the EPS impact is for the --?","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. It's about 20 million in the quarter, I think, right.","Pat Ward","It haven\u2019t changed, Jamie.","Jamie Cook","Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. Okay. So let's get to the 2017. As you said, we won't be giving guidance. Let me just tell you how we\u2019re thinking about it so, and again Rich can add if he has some more thoughts on it. But we are going to go into the 2017 conservative on markets. As we talked about before, we don't see obvious turnaround. We do see some bottoming in some markets, but there is not an obvious instigator for turnaround, so we intend to enter 2017 much as we enter 2016, with a relatively conservative view on markets, and then trying to make sure how we get our cost appropriate, set appropriately for those markets and how we continue to fund the critical new products and new capabilities we need to succeed and grow in the market. ","Yes, we will be targeting market share, and you probably know some of the places we\u2019re doing that. Our very large engine, for example, we talked about that earlier, we\u2019re gaining share. We are expanding share in China. That's both with components and engines. We've had several new launches there that are going well. So we will be targeting to gain share in different markets where we think that opportunity exists and we will be investing to do so. But at a high level, what you will see is relatively conservative planning on market outcomes and to be aggressive on how we get costs in line to make sure that we keep our detrimental margins at 25% or below.","Jamie Cook","And any update on the M&A front, Tom, I know this has been a focus of yours, but just trying to get a sense of, if there is, if we\u2019ve made any progress I guess?","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. We\u2019ve made tons of progress, we've done lots of good work. Again unfortunately, the way that you\u2019ll hear about it is, when we have an announcement and not in one of these calls, because we can't really say anything until we say things, but yes, the thing I would say that's probably important for shareholders is we haven't changed our focus areas. We remain focused on the areas I discussed with you. We are continuing to progress in those. We remain focused on how to expand our businesses in areas that we think we have the capabilities that will make the returns meet our targets and that we can invest at some that we think we can earn a return on. So, that same conservatism about how to invest, how to make sure the things that we belong in. That's stayed the same, which, as you guess, takes a little bit more to find the right thing, but we feel optimistic and I just say for myself that I\u2019m very committed to the areas that we set out and doing in the way we set out in our strategy session with investors.","Jamie Cook","Okay, thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Hi, thank you. Tom, just following up on the idea of yours stocks going into \u201817 now, obviously folks are looking at you as maybe a way to play stronger emerging markets in the \u201817, but your comment right there seem to be a little more on the cautious side, can you give us a little more detail around how you're really thinking about the Chinese and Brazilian market and just around the horn?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. Again, I don't mean to imply that there won't be recovery in some markets, we've seen decent recovery in the Chinese truck market this year. I just mean to say that in broadly speaking, our view is that markets are across Cummins markets broadly that they continue to be weak and while we may see some bottoming, we don't have an instigator for a significant growth directly in front of us. So our view is, given that we get in this for a couple of years now, the right posture for the company to take is to assume relatively weak markets, set our cost structure accordingly, find opportunities for cost savings, productivity gains, and then continuing to invest in those opportunities where we think markets could improve and we will be able to gain share and gain business accordingly. ","So, for example, in China, you've seen us have a pretty aggressive posture with new product launch and on share gain and so if and when China starts to improve next year, if it did, we would be positioned well to take advantage of it. Of course, in Brazil, we\u2019d love to hear it. It's a very, very weak market. We're in a very strong position in Brazil, where we're ready to ramp up when the market is ready and whether it\u2019s going to ramp up in 2017, I just don't know. So again, we're still doing work on it, Dave, so we\u2019ll have a much better view in a couple of months about, if we see some of those markets actually starting to turn back, we will definitely forecast those. I just wanted to give you a sense of how we are approaching our planning rather than specifics on one emerging market or another.","David Raso","Yes. Again, I'm not trying to push through, but I mean, obviously your stocks had a valuation gap versus other names that would suggest. Yes, we understand some of the developed market weakness in truck or power gen, but the reason among, even as what it is, is that, hey, maybe Cummins gives me more that EM ramp in \u201817, right? It's not baking in a ramp in both developed and emerging markets. Otherwise, your valuation would be higher, but there is still some base case should of EMs should be up notably next year. Are you not yet seeing the order book or at least commentary from your customers that suggest that we can think about the Brazils, the Indias, the Chinas, that\u2019s up double-digit for you next year, I mean off a low basis, I appreciate it, but are you just not seeing that yet or are you seeing a little bit and not willing to say anything?","Tom Linebarger","In the China truck market, we've seen improvements already this year, I would give a forecast for the China truck market, what that means for 2017, we just don't know yet. We have not seen much of an uptake in Brazil yet. Whether or not we will be there next year, I just don't know. My view is that evaluation of the Cummins stock is really a good deal, really inexpensive. So I think it would be a good buy for anybody for any of those reasons, but again, my view is that we\u2019ll have a better view in February about what the individual markets are. I don't know what individual investors have built in about assumptions for next year, but I will say that we are, capacity wise, new product wise, market leadership wise, if markets go up, we will benefit more than anybody. ","We are positioned incredibly well for that, but we are also prepared if it doesn't turn out to do better than anybody else. And, as such, really as a management team, all we can do is be ready for both because we just don't know, really, what's going to turn around and when. But as you know, our order lead time is very short. So it\u2019s very difficult to see from just an order book point of view, what\u2019s going to happen in the middle of next year, but again, we will have a much better view in February, and I suggest we take up this conversation again then.","David Raso","I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","And so again, not trying to get too much, but if we're trying to handicap the medium duty market share for 2017, just like some of the moving parts, can you help us understand the timing of competitive products coming in to market versus your 12 liter coming in as well?","Rich Freeland","Okay, yes. Sorry, this is Rich again. Sore throat here. We don't see a lot of move in next year in the medium duty market share. There is a couple of moving pieces that you know about, so we\u2019ll see a 4-cylinder engine being introduced at low volumes, which will be a negative and we also though, we will see our share continue to grow in that. In fact, we introduced the ISL 900 engine here in Q3, which is a positive. So again, we\u2019ll give further guidance, but you ought to think of kind of more of the same in \u201817 at this time as far as market share.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And then Tom --","Tom Linebarger","So, you mentioned the ISG, which is in -- we have put in heavy duty markets, it\u2019s a mid, but heavy duty market, that's why so I just want to make sure that, because I heard you mention that, that was not included in whatever Rich just talked about.","Rich Freeland","And that will come at the end of \u201917.","Joel Tiss","End of \u201917. Okay, yes. That\u2019s what I was just trying to get the timing of the different pieces. And then on power-gen, you seem to keep cutting costs, repositioning the business and the volumes keep dropping on you, is there anything else that can be done structurally to kind of put a floor underneath those margins? And I appreciate, it's kind of a terrible and market like the whole industry is struggling, but is there anything else that feels like you\u2019re kind of chasing the decline a little bit and I don\u2019t know if there is anything else to do there? Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Joel, it's a good comment. I mean, you\u2019ve heard me express frustration about that in the past that I think while we've done a really good job on reducing costs in a lot of our segment, I do believe over the last several years, we have chased the power-gen market down as opposed to getting in front of it and I\u2019m disappointed in that for that reason. But I believe that we made a step earlier this year that is really helping us get ahead of that and find new ways to establish productivity and further reduce cost and that was by combining our large engine business with our gen-set business. What that\u2019s brought to us is some new opportunities for both how we do production, how we consolidate production and therefore take steps out of production, reduce supply chain, reduce inventory, which again means as market vary, we end up holding less stuff, we end up holding less stuff that we can\u2019t sell, et cetera. ","And then also our new product development process, we\u2019re able to streamline that to make sure that we\u2019re ready with the products that we want, because the engine produces the one that the gen-set wants and we don't produce stuff that we don't -- we don\u2019t generate new products that we\u2019re not going to use. So I feel like both of those, both in terms of efficiency, cost and asset utilization will continue to improve. We\u2019ve got one of our best leaders leading the group. So I think over the next year or two, not only do I feel like we're starting to reach some bottoms in some of the markets, I feel like we've got some renewed opportunities for cost reduction to further improve margins in that area. Now, again I thought that before, so it\u2019s really great to talk about what we got to do is deliver it and no one here is confused about that.","Pat Ward","And just to jump in for a second here, Joel. And if you keep in mind the power systems revenues go up by 13% in a quarter, and you manage to or they manage to keep detrimental EBIT margin [indiscernible] and I think you\u2019ll see more of that as we go into the fourth quarter.","Joel Tiss","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, good morning. For a similar theme and just thinking about cycles in some of your comments around markets that are bottoming and if you could just talk about kind of power-gen. Broadly, how you\u2019re thinking about it from a cycle perspective and really, how much more downside is there I think as we\u2019re sort of five years into declines? And then similarly just to address some of the high horsepower key markets and whether or not there is much downside left really in say oil mining, some of the marine markets and how confident you\u2019re in a bottom in \u201816 there?","Tom Linebarger","Great. I\u2019ll share this one, but ha it only been five years, because it feels like a decade. So it does seem like we\u2019ve been in the downcycle for a while to your point, and frankly longer than we've seen in the past, which is frustrating. So obviously we\u2019re kind of to the discussion earlier from David, we\u2019d like to see some of the things turn back. We just haven't seen yet signs that they\u2019re turning back and, of course, power generation, reflects a couple of things. One, in emerging markets, it reflects infrastructure building and general economic growth where the margins start to get under threat and things like that. And then it reflects non-res capital spending in some of the more mature markets where we\u2019re selling standby. And again, while our non-res capital spending is in a disaster in the US and our business is in a disaster, both of those statistic broadly across the world are still quite there.","So our view is that where we start to see turnaround in power-gen is when we start to see infrastructure spending starting to come back in some of these emerging markets across the world and then we see non-res capital spending coming back more aggressively in some of the more advanced countries and we just, right now, that's just not obvious when that happens. So as we were talking about, we\u2019re prepared to be at levels like we are now or a little better or a little worse and we\u2019re finding ways to get more money out of our business at those levels. We are completely ready when it turns around to gain a lot of growth, but also profitability improvements. So there is no question about that, but right now, I would just say we\u2019re approaching it conservatively. We will see what happens and Rich, I\u2019ll let you talk about some of the other large engine markets. ","Rich Freeland","Yes. I\u2019d come on mining and oil and gas, no one is calling a turnaround. Certainly, we are not and production orders. There are, I\u2019d say there is a couple of positive signs out there anyway. Commodity prices up is one, but what we are seeing is some more enquiries and some more business, both on rebuilds of products and aftermarket parts, which is generally the precursor to actual orders going up. So it's a greenshoot, but we've seen just little bit of that to give some optimism there. We are down 7% in mining this year and again, no one is really calling for that to turn around this time other than the aftermarket at least.","Joe O'Dea","And then in marine?","Rich Freeland","Marine, I would think, maybe has a little longer delay to it. I would probably be a little more pessimistic there. We're down a little heavier, and most of our marine, a lot of our marine is tied to oil and gas, so maybe 30%, 40% of our marine business is tied there. So until you see some turnaround in oil and gas, and then there will be a lag effect there, I would say I'm more pessimistic on the marine side.","Joe O'Dea","Okay, that's really helpful. And then maybe it's a little early, but just thinking about a lot of the initiatives underway this year and what it means for kind of the carryover tailwind into next year and any ability to talk to what some of the productivity and material and restructuring benefits mean just as a carryover benefit into next year?","Tom Linebarger","Right now, we\u2019ll have a hard time seeing those, because we\u2019re just putting together our plan. You can bet that our intention is to find ways to carry those over and add to those with new initiatives. That's what you\u2019ve seen from us every year, you\u2019ll see that again. We will be trying to capture the benefits of things we put in place, put in some new things to help drive more and then deal with whatever variations that we\u2019re seeing in the market. Again, that\u2019s kind of our broad approach to the plan. We\u2019ll be able to quantify those things for you though much better in February.","Joe O'Dea","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, good morning. I guess a quick clarification, Pat, what would be the material cost benefit that is expected to be seen for the full year this year?","Pat Ward","We're tracking to launch 1.5% this year, which is consistent with what we delivered last year too, Adam.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, it's pretty good. And then broadly stated, could you just maybe share your thoughts on where you think the North American on-highway markets are tracking, going into 2017. The medium duty forecast got cut for the second quarter in a row, and I'm wondering, have you got any more color on what exactly you\u2019re seeing there and then there seems to be a pretty wide range of forecast from your OEMs on what heavy duty does, I guess do you think you\u2019re leaning more on the optimistic side of a flattish market or more on the pessimistic side of more declines to come? Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Okay. I think we've probably been a little more pessimistic than most on this as we started the year, which is why we took a pretty big reduction in cost at the end of last year, anticipating this. There is no sign of a pickup out there right now. I think what you have a situation is, for many, many months, we\u2019re still producing more than orders are coming in, and that hasn't changed. So the backlog is down 85,000, which is kind of the forward order board and we\u2019re hearing from lots and lots of fleets that while businesses, they are little nervous on business, they\u2019re delaying purchases. So they had always stretched the assets out a little bit and we\u2019re in that. That\u2019s the mode we\u2019re in right now. I don't have quite the miles that I need to make a trade out and the trucks and engines are really good out there. So you can stretch a little more out of it and the lead time is really low. So if I need one, I can get it quickly. ","As we look at it, I see that fundamental business is not bad and so we\u2019re maybe moving towards where retail orders are getting close to trough. I still think though from a production standpoint, there is a step down still in there, which is what we've assumed. If you run our numbers that says, it steps down in Q4 and quite frankly, I think, would continue into Q1 on the production side. And so, retail orders getting close to trough, production is always a bit of a lag there and that's what we've seen there again. That's what we've seen in other cycles, especially towards year-end, folks take a bit of a shut down at the end of the year and they start the year out. We\u2019re planning for that kind of step down in production and whether it actually happens or not, or when it happens, what quarter, but that's how we are thinking about it kind of right now.","Adam Uhlman","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Barclays. Your line is open.","Robert Wertheimer","Good morning. I had a couple of product questions if I may. Your class 8 aftertreatment system, I think you went to a single cylinder for your own engines and for an OEM customer, it seems like it gives a lot of weight savings, and it seems beneficial in that way, is there any headwind to revenue or dollar margin of the components, because you\u2019re becoming more efficient in how you provide aftertreatment solutions to customers?","Rich Freeland","Well, first you\u2019re accurate. It\u2019s one of the big advantages, one of the couple of advantages of the new single module, which is the weight savings on it, can\u2019t pull the exact number, but over 100 pounds that will be taken out. And then, and second, what we are doing is changing the cycle to do repair on it. So take it out well beyond the first owner, so that you never have to touch the aftertreatment if you buy this. So those are some of the big advantages we've got with it. Our normal approach is what we sign up with customers is to continually take cost out of product and pass that cost -- pass on those savings to customers and the aftertreatment is in the same mode that we -- Pat talked about material cost savings and we are taking costs out and working with customers to sharing that with them.","Robert Wertheimer","Is that big enough to impact the growth curve on components or not?","Tom Linebarger","It really depends I think on, this is Tom speaking, it depends on what else we got going. I mean, I think Rich I think painted our business model pretty closely, which is it is in the components business, we are constantly trying to find ways to do the same things for less money or do more for the same money and without it, that\u2019s essentially what new products mean and without it, we don't get to be the supplier and then what we have to do is come up with new things or new capabilities, new features, new something in order to make sure that we have revenue growth.","And we\u2019ve been able to do that for the last 15 years in the components business by finding new markets to go to and new products to add, new systems to go. So if everything was status quo, it would have an impact on our revenues. Of course, everything is in status quo. For example, we just grew our business in China about 37%. So this is the kind of thing we're trying to do is to offset sales, revenue declines, driven by cost savings, which don't necessarily translate into margin dollar decline, but they do mean sales go down into other things that we can do for those customers to drive sales up.","Rich Freeland","If I could add just one more example on that would be next year, we look at India. As we go to BS4, so we will be adding content there in both the aftertreatment and the field system where we will be replacing existing supplier. So that's an example of where you\u2019d be if the step function changes, when you have emissions change.","Robert Wertheimer","Perfect, thank you. If I can ask a quick follow-up, the comments on the ISG side are pretty positive really. For clarification, do you have multiple OEMs who are sort of exploring it or with the engineering path, you can see you\u2019ve already kind of committed to putting in trucks?","Rich Freeland","We have multiples who are doing the engineering work to put it in trucks.","Robert Wertheimer","Okay, all right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks, good morning. Can you just talk about your market share in heavy duty truck in North America? It picked up sequentially, but you didn\u2019t change your full-year expectation. Can you just give a little more color on what was happening there in the quarter, was it just sort of a lumpy order and then how you\u2019re expecting that share to trend in 2017?","Tom Linebarger","Okay. Yes, Steve. Our share is the production share, so it\u2019s the share of the trucks built in a given quarter and our share is high with a couple of OEs and not so high with a couple of others, so they use their own engine. And so in Q3, we saw a couple of the ones who are low users of Cummins took their production down, which took our percent up. So that was the reason for the kind of the step function, I think we were close to 35% in Q3. Having said that, we\u2019re gaining share in the market in a lot of places. With virtually every mix fleet customer I\u2019ve talked to, and so using multiple engines, they are increasing their share with Cummins now, which we couldn't say two years now. So I think there is some phased improvement going can, but I think the big step up you saw in Q3 was more of production cycles changing and which OEs are taken down versus expanding production.","Steven Fisher","Okay, that's very helpful. And then can you remind us what the posturing is of that OEM involved and this was continuing to be a situation as we head into the commercial discussion?","Tom Linebarger","Well, see if I answer the question. You can do a follow-up if I miss it. So we are in a dispute on who pays for this, okay. So that's where the disagreement is. Quite frankly on everything else, and we've separated that and said we are going to resolve this separately, we know what the amount is, I think both companies have recruited for that and we\u2019ll run through a process to resolve what that final amount is. Everything else we are moving ahead with and how do we grow the business and move ahead. So we kind of -- the posturing is a separate path and we\u2019ve agreed to disagree and we\u2019re going to resolve it and everything else, let's go and win in the marketplace.","Steven Fisher","Okay, so they have agreed to disagree, not said, they said, we\u2019ll just work it out later and you\u2019ll get some recovery, it sort of needs to be adjudicated in some way?","Tom Linebarger","That's accurate, yes.","Steven Fisher","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with BoA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Hey, good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the China market share, it sounds like you\u2019re going to be down slightly this year. What's going on, I mean is we\u2019re trying to getting more aggressive on pricing, are you actually relinquishing any share specifically at Foton or is this just a pure customer mix issue of certain Chinese OEMs growing faster than others and it\u2019s causing your share to move around?","Rich Freeland","It's the last thing. It's just -- there are just different customers gaining share, again, there has been discounting in the market. The share was lost by some, and they went to gain some back. With our customers with Foton, we are gaining share, I talked about some of the numbers there, we\u2019re gaining share. Our ISG is doing well in the market. With Dongfeng, we are maintaining share. So we're not losing anything there. In fact, despite all the predictions, we\u2019re just as strong as we\u2019ve ever been with them. And so I feel really good about our position. I also feel really good about those OEMs, those two OEMs are building quality products, meeting new emission targets and I believe that they will restore or share they are closing. It's just during this last year, Dongfeng in particular has lost a little bit of share while some of the others have gained some through some improvement in their products to not just only discounting, but they did take some old product and launched some new products. [indiscernible] So that\u2019s never going to stop, but I think still our product is both competitive from a performance and cost point of view in China.","Pat Ward","Thanks, everybody and I will be available for calls later on.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Ross.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mark Smith for any closing comments. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"6193":["Cummins Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.","Mark Smith","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2015. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger, our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward and President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions after our prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available at our website at cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now, I will turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I will start with a summary of our third quarter results and the actions we are taking to respond to very weak demand in a number of important markets. I will also provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the rest of the year.","Revenues and earnings in the third quarter declined from a year ago as a result of very weak demand in global off-highway and power generation markets and a continued slowdown in Brazil and China. Although we anticipate lower demand in these markets, orders have fallen further than expected, causing disappointing results for the company in the third quarter and a lower outlook for the full year.","We have already taken a number of actions to reduce cost across the company, especially in the power generation business. However with further weakening in most of our end markets and no clear signs of improvement in the near-term, we are now implementing additional restructuring and cost reduction actions.","First, we will reduce our professional headcount by approximately 2,000 people, with the majority of these reductions to be completed by the end of year. We expect these reductions will reduce cost by between $160 million and $200 million on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter of this year, we will record costs of between $70 million and 90 million associated with this action.","Second, we are reviewing our manufacturing capacity in each business and region on a -by-facility basis and we will evaluate if restructuring actions are required in any of our plants. We expect to complete this evaluation by the end of the fourth quarter and will take actions as needed.","Revenues for the third quarter were $4.6 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the third quarter of 2014 with currency negatively impacting sales by 4%. Third quarter EBIT was $577 million or 12.5% of sales, compared to $684 million or 14% in the same quarter last year. Margins in the quarter were negatively impacted by reduced volumes, a lower mix of high horsepower engines, currency and pricing. Theses impacts were partially offset by improvements in material cost and supplier pricing, reductions in warranty costs and distributor acquisitions.","Engine business revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year with very weak demand in global off-highway and power generation markets resulting in the lowest quarterly shipments of high horsepower engines since the third quarter of 2009. Production in the truck market of Brazil is the lowest since 2004 and the industry sales in most end markets in China are at multiyear lows. Demand in these markets will inevitably recover, but in the near-term conditions remain very challenging.","EBIT of 10% of sales was down from 11.7% a year ago due to lower volumes and weaker mix which offset the benefit from material cost and improved warranty costs. As a result of a lot of focused work across the company, warranty cost in the third quarter were well below the levels in the first half of this year and lower than third quarter last year. This was true both for the engine business and for the company as a whole. Warranty cost for the company were 2% in the third quarter, down from 2.6% in the second quarter and 2.4% last year.","Revenues in our components segment decreased 4% year-over-year with a negative impact of currency, pricing and very weak demand in Brazil offsetting volume growth in North America and China. Revenues in China grew 19% despite a 24% decline in the truck market in the third quarter as we continue to capitalize on the new NS4 emission regulations.","EBIT of $156 million or 12.6% declined from 13.4% last year as a result of lower volumes in our turbo business and the negative impact of currency and results in our filtration business. Distribution revenues increased 20% compared to the second quarter of 2014 with acquisitions adding 27% and currency negatively impacting sales by 8%.","EBIT for the quarter was 7.9%, down from 10.1% a year ago. EBIT percent declined due to currency, primarily the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Australian and Canadian dollars and the dilutive effect of acquiring businesses previously held as joint ventures. Excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, operating margins in our distribution business improved year-over-year.","We completed three distributor acquisitions in North America in the third quarter as planned. Our forecast for the positive impact of acquisitions is unchanged from three months ago. We expect to add approximately $600 million to company revenues this year in addition to the more than $460 million added in 2014, exceeding the $1 billion in revenues we projected for 2015 at our last Analyst Day. We currently expect to add $0.20 to our earnings per share this year on top of the $0.43 added in 2014 for a total of $0.63, also ahead of our 2013 projections of $0.50 per share.","In the power generation business, revenues decreased 13% year-over-year with lower sales in most major markets except the Middle East and India. The decline reflects very challenging conditions in our markets as a result of weaker investment in infrastructure in emerging markets and declining capital spending by data center operators in North America. EBIT declined from 8% last year to 6.4%. The negative impact of lower volumes and pricing more than offset 100 basis point improvement from cost reduction actions.","Now I will comment some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 4% in the third quarter due in part to the positive impact of the distributor acquisitions. Shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 24,000 units in the third quarter, a decrease of 9% from the third quarter last year. Our market share to-date is approximately 34%. Based on current projections from our OEM customers, we expect our full-year market share to be in the range of 33% to 34%, below our prior projection of 34% to 35%. We expect the full-year market size to be approximately 286,000 units, up 7% from 2014, but down 4,000 units from our prior forecast.","In the medium duty truck market, we delivered more than 22,000 engines in the third quarter, up 10% from last year. We currently project that market will be flat for the year, lower than our previous forecast of growth of 3%. Our forecast for market share is now 78% for the year, up from 72% last year and higher than our previous forecast of 76%.","Shipments to Chrysler increased by 6% in the third quarter and we forecast full-year shipments to increase 3% compared to 2014, up slightly from our previous forecast of up 2%. Our engine shipments to the North American construction market decreased by 35% compared to the third quarter last year. This decline is partly explained by the pre-buy in 2014, ahead of the Tier 4 final emissions regulations and partly by weaker demand due to economic conditions.","Power generation revenues declined by 12% in North America in the third quarter, due primarily to lower sales to data center customers. We are winning new orders from data center customers in Europe and Asia, but the rate of investment in North America has slowed. Cummins International revenues declined by 18% year-over-year due to very challenging market conditions and the negative impact of an appreciating U.S. dollar.","Third quarter revenues in China including joint ventures were $775 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year. Very weak demand across our key end markets more than offset market share gains and growth from new products. Industry demand for heavy and medium duty trucks in China declined by 24% in the third quarter and is down 29% year-to-date as the industrial economy continues to slow. We are maintaining our full-year forecast for the truck market to decline 30%.","Our third quarter engine shipments were flat year-over-year. In very challenging market conditions, we increased our market share by 550 basis points year-over-year to more than 16% as shipments of our new heavy duty ISG engine to Foton increased and our market share with Dongfeng improved. We expect our market share to increase again in the fourth quarter to 17%.","Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 2% in the third quarter and are up 21% year-to-date in a market that's down 9%. We gained penetration to Foton and other Chinese OEMs displacing local competitor engines. Our light-duty market share has increased 160 basis points to over 6% so far this year.","Our power generation revenues declined by 32% compared to a strong quarter last year and are down 3% year-to-date due to lower infrastructure investment and a low rate of growth in electricity consumption, consistent with a weaker economy. Demand for construction equipment remains very depressed in China due to the slowdown in real estate development and infrastructure spending. Industry demand for excavators in China declined 31% in the third quarter compared to very weak numbers last year and is down 40% year-to-date with no clear sign of improvement. Our construction revenues declined by 21% in the third quarter.","Full year revenues in China across all segments including joint ventures are now expected to be flat for the year, down from our previous projection of 6% growth due to weaker market demand in power generation, light-duty truck and construction markets. We continue to gain market share in the world's largest truck market, despite increasing competition and a weak market. And with more emission changes ahead, we are well-positioned to continue to outperform our end markets here.","Third quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $378 million, up 7% year-over-year due to growth in our truck and power generation businesses, partially offset by depreciation of the Rupee against the U.S. dollar. We now expect industry truck production to increase 27% for the full year, up from our prior forecast of 22% growth. Bharat Stage IV emission standards went into effect in the North of India in October and countrywide adoption is expected in April 2017 which should present opportunities for further growth for Cummins, particularly in our components business.","Power generation revenues in India increased 12% in the third quarter as demand slowly improves from very weak levels last year. Government plans for further investment in infrastructure should stimulate stronger demand going forward. In India, we project total revenues including joint ventures to increase 12% for the full year, consistent with our previous forecast.","Third quarter revenues in Brazil were $78 million, down 43% from the second quarter as the economy is in recession and the Real has depreciated by almost 60% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production declined 53% year-over-year in the third quarter and is down 47% year-to-date. Our engine shipments are down 43%. We are maintaining our full year projection for industry production of trucks to be 70,000 units, the lowest level since 2004 and decline of 50% from 2014.","Revenues in our power generation and distribution businesses have declined less than the truck business but demand is down significantly in all markets. Global shipments of our high horsepower engines in the third quarter declined by 18% compared to a year ago and were the lowest since the third quarter of 2009, reflecting a severe and prolonged impact of slower growth in emerging economies and weaker commodity prices. Demand in our mining, oil and gas and commercial marine business are all impacted, with full year volumes in these markets expected to decline by between 20% and 40%. All this is exacerbated by lower demand in power generation markets.","Given the weaker markets we are facing, we are lowering our forecast for company revenues and EBIT. We now expect full year sales to be flat to down 2% compared to our previous guidance of growth between 2% and 4%. Earnings before income tax is now expected to be in the range of 12.75% to 13%, also down from our previous projection of 13.5% to 14%.","I want to close by saying that while this is no doubt a difficult time in our markets, we have been here before. We have a management team at Cummins that has proven capable of effectively managing through periods of weak demand. We will take the right actions to ensure the company emerges with higher profitability and stronger leadership positions in our major markets just as we have in the last three cycles.","We look forward to our Analyst Day in November 10 in New York where we will share how we will deliver profitable growth even in this environment and generate strong returns for our shareholders.","Thank you for your interest today and now I will turn it over to Pat who will cover our third quarter results and full-year guidance in more detail.","Pat Ward","Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.6 billion, a decrease of 6% from a year ago. The acquisitions of the North American distributors added 3% to revenues, but were more than offset by a 5% decline in organic sales in addition to a 4% reduction from unfavorable foreign currency movements.","Sales in North America which represent 62% of our third quarter revenues increased by 4% from a year ago, primarily due to distributor acquisitions. International sales decreased by 18% compared to the prior year as a result of weak demand in global off-highway markets, more sales across all markets in Brazil and from the negative impact of foreign currency movements against the U.S. dollar.","Gross margins were 26.1% of sales, down 20 basis points from a year ago. The benefits of lower material and warranty costs were offset by a combination of weaker volumes and unfavorable mix and more heavy-duty and high horsepower engine sales, negative foreign currency impacts and from pricing.","Selling, admin and research and development costs of $727 million or 15.7% of sales were flat with the previous year in dollar terms, but increased by 80 basis points as a percent of sales. The increased cost associated with the distributor acquisitions were offset by the benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar. Joint venture income of $78 million decreased by $21 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to the acquisitions of North American distributors, previously held as joint ventures. Earnings from our joint ventures in China increased 12% year-over-year due to the market share gains made in on-highway markets.","Earnings before interest and tax were $577 million or 12.5% of sales for the quarter compared to $684 million or 14% of sales last year. Earnings per share were $2.14, a decrease of 8% from the $2.32 reported in the same quarter last year and the tax rate was 30.1% for the quarter. This is a disappointing set of results after coming off a strong second quarter. In fact, July margins continued to improve over the second-quarter levels. However, demand weakened in August and has continued further into September.","Let's now move on to the operating segments and further discuss third-quarter performance and the revised outlook for the full year. In the engine segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 10% from the same quarter last year. Off-highway revenues declined by 20%, primarily due to weak demand in global construction and marine markets. On-highway revenues declined by 5% as a result of weaker demand in Brazil and more global demand for heavy-duty trucks, partially offset by an increase in North American medium-duty truck and global bus revenues.","Segment EBIT was $252 million or 10% of sales, down from 11.7% last year. Gross margins dropped as a result of the lower volumes and a less favorable product mix. Shipments of high horsepower engines declined 18% from the prior year and were the lowest volume since 2009, has contributed to the unfavorable product mix. Both selling, admin and research and development costs were lower than last year. They increased 100 basis points as a percent of sales due to the lower sales revenues.","For the full year, we now expect revenue for the engine segment to decline 5%, as demand in off-highway markets continues to weaken and industry production in North America truck market slows. The reduction in volumes has also caused us to lower our outlook for segment profitability. Full year EBIT margins are now expected to be 10.75%, compared with 11.2% in 2014.","For the distribution segment, third-quarter revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions completed in the last 12 months added 27% to segment revenues year over year, but were partially offset by foreign currency movements that negatively impacted sales by 8%.","EBIT margins for the quarter declined in both dollars and as a percent of sales, from 10.1% a year ago to 7.9%, primarily due to the negative impacts of foreign currency movements, which lowered the EBIT margins by 220 basis points. An improvement in the margin of existing businesses increased segment margins by 100 basis points, but this was offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions.","For the full year of 2015, distribution revenue is now forecasted to grow 20% at the midpoint. This reduction reflects a larger-than-expected impact from foreign currency compared to the forecast from last quarter. We now expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 7%, compared to our previous guidance of 7% to 8% of sales.","The components segment recorded revenues of $1.2 billion, a decline of 4% compared to the third quarter last year. Increased sales in North America and sales from the new NS4 compliant products in China were more than offset by negative impacts from foreign currency and to a lesser extent from pricing.","Segment EBIT was $156 million or 12.6% of sales, a decline of 80 basis points from a year ago. Gross margins were relatively flat to last year, with improvements in material cost more than offsetting lower pricing, unfavorable mix and the negative impact of foreign currency. While selling, admin and research and development spending was flat in dollar terms year over year, they increased 60 basis points due to the lower revenues in the quarter. We now expect full-year revenues in 2015 to be up 1%, which is lower than our previous estimate of 4% to 8% growth. We have also lowered our EBIT projections for the full year to be in the range of 14.25%. This compares to a full-year 2014 margin of 13.4%.","In the power generation segment, third-quarter revenues were $659 million, a decrease of 13%. Year-over-year, international revenues declined 14%, primarily in Europe, China and Russia, which were partially offset by growth in the Middle East, India and in Africa. Currency movements reduced sales by 3%. In North America, revenue declined 11%, due to lower demand for the large standby generators used in data centers, along with reduced military sales. EBIT margins were 6.4% in the quarter, down from 8% last year. Weak demand, the negative impact of currency, primarily the depreciation of the Euro against the U.S. dollar and lower pricing in the alternator business more than offset the benefit of cost reduction actions. For the full year, we now expect power gen revenues to be 5% lower than last year and for the EBIT margins to be 6.75% of sales.","We are now projecting total company revenues to be flat to down 2% in 2015, due to the weakness in off-highway and power generation markets, along with a slowdown in demand in some markets in North America. We are maintaining our forecast for joint venture income to decline 15% from 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of distributors in North America previously held with joint ventures. We still expect joint venture revenues in China to grow this year as a result of the market share gains and new product sales in on-highway markets, which will partially offset the declines from the distributor acquisitions.","We have now forecasted EBIT margins for the company to be in the range of 12.75% to 13% of sales, excluding costs associated with the restructuring and other cost-reduction actions. Compared to the second half of 2014, we now expect sales to be down around 7% and decremental margins to be around 25% for that period. The full-year tax rate of 29.5%, excluding discrete items, remains unchanged.","And finally, cash flow generated from operations through the first nine months of the year was $1.1 billion. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 15% of sales for the full year, with stronger cash flow generation in the second half of the year than the first, as is typical for our business. Capital expenditures will now be between $650 million and $700 million, down from our previous guidance of $700 million to $800 million.","During the third quarter, we announced 25% increase in our quarterly dividend and year-to-date we have returned $1.1 billion to shareholders, including the repurchase of five million shares. Our cash balance has declined by over $600 million so far this year, due to reinvestment in the business and higher returns to shareholders due to increased dividend payments and share repurchases.","Despite strong results from our cost reduction efforts and material costs, supply chain and quality and the success of a number of new product launches, we are disappointed that the results were weaker than expected in the third quarter as demand in a number of important markets weakened further. We are addressing our cost structure in light of the weaker demand, as Tom highlighted and we are confident that we will announce some stronger performance as demand improves, just as we have done in prior cycles.","Finally, I want to remind you of the upcoming Analyst Day on November 10 in New York.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Okay. Thanks, Pat. And now we are ready to move to the Q&A section.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Steve Volkmann","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning, Steve.","Pat Ward","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Volkmann","So yes, I guess obviously the focus is kind of shifting quickly to 2016 and I am guessing you probably don't want to say too much about that yet, but I am wondering if you can give us your thinking about the various programs you may have that could continue to get traction above whatever we think the market is doing in 2016? And I guess I am thinking about the China NS4 stuff and are there other areas where you think there is a penetration story that can help us in 2016? Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Steve, as you mentioned, China is a good one and that, we think, is both an engine and components opportunity for the company. Hedgehog, our large-engine program, is another one. We were really just getting started with that, but it's another opportunity for us to grow both in large gen sets and in engines. India is an opportunity, as I mentioned, where emissions hurdles, the Bharat Stage IV hurdles are just the place where now you will start to see some aftertreatment and electronic engines go into the market. So that again gives us a chance. That's mostly a content and components opportunity because we already have quite a share in terms of the engines.","Rich, anything I left out there that you would highlight?","Rich Freeland","The only one I would add is, we will introduce the Nissan engine. That goes into production here in Q4 and it will begin ramping up in Q1 next year.","Tom Linebarger","I guess the other more big story, I think, for Cummins is, we are really focused in the distribution segment on acquiring and really integrating the back office of the distributors. We really haven't done anything on sales or cost synergies in a significant way in the distributors. We will really be more active on those elements in 2016, which we think again provides both sales opportunities as we begin to focus our attention on national accounts and put more engineering attention on some of the more technical intensive projects and then also on cost synergies from consolidations and other opportunities inside the distribution system. So that, I think, also gives us an opportunity above the market.","Steve Volkmann","Great, I appreciate that. And maybe, could I just get you to comment quickly on pricing? You called it out a couple of times in your prepared remarks, I think in components and alternators. But can you just give us a sense of your view of what's happening in pricing?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. As we highlighted last time, in the power gen segment we have now seen some pricing competition come in, primarily as a result of low Euro. So there is just a number of competitors in the European area that are Euro based costs and so areas where Eurozone exporters can compete with us, we are seeing some price competition in the gen set. There is not a lot of excess capacity and those kind of things that may generate a more broad scale, but we are seeing competition there, which is why you saw the negative impact on pricing.","And again, power gen because it is basically a retail sale, that's often an area where we can increase price, instead we are seeing backward prices on that. We are seeing pricing, as always, in our components areas. We have contractual kind of arrangements there which is normal, but we are more than offsetting those with material costs. So as you heard, material cost opportunities, we have been taking advantage of those all year. We think it's another big opportunity next year. So we are very focused on material costs to more than offset any kind of pricing.","Steve Volkmann","I appreciate it. I will pass it on. Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning, Andy.","Andy Casey","I was wondering, a couple questions. First on the benefit from the restructuring headcount. I think that's the $160 million to $200 million you called out. Is that all to be realized in 2016? Or does some of that carry over into subsequent years?","Tom Linebarger","It's an annualized figure that we are generating an annualized estimate and we are really, as you heard from our remarks, we are trying to get all of our work done this year. It won't all get done because in some jurisdictions, there is just some legal requirements and other things, so that won't work perfectly and so that will make it not perfect for our 2016 number. And as you guessed, there's a lot of other moving parts which will impact it, but think of it as an annualized figure based on an estimate of reducing all those people and we will have a very, very hard focus on doing those things as quickly as we can and getting them all done in the fourth quarter.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks. And then I wanted to go back to Pat's comment about more of the short-term stuff that you saw during the quarter. I think the comment was faster demand drops as the quarter progressed. Could you give a little more color as to in what region and\/or segments you saw that?","Pat Ward","Yes. Andy, so as I said we had a really very good second quarter and we followed that off with an even better July. We did start to see a bit of a slowdown in August, mainly in the components and engine segments. That's not unusual. So having that slowdown in August is not the first time that's happened. What was surprising and disappointing was the slowdown continued into September, again primarily in those two segments. Power gen came off a little bit as we went through the quarter, but most of it was in those two that I just mentioned.","Andy Casey","Okay. And then, Pat, just within the power gen side, it seems like that changed a little bit from your prior guidance. Is that another area where you just don't see any short-term reversal in the trend?","Pat Ward","It's hard to see any immediate pickup in many of these industrial off-highway markets. Power gen has been down for a period of time just now across many regions and I would not anticipate any recovery in the short term in power gen.","Tom Linebarger","Okay. The only part we are seeing a little bit of improvement in India, a little bit of improvement in Middle East, but we are not counting on any improvement going forward and a lot of the restructuring that we are talking about will again be aimed at the power gen area.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks a lot, Pat and Rich.","Tom Linebarger","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ross Gilardi","Good morning. Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Hi. Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Hi. Yes. I am just trying to understand the shortfall in components a little bit more and the cut to guidance. The revenue weakness seems to be more specifically in turbo and filtration, as opposed to emissions and what is driving that? And where specifically is the weakness geographically? And then, I had a follow-up to that.","Tom Linebarger","Again, just going back to Andy's question. So we had a fall-off in the third quarter and we saw segments where we normally have some down days. They just took more down days. So construction in particular and truck, we just saw more down days than we had anticipated, unplanned down days. Those impacted components, for sure.","And as you mentioned, the turbocharger and filtration business was hurt harder, more than the rest. Filtration was really a currency story. So they have more global aftermarket, which just turns into lower U.S. dollars because it's all over the world and we get lower U.S. dollars because of the currency.","Turbochargers had the same impact as everybody else, plus China truck, where I mentioned the truck market is down. We are offsetting that with market share gains with our engines and components, but turbocharger already has a big market share across all engine suppliers. So while they got the benefit with Cummins engines, they got the decrease from the other engines. So they have had an offset compared to everybody else who just gained with Cummins' market-share gains.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you. And then just on components like longer term, how should we think about just the resilience of profitability? Clearly, it's been one of your strongest businesses even through a lot of the softness we had seen in emerging markets perhaps until this quarter. But eventually, should we look for demand to just follow truck build lower with a lag over the next couple years? Or do you think this business can continue to grow and why?","Tom Linebarger","Again, at a high level, the opportunity remains for the components business to get above market growth in those areas where emissions requirements are increasing. So we just talked about China, for example, where we are gaining market share and gaining more content because emissions hurdles are being implemented. India, we just mentioned as well. And then off-highway, we are still working through the globe on Tier 4. So we are a small way along.","I think in markets like the U.S. market, where you are seeing both the emissions hurdles have largely been done, then you will see components business largely track with the end markets that we are supplying them to. So it's a mix story, but we definitely feel like there are significant secular opportunities in the components business to continue to grow above the market levels and to grow profitability.","And again, in the components segment, like most of Cummins' businesses, the opportunity to stay ahead is that we have the lead in technology. If we lead in technology, we can sell our products for good margins and continue to grow them. If we fall behind in technology, that becomes more challenging and then we compete more on price. So that remains the same strategic formula for us in components as it does in engines and most of our end markets.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. I guess two questions. One, the weakness that you have seen, Tom, has been primarily in the emerging markets, off-highway, high horsepower type markets. But the concern from the market is, the market that's still doing pretty well for you that's driving components and engine, which is North America truck, is ready to roll. You have seen used truck prices weaken. We have heard about production cuts. We heard some of the customers drawing in their CapEx. So relative to where you were last quarter, how do you think about North America truck into 2016? And is that one of the reasons why you are contemplating additional restructuring relative to what you have already announced this quarter?","And then, my second question sort of relates to capital allocation. In a lower growth environment, how do you think about buying back stock versus just building cash? Or the other side of it is, Tom, you have been a little more aggressive on the M&A front, I would say, relative to your predecessor. So given the success that you have had with North American distribution acquisitions, would you be more willing to look at acquisitions in a downturn? Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Okay. Jamie, that's some big ones. I am going to let Rich talk about North American truck because he is very close to it.","Rich Freeland","Okay. So hi, Jamie. As you know, we took our guidance down by 4,000 units, so down just a bit. And like we said last quarter, production has been running higher than orders and that we needed a pretty healthy order board through Q3 and Q4 where eventually the production had to look closer to orders. And while the orders were solid and good, we are not at the rate, still didn't keep pace with production. So the backlog now is down to 137,000 units, which is from the peak of 190,000. So it's down a bit. It's not a weak backlog. In fact, it's higher than it was a year ago at this time, but the sentiment has clearly changed, some of the things you talked about.","So, the way that plays out for Cummins is that when the backlog gets lower, not all the build slots are full in a given week or month or quarter. And so, we see some pretty near term reductions in requirements for engines. And we saw that in Q3 and, frankly, we see that continuing into Q4 and into 2016. And so it's evident now that retail sales and production will be down going forward. We are not calling out exactly what that is at this point. The freight actually is pretty good, but some of the indications we talked about, like truck prices, dealer inventories are up, cancellations are up a bit, there is a lot of moving pieces there.","So that's exactly why we took the actions now that were taken, in anticipation of that, not declaring exactly where that will end up. What you will see is our plants are very flexible at adjusting to this. They were designed to flex quickly. So in weeks and months, not over quarters. So as production goes up or down, our whole system is set to flex and so we are already doing that in our production plants.","Tom Linebarger","Thanks, Rich. And then, Pat, do you want to talk a little bit about stock buyback?","Jamie Cook","Capital allocation","Pat Ward","So you will recall, Jamie, that at the last Analyst Day we committed to return 50% of cash from operations to shareholders and we did that in 2014 and we feel we are going to exceed that in 2015. Now we have repurchased five million shares so far this year. As soon as the blackout ends this week, we will be back in the market to buy more stock at this price in Q4. So clearly in a environment that we have got, lower growth outlook at least in the short term, we have been looking to do some more there.","On the mergers, acquisition type question, I think it's probably best to hold our remarks until we get to Analyst Day. We will have more to say on that subject, as well as the whole point about capital allocation over the next two or three years when we get to that point in the year.","Tom Linebarger","If I can just add, Jamie, I think we increased our dividend after last quarter and we are in a tough period and we want to make sure our shareholders knew that we feel strong and sustainable through this period and we do. And we will increase stock buybacks, as Pat said. So just as we talked about before, 50% is our guideline, but we think today our cash flow remains strong and our opportunity to repurchase shares looks stronger. So we will be active and more active than we would have been in a different circumstance. And as Pat said, we have a lot to say about how we are going to grow in this environment and we will talk a lot about that and we will include capital allocation and M&A and all that in our discussion in November. So thanks for the question, though.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Great. I will reserve the rest for November 10. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Well that was a fancy pronunciation.","Tom Linebarger","You are French now, Ann.","Ann Duignan","It's almost, Gaelic, Pat. Let's take a step back to components, if we can. I know you said that pressure on pricing was contractual and normal, but can you help us think about pricing going forward, then? Is this once you reach a certain volume with a customer, you give them X percent back? Or is it giving up lower input cost? If you could just give us a little bit more color there, because it was a little bit of a surprise that pricing was negative in components.","Tom Linebarger","Yes. Ann, it's all those things and it's actually not a surprise in the sense that we always have done these contractual things. Again, the big difference in pricing now is we normally have offsets that make pricing for the company look neutral or positive and that's because you normally got markets, off-highway markets and power gen markets and parts that push up and then you have got your normal contractual things that push down and the whole thing adds up too fine.","And in this case, you have got power gen dropped the other way, the off-highway markets are very challenged, so then just pricing shows up. But the answer to your question specifically about components is, some of the agreements are just contractual on time. Some are related to metal markets or other kinds of agreements related to back door prices. Some are related to introduction of cost reductions that we made and then we offer some to customers. So, it's a range of those things. It's not as standard as you would guess in our negotiations with customers.","We like zero of those. So we are always negotiating for less or none and they are negotiating for more and we end up with some compromise in those agreements that we think adds up to good returns and profitability for us and that's how they are set up. So the reason though, you are seeing them in our variance analysis today is because they don't have the same offsets they would normally have.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And would you expect that to persist going forward on the components side specifically?","Tom Linebarger","It's going to be challenging in this environment because, as I mentioned, the markets that we are normally relying on to push prices through look like they are mostly not. We are not able to push prices through and again, power gen, they look challenging the other way. Again, the thing I would just say is that we are more than offsetting those with material costs. So the same environment exists for our suppliers and we are taking full advantage of that. And so, the margin enhancements that we are getting for material cost is more than offsetting the pricing hit. So volumes is what we are challenged by, as opposed to pricing versus cost.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate the color. I think most of my other questions were answered. Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi. Good morning. With the announced restructuring and outlook across power gen and some of the components challenges in emerging markets, could you just talk about and these markets have now been down for a while and so how you address that over the course of the quarter to come to the conclusion that is it going to go further down from here? Is it more an expectation of stabilization around a bottom, but not getting better for a while? Just how your view has developed there?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. Joe, it's a complicated answer because each market is a little different, but let me just try to hit it at 10,000 feet. The answer is that we have set our plan not expecting a whole bunch of improvements in those markets, but they were starting to bottom, just as you suggest and if anything would be level or coming up. And in fact, what's happened is they have gone down further. And that's, I think, what maybe is the thing that says we haven't clearly bottomed in most of those markets. We thought we had and we have not and where the bottom is, we are not exactly sure, but it doesn't look like we have reached it. And there still looks like to be a general weakness in off-highway markets across the world and not a lot of instigators for improvements in those economies that would suggest infrastructure spending or commodity prices would start to come up.","And then on the truck side, as we have also already said, we have seen further down days and other things that make us more concerned about next year than we were, say, three months ago or six months ago. So all those things combined together, they are not the same trend or whatever, but all of them came together to say to us, hey we are at a different business level globally than we anticipated being at this time and on a different trend.","Joe O'Dea","Okay. And then on North America truck and as you see build coming down into the fourth quarter, could you just talk about any incremental pricing risk you see there, either related to the contractual side of things or whether it's additional pricing pressure that you are feeling, but how much risk we could see on the margin side moving into lower build rates?","Rich Freeland","Joe, this is Rich. Nothing on the pricing side on the engine side. Again, we have long term contracts and those won't change going forward. But nothing on the engine side on pricing.","Joe O'Dea","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich","Hi. Good morning.","Tom Linebarger","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","You folks have focused on structurally improving margins with your restructuring actions in prior downturns. Can you just talk about how the biggest opportunities you see for Cummins on the other side of the manufacturing footprint adjustment? And just maybe touch on the broader high level framework that you folks are thinking about in sizing the business plan and the structural changes that we should look for.","Tom Linebarger","Yes. It's a good question, Jerry. So as you said, just like the last downturns, we will take action that we think will put us in a position to emerge from this weakness stronger than competition and to be able to grow faster and raise profits, just as we have done the last three times. And so, we do have a framework on that. Our first step, as you see here, really is trying to bring our professional workforce down to what we think the business level and business trends look like for right now. The second thing you saw in our announcement is to look through our facilities to see if there are opportunities to do some kind of structuring that we think leads us to a better cost position over time.","And as Rich was saying, we adjust our plants pretty quickly to demand, but at some point, opportunities get created, where you say I am now at a low enough level of supply here that I can potentially put these together or move this to another place where I can be in a better position cost wise and we will look for those opportunities, for sure. As I mentioned in our announcement, we are going to spend the next quarter looking at those because we want to make sure we understand them really well and we make the right structural calls from a long term performance point of view. So we will do that and those decisions will be made over this quarter. We are, as you would guess, very active on that project already and so there will be things along the way. But we will be done with that this quarter.","And then, the last thing is that as we look through our new product introductions and programs, we have been for the last couple of years making sure that we are keeping our costs under control, but positioning ourselves in the key markets for when they return to gain share and gain margin in those markets. And so you see what we are doing in China today. So increasing, we are launching in markets which we think, when they return, will be large and profitable for Cummins. We will continue to push on our product portfolio in those areas so that we can indeed emerge stronger. So think of it in terms of products, facilities and cost structure and then overall overhead and the workforce for business levels. Those are the broad framework of what we will be looking at, just as we have before.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then from a shorter term standpoint, the guidance looks for 100 basis point improvement in engine and components margins 4Q versus 3Q. Can you just bridge for us the major building blocks? How much of it is adjusting the plants? It sounds like your lead times were low in 3Q. I guess how much of that margin expansion target do you feel like you already accomplished to start the quarter? Any color there would be helpful.","Pat Ward","Yes. I think we have the Q4 derived guidance, if you back into the number, failed a bit in defense in both the components and the engine segments, which were the ones that fell off most in August and September. So we have been taking actions in the manufacturing plants to get their cost structure in line with demand for the fourth quarter. So I would expect their margins to improve, based on the actions we have taken so far and are taking right here as we speak. We also expect warranty average as being a good improvement as we have seen in the third quarter as they continue at these levels and probably got a little bit better, actually, in the energy segment with what we have seen in Q.","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","So my question is around China market share and I guess it's more of a medium term question. So you guys have made a lot of progress there, I think you gained more share than we had expected. So I am curious, once we get to 2016 and even beyond that, how much market share do you think you can gain on a sustainable basis in China in the future?","Tom Linebarger","On our last analyst conference, Nicole, we talked about this and we had hoped to be about where we are by the end of the period. So 2017 or 2018, we had hoped to be here. And I had said at that time, much to my leader in China's chagrin, that what I was really targeting long run was 25% share. So to me, that's Cummins' entitlement. If we could be at 25% share, I feel like that's being fully deployed with our two biggest partners and then also playing a role, albeit smaller, in the broader market and that's where I would like to get. Whether we can get there or not, we will see. We will talk a little bit about our plans in November, longer run, but clearly we are ahead of our plans in terms of market share so far and I think we do have more opportunity to grow with our partners.","Remember, we are now in our light duty side 6% market share, in the light duty market, 6%. So we have room to grow and we are partnered with the largest light duty truck maker in China. And on the heavy duty side, we have made good progress, but we are still on the ramp up phase. We still have more to go there. We have introduced a new telematics system in there. We just started that work and with this telematics system now, Chinese customers for the first time can track fuel economy and performance of their drivers, as well as the reliability of their truck. And we visited a few of them. Rich and I visited a few of those end customers and needless to say, those trucking companies are very interested in keeping track of fuel economy, just like everybody else. And so, I think we have a lot of opportunity still there to grow.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Tom. And then for my follow up, on Brazil. Brazil has been weak for some time and the volumes are getting pretty ridiculously low there. So I am just curious, do you think that it's possible that the Brazilian truck market is bottoming? Or do you see the potential for even more downside in 2016?","Tom Linebarger","Boy, I wish I knew the answer to that. Rich, do you know the answer to that?","Rich Freeland","Right now, we are assuming bottoming. So we are assuming no improvement at this point. And so we are down to pretty low numbers where we are right now. So it seems like not a lot of downside risk. But we are not counting on any improvement in 2016.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. I will pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alex Potter","Hi guys. I was wondering if you could comment a bit on market share trends in North America on-highway market. Obviously, you guys are inclined to hope for share gains, I guess, amongst certain OEMs. I am just wondering if you have any commentary there regarding, I guess, through the end of this year and then into next.","Rich Freeland","Alex, this is Rich. It looks like we have fairly settled in at this 33%, 34% range. We have been there between and 33% and 35%, each of the last four quarters. And that's what we are projecting going forward. We get a little bit of some quarter-to-quarter things where sometimes the OEs build a little more of their own product in Q4 and so we have seen some historical, a little dip down in Q4 and then a bounce back in Q1. So we have assumed a little bit of that. But, again, it's a couple points lower than where we started the year forecast and so our share is a bit lower with PACCAR right now and our share is, in fact, higher than we planned at Navistar, but their overall share is down a bit. But again, with all those puts and takes, it seems like we have settled right at that 34% range.","Tom Linebarger","And then medium duty, I think, Alex, you probably saw the numbers there, but medium duty, we have gained a little more share than we anticipated. Ford is not really back in the market yet. SO our market is stronger there and I think our view is our market share opportunity in medium duty is mostly about trying to hold share and, again, it's looking good so far. We will have more competition as the years move on, but we feel like we have got a pretty good say on advantage in the medium duty truck engine. So we are pushing hard to maintain share there and again, it's a very, very good position to start from.","Mark Smith","We have probably got time for one last question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ted Grace","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Tom Linebarger","Hi Ted.","Ted Grace","Hi. I was just wondering, maybe to follow up on Jerry and Joe's line of questioning on the restructuring, could you maybe just walk through how to think about it, COGS versus SG&A? I know you talked about 2,000 professional jobs, but just trying to dimensionalize where those savings will accrue on the P&L? And then maybe to the degree you could walk through segments? It seems like maybe power gen and engines are the two that have maybe the most overcapacity. But can you just dimensionalize how we should think about where those savings will accrue?","Pat Ward","Yes. Ted, this is Pat. Let me take a shot at that. It's a little bit early to give you too many specific details, but you are right. Most of it's going to be in power gen, back to the remarks that Rich touched upon earlier on. We have to do more work. So we are clearly well ahead with our planning. And the engine business is also deep into this. We talk about where those are going to land in terms of the P&L. We will be taking actions in our manufacturing plants to flex our operations there. So that was dropping costs of goods sold and help nudge, But most of what we are talking about here, when Tom was talking about the 2,000 professionals, they will primarily be in the SG&A side of the business.","Ted Grace","But would it be more corporate or would it be more at the divisional level?","Pat Ward","It's going to be across the board. So we are looking at corporate. Obviously, we are looking at power gen and the engine business. We are going everywhere on this. We are looking where we have got excess cost today and we are trying to deal with that, given the environment where we find ourselves in.","Ted Grace","Okay. And then the last thing I will ask is, just as we think about today's news on the restructuring, would it be appropriate to think about this as Phase 1 of a multistep plan? Will that be dependent on the outcome? I am guessing the answer is yes, with what happens in 2016 and 2017, but in terms of today's announcement and the $160 million to $200 million of savings, would you say you expect that, at this point, to be the extent of the restructuring? Or just how would you frame that dynamic?","Tom Linebarger","So here's the thing. As I mentioned it, we are trying to do these actions quickly because we think that's the best way to get our cost structure right and also the best way to manage our people to keep going and move forward and emerge stronger as we go. But as we mentioned, there really are two steps to this.","The first step is this professional workforce reduction and the second thing is we will be looking through our facilities to say, are there structural opportunities for us in the manufacturing plants that we can take and things will come out of that. I don't exactly know how many things, but we have already identified a couple of things that look like big opportunities for us.","So we just want to make sure we handle those right. Those are more complicated things to do. So we want to make sure we understand exactly what the biggest strategic opportunities for the company are to position us well. So we are going to take a little more time with that. But again, not that much more time. It will be really this quarter that we will be working on that.","So again, rather than think of it as two or three or four, the professional action we are taking, we are going to do that very quickly. As quickly as we can get it done. And then the manufacturing thing will depend on which opportunities we see there. But again, expect us to get through that work this quarter and not stretch beyond that.","Ted Grace","Okay. That was really helpful. Good luck this quarter and we look forward to the Analyst Day.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you.","Mark Smith","Thank you. Thank you, everybody. We will be available for your questions later. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect.

Please proceed, sir.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Denise and good morning everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the third quarter 2014. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We\u2019ll all be available for your questions at the end of the prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our presentation for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP, financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Before I start, I just wanted to tell you how much I really enjoyed those disclaimers section, thank you for doing that. Good morning everybody, I\u2019ll start with the summary of our third quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.","Revenues for the third quarter were $4.9 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the third quarter of 2013. Third quarter EBIT was $684 million or 14% of sales compared to $536 million or 12.6% in the same quarter last year. We delivered incremental EBIT margins of 24%, due primarily to strong demand in North America and improved operational performance in all four businesses.","Engine business revenues increased by 13% year-over-year and EBIT margins were 11.7% of sales, up from 10.9% a year ago. We have increased our outlook for the engine business and now expect sales to increase between 7% and 9%, up 1% at the mid-point. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11% to 11.5% of sales, 25 basis points higher than our previous forecast due to improved productivity in our manufacturing operations.","Revenues for the Components business increased 20% year-over-year and EBIT percent improved by a 110 basis points to 13.4%. We have increased our full year outlook for the component\u2019s business and now expect revenue growth of 15% to 17%, 1.5% higher than our previous forecast at the midpoint.","We expect EBIT to be in the range of 13.5% to 14%, up 25 basis points, due mainly to higher volumes. Power generation revenues increased by 6% compared to a year ago, an even increase from 6.3% a year ago to 8% this quarter. While this is a good improvement from a year ago, the level of water intake in power generation has remained weak for some time and is not yet showing signs of a significant turnaround. As a result, we are considering taking further actions to align our cost structure with demand starting in the fourth quarter.","We have lowered our revenue forecast for 2014 and now expect revenues to decline between 3% and 5%, down from our previous guidance of flat at the midpoint. We now expect EBIT to be in the range of 6.8% to 7.2%, down 50 basis points at the midpoint. This forecast excludes any one-time costs associated with the cost reduction activities currently under consideration. We will provide details of our cost reduction plans during our fourth quarter earnings call.","Revenues and the distribution segment increased 37% in the third quarter with organic growth of 8% and acquisitions adding 29%. EBIT for the quarter was 10.1% and EBIT dollars were a record $131 million, up 52% year-over-year.","We continue to make good progress with our North American acquisition strategy. Through the first nine months of this year, we completed four acquisitions and another three will close by the end of the year. The acquisitions are expected to deliver incremental revenues for the full year of $500 million for this company and generate earnings per share of at least $0.35.","We are forecasting revenue growth of 30% to 35% in the distribution segment for 2014, unchanged from three months ago and have tightened the range for EBIT percent to 9.25% to 9.75%, unchanged at the midpoint.","Now, I will comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 19% in the third quarter due to strong demand in on-highway markets. Shipments for the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 26,000 units in the third quarter, an increase of 32% from 2013 levels.","We now expect the full-year market size to increase by 22%, up from our previous forecast of a 15% increase. We expect our full-year market share to be 37%, consistent with year-to-date performance though August.","In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 18,400 engines in the third quarter, up 15% compared to a year ago. We expect the market to grow by 9% for the year, unchanged from our prior forecast. Our market share is 73% year-to-date, and we expect to maintain this market share for the full year, which would be 10 points higher than 2013.","Shipments to Chrysler increased by 6% in the third quarter year-over-year. For the full year, we expect that shipments will increase 6% as well.","Power generation revenues declined in North America by 1% year-over-year, due primarily to lower sales to the U.S. Military. Excluding the Military business, power generation revenues increased 8% due in part to stronger orders from data center customers.","Also in North America, we are experiencing improvement in some of our high horsepower engine markets. Oil and gas revenues more than tripled in the third quarter as the market recovers from very weak levels, and for the full year, volumes are expected to be up by 70% to 80%.","We are also experiencing very strong demand in the commercial Marine market, supporting the offshore oil and gas industry. Demand for mining engines remains very weak both in the U.S. and international markets with unit shipments expected to decline 20% for the full year.","The combination of a strong commercial Marine market, improving orders from oil and gas customers and data center demand in the U.S. for our power generation business resulted in a 11% growth in global high horsepower engine shipments in the third quarter, following almost two years of declining demand. In 2015, a number of high horsepower markets who adopts Tier 4 Final emissions regulations in the U.S.","We have already achieved certification for high horsepower generator sets and for our engines for rail and oil and gas applications, so we feel well-positioned to meet customer demand. We will actually start delivering some Tier 4 Final systems in the fourth quarter of this year and are excited about the opportunities looking at the next year.","Our international revenues increased by 10% year-over-year in the third quarter with growth in China and Western Europe offsetting declines in Mexico and Brazil. As I will discuss our full-year forecast for revenues in our largest international markets remain unchanged from our prior forecast.","Third-quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $824 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Secular growth in light-duty engines and components more than offset weak end-market demand. Industry sales for heavy and medium duty trucks in China declined 10% for the third quarter.","Sales in third quarter of 2013 were unusually strong due to pre-buying activity ahead of the anticipated an NS4 emissions regulations. NS4 compliant trucks represent 40% of the total industry production in the third quarter and should exceed 50% in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, total industry sales are down 3%, and we currently expect the full-year market size to decline by approximately 5% consistent with our prior forecast.","Our shipments of light duty engines in China increased 94% year-over-year, even as overall market demand declined by 28% as our partner Foton increased the proportion of its trucks powered by the 2.8 and 3.8 liter engines manufactured in our joint venture.","Production of our new ISG heavy-duty engine, also part of our joint venture with Foton, are increasing and should contribute to growth in our market share in the fourth quarter.","Demand for construction equipment continues to decline as property construction has contracted, and the pace of government investment in infrastructure has slowed. Industry sales of excavators declined 30% in the third quarter and are down 15% year-to-date compared to weak levels last year. We expect full-year industry demand for excavators to decline 17%, down from our previous forecast of a decline of 15%.","Revenues for our power generation business were up 4% year-to-date and are expected to be flat for the full year. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures are expected to increase 10% for the year, unchanged from our previous guidance with new products and higher emissions related content driving our growth. We do expect to see further growth in engine and component sales with broader adoption of the new NS4 regulations.","Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $283 million, up 17% compared to a very weak third quarter last year. Industry production in the truck market increased 20% in the third quarter compared to third quarter last year and is 1% higher for the first nine months of the year. We now expect truck production for the industry to increase 9% for full year, up from our previous forecast that production would be flat year-over-year.","Power generation revenues in India increased 5% in the third quarter, higher pricing for new products introduced to meet the recently adopted CPCB II emissions regulations offset lower unit demand. Year-to-date revenues, however, are down 25% after a very weak first half. The new government in India has placed a strong emphasis on improving infrastructure, which should be positive for our business in the future, the near-term demand remains weak. We expected full-year revenues for the power generation business would decline by 19% compared to our previous forecast of a 15% drop.","In total, we continue to expect revenues in India to decline by 8% for the year, unchanged from our prior forecast with improving truck production offsetting weaker power generation demand.","Third quarter revenues in Brazil were $189 million, down 14% from the third quarter last year. Industry production of trucks declined 33% in the third quarter as the weak economy continues to impact demand for capital goods.","Industry truck production is down 25% year-to-date and we expect a full-year decline of 25% to 30%. We expect our full-year revenues in Brazil to decline by 15% to 20% consistent with our prior forecast with power generation sales and modest (inaudible) in this difficult economic climate.","In summary, we currently expect global company revenues to increase between 10% to 12% for the full year, up slightly from our previous forecast of growth between 8% and 11%. The main driver of the increase in our revenue outlook is stronger demand in the North American heavy duty truck market. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 13% to 13.5% up 25 basis points to the mid-point.","I'm pleased with the company's strong earnings and cash-flow performance in the third quarter despite weak market conditions in nearly all of our international markets. The strong results underscores the (inaudible) growth opportunities that we have generated with new products, new partnerships and expansion of our distribution business.","The results also showed that Cummins can continually invest for long-term leadership and growth while effectively managing our costs. Thank you for your interest today and now I\u2019ll turn it over to Pat who will cover our third quarter results and full-year guidance in more detail.","Pat Ward","Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Third quarter revenues were $4.9 billion, an increase of [50]% from a year ago and included a record revenues for both components and distribution segments. Acquisitions accounted for 3% growth year-over-year.","North American sales which represented 56% of our third quarter revenues were up 19% from a year ago due to continued strength in on-highway markets along with the impact of acquisitions in our distribution segments on record revenues in our parts business.","International sales increased by 10% with growth in China and Europe partially offsetting weaker sales in Brazil. Compared to the prior quarters, sales were up 1%, stronger demand in North American heavy-duty truck market and the impact of acquisitions and the distribution business were partially offset by weaker demand in Brazilian and Chinese truck markets.","And discussing performance in the different lanes of our income statement, I want to point out the change that we have made this quarter. Certain activities of a previously classified in selling and general and administrative expenses were mainly measured as cost of sales which allows for consistent treatment across the distribution channel.","The revision had no impact on earnings before interest and taxes and cash flows or on the balance sheet and all composites I will discuss today include the adjusted gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses.","Gross margin was a record $1.3 billion in the quarter or 26.3% to sales, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior quarter and 100 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. Compared to last year\u2019s stronger volumes, positive mix and more material costs were partially offset by higher warranty costs and unfavorable currency movements, compared to last quarter margins improved due to higher volume and lower warranty expense.","Selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $90 million compared to the prior year. Acquisitions and our distribution segment accounted for $22 million of this increase. Compared to the prior quarter, selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $35 million, of which the acquisitions added $6 million.","Joint venture income of $99million was up $8 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to increased earnings in China. Sequentially, the joint venture income decreased by $6 million primarily due to lower admin in the China joint ventures.","Earnings before interest and tax were $684 million, 14% of sales for the quarter was compared to 12.6% of sales last year and 14.6% in the prior quarter. The third quarter margins represented 24% incremental EBIT margin compared to the prior year. Net earnings were $423 million, an increase of 19% from $355 million we reported a year ago, an earnings per share of $2.32 compared to $1.90 last year.","The tax rate was 34.4% for the quarter and included a discrete tax expense of $19 million or $0.10 per share and the change in our projected full year operating rate from 28% to 29.5% related to the geographic mix of our earnings.","Let\u2019s move on now to the operating segments and discuss third quarter performance and the outlook for the full year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 13% from last year.","North American on-highway revenues were up 22% driven by strong demand in truck and in bus markets. Industrial revenues were up 11% with growth driven by record sales in a commercial marine business. Mining engine revenues were down 10% compared to last year.","Compared to the prior quarter, sales were up 3% sequentially we experienced stronger demand in the North American heavy duty truck market and the European construction markets which is partly related to Tier 4 final emission regulations.","Segment EBIT was $340 million or 11.7% of sales, up from 10.9% last year. The EBIT margins improved as a result of stronger volumes, more material costs and higher joint venture income partially offset by an increase in the warranty expense. Sequentially EBIT margins increased by 40 basis points.","For the full year, we are increasing our revenue under EBIT guidance for the engine segment. We now forecast that revenues will be up 7% to 9% driven by higher demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market. We continue to see weakness in most global off-highway markets and in the Brazilian truck market. We now expect the Brazilian truck market will be there in 25% to 30% for the full year. We are raising our EBIT projections for the full year to 11% to 11.5% of sales which compares to 10.4% that we reported last year.","The component segment delivered record sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, revenues were up 20% from last year and up 1% from last quarter. Compared to the prior year, the higher revenues were primarily driven by increased truck demand in North America along with increased revenues for our after-treatment systems in Europe and China related to the new Emission regulations in both regions. Sequentially, higher revenues were primarily driven by increased demand in the North American heavy duty truck market, partially offset by lower demand in European and Chinese truck markets.","Segment EBIT was $173 million, 13.4% of sales, which is up 110 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of the stronger volumes and lower material costs. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins decreased by 110 basis points due to increased research and development expense which we expect to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter.","We are increasing our revenue and EBIT guidance for the component segment and now expect full year revenue growth of 15% to 17% as a result of the stronger demand in the North American heavy duty truck market. We are raising our EBIT projections for the full year to 13.5% to 14% which compares to our full year 2013 margin of 12.1%.","In the power generation segment, third quarter sales were $754 million, up 6% from last year and essentially flat from the prior quarter. Year-over-year revenues declined in North America by 1% due to reduced military demand but increase in international markets, primarily China, Africa and in the Middle-East.","Our international sales were up compared to the prior year, we remain more than 30% below the 2011 peak. EBIT margins were 8% in the quarter, up from 6.3% last year and flat with the second quarter. The positive impact of higher volumes and ongoing cross management led to the higher margins.","Foreign currency negatively impacted power gen's EBIT margins by 90 basis points when compared to the third quarter of the last year. For 2014, we now expect sales to decline 3% to 5% compared to the prior year. The reduction in revenue guidance is primarily driven by continued weakness in international markets. As a result of the weaker demand, we are lowering EBIT projections for the full year to be between 6.8% and 7.2% of sales.","As Tom discussed earlier, given the continued weakness in power generation markets, we are considering certain actions to reduce cost structure starting in the fourth quarter. The course of the action being considered could range from $15 million to $40 million.","Both power generation and company EBIT guidance exclude any cost associated with these actions. We expect to realize the benefits of these actions beginning in 2015.","For the Distribution segment, third quarter revenues were a record $1.3 billion, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions accounted for 29% of the growth year-over-year. Organic growth of 8% was driven by stronger parts demand in North America oil and gas markets and pre-buy related to tier four final standards in Europe and in United States, EBIT was a record $141 million in the quarter as margins increased from 9.1% last year to 10.1% with improved operational performance and gains from acquisitions partially offset by lower joint venture income.","EBIT dollars increased by 53% when compared to last year. For 2014, we continue to forecast revenue growth between 40% and 45% with 3% organic growth and the balance coming from acquisitions. We expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 9.25% to 9.75% of sales.","Acquisitions remain on track to add $500 million of revenue to the Cummins in 2014 and earnings of at least $0.35 per share.","As Tom mentioned, we may project total company revenues to be up 10% to 12% in 2014, driven primarily by strong on-highway demand in North America and from the impact of the distributor acquisitions. While we are increasing our expectations for revenue growth in North American on-highway markets, we continue to see weakness in power generation, mining and in some top markets, particularly in Brazil.","As we mentioned in the last quarter, demand stabilized in India during second quarter but revenues were flat sequentially and we do not anticipate significant improvement in our end-markets this year. We are increasing EBIT guidance to 14% to 14.5% of sales as a result of the stronger performance in North American market which compares to 12.5% last year and represents a 20% incremental EBIT margin at the mid-point of the guidance.","We are now projecting a tax rate to be 29.5% in 2014 excluding any discreet items, higher than our previous projection due to a change in geographic mix of earnings.","And finally, with regard to cash flow, we produced $687 million of cash from operations in the third quarter. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations has totaled $1.4 billion of 10% of sales. We continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 15% of sales for the full year.","We will invest between $650 million and $750 million in capital expenditure for the full year which is below our previous projection and expect to spend between $475 million and $525 million on distributed acquisitions.","During the third quarter, we increased our dividend by 25% and repurchased just over 1.2 million shares, leaving our total share repurchases to the end of September to over 4 million shares. The company has returned $975 million of cash to shareholders so far this year and we are well on track to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders as we have previously discussed.","And as is a practice, we will provide guidance for 2015 during our fourth quarter earnings release.","And now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks, Pat. Okay, Denise, I think we are ready now to move to the Q&A section.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Mark Smith","Hi Andy, thanks.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Tom, you can give us a little more color on how to think about China as we go into 2015 for you guys? You have continued to build out your light duty engines, but you also potentially have a significant build-out here with your new ISG engine with your JV partner in China. So can you talk about what your initial experience has been with your new heavy duty engine, and how should we think about Cummins\u2019 growth relative to the market as we go into \u201915 in China?","Tom Linebarger","Broadly speaking, I think we\u2019ll still see secular growth. We see light-duty products continuing to expand, emissions related content continue to expand as we move adoption rates up. They have moved up pretty steadily this year, and I think they will continue to move up next year, and then as you mentioned our heavy-duty engine is really just getting off the ground with our launch. The engine has been successful, we have got good feedback on it so far. We launched it, it\u2019s a first new platform for Cummins, so we definitely were measured in our launch. We were careful with it, we kept production levels at moderate pace, we've been tracking all the engines, so we do have a good feel for how it's going and we are happy with where we are and we will be able to ramp up production and market position next year, so all should contributed to secular demand. What we don't know, Andy, is how good the market is going to be.","I think there's a lot of uncertainty still about China. I mentioned in our earlier calls that the truck market has been kind of fits and starts. It actually was strong than we expected in the first half, and then a little bit weaker than we expected in second half. Although we knew second was going to be worse than first, there was more up and down than we expected and we just don't know what to expect next year in that regard.","So, we are feeling good about growth next year given the secular growth, but what we don't know is how much headwind or tailwind we are going to get from the market.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Okay, Tom, that's helpful and then I know you get this question a lot because I get it a lot, too. But it has been pretty topical lately, and that's the vertical integration threat. Many investors seem to think that your customers are being more aggressive here regarding vertical integration. You mentioned the 37% share here for the year here in heavy duty, and obviously very strong share in medium duty. So maybe you can talk about that as we go forward here, because this has been something that has been out there for a very long time and you've been able to maintain share. But how should we think about it from here?","Tom Linebarger","I will say a few things, and I\u2019ll let Rich to add because he is pretty actively involved with discussions. First of all, it\u2019s the first time I have ever heard that question about integration. It\u2019s definitely not as you know. It\u2019s an ongoing part of our business, and I think really it has been since the beginning, certainly since we left the shores of the U.S. back in the 70s, in a serious way, this has been part of our business. We regularly take vertically integrated manufacturers and add our engines to their mix, so we kind of whatever you want to say, reverse disintegration or disintegrate them, and that's what we\u2019re, that\u2019s our business. Everyone has an engine already, and every vehicle that they're doing. We are oftentimes replacing their engine with ours and then vice versa. These are integrated manufacturers, most of them and so they have the opportunity at times to integrate themselves. And I think that's an ongoing process.","The good news for us is that we have our full engine range, we have a global engine range, and we have good relationships with the best truck manufacturers in the world, which means if they are thinking about using an engine anywhere in the world, we are on the page for them to talk to, and as long as we continue to provide capable products, products that they think will help them sell more trucks, we will be able to keep sharing in these big manufacturers somewhere in the world and big markets. If we are not that competitive from a product performance point of view or cost point of view, then of course we will be unable to the same competitive dynamics that have been true for ever.","Rich talks to all these guys as do I, he has been talking to them more recently. Rich, you should talk may be about what conversations you are having with people.","Rich Freeland","Yes, just a couple of things in North America, I think was part of your question, but just to follow up what Tom said, fortunately every customer we sell to produces their own engines, and that's not new that has been the case for the last twenty years. So if you look just at the heavy duty truck market and just an example to what Tom said, if you go back three years ago, we weren\u2019t selling to Navistar, we are now, so things move both ways in this space. We still see ourselves kind of we have said in that 35% to 40% range, we remain there, I think we\u2019re at 37% for the year and projecting that to go-forward. In our penetration with all of the vertically integrated, we are about right what we thought it would be, and it hasn\u2019t changed a lot through the year. I\u2019d say, if anything, we\u2019re a little higher than Navistar than we thought, so that peace is not new.","I think the question in the medium duty space, probably just to address that, because I am sure some of you have the question with the recent Daimler announcement. So just a couple reminders on the medium duty-truck market, it's an important one to us, the market is up 9% we are up 15% this year, and that's been with our share gains, we have gone from 63 to 73, and that\u2019s really been on the heels of \u2013 we have got a terrific engine in that space and people are moving to that engine. As you know Daimler has announced, they will be introducing a mid-range engine beginning in 2016 with the family of engines in 2016, Daimler is a terrific customer and partner globally, not just in North America, but globally, and of course we prefer they have not done that if we\u2019re honest. What they have done, and I think the impact will be, I think short-term pretty moderate, and it will begin to be introduced in 2016 with an imported engine, so not much impact 2015 and 2016. The question is longer term the impact is naturally determined by the engine.","This is a truly and remarkable we have is that the customers will decide which engine they call and this is kind of how we do. We have got a terrific engines in this space and that's why we have the 73% market share, so with the durable engine really a bulk of engine that we have had, the customers thought it\u2019s a most reliable (inaudible) and it has been designed and optimize for this North American market, so it is in the space.","So time will tell, I think for the next couple of years, not much impact, we are going to continue to improve that engine and we will be working with Daimler in that pace.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Thanks guys, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","It\u2019s Andrew on for Jamie.","Rich Freeland","Hi, Jamie is on the other call, ah? That's how I noticed, okay?","Unidentified Analyst","A little busy today but I am filling in for her so I have got some good questions for you. So I wanted if you could expand more on we have said on PowerGen and I think you have mentioned international market increase, which is pretty encouraging given your market share there, can you provide some more color and going forward what you are expecting for order book and any one country stand out in particular, and then I am surprised \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you mentioned India, but more or less do you think you will see specifically were those restructuring efforts are going to take place?","Rich Freeland","Let me start off here, Tom you can jump in here. So PowerGen revenues have stabilized in fact if you look back year over year, we\u2019re seeing some improvement for the first time and you have seen profits stabilized, the start-up with rough Q1 and then we have been pretty stable through the back half of the year but what we haven\u2019t seen is any growth yet and I will talk little bit about what is going on in the market in a second. The action we are taking is, though the revenues are not increasing we are going to take further actions to reduce the cost structure and so we were permitted improving the profitability at these levels with the scene is stabilized.","So we will position well when we do, come back. I think globally, world markets are good and bad, we have talked about India being down, being down pretty significantly, North America market is up to take out the impact of the military business and Africa is one we have talked about, in fact actually the business is a fairly well in Africa up about 20%. Now, we are tied a little bit just kind of, the global economy (inaudible) and so we\u2019re now projecting not a rapid growth in any one area, I think strongest would be the North America.","Tom Linebarger","Just market wise, we had a couple of places up a little, Middle-East was up and that had been depressed and now it seems to be showing some strength, China was up little although again I don\u2019t think there is sustained strength there. Latin America on the other hand what we have seen from the strength earlier is down, again it\u2019s pretty anaemic around the world with regard to market.","And again as Rich said we don\u2019t know exactly which action we are going to take but what we have said in the earlier in the year is that we anticipate given how low power generation business was, we thought some of the markets would improve to some degree by this time or we start to see signs of improvement, we just haven\u2019t seen that and so as we discussed then we said if revenues don\u2019t improve will take further action and that\u2019s what we\u2019re considering that.","We would have of course announced the actions we knew exactly what they were, we just don\u2019t know yet. We are going to figure out ways to reduce the cost and we have been studying that all year. So we have got a good list of items that we\u2019re looking at and we will finalize those this quarter and then we will let you guys know next quarter. So, the way I would read this is that we knew if things didn\u2019t get better way to do something and things didn\u2019t get better and we don\u2019t see a sign right now or things are getting a lot better, so we are following to what we have said.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then with those restructuring, with those efforts you are going to do in Q4, how do you see that, I know it is difficult to say at this one but do you see that trickling through and benefiting early next year, how quickly do you think the things will turn around there, given your efforts?","Tom Linebarger","As you know, we had to go through the actions specifically to say that our anticipation of course in all of these things we would like to get costs down as quickly as possible and again all of these kind of actions, we have the first decide what we\u2019re going to do and how we are going to do it and we have not done that, we have not decided what we are going to do and how we are going to do it. So when we to we will have a better set of plans. But from us in the past, we don\u2019t mess it out. When it is time to reduce the cost, we will make good decisions, we will make the right ones for the business but we will make sure we will get the cost and we will get the benefits quickly.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Gellman, your light-duty engine in the U.S. has made announcement with new sign a just a little while ago, can you just give us an update on when you expect additional new platform announcements to come out and also can you just touch on up highway side you alluded to in your prepared remarks that that's an area of opportunity with Tier 4 next year, I am wondering if you could flush that out on what additional platforms you are on heading into the next year and what sort of tailwind we should be thinking about if you can talk about it at least directionally?","Rich Freeland","Okay, I will go ahead and jump and start with the light duty. So the one who is public now is, is in the pick up space which is Nissan and that will go into production mid-year, next year so that hasn\u2019t changed what we told you last quarter. We do have several other light commercial vehicle customers that will go into production early next year who have not, elected not to make those announcements yet. So there will be further announcements late this year, early next year and we will begun to see some ramp up in light commercial vehicle space early 2015.","Tom Linebarger","And working (inaudible) that we can\u2019t, our policy base let our customer announce when they want to put their engine in and that's the right thing to do but it is frustrating to us obviously that we can\u2019t give you more visibility when we would like to do that. So I reckon that is frustrating. Mark, why don\u2019t talk a little bit about that, that Tier 4.","Mark Smith","In the U.S., Jerry, Tier 4 final regulations are going to impact oil and gas business, rail has particularly you have seen orders in passenger rail business and also (inaudible) high horsepower genset all certified and I know we were the first to be certified in those markets, I don\u2019t know the current status, orders at this time but we feel really well positioned. It is not just about being certified of course but having those final solutions in the hands of the customers, so they can trial and just feel comfortable with them, so we see some momentum going into next year. We can\u2019t say exactly what those end market conditions are going to be but we will definitely deal with some systems here in the fourth quarter and you should expect, we will be talking all three of those segments in the next year.","Tom Linebarger","And to the Mark\u2019s point, Jerry we have problems with quantifying the impact for next year, in the market, they are not that consistent they are pretty volatile. As we talked about oil and gas, we saw some good movement this year and then now oil prices are weakening so we don\u2019t know what impact that is going to have. On the rail side, we have seen a lot of positive increase we have got some business and passenger rail and that is kind of new to us and we got the Hedhog engine coming out. That\u2019s another benefits to the rail side. We really haven\u2019t had an engine big enough really in the main part of the rail business. We have a lot of good stuff coming our way, we are still pretty small though, I mean just to call like it is we are still small and growing, so what the overall impact is going to be, we will see, the biggest positive impact will be in the Genset side if we see market improvement in North America, that will be the biggest one, because that is the biggest volume but we just don\u2019t know whether it is going to.","Mark Smith","Jerry, I just had one thing, in the Tier 4 space we feel really good about technology we have got there. We have been\u2014this is technology we have had in place in automotive markets for multiple years, so we are \u2013 we feel good. We are ready, we are on time there will be no delays and we have tested this technology and we know it\u2019s durable and reliable. When we go through this technology changes there is winners and losers and we feel really good about where we stand in the technology.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Okay and lastly I know in PowerGen you are still working through the restructuring fees, so I am wondering if you just talk about the existing actions you have in place which is just the production transition of low horsepower units to India where are you now process, what is the margin tailwind as you complete that transition and any other cost saving measures which you should be thinking about outside of the restructuring program?","Mark Smith","There are couple of things Jerry. Generally we provide an initiative to grow our how our business and so we have been naturally ramping production up low horsepower using the (inaudible) from anywhere else, would just be growing in (inaudible) and they are going into multiple markets, we are seeing good growth this quarter and after occurrence some of the other emerging economies. So it wasn\u2019t really a restructuring our low horsepower more of a leveraging our India base and growing where we did take actions and we completed those actions (inaudible) particularly around alternating business so we were moving some production out of Germany and we did that and we completed everything that we said we would do basically at the end of the second quarter and so that\u2019s why you saw through a combination of cost reduction activity that what we have been able to get margins without much revenue growth, we have seen basically every quarter this year, our gross margin essentially been higher to year to date sales are down. So we did all that, but the problem is of course we are still lacking that momentum and revenue we are still not entirely comfortable at 8% margins.","Tom Linebarger","Jerry just a few some numbers that Mark just said. If you look at PowerGen margin, on a year-to-date basis, they have improved 18.1% to 18.7% and that's on the lower sales and that's almost with 1% headwinds from the British pound from currency. So it\u2019s not just that the things we have been working incredibly hard and we see it coming through those margins, we just need the volumes that can (inaudible) much more obviously as you go into the future.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research","Good morning everybody.","Tom Linebarger","Hi, Rob.","Rob Wertheimer - Vertical Research","Two quick questions, one just out of curiosity on marine and commercial in oil and gas, it didn\u2019t seeing the strength I mean there is obviously a lot of structural trends there but obviously it has been a little weak lately and I think related party called out (inaudible) weakness to offshore rigs, is that strength continuing if you add any cancellation to there and fracking or is there a some sort of I don't really know the cycle there whether there is a big catch up in these to happen regardless of overall for CapEx.","Thomas Linebarger","To this point, just a couple of numbers just to illustrate how we look at the market. But inflationary market in fact will be up 20% throughout this year. So it's been a nice steady growing marketing that we have had here and we are tied to some of the offshore work that's going on so that's a headwind to see what's going on potentially in the short term going on price. Our oil and gas are tracking business is up pretty significantly almost 70% from some pretty low numbers quite frankly. So we had not seen any I don't have any details to give you on what's going on with oil price and some of the stuff you read on tracking. That's held in there for us so far but it's just up, we are paying attention to right now.","Patrick Ward","And one of the things that we have been seeing, we had a big ramp in tracking engines. We have the right engine for the right size and they are huge built out and then it kind of completely dead when people kind of done with that build out and things slowed down. Now what we are mostly seeing is replacements. When we talk to customers and ask them what they are doing, they are not really adding a bunch of tracking units. What they are doing is replacing engine that they have used. And again that\u2019s not only it but in the conversations with customers that's what we are hearing from them. They are moving them around and they are using up the engine and they want to replace the engines and their tracking unit. So I don't think there is a lot of growth in tracking sites. I think they are just using them and then they need replacement engines. And so what's going to happen is as a result of any changes in oil price is not just clear to me there. But I do think there is a steady demand for replacement because though the patter we\u2019re using up. ","Thomas Linebarger","The other thing I would add, the commercial learning is much more of a broad base story we\u2019ve seen growth in China, in West Africa not just the offshore piece and it has in fact come out a largest fewer engine end market that\u2019s outside of the power generation business. Very strong, we don't see any kind of big change in demand looking forward oil and gas obviously for rules, it's relatively small and bearing to the U.S. at this point in time.","Patrick Ward","Thinking about the company overall, the market that we are biggest in mining and power gen are still very weak. And the markets are not improving marine, we talked about oil and gas and rail are relatively small and growing. So definitely our high horse power business step back and look at the company it's still way lower than it was previously so we have a lot of opportunities for growth here when markets turn around.","Unidentified Analyst","That's all very, very helpful. Thank you. One quick one I don\u2019t know if you all answered or not obviously the class 8 North America share bounces up and down and maybe you lose some of the OEM in gain and maybe there is underlying poll for your brand one way or the other, a little bit curious as to those as you lose little bit share structuring one OEM are you able to see into 2015 at this point I think you are kind of probably booked out for 2014, are you able to see into 2015 if you are holding share and probably want the answer and I am just curious if they raise production this year, if you can sort of see if that 37 hold or whether you start a little lower run rate. Thanks.","Patrick Ward","So we will wait till December to give that guidance but there is nothing fundamentally changing as we look forward on the next standpoint. So one thing that we have \u2013 it's minor but one we counted on was on the natural gas business. So we have 100% in natural gas and we actually we thought that would be a big play by now but it's not. We are more conservative than most. We thought that it would be 2% to 3% share by now and it's going to be closer to 1% share. So that is low kind of appeal when we have is win that happens which we don't see a big change in 2015. But when that market comes which will be the will, that will be some upside for us on the market share.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please proceed.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities, LLC","Hi good morning. I know it's too soon for 2015 guidance but based on the trends you are seeing now, if you had to rank the pace of maybe your international businesses over the next year or so from strongest to weakness, would it still be China growing the best and then India, Europe, Mexico and South America, how would you think about that ranking?","Thomas Linebarger","It's really difficult to say I mean I am not trying to be coy at all, it's really difficult to say. You heard some of our remarks about the different regions. In India you got a new government coming and a lot of positive sentiments going around. Some numbers are moving too. We are seeing some improvements in some numbers. We are not seeing yet it that translating the demand in our markets yet but there is a very positive story there, you just don't know what's that\u2019s going to result in. China I think it's very uncertain also. We just don't know whether what trends are going to do. We don't think China is going to boom. Nobody thinks that. But whether or not number of \u2013 our market is still significantly down from where they were even all the way back to 2011. So you could see even among relatively moderate Chinese market, if the infrastructure start to grow at all we could see significant improvement and of course there has been elections in Brazil. I just think there is just great too much uncertainty to rank in terms of upside or opportunity though I would love the market to settle down, I just don't think we have the visibility to do it.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities, LLC","Okay. That's fair. And I think you said warranty costs are down sequentially is that right and I think last quarter you said the elevated accrual would kind of remain at that level for some time. Just curious what's developed there?","Rich Freeland","Yes. We are really right where we thought we would be. So we what you do get is some quarter to quarter variation \u2013 if there is a big population out there, things get adjusted. So we took the rates up in Q3 and we were kind of saying in the full year the second half will look a little closer to Q2. Longer terms those rates are coming down. And so the effects are in place and we just demonstrate that overtime but we look back the back half of 2015, those rates are coming down. Pat you want to.","Pat Ward","So yes, as you said in the last call, we expect it to be somewhat in the range of 2.6% of sales. We have not changed from that. It look into prospects to last year 2.3%. The biggest headwind is obviously the engine business. If you look at engine business, the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of last year as a percentage of sales increased by just 1.2%. And the EBIT margins also improved by 80 basis points. So we are doing a terrific job of overcoming that headwind and as Rich said, everyone is working very hard, I think we are pleased with some of the progress we are seeing and we enter next year, specially second half of next year, I think we really start to see some improvements in these warranty rates from the coming levels.","","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities, LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Hi good morning guys. ","Tom Linebarger","Hi Ann. ","","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Most of my questions have been answered. But on the distribution side you kept your incremental revenues from the acquisitions as they were, but you raised the EPS guidance can you just talk a little bit about what's happening there and what you are seeing and what's better than you had anticipated?","Pat Ward","Yes. Basically it's down to the gains on acquisition so the purchase account, the businesses that we are acquiring in the value of the 50% that we already yield is getting actually written up a little more than we had anticipated. ","Tom Linebarger","I mean the large story as you know Ann is, we are at a little bit ahead. So we have got seven acquisitions planned for this year and our original plan was six. And so with that we have just got ahead a little bit and that's great. In addition to that, we \u2013 the integration has gone a little better than we expected in U.S. market been a little bit better than we expected. So that's kind of if you want to say the economic and execution side and then there is little bit annoys around the purchase accounting and what gets written off, what kind of cost we have on the other side, those numbers have been fluctuating up and down but as I mentioned before those will get flushed through and then we will be left with the revenues and the profit dollars or the acquisition which again are ahead of what we anticipated and then we will do it really well.","Pat Ward","I think if Ann if you step back and look at the performance of the segment without acquisition and look at same store business, same store margins have improved by 1% compared to last year and again that's North American market, some oil and gas markets relative to where we\u2019ve been so it's not just an acquisition story, I think the performance of the underlying business is also a little bit better from what we have anticipated maybe three months ago.","Ann Duignan - JPMorgan","Okay. That's great. Thank you for the color and I just wanted to follow-up on the diner question earlier. I know 2016 and beyond but I think (inaudible) engines in Q3, could you just remind us what percent of those were?","","Pat Ward","I don't know the number on top of my head. I know Mark can get it for you. It's a good question but we don't have the number in front of us, but Mark will have it and again one of the other thing Ann which was getting at it not only will start right away but it will \u2013 there will be a transition period of some time because it's going to have the engines one-by-one and what's more is that we will of course continue to compete for the business with them. One of the nice things about working with them are is they are very capable company that wants to sell trucks and systems and I think that's one of the reasons they like to work with Cummins and so they are \u2013 we still have opportunity to grow with them in north America in mid range and we will see how that plays out but we \u2013 and they are working closely with us. The thing I really appreciate about that is even as they made an announcement that of course we had preferred they would not make, made the decision they talked to us the whole time about it that they were open with us, they talked about what they are trying to do and why they were trying to do it and so I think the relationship remains good and open for us to grow with them. So now and later and we will take transition time to get there and we have a good opportunity to find ways to grow with them even in mid range.","Tom Linebarger","And moving back to the number but it's roughly about half, maybe little less than half of that.","Ann Duignan \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay great. I appreciate that. I will take the rest offline. Okay.","Tom Linebarger","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please proceed.","","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Hi guys good morning.","Tom Linebarger","Morning Adam.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you are hearing from your heavy truck customers here in North America about their buying appetite for next year. There is a lot of cross currents out there in the market that fundamental aren\u2019t pretty good but there is driver sort of seems to be holding things up. So maybe can you just talk about what you are hearing from your customers about their buying plans for next year? ","Tom Linebarger","Yes, I\u2019ll give Adam but it remains pretty positive. Okay. So all the things we looked at and you looked at, used truck prices are high, I think the one thing we are worried about a little bit is the driver shortage and as it happened in other cycles that appears to be taken care of itself to the extent that folks have ways of addressing quite frankly we see the pay for drivers going up through the cycles one of the ways that's done. Folks are liking the fuel economy they are getting with the trucks they are getting now as they are replacing and looking at the maintenance cost. And where we are right now even though the numbers are up higher, we are really at the replacement level. So folks are not expanding fleet at this standpoint for the most part. If you think of 260 market, that\u2019s pretty close to a long term replacement. So we have got old population out there and people are replacing but we don't have a \u2013 it doesn't appear we have kind of overheated, where it's growing here. So the sentiment we just had ATA sentiment is very positive. I mean rates are going up, they are making money. The truck fleets are making money. They are trying to replace their fleets get a newer fleet. And so it's generally positive and I would say the one thing it was seemed to be a little bit of drag on the shortage, the more people I talked to are finding ways to get pass that.","","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Got you. Thank you. And then Pat just a couple of detailed question. Would you expect the tax rate next year to go up above this 29.5% we\u2019re going to do this year because of the distributor acquisition and then was there any impact to earnings from currency?","","Pat Ward","On the tax rate, I will tell you in general, we don't have \u2013 we are still looking for plan in the next year. So it's very premature for me to give you a number at this point. On the currency, currency actually helps save much more when we look at Q2 to Q3 it's like 20 million benefit in the top line. However given the strength of the pound, bottom line ended up maybe being $6 million or $8 million negative year-over-year and that really had more than anybody else. But as significant as what you would see in previous quarter.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","At this time we have no further time for questions. I will now send the call back over to management for closing remarks. Please proceed.","Tom Linebarger","Okay. Thank you very much for your time today and I will be available for questions later.

Good morning everybody. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2020. Mark will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.","The company implemented several measures to reduce costs and improve future performance in the second half of 2019. In the third quarter, we announced our decision to end production of certain underperforming product lines; and as demand fell in the fourth quarter, we moved quickly to execute a number of additional actions to lower our cost structure resulting in a $119 million pretax or $90 million after-tax restructuring charge.","Global headcount reduction actions covered by this charge began in the fourth quarter and most were completed by the end of January. We expect to realize savings from the restructuring and other actions of $250 million to $300 million as we discussed at our Analyst Day in November.","The actions we have taken will mitigate an expected slowdown in revenues in 2020 and position the company for stronger performance as market demand improves. We will continue our investments in new technologies and new product launches in 2020 as we have in prior periods of lower demand which we believe will continue to improve our strategic position in the industry and sustain our profitable growth. As always, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the economic cycle.","Now, let me summarize our fourth quarter and full year results and comment on key drivers within each business. All references to EBITDA and EBITDA percent exclude restructuring charges.","Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $5.6 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 with declines in most major markets outside of China. EBITDA was $682 million or 12.2% compared to $896 million or 14.6% a year ago.","EBITDA decreased as a percentage of sales due to the impact of lower volumes and an increase in research and engineering expenses to support new product development in our core business as well as in our New Power segment. These impacts were partially offset by strong material cost reduction activities and improved pricing.","For the full year, Cummins sales were $23.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margins were 15.8% compared to 14.6% in 2018 due to lower warranty costs improved pricing, and material cost reduction activities and partially offset by lower volumes, the impact of higher tariffs, and increased investment in research and development.","EBITDA dollars were a record $3.7 billion and operating cash flow was a record $3.2 billion. We lowered inventory by over $400 million in the second half of the year and our strong operating cash flow supported the return of a record $2 billion in cash to shareholders in 2019.","In our Engine business, sales decreased by 5% in 2019. Lower demand in the Chinese light commercial vehicle market, North American and European construction markets, and the global bus market were partially offset by higher demand for pickup trucks in North America.","Heavy and medium-duty truck revenues in North America were flat compared to 2018. EBITDA was 14.6% compared to 13.7% in 2018 with the negative impact of lower volumes more than offset by lower warranty, improved pricing, and material cost reduction activities.","Sales for our Distribution grew -- business grew by 3% in 2019. Increased demand in North America and China, driven by higher sales of gensets to data center customers was partially offset by lower demand for engines in construction and oil and gas markets.","Full year EBITDA increased to 8.6% compared to 7.2% in 2018 [technical difficulty] costs partially offset by the impact of a strong U.S. dollar and currency volatility in Africa. Full year revenues for the Components segment declined by 4% due to lower truck production in India and in Europe.","EBITDA was 16.2% compared to 14.4% in 2018. The increase in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower warranty costs and the benefit of material cost reduction programs, which offset increased investment in the development of new products to meet advancing emission standards in China and India as well as the impact of lower volumes.","Power Systems sales decreased by 4% in 2019. Demand for power generation equipment was down 3% with higher demand for power generation, equipment in data center and military markets more than offset by lower demand in RV markets and for backup power in the Middle East, Latin America, Africa, and China. Demand for engines and industrial applications declined by 8% driven by lower demand in oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA was 11.7% compared to 13.3% in 2018. ","Power Systems revenue and EBITDA margins were below our expectations in the fourth quarter. EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $15 million charge to exit the business in Africa, part of a broader effort to improve profitability in that region as well as higher warranty costs. In addition, orders declined in multiple segments in the fourth quarter, especially in parts sales due to lower engine rebuild volumes negatively impacting both revenue and profits.","In our New Power business, full year EBITDA was a loss of $148 million, in line with our forecast. We continue our investments in key technology areas for the future and building out our product offerings to target markets and applications most suitable to electric and fuel cell power.","Now, I will comment on some of our key markets in 2019, starting with North America, and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America increased 3% in 2019 primarily due to higher demand for pickup trucks and power generation equipment. Sales in medium and heavy-duty truck markets were flat compared to 2018 while sales of engines to construction and oil and gas markets declined.","Industry production of heavy-duty trucks increased to 303,000 units, an increase of 6% from 2018 levels. Industry production remained strong for the first half of the year supported by a record industry backlog. However as truck orders remained weak and the industry backlog declined, OEMs began lowering truck builds in the third quarter and once again lowered production in the fourth quarter.","Our market share for the full year was 32% down two percentage points from 2018 as OEMs prioritized production of their own engines when making cuts to production in the second half of the year. The market size for medium-duty trucks was 138,000 units in 2019 representing another strong year of demand. We maintained our clear leadership in the market with full year market share of 80%.","2019 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in North America. We shipped 148,000 engines to our pickup truck customers in 2019 including the highest number of engines for Ram pickups in over 10 years. During the third quarter, we decided to end production of our ISV 5-liter engine which was primarily sold to Nissan for use in pickup truck applications.","Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 5%. While non-residential construction spending remained high we saw industry participants take steps to reduce their equipment inventory in the second half of the year. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America decreased by 38% from last year, with lower demand from oil and gas customers, partially offset by increased shipments to mining customers.","Power Generation revenues increased by 4% year-over-year driven by demand for military applications and data center customers. Our international revenues declined 6% in 2019. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures were $5.5 billion, up 4%. The increased revenue was driven by market share gains in the medium and heavy-duty truck market, as well as the impact of our new JAC joint venture with sales of $237 million in its first full year of operation.","Industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China decreased by 1% from record levels experienced in 2018 ahead of our expectation three months ago and driven by increased incentives to scrap NS3 trucks. Within the truck market construction-related dump truck sales declined 16% in 2019, while non-construction-related truck sales increased by 6%.","Our market share improved to 14.8% this year from 12.7% in 2018. The light-duty market in China declined 1% in 2019. OEMs accelerated the launch of new truck models in light of the more stringent enforcement of overloading regulations that began in the second quarter, resulting in end users increasing truck part purchases. Our share ended the year 8.1% in line with our guidance, and up 2.6% from 2018.","Industry demand for excavators set another record of 236,000 units in 2019, an increase of 16% from 2018 levels. Our market share ended the year at 14% flat with 2018. In our Power Systems market, demand for power generation equipment in China was flat for the year with lower demand for standby power offset by growth in data center markets.","Increased investment in domestic fracking resulted in higher sales of oil and gas engines in 2019 increasing from $17 million to $72 million in the year. Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures was $1.6 billion, a 19% decrease driven by both a weak economy and reduced credit availability.","Industry truck production declined by 29% in 2019 and construction demand declined 34%. Power Generation revenues increased in 2019, partly due to increased demand in data center markets.","In Brazil, truck production increased 8% compared to 2018 with strong growth in domestic demand, partially offset by lower exports primarily to Argentina. Our revenues declined 9% for the year with increased truck production in the market offset by the impact of Ford exiting the Brazil truck market last year.","Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2020 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2020 to be down between 8% and 12% from 2019, driven by a decrease in heavy and medium-duty truck production in North America, Europe, China and India. We also expect that construction, mining and oil and gas markets will experience double-digit declines in 2020 and power generation markets will decline 5% to 10%.","Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 185,000 units in 2020 a 40% decrease year-over-year. The industry enters 2020 with a backlog of 123,000 units less than half the 297,000 units when entering 2019 as order rates were consistently below truck production throughout the year. We expect orders to remain weak in 2020, with continued weak freight activity resulting in excess capacity and lower used truck market prices.","We expect our market share to be flat with 2019 at 32%. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 123,000 units, a 20% decrease from 2019 after several years of strong demand. We expect our market share to be in the range of 75% to 80%. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are also expected to be down 10% compared to a very strong 2019.","In China, we project domestic revenues, including joint ventures to be down 7% in 2020. We currently project a 10% reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck demand and flat demand in the light-duty truck market. We expect our market share in medium and heavy-duty trucks to be in the range of 14% to 15% in 2020, flat with 2019, and 2% higher than it was in 2018.","Our share in the light-duty truck is expected to be 8% to 9% flat with 2019. Industry volumes of NS VI products will increase modestly in 2020 primarily in light-duty applications, as city-used vehicles move to NS VI standards in July of this year followed by all remaining diesel vehicles in July of 2021.","We first met standards similar to NS VI in the United States 10 years ago, when we have leveraged our knowledge in powertrain technologies to develop a range of products for Chinese markets that we expect to be well received by end users. Industry sales of excavators are expected to decline 25% from record levels in 2019. These are -- it is expected that our industry as well as others will experience supply chain disruptions and loss of revenues in the first quarter due to the coronavirus outbreak.","We have significant operations in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located including manufacturing and technical facilities that have been impacted by extended closures. We are monitoring the situation in China very closely to ensure the safety of our employees and their families and to minimize any impact on our operations and our customers. We are also monitoring any impact on our global supply chain by Chinese suppliers and taking precautionary actions wherever possible.","In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 15% in 2020 and we expect industry demand for trucks to decline 5% in 2020 after a 29% decline last year. Truck production will remain at very low levels in the first quarter, as OEMs reduce truck inventories ahead of the planned implementation of Bharat Stage VI standards in April. We expect demand will remain low immediately following the launch of BS VI vehicles, but will increase in the second half of the year.","BS VI represents a significant content opportunity for Cummins in India and we expect to increase sales of after-treatment systems by over $200 million in 2020, offsetting continued low demand across Indian domestic end markets. With the transition to BS VI, we expect to maintain our market share leadership with our longtime partner Tata and we -- begin selling after-treatment systems to a new local customer for our Components business. We project our major global high horsepower markets will decline in 2020. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to decline by 40% in 2020.","In North America, sales continue to be impacted by fleet replacement that occurred in 2018 and the lack of new oil well drilling. In China, we expect to see lower demand, as the industry absorbs the record amount of equipment purchased in 2019.","Sales of mining engines are expected to decline by 20% in 2020 with lower demand in Russia and China primarily driven by lower demand for and investment in thermal coal. Demand in power generation markets is expected to decline 5% to 10% driven by lower global economic growth and lower demand from data center customers, where we see construction that was originally planned for this year slipping into 2021.","In summary, we expect full year sales to be down 8% to 12% and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.2% to 15.2% of sales, representing a 25% decremental margin in our base business. We expect cost savings from our restructuring activities, material cost reductions and increased pricing will partially offset the impact of lower volumes and increased variable compensation costs.","Before I hand it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail, I'd like to take a few minutes to share some of the progress that's been made in our New Power segment, which completed its second full year of operations last year. In 2019, we delivered full electric powertrains to both the school bus and transit bus markets. These buses are not prototypes, but are full production units for commercial use.","For example, our first fully electric bus with our partner GILLIG went into service in Santa Monica, California in the fourth quarter. Our Distribution business is providing service and support for these electrified buses as well as supporting the same customers with their existing natural gas and diesel fleets.","We also announced Kalmar as a partner in the first electric terminal tractor market in 2019 and with production expected to begin in early 2021. We also announced several programs with end user partners to deliver electric prototype vehicles for their use in testing, including the United States Postal Service. There are currently over 200 fully electrified vehicles with Cummins New Power Systems in the hands of our customers today.","At the North American Commercial Vehicle Show in October, we unveiled the Cummins PowerDrive, a flexible hybrid architecture, which seamlessly shifts between pure electric for environmentally sensitive areas with a 50-mile range and hybrid for jobs requiring more than 300 miles range.","The PowerDrive system can be combined with various sizes of diesel or natural gas engines and battery pack outputs providing our on-highway customers with the flexibility needed to meet the demands of their diverse jobs and markets.","We completed our acquisition of Hydrogenics last year, adding additional fuel cell and hydrogen production capabilities to our New Power portfolio. Within 60 days of closing the acquisition, we showed a fuel cell-powered truck at the North American Commercial Vehicle Show, and are seeing significant interest in fuel cell technology in both on and off-highway markets.","The inclusion of hydrogen production technology as part of the Hydrogenics acquisition positions us well to support customers looking to utilize hydrogen fuel cells, because lack of access to hydrogen is a significant pacing factor in fuel cell adoption.","While we are investing in our New Power segment, we are also continuing to invest in diesel and natural gas powertrains. In North America, we now provide three natural gas engines that meet CARB's offshore low NOx standard of 0.02 grams per brake horsepower hour, a 90% reduction from the current EPA limit of 0.2 grams.","We launched our first natural gas variant of our Hedgehog engine platform, a 78-liter for power generation applications in 2019. And this year, we will launch several new on-highway natural gas platforms in China.","Investments in diesel technology continue to drive improved fuel economy for customers as well as lower emissions. In 2019, we launched the company's new X15 Efficiency Series, which meets 2021 greenhouse gas standards and delivers up to 5% better fuel economy.","In India, we'll launch all our new BS VI engines and after-treatment systems in 2020, driving over $200 million in incremental revenue for the company and lowering NOx by 50% and particulate matter by over 80%.","We will launch NS VI products in China over the next 18 months in preparation for full adoption in July of next year. As you can see, we are continually innovating across our broad portfolio of power solutions from diesel and natural gas to fuel cells hybrid and fully electric options.","We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solution for their application at the right time and to continue to be the leader in power for commercial industrial equipment.","Now let me turn it over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you, Tom. I'll begin with a quick summary of our financial performance in the fourth quarter, and then the full year before moving on to our outlook for 2020.","As we already discussed, we recorded restructuring charges in the fourth quarter totaling $119 million pre-tax or $90 million after tax, and we expect to realize annual savings from the restructuring and other actions in the range of $250 million to $300 million.","In order to provide clarity on our operational performance, I'm excluding the impact of this restructuring in my following comments. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.6 billion, a decrease of 9% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 8% and international revenues decreased 10%. Currency negatively impacted revenues by 1%.","Earnings before interest and taxes depreciation and amortization was $682 million or 12.2% of sales for the quarter compared to $896 million or 14.6% of sales a year ago. EBITDA decreased by $214 million driven by the negative impact of lower sales, higher warranty costs and lower joint venture income. Warranty costs were in line with our expectations, but were higher than the reach of comparison a year ago.","Gross margin of $1.3 billion or 23.5% of sales, decreased by $233 million or 1.7% driven largely by the impact of lower volumes and to a lesser extent increased warranty costs, all of which more than offset the benefits from favorable pricing, material cost reduction and lower variable compensation expense.","Our selling, administrative and research costs of $903 million increased by $16 million year-over-year. Selling general and administrative expenses decreased by $11 million while research expenditures increased by $27 million, driven primarily by new product development in the Engine Components and New Power segments, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.","Joint venture income declined by $55 million, primarily due to a non-cash impairment of a joint venture in Africa within our Power Systems segment. Other income of $20 million improved by $16 million, primarily due to better returns on the investments that underpin our nonqualified benefit plans. Due to market volatility in the fourth quarter of 2018, we incurred $24 million of mark-to-market losses within other income.","Net earnings for the quarter were $390 million or $2.56 per diluted share compared to $579 million or $3.63 a year ago. We also incurred after-tax expenses of $22 million or $0.14 per share related to actions taken to cease development and production of certain products in North America and our planned exit of the joint venture in Africa within Power Systems all of which will benefit future financial performance.","The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.5%. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was strong an inflow of $838 million, down from last year due to lower earnings which more than offset lower working capital.","Now I'll comment on individual segment performance in the fourth quarter before moving on to the full year. Revenues for the Engine segment declined by 15% driven by weaker truck demand in North America and lower construction sales in North America and Asia. EBITDA was 12.1%, down from 14.6% a year ago, due to the impact of lower revenues, which more than offset positive pricing and lower material costs.","Distribution sales declined 1% year-over-year. Growth in Power Generation sales offset weaker demand from oil and gas and construction customers leaving organic growth about flat. And stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues by 1%. EBITDA improved to 8% from 6.8% a year ago due to the benefits of positive pricing and other operational improvements particularly in North America.","Revenues for the Components segment declined by 12% due to weaker truck demand in North America, Europe and India which more than offset growth in China. EBITDA was 13.4% compared to 15.7% a year ago, primarily due to lower gross margin as a result of lower volumes. As Tom has already discussed, the fourth quarter was a challenging one for the Power Systems business with revenues declining by 12% driven by weaker demand in oil and gas, mining and power generation markets.","Sales declined in most regions led by North America and Europe. EBITDA in the fourth quarter was 5.2%, down from 10.3% a year ago with the negative impact of lower volumes, higher warranty costs and the impairment of the joint venture in Africa that we've already discussed. For the full year, 2019 revenues were $23.6 billion, a decrease of 1% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 3%, while international revenues declined 6%. Currency for the full year was a negative 1% impact on sales.","EBITDA was a record $3.7 billion or 15.8% of sales for 2019 compared to $3.5 billion or 14.6% a year ago. Lower warranty expense, material cost reduction actions and positive pricing more than offset the impact of lower sales and some increased investment in new product development and weaker joint venture earnings in India and China.","Net earnings were $2.4 billion or $15.05 per share both full year records. This compares to $2.1 billion or $13.15 per diluted share a year ago. Full year cash from operations was also a record $3.2 billion. Strong earnings especially in the first half of the year and working capital reductions in the second half of the year contributed to the strong cash generation.","Capital expenditures in 2019 was $700 million flat with the prior year. We returned a record $2 billion of cash to shareholders or 64% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased 8.1 million shares throughout the year at an average price of just over $156 and increased our dividend by 15%.","Moving on to the operating segments. I'll summarize our 2019 results and provide our forecast for 2020. For the Engine segment, 2019 revenues decreased 5% a year ago, while EBITDA increased from 13.7% to 14.6% of sales. In 2020, we expect revenues to be down 15% to 19% driven primarily by a decline in heavy and medium-duty truck production in North America and weaker demand for construction equipment in North America and China. 2020's EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.3% to 14.3% compared to 14.6% of sales in 2019.","In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 3% from a year ago to a record $8.1 billion. EBITDA increased to a record $693 million or 8.6% of sales, compared to $563 million or 7.2% of sales a year ago. We expect 2020 Distribution revenues to be flat to down 4% compared to 2019, driven by lower sales of power generation equipment and construction engines globally and weaker demand for oil and gas engines here in North America. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 8.6% to 9.6% of sales, compared to 8.6% in 2019.","Components segment revenues decreased 4% in 2019 while EBITDA increased from 14.4% to 16.2% of sales. This year we expect revenues to decline 9% to 13%. Again the drop in sales primarily due to lower truck production in North America, China and Europe, partially offset by more than $200 million of incremental revenues in India associated with the implementation of Bharat Stage-VI emissions regulations. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.8% of sales compared to 16.2% in 2019.","In the Power Systems segment, revenues declined 4% in 2019 and EBITDA declined from 13.3% to 11.7% of sales. In 2020, we expect revenues to decline a further 7% to 11% primarily due to lower sales of power generation equipment and then weaker demand for mining and oil and gas engines again. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 10% to 11%, compared to 11.7% of sales in 2019.","In the New Power segment, net expense was $148 million in 2019 in line with our guidance. We currently anticipate net expense of $160 million at the midpoint of our guidance in 2020 consistent with our communication at our recent Analyst Day. We are projecting company revenues to be down 8% to 12% in 2020. EBITDA is projected to be between 14.2% and 15.2%, which represents 25% decremental margins on our base business at the midpoint of our guidance.","The negative impact of lower sales will more than offset the benefits of restructuring, material cost reductions and the positive impact of increased pricing, although all of those actions will set us up for better profitability when markets return. We are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 22% in 2020 excluding discrete items with the increase in the tax rate from 2019, driven principally by a decline in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions in our forecast in 2020.","Full year operating cash flow is projected to exceed $2 billion after funding the restructuring costs. We expect capital investments to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million. We plan on returning 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2020 as our base case.","So to summarize all of this, we delivered solid results in 2019 capitalizing on strong markets in the first half of the year to generate record earnings and record operating cash flow.","In response to weaker demand in most of our end markets in the second half of the year, we took a number of actions to reduce costs, address some underperforming parts of our business and to set the business up to perform better when we move to the stronger part of the cycle. We are well-positioned to continue our track record of delivering improved performance cycle over cycle as we navigate the downturn that is upon us in 2020.","Thank you for your time today. And now let me turn it back over to James.","James Hopkins","Thank you, Mark. So, out of considerations to everybody on the call, I\u2019d ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up, and if you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator we're now ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andy Casey","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning Andy.","Andy Casey","I guess, kind of a short-term question to start off given the disclosure about you expect a disruption in the first quarter. A, is that already included in your guidance? And B, what does that do to the normal quarterly spread?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. Well, you remember Andy that we -- so far, most of the disruption has been during Chinese New Year, which -- and so we always have in our guidance the effective Chinese New Year shutdown. But starting basically Friday last week, the shutdowns have now extended beyond what we have planned in our plan or our guidance. So, right now, we don't really know what the exposure is going to be, partly because we don't know how long it's going to last and partly because if it does recover pretty quickly, we expect most of the sales to come back in the year. So, we don't really know what's going to happen.","But just to maybe add a few more pieces to my comments, we are basically looking at three different kinds of exposure. One, of course, is safety of our employees and their family. So, we are very active trying to make sure that everybody has the support and resources they need. We know where everybody is. We know people are doing wellness tests. We're just trying to make sure that we're taking care of everybody. That's of course job one.","Job two is we want to make sure that there's no impact on customers. So, we are tracking both our parts -- what's in inventory, what needs to be shipped by when, how we can proactively work to make sure that if things are -- there are extended delay, we have a least impact to customers that's both for global shipments and Chinese shipments. So, we have a very active set of activities on that.","And then third of course is just shipments within China. Right now, we are planning to open our facilities somewhere between February 10 and February 14 depending on where they're located and what the province schedule is. And right now, we have -- there's no backup dates given by the government, those are the dates. And so, our plan is to open on those dates. And if that happens, if it happens as planned, our expectation is that the impact will be relatively modest, not zero, but not -- but modest and could possibly be made up in the year.","If those were extended further because the outbreak extends further and the government has to take further actions, then of course, we don't know yet, but we'll have to figure out then what will happen, but we are -- worry about both shipments in China as well as shipments to markets outside of China because we do have a number of parts in China that supply plants outside.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it for others.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore.","David Raso","Hi, good morning.","Mark Smith","Hi David.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. Just so we can better understand the incremental margins a bit by division, the comment about $250 million to $300 million of annual savings, how much of those savings are expected in 2020, and can you help us a bit between the divisions?","Mark Smith","Yes. I mean, basically we're expecting almost all of those savings in 2020. In the disclosures, you can see the split of the cost reductions by segment. So, we've broken that out for you. So you should assume that the savings are mostly proportional to the expenses incurred with the one caveat that you will see a chunk of those expenses are in the corporate eliminations column, and those will be just -- ultimately when we report the segment results, the benefits of those savings will be shared across the segments. But you can basically do the math from there David.","The additional actions, of course, the exit of the V8 engine business is going to be all in the Engine business, and then the benefits of exiting the medium-duty transmission business are going to be in the Components segment. But I think the Engine business Components and Distribution will have the biggest benefits from those actions.","David Raso","And the cadence, just so we get a sense of the decrementals through the year, can you give us some sense of the cadence?","Mark Smith","Yes. I mean number -- yes, so the cadence will be -- most of the actions almost all of them will be completed by the end of the first quarter, a chunk already done through the end of January, so full run rate principally starting in the second quarter.","David Raso","Of the savings?","Mark Smith","Savings and obviously the comps of the base business are going to be very tough in the first half of the year given the very strong markets and performance last year. So yes, much tougher decrementals in the first half of the year, easing as the year goes along.","David Raso","All right. Thank you, very much.","Mark Smith","Thanks, David.","Operator","Than you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. Mark, sorry another guidance question. A lot of the questions I'm getting are in terms of again the cadence of earnings throughout the year, in particular the first quarter. Given the cost cutting actions we won't realize those benefits in, we have truck production down dramatically, so is there any way that you can sort of help us with how bad the first quarter is relative to the remaining nine months so people can get comfortable with just sort of the cadence of earnings throughout the year?","And then I guess, Tom, just a bigger picture question for you. You talked at the Analyst Day about opportunities for market share. There was obviously news last week on one of your larger customers, so just trying to balance the two and how you think about ultimate market share for Cummins over the long term. Thank you.","Mark Smith","Yes. So I'll try and help as best I can. So we should expect the toughest decremental margins in the first quarter, number one. North America truck was still \u2013 at least production was still booming in the first quarter. And then yes, we're going to have a weaker start in China.","By segment I would just say, the Engine business and Components are probably going to take the biggest challenges in the year-over-year decremental margins. I don't foresee Power Systems continuing at what was a very tough fourth quarter. And then Distribution business as you would expect should be a lot more stable.","So I think what's different this time Jamie is. I don't think there's any big rebound. There isn't a big rebound built into our revenues for the rest of the year. So we're really betting \u2013 not betting we're taking those cost reduction actions to help improve the earnings as we go forward. For the rest of this year we're really \u2013 kind of Q2 revenues onwards are more flattish as we look out.","Tom Linebarger","Yes. And Jamie just to close on that, we put quite a bit of thought into planning for this year. And so we did \u2013 definitely took a pretty conservative view about how revenues would come out, which is now feeling pretty close to right for us. And so we did all \u2013 as Mark said, we did all our work on the expense line. We took our actions make sure we got them done in the first quarter, in fact mostly by the end of January, so we could benefit in the year from the savings from those not just drag them out.","But there's no question that the first quarter will be worse because we'll still be implementing those. And then of course the China \u2013 the coronavirus is not helping. That is all negative to that too. So we will expect a weaker Q1. But again as Mark says, it's not a revenue story, it's an expense story that will really help us through the year. We've done it before so we kind of know what we're in for.","With regard to your bigger question by the way, it's a good one. We still see the same opportunities for market share that we talked about. We still believe that many of the OEMs are considering which investments they want to make and which they don't. And that unlike 10 years ago, when they couldn't wait to invest in more engines, they're wondering about that. But that doesn't mean that every one in every case is going to do it but that's still the way we see it.","With regard to the specific offer from Traton for Navistar that of course is completely expected, but it's been sort of talked about and rumored and \u2013 for some time, it's not a surprise to us or I don't think anybody else. We have been having conversations with both Traton who is a partner of ours. We have a joint venture with Scania. We have a number of customer relationships with them as well as with Navistar throughout that time.","We believe that we're building strong relationships with both. I mean Navistar has been a customer for a long time. So we think we have as many opportunities from this merger or if it actually goes through as we do threats. It doesn't mean that there aren't threats but we think there's as many opportunities as threats. So we intend to play all those cards out and see how they come out.","And I think both companies see Cummins as a potential asset for them in terms of how they approach their future business. So I realize that that's just general strategy talking not actual numbers but until it actually occurs or doesn't and they make decisions, there's not much more that I could say other than we are very active with both of them and there \u2013 and feel like we have opportunities with both.","Jamie Cook","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley.","Courtney Yakavonis","Good morning, guys. Just curious if you can give a little color on the parts expectations for next year. I think that had been an area that you mentioned you had seen some weakness this year. And just wondering given the decline in OE how you're thinking about that business.","Tony Satterthwaite","Yeah, Courtney, this is Tony Satterthwaite. I'll just give a couple of comments. We did see a little bit of parts weakness, we mentioned in the third quarter call. And it's in the automotive space in North America and the truck markets.","That has normalized. And we now expect, parts for next year to be relatively flat in that market, maybe up a little bit. We do see some -- we did see some definite weakness in parts in Power Systems in the fourth quarter.","That was one of the reasons that business did not perform as well as we hoped, as both Tom and Mark mentioned. But we do see that coming back a little bit. We are not seeing overall parts up this year, in the Power Systems business, primarily because of lower oil and gas engine rebuilds.","We are seeing a definite slowdown in utilization and less rebuilds coming. So, we are expecting parts to be a little less in 2020, in the Power Systems space.","Courtney Yakavonis","Great. Thanks, and then, just one more clarification on the guidance for JV income. I think you guided that to be up. But it seems like some of the core markets that you're talking about are going to be down there. And yet -- and I think you're guiding to relatively even market share in those segments. So, could you just comment on why we should be expecting JV income to be upwards, not just lapping the impairment that you're taking this year?","Mark Smith","That's a very fair question, even without the uncertainty in China. So, a couple of factors, yes, we shouldn't expect impairments to continue.","Number two, we had a big disruption to our light-duty business in the middle of last year with the Chinese government focusing on overloading of light-duty vehicles which caused all industry participants really to dramatically slow production and kind of reconfigure certain models.","So the hit to our earnings was quite significant there.","Then the third piece, which would not be visible to anybody on the outside of the company is that, we get technology fees and royalty income associated with new product introductions in different parts of our business. And we're anticipating some increases there with the launch of some new products.","So all of those are the reasons why, even with some weaker markets we had a base case of higher joint venture earnings, notwithstanding, the potential risks at least in the near term to China operations.","Courtney Yakavonis","Great, thanks, guys.","Mark Smith","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Mark Smith","Hi, Ann.","Tony Satterthwaite","Hi, Ann.","Ann Duignan","Just a clarification on the Components guidance, you did guide to an increase of $200 million in revenue from new product introductions in India. I just want to be sure and clear that that's sales directly to this new customer that you spoke about just for clarification.","Mark Smith","That's all customers. It's just that the total content opportunity from the new emission solution products.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. We mentioned that -- in my script I talked about Tata. We are selling also to Tata as well as to new customer. And of course now, we'll be selling after-treatment systems and other component technologies, associated with BS-VI that we weren't selling before.","Ann Duignan","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the electrification of our New Power segment PACCAR has been quite visible there with announcements of ventures with key components players in the truck industry, but hasn't selected Cummins as their key partner, can you maybe talk a little bit about where you are in terms of new program wins and whether you're behind or ahead of where you thought you might be at this point? Just a little bit more color on that segment please.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. Let me first just say that, we've been active talking with PACCAR and would love to win them as a customer on the electric side too. Needless to say, that it's a significant effort for us.","And while we're disappointed when they choose other people, they have their own goals and things and -- we are -- but we are active with them, let me just say it that way. So we hope to win some of their business and we are fighting hard to do it.","More broadly though, one thing that's true is that, we are focusing a lot of our effort and attention on those markets where the near-term possibility for production level, demand of new power is higher.","So let me just see if I can simplify the words, even I'm confused by what I just said. I mean those products where electric and fuel cell power is more economically viable in the short-term. So that's why pluses, has been big focus for us.","And that's why terminal tractors is a big focus for us, because when you do the range, you think about the range, you think about the ability to charge, frequently you think about the loads, those vehicles can actually almost make a case of it depending on where they get their power, today, on electric power, or on hybrid.","And then same on fuel cells. A lot of our focus and attention is on trains today. It's not because we don't think there's a truck -- a viable truck thing we do. It's just that the trains are more viable now, because you only have to refuel with hydrogen at one station and then the other -- one and then the other.","So these are -- again, it doesn't mean we aren\u2019t focused on the truck side, we are. But the fact is that those -- the volumes of those are likely a little further out than the volumes of these other things and we want to make sure that we're putting our products into production, getting full testing in real-life situations.","So, again, it doesn't mean that we're not focused on all those other wins. It's just -- our attention is drawn there, where we think the most activity is and also where the most real-life tests are. And then, everyone's got a lot of products and prototypes to produce and not enough battery engineers. So that's another issue for us, is trying to focus our scarce resources on the things that we think are most viable today.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I'll get back in line in the interest of time. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye","Thanks. And just on the last question, I believe, you guys are on the PACCAR refuse truck, although, correct me if I'm wrong, for the electric refuse truck. But I wanted to ask about medium-duty. I think entering 2019, you expected your NAFTA medium-duty market share to be around 75%; you came in at 80%. Looking at 2020 in terms of industry moving parts, I think, there's one key new entrant, but you're on that platform. And so, you're still suggesting there could be some modest market share loss. Just trying to understand how you think about those moving parts.","Tony Satterthwaite","Yes. Noah, this is Tony Satterthwaite. I'll just make a couple of comments. Yes, we did have a very good year in North American medium-duty. The market was strong. Our position remains strong. And as you see, we've guided to a lower market next year. Our experience has been when the market moves down and I think our guidance is down 20%, we see market share move around quite a bit as OEMs optimize their product and market -- and shares in the market shift.","And so we're expecting to see some decline in share. We said 75% to 80% is our guide for this year, so not significant. But we still see some pressure from those customers who have their own engines still and we expect that to continue. The new entrant that you talked about, that's the Mack, which is just announced last week. We're very excited about that and we're looking forward to see how that's going to impact the market.","Noah Kaye","Okay. Great. And then, as a follow-up, I mean, it looks like your Class 8 assumptions are maybe a touch more conservative than some of the third-party forecast. I guess, maybe just talk about what you're seeing in the market that leads you to take a little bit of a haircut.","Mark Smith","Let's say, one might have said we were a little bit conservative, I think, with the start of last year. I think, it's just the overall order trend. I mean, you look at the pace of freight and the capacity in the industry and that's where we are now. We're going to need to see a bounce back at some point in orders, or the backlog is going to keep just declining. And build rates you're going to have to adjust. So I don't think we're enormously off now. And again, at some point we'll get through this and the market start to recover.","Tom Linebarger","And, Noah, just -- I mean, just to call it. I mean, Tony and I have talked to a lot of the OEMs and end users. And I want to be clear that we don't think we have -- smarter than any of them about what they're going to do. We're just doing our best to trying to plan our business, so that we can right-size our expenses, make the best forecast we can for you guys and for other investors. So we're just calling it, like we see it.","Individual OEMs have their own view about how orders are going, what their share looks like and they can call it differently than we can. All we can do is react to schedules they're sending us; anticipate schedules they are sending us and these big picture things, which don't have a lot to do with their individual share or their individual decisions about stocking and otherwise.","So, I think, it is one of the reasons you see these differences, is that people have a different view of the market. We're standing back. We're back a step and the change is making the best call we can make. And we have, kind of, tended on the conservative side in this downturn relative to the average. But in other downturns, we've been more towards the middle or more towards the upside. It's just how we see it from where we are standing here.","And, again, the differences that I see and what ACT says, or what we say, are so small that it wouldn't change a darn thing we do. So, again, I would just say, we're not looking at a different set of facts than they are, or really seeing a broad difference than they are. Although, again, individuals -- I think, these individual OEMs think they have opportunities to gain share in some segments versus others that they would know better than we do.","Noah Kaye","Yes. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning, Jerry.","Mark Smith","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","You folks are targeting margin improvement through restructuring actions on the same base. I'm wondering if you could just expand the discussion on the opportunity set for further cost out in Power Systems. Have we cut as far as we can? Because it's surprising to see a relatively low share of restructuring in that business. And on the flip side, you have big margin expansion targets baked in for the Distribution segment. Maybe just flesh out the year-over-year drivers of margins up on sales down. Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Great. And I'll let Tony talk a little bit more about the details. At a high level though, Jerry, here's what's going on. You remember with the Distribution business that we -- when we merged all the independent distributors into Cummins, we mostly started with trying to figure out how to make sure we kept all the customers, we got the benefits of trying to sell across regions and things like that. We didn't really do a lot of major restructuring or efficiency work; a little bit, but not very much.","And so what you're seeing in the Distribution business is not only the normal kind of contraction related to the downturn because in fact they can track less than the rest. But their strategic effort to now get the benefits of consolidation and try to drive a much more efficient set of operations which -- it's a terrific program. Tony can talk more about that. It's a great program that he and Distribution business, Tracy Embree and Jenny Bush are leading.","And then I think on the Power Systems side, we have a little bit of the opposite. We did a bunch of restructuring actions. They had already taken a bunch of actions which of course makes the results even that much more disappointing. So if you're wondering if that's the way we feel that is the way we feel.","And part of the reason is that, unlike some of the other businesses we've seen a pretty consistent steady slide in sales and markets in the generator set business as a starting point and then a lot of volatility in some of the industrial applications.","It just hasn't been as simple as it went down and it went up. In the mining market we saw it go up and then it kind of leveled-off and in some segments as we mentioned coming down. Oil and gas popped up nicely and then just blast it right back down again.","So there's just been a lot of volatility in that in the industrial side which has produced less than stellar results than we'd like. And then on the genset this sort of steady decline in the market which is despite our efforts to do restructuring, just has it resulted in profitability where we want it.","So I guess what I'd say is we definitely are not giving up. We have a lot of work left to do to figure out how to get that business to our target profitability. We still feel confident we can. What's more is the markets are not -- we have a lot more room in market improvement as it starts to turn back up.","So we -- while not happy where we are, we think that we have a lot more work to go. It's just not in this normal reduction in people and things because they already did a lot of that in previous restructurings.","Jerry Revich","And Tom the actions in Distribution can you talk about the timing of the benefits? When should we expect the phasing to come in of the programs that you just stepped us through?","Tony Satterthwaite","So Jerry I'll handle that, this is Tony. Just -- we really -- we are really in the beginning of that transformation. We've taken some decisions about organization restructuring that Tom talked about streamlining the organization. Those actions, we were able to get done as part of our overall actions.","As we said majority will be finished here in Q1. And then we will start to see improved performance of the business really from there on. We are streamlining operations. We are adjusting our footprint. We are making the organization much more efficient. And all these things, we think will start to pay-off in the second quarter and you'll see some benefit throughout the year.","You can see our guidance is up for this year over last. And really it's a result of these efforts primarily that's moving the Distribution business performance.","Mark Smith","And we'd hope we could continue to drive more benefits in the future years.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.","Rob Wertheimer","So just a quick one on the power gen or Power Systems or really power gen you just touched on it. But are you seeing project delays that are -- just lumpiness and big project-related or just kind of a general slowdown in the business? I don't know if there's a reasoning behind the slowdown you're seeing?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. What I was commenting there for Jerry is that, the business hasn't been terrific for a bunch of years. I mean it's not been declining all the time, but it's either been flat or declining for a bunch of years. And it's just -- that's just the nature of the genset business over the last 8 or 10 years.","But now -- right now what we're seeing in the data center market is some projects slipped. So data center market has been the one bright spot. So if I went over that same period of gensets, I'd say data centers has been good throughout that time, kind of offsetting or partially offsetting a lot of the other decline. And it's been terrific.","And that is the one where we saw a lot of projects scheduled for 2020, big customers that we are talking about doing things several of them have already said, it's now very early in 2020 hey we're thinking about moving this to 2021. So what happens with that we'll see, but that's not a terrific sign? It's not that surprising though at this stage of the market.","When you start to see the industrial stuff start to come down then capital investments like those start to move out a little bit that's not a big surprise, but that we are starting to see that in the data center market for the first time.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay. Great, thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you.","James Hopkins","Great. Thanks. So with that I think we're at the end of our hour here. So I just want to say thanks everyone for your interest in Cummins as well as today. And then this afternoon, I'll be available for any follow-up calls also. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."],"6621":["Cummins Inc.

Also like to advice you that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mark Smith, Executive Director, Investor Relations for opening remarks. Please proceed. Thank you.","Mark A. Smith","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins\u2019 results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President of our Engine business, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions after the prepared remarks.","Before we start today, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future.","Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent quarter reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today\u2019s webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investor and Media.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2014. Pat will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.","Revenues for the fourth quarter were $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Fourth quarter EBIT was $566 million compared to $532 million in the same quarter last year, excluding restructuring costs. For the full year Cummins sales were $17.3 billion in line with 2012. Our full year EBIT margin was 12.5% in 2013, a decrease from 13.6% in 2012.","Revenues for the year came in at the high-end of our guidance, but EBIT percent was below our original expectations of 13% to 14% for the full year. The most significant drivers of lower EBIT margins were first, lower global demand for power generation equipment, especially our larger kilowatt products, weaker demand for high horsepower engines and weaker than expected industry orders from North American heavy duty trucks in the second half of the year.","There were a number of other factors that influenced our financial results for the year, including record performance in our Components segment. And I will let Pat to comment on those in more detail. But I do want to add a few comments on the performance of our Power Generation business.","In 2013 EBIT percent declined nearly two percentage points from the prior year to 7.2%, primarily due to weak demand in most international markets for large power generation projects. Gross margins improved by 80 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter and have now improved for three straight quarters as a result of the ongoing restructuring actions and other cost reduction initiatives in the business. The improvement in gross margins, however, was more than offset by one-time items in the quarter, particularly the write-down of an investment in technology venture and costs associated with legal settlement.","We fully expect that the actions we\u2019ve taken -- we have been taking to reduce costs in the business, including permanently relocating some alternator manufacturing capacity from high-class locations in Europe to lower cost locations will drive margin improvement in the Power Generation business in 2014.","As Tony indicated during our Analyst Day in September, we expect that the restructuring actions we have underway will be fully completed by the end of the second quarter of 2014. Improvement actions taken throughout 2013, but some of the early benefits were more than offset by weaker than expected demand especially in developing country markets.","Now I will comment on some of our other key markets in 2013 starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 3% in 2013 with approximately 2% of the growth resulting from acquisitions in our distribution business. The North American heavy duty truck market reached approximately 218,000 units in 2013, a decrease of 13% from 2012 level and weaker than our original forecast for the year of a 4% decrease. Our full year market share was 39% consistent with 2012.","The medium duty truck market was approximately 112,000 units in 2013, representing an increase of 5% from 2012 and up a little more than our original forecast of 2% increase. More importantly we strengthened our market share to 63% during the year, up from 53% a year-ago.","Shipments of Chrysler declined by 7% in 2013 as we expected. 2012 shipments were unusually high at the end of the year in anticipation of the 2013 model year change. Also in North America revenues in our Power Generation business increased by 21% with shipments to the U.S military driving 16% growth and sales to our traditional markets including nonresidential construction increasing 5%, consistent with a slowly improving U.S economy.","Our international revenues decreased by 4% in 2013, with decline in India, Australia, Mexico and Europe offsetting growth in China and Brazil. In Brazil our revenues increased 11% driven by a stronger truck market. Industry truck production increased 43% as demand rebounded after a typical year-end 2012, driving revenue growth in both our engine and component segments. Revenues reported in U.S dollars were negatively impacted by nearly 10% depreciation of the real against the dollar.","Full year revenues in China including joint ventures were $2.9 billion in 2013, an increase of 14% year-over-year. The growth in 2013 was driven primarily by stronger demand for engines and components for on-highway markets. Demand for heavy and medium duty trucks in China increased by 15% for the full year, higher than our original forecast as demand increased ahead of the expected transition to the NS4 emission standard in 2014. The growth in market demand boosted sales of our joint venture engines and our components business.","Shipments of light duty engines in China increased by 17% as our partner Foton increased the proportion of its trucks powered by the 2.8 and 3.8 liter engines manufactured in our joint venture. Industry demand for excavators in China declined by 3% for the year, reflecting a slower pace of infrastructure spending and high levels of inventory from over production in prior years.","Our revenues improved by more than industry retail sales, but fourth quarter shipments were still quite weak. Unfortunately we\u2019re not seeing evidence of a strong rebound in new equipment production as we head into the peak selling season this year.","Demand for power generation equipment in China remain muted in 2013, with slower growth in infrastructure and weak power needs reflecting underlying weakness in the Chinese economy. Our revenues did increase 5% year-over-year due to relatively easier comparisons in the second half of 2012.","Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.3 billion, down 20% from 2012 due to weaker demand across most end markets as the economy slows sharply. Revenues were also negatively impacted by the depreciation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar.","The truck market in India weakened significantly during the second half of the year with full year industry production declining 29% to 226,000 units, the lowest levels since 2009. Power Generation sales also declined as industrial activities slowed easing pressure on the grid. In the first half of 2013, Power Generation sales had held up despite the weak economy, but demand collapsed in the third quarter as lending markets tightened and inventories grew.","Total revenues in Europe were down 3% in 2013. Sales to European Power Generation customers were down 33% partially offset by stronger demand for engines and components ahead of new on-highway and off-highway emission standards that took effect on January 1, 2014. The decline in Power Generation revenues was a function of weak global demand for large power projects which reduced the needs of our European-based customers for new equipment.","Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2014 and then comment on individual regions end markets. We are currently forecasting total company revenues to grow between 4% and 8% in 2014, driven by distributor acquisitions, additional revenue related to new emissions regulations and market share gains including new products. We expect modest growth in most end markets in North America offset by continued weakness in our key high-horsepower markets and some developing economies.","We expect EBIT to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.25% sales reflecting incremental EBIT margins of 22% as the midpoint of our guidance. In North America, we expect our truck business to grow in 2014. We are forecasting that 2014 market size for heavy duty trucks to be 236 units, an increase of 8% year-over-year.","We are projecting our market share to be approximately 38%. In the medium duty truck market, we expect the market size to increase by 7% to 120,000 units and we expect our market share to increase to 70%. Shipments to Chrysler are projected to be flat with 2013.","In China, we expect domestic revenues including joint ventures to increase 11% in 2014. We expect the market size for heavy and medium duty trucks in China to decline by 7% from 2013 levels, as the industry steadily moves to a wider adoption of NS4 complaint products. Despite the anticipated decline in market size, we currently expect our revenues including joint ventures to grow in 2014 as we launch our new heavy duty engine and increase our components revenues as the new emission standard is gradually implemented.","In addition, demand for our light duty engines in China is expected to grow by 20% in 2014, as our partner Foton continues to increase the number of its vehicles powered by our joint venture engines. It's important to understand that despite the generally positive statements being made by a number of OEMs regarding the transition to NS4, significant uncertainty still exists.","As you are all aware of the change to NS4 emissions standard was scheduled for July 1, 2013, and the government has not yet made any announcements regarding a formal timetable for enforcement of regulations. Encouragingly, OEM orders for NS4 products have increased but the timing and extent of actual sales of compliant trucks to end users is still unclear. We continue to monitor the situation very closely and we'll provide updates as the transition to NS4 becomes clearer.","We expect industry sales of excavators in China to grow by approximately 3% in 2014 as infrastructure spending is projected to grow at a modest pace and inventory levels continue to reduce. In India we expect 2014 revenues including joint ventures to be flat after a very challenging year in 2013. Demand for trucks is expected to be level with 2013 with no clear drivers of improvement in the market in the near term.","In Power Generation we expect unit volumes to decline by up to 10% due to weak economies driving lower power needs. New emission regulations referred to as CPCB-2 are expected to go in force in the Power Generation market in the second half of the year with prices expected to rise by up to 20% to reflect the addition of new technologies. We expect full year Power Generation revenues to be flat in 2014 with increased prices for the new products offsetting lower unit volumes.","In Brazil, we expect truck production for 2014 to be in line with 2013. The government-subsidized finance program called FINAME has been an important source of financing for the Brazilian commercial vehicle market. More than 7 of every 10 trucks sold use FINAME-based financing in 2013. While the program was renewed for 2014, interest rates were raised by 150 basis points and the capacity of the program was reduced by 25%. OEMs have been working with commercial lenders to make additional financing options available to their customers, but with GDP growth running below 2% in the near term and rising finance costs, we do not anticipate growth in industry volumes into 2014.","While GDP is expected to grow in the eurozone in 2014 for the first time in three years, we expect our revenues to be relatively flat. Demand from our European-based Power Generation customers will remain weak in 2014 given that most of these products are shipped to developing markets.","Our components business will benefit from content growth on engines at new emissions regulations, but this will be offset by weaker engine demand in on and off-highway markets as to the pre-buy in Q4 of last year. I think it's also important to comment on our global mining business after a very challenging 2013.","Revenues for new mining engines declined by 43% last year with shipments declining sequentially each quarter throughout the year. With no improvement in commodity markets, mining companies remain very focused on reducing capital expenditures and maximizing the productivity of existing equipment. As a result, we expect engine shipments to decline further between 10% and 20% in 2014. Our high-horsepower aftermarket revenues should be in line with 2013.","We are confident about our projections for growth of between 4% and 8% in 2014 with the majority of the growth driven by acquisitions, additional content in new emission regulations and market share gains in medium and light duty truck markets. We will also see the launch of a number of new important products in 2014. For example, the engine business will launch our new heavy duty truck engine platform in China as well as the off-highway Tier 4 light duty engines, also sourced from China.","We will also see the launch of our new 5-liter V8 product in the U.S. late in the year. In Power Generation we have just launched the new Connect series generators for residential and light commercial markets in North America. The expected higher revenues, material cost reductions, supply chain savings and the benefits of restructuring in the Power Generation business will more than offset increased investment and selling, admin and research costs and deliver incremental margins at or above 20% in 2014.","We also expect the results this year to benefit from the cost reduction work undertaken in our manufacturing facilities in 2013. In 2014 production will be flat or increasing in most of plants whereas last year a number of our largest manufacturing plants were adjusting production rates to lower demand levels.","We delivered record operating cash flows in 2013 of $2.1 billion and strong cash flow performance allowed us to continue to invest in our business and return more cash to shareholders. In 2014 we will complete the acquisition of several North American distributors as we communicated September and we also expect to return 50% of our operating cash flow to investors in 2014 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As a result, we expect our net cash balance to decline in 2014.","In closing, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of all of our employees around the world for their hard work in 2013 in the face of a very challenging market. I would also like to thank our customers for their confidence in Cummins.","Thank you for your interest today. Now I'll turn it over to Pat who will cover our 2013 performance and 2014 guidance in more detail.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom described we faced challenges in a number of end markets in 2013 with very weak demand in international power generation and global mining markets while industry orders in the North American heavy duty truck market weakened in the second half of the year as did demand in most end markets in India.","While several of our largest markets were down last year, market share gains in the medium duty truck market in North America, growth in our components business and acquisitions in our distribution business resulted in full year revenues of $17.3 billion, flat with 2012.","As I review the full year financial results in more detail, all the numbers and comparisons will exclude the restructuring charges as well as the gains and divestitures that you'd recall in 2012. Full year revenues for the company were $17.3 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Revenues were up 3% in North America but were down 4% in international markets.","Gross margins of 25.3% were 90 basis points lower than last year with the positive impact of pricing, material cost reductions and supply chain savings, offset by the impact of a 25% decline in high-horsepower engine shipments.","Selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $28 million in the year. The acquisitions on our distribution segment accounted for $60 million of additional spend and was offset by reductions in spend in both the Engine and Power Generation segments, while the Component segment spend remain flat at 2012 levels.","Joint venture income was down $23 million compared to last year primarily due to the impact of the distribution acquisitions. And total earnings before interest and tax or EBIT was 12.5% to sales in India, down from 13.6% of sales in the previous year.","Net income was $1.5 billion or $7.91 per share. This compares to $1.7 billion or $8.83 per share in the previous year, excluding restructuring charges and the gains from divestitures. The tax rate for the full year is 25.1% and was lower than the guidance that we provided in October, primarily due to the benefits from the implementation of certain tax strategies and from higher research and -- research and development tax credits than we originally anticipated.","Now let me comment specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance. Revenue of $4.6 billion was 7% higher than the previous year and 8% higher than the third quarter levels, despite weaker demand in mining and international power generation markets. Compared to the prior year, North American revenues were up 11% due to the impact of distributor acquisitions and market share increases in our aftertreatment business.","International revenues were up 3%, helped by stronger demand in China truck markets and in Europe ahead of the implementation of Tier 4 Final and Euro 6 emission regulations. Compared to last quarter, North American revenues increased by 5% were actually due to seasonal demand in our Power Generation business, while international revenues were up 10% due to stronger truck and construction demand in Europe ahead of the Tier 4 Final and Euro 6 emission rates.","Gross margins for the quarter was slightly higher than a year-ago of 25.4% of sales. With positive pricing and lower material costs offsetting the product mix headwind from the decline in high horsepower engine shipments. Sequentially gross margins declined from the prior quarter primarily due to increased product coverage costs.","Selling, admin and research and development as a percent of sales, increased by 10 basis points compared to last year and declined by 80 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Joint venture income was $80 million, 2% lower than last year and 12% lower than the prior quarter.","Earnings before interest and taxes were $566 million or 12.3% of sales, down from 12.4% a year-ago and 12.6% last quarter. Compared to the last year the key profitability issue was the sharp drop in demand for high horsepower engines and gensets, which was partially offset with positive pricing and material cost reductions. Well sequentially the drop in gross margin percent from higher product coverage costs was offset by lower selling and admin costs as a percent of sales.","Net earnings for the quarter were $432 million or $2.52 per diluted share with an effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 15.7%. The tax rate in the quarter was more than expected primarily as a result of the benefits related to legal entities stock transactions that we managed to complete in 2013, from the reconciliation of our tax accounts to our state income tax returns that generated some favorable adjustments and from a larger research and development tax credit than we have projected.","Moving onto the operating segments, let me highlight their performance during the year and in the fourth quarter and it include with revenue and profitability expectations for 2014.","In the Engine segment, fourth quarter revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 2% compared to last year and 3% compared to the third quarter. Compared to last year, stronger demand for construction and agriculture engines in North America and Europe, along with the higher on-highway parts sales in North America were partially offset by the reduced demand in global mining and power generation markets. Sequentially, demand increased in construction and agriculture markets in North America and Europe along with higher shipments to Chrysler. We experienced weaker demand in the North American heavy duty and Brazilian truck markets.","Segment EBIT margins were 9.2% in the quarter compared to 10.9% last year and in the third quarter. Compared to last year, the impact of the drop in high horsepower engine demand more than offset by material costs and improved pricing. Sequentially increase for the coverage costs, negative mix and an inventory write-down related to oil and gas market reduced margins by 170 basis points.","In 2014 we expect revenues to be up between 4% and 6%. On-highway revenues in North America will drive the majority of the growth as industry production grows in both the heavy and medium duty truck markets. We will also benefit from increased market share in the medium duty truck market. Continued weakness in global mining will result in industrial revenues remain in flat when compared to last year.","2014 EBIT margins are forecasted to be in the range of 10.5% to 11.5% of sales, compared to 10.4% for the full year 2013. Positive pricing, material cost savings and increased volumes will offset the impact of lower high horsepower volumes again in 2014, resulting in gross margin expansion. We anticipate high horsepower volumes to be flat to down 5% this year with the first quarter expected to mark the low point of the year.","The Component segment recorded record sales of $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 21% from the prior year and 6% from the prior quarter. Compared to last year, higher revenues were driven by market share gains in our emission solutions business along with strong demand in European and Chinese truck markets for turbochargers and aftertreatment systems. Compared to last quarter, sales increased in Europe ahead of the Euro 6 regulations which took effect in the first of January and in China where the industry continued to experience strong truck demand ahead of the National Standard 4 emission regulation implementation.","EBIT margins for the quarter were 12.3% of sales compared to 8.9% in the prior year and 12.3% last quarter. The increase in margins over the prior year was driven by higher volumes, lower material costs and very good SAR leverage.","2013 was a record year for the Component segment in terms of revenues, EBIT dollars and EBIT percent. We expect another record year in 2014 with revenues up 8% to 12% primarily due to increased penetration of aftertreatment systems in the North American medium duty truck market, stronger demand for all four businesses in the North American market and growth in our European aftertreatment business from truck transition from Euro 5 to Euro 6 standards at the beginning of 2014. EBIT margins for the segment are expected to be in the range of 12.25% to 13.25% of sales.","In the Power Generation segment, fourth quarter sales were $759 million, down 1% compared to last year and up 7% sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, weakness in Europe and India was partially offset by stronger demand in the United States. Sequentially, revenues increased due to stronger demand in North America.","EBIT margins were a disappointing 6.1% of sales in the quarter compared to 7.1% in the prior year and 6.3% last quarter. Compared to last year, improvement in gross margins on lower sales were more than offset by higher selling and admin expenses and lower joint venture earnings. Sequentially, what we continue to see improvement in operating performance in our manufacturing plants. This was offset by higher selling and admin expenses and from negative currency movements, in particular the British pound, which negatively impacted EBIT margins by over 1% in the quarter.","For 2014 we expect Power Gen sales growth to be in the range of minus 3% to plus 3%. In the United States lower military revenue will be offset by moderate growth in our base business along with the revenue from our new Connect line of gensets.","Margins will improve this year to between 7.75% and 8.75% of sales. This compares to 7.2% for the full year of 2013 and 6.2% for the second half of last year. The increase in margins will be driven by savings related to our previously announced actions in Europe and from ongoing operational improvements across the business.","For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 18% compared to last year and 14% sequentially. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, fourth quarter revenue increased by 3% compared to last year and by 13% sequentially. Compared to last year, growth was driven by stronger Power Generation and aftermarket demand in North America while currency movement negatively impacted the distribution revenues by 5%. Revenues increased sequentially in North America and Europe due to an acquisition in Nigeria.","EBIT margins for the quarter were 10% of sales compared to 10.8% a year ago. Improved margins on same-store sales were offset by the impact of foreign currency movements. Although the acquisitions completed during this time were accretive in EBIT dollars terms, there were dilutive as a percent of sales as we've previously explained. Sequentially, EBIT margins improved by 90 basis points with improvements in both gross margin and selling and admin costs as a percent of sales.","For 2013 we're forecasting revenue growth between 22% and 30% over 2013 levels, with 3% organic growth and the balance from acquisitions and we expect EBIT margins in the range of 9% to 10% of sales. We are on track with our North American acquisitions and for the company, we expect to add approximately $400 million of revenue this year and earnings of between $0.20 to $0.25 per share.","As Tom mentioned, we are projecting total company revenues to be up 4% to 8% in 2014. The majority of the growth this year will be related to the previously announced distributor acquisitions, market share increases in the North American medium duty truck and bus markets, growth and demand in the North American heavy duty truck market and increased content in European truck markets related to Euro 6 emission regulations.","Revenues will increase sequentially through the year with growth in the first half of the year towards a lower end of the guidance range and growth in the second half of the year towards the upper end of our guidance range. We expect EBIT margins to be between 12.75% and 13.25% for 2014. This compares to 12.5% of full year 2013 and represents a 23% incremental EBIT margin as the net point of the guidance.","As was the case in 2013, EBIT margins will be at the low point in the first quarter and will decline from first quarter 2013 levels due to seasonal weakness in power generation markets along with lower shipments and industrial high-horsepower markets. Compared to the first quarter of last year, high-horsepower engine shipments will be down 23%. As a result of this, we expect EBIT margins in the first quarter to be similar to those in the first quarter of 2013.","We remain focused on driving improvements in our gross margin in 2014 with benefits from lower material costs and from our supply chain initiatives and some improvement from pricing, primarily an aftermarket. We are currently projecting the tax rate to be approximately 28.5% this year, excluding any discrete items. Our tax rate guidance does not assume that the research and development's tax credit is extended into 2014 which will negatively impact the rate by 1.5 percentage points when compared with 2013.","Additionally, changes in tax legislation in the UK, one-time benefits that will not recur in 2014 and the fact that a higher proportion of our profits were currently in the United States this year will lead to an increased tax rate in 2014.","Finally let's turn to cash flow; we generated a record $3.1 billion in cash from operating activities in 2013 which equates to 12% of sales, an increase from the 90% of sales we generated in 2012. We continue to use that cash to reinvest back into the company and return value to our shareholders.","We increased the amount we returned to our shareholders by 34% in 2013 to $801 million. We increased our dividend by 25% which resulted in a dividend payment ratio of 28% for the full year and we repurchased 3.3 million shares for $381 million. We also continued to invest in the business with $676 million in capital expenditure projects in the year which was more than our initial guidance of $850 million.","Our debt to capital ratio did increase from 10% at the end of 2012 to 18% at the end of 2013, due to the debt offering that we completed in the third quarter of last year. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2014 will be somewhat at 2013 levels and within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales.","Capital expenditures this year are expected to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million and we anticipate a cash outflow of $400 million to $500 million on acquisitions, primarily related to the previously announced acquisition of our North American distribution channel.","Our cash balance will decline in 2014 as we execute distributor acquisitions and as we continue to return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Investors should expect that through the combination of dividends and buybacks, we will return at least $1 billion or 50% of the cash we expect to generate from operations which will be a 25% increase over 2013 levels.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark A. Smith","Thanks, Pat. We're now ready for question. If you can limit your first question to one single question and a related follow-up, we'd appreciate that and get back in queue. Thank you very much. We're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now conduct the question-and-answer question. (Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Thanks. I guess a couple of questions. One, just in terms of your top line outlook to 40%, I know a lot of the growth is coming from distribution, medium duty share, et cetera, but can you just give me a sense of the 40; a, is 2 points markets, 6 points secular growth just so we can get a better sense to that? And then Tom also is there any \u2013 how do we think about your approach to guidance in 2014 relative to the past couple of years when there has been disappointing \u2013 you guys have disappointed first this year our guide? And then I guess my last question, you alluded the first quarter is weak and then second half is better than the first half. In terms of the improvement as we go out throughout the year, is it more macro, is it more \u2013 that's when your market share gains or the distribution stuff hits, I'm just trying to get \u2013 in the restructuring. I'm just trying to get a sense of what's driving that improvement throughout the year? Thanks.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Jamie, good morning by the way. So let me just give the total answer. I'm going to let Mark talk a little bit about some of the details you asked, but hone wise [ph] we are trying to provide guidance that we think is most accurate relative to what we think is going to happen. And as I had mentioned to you before that's what we were trying to do before, obviously not as well as we should have. I think what we see today though is that most of our markets have bottomed out and that doesn't mean things can't get worst. As we mentioned mining markets are slipping further. But what we did do is chase the market down in power gen all year which was really disappointing. It's what we said we would not do. Instead we would get ahead of it and we would reduce costs approximately and we didn't do a good enough job on that. And I think that's one of the big reasons why we were disappointing on guidance. There were other reasons but that's a big one. So we did not feel like we did well there. We have taken a hard look at where we think markets are. I'd like to call them \u2013 the way we think they're most likely to be, but obviously taking a little bit more conservative look at the way we think economies are developing. So I think from that point of view, it's more conservative. I don't think we're trying to play the numbers anymore progressively or conservatively. We're just taking a more conservative look at economies because they really just happened to perform this well as we hoped. So let me know let Mark answer some of your more detailed questions.","Mark A. Smith","Hi, Jamie. So in terms of the 6% revenue growth at the midpoint of our guidance, 2.5% is going to come from the distributor acquisitions, almost 2% is going to come from emissions and new products. We've really got just under 1% for market growth. We've got growth in North America offset by weakness in international markets and then the balance is coming from market share and pricing.","Jamie Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay. And then just in terms of \u2013 so I guess driving the improvement in earnings throughout the year is just \u2013 that's when all your secular growth opportunities will fit the market, is that the way to think about it?","Patrick J. Ward","I think the way to think of it, Jamie, is that we're going to definitely see benefits from the macro environment as we get through the year. Going back to the remarks I made earlier on, first half of the year we expect to grow closer to 4%, second half of the year closer to 8%. So the volume benefit will come into play there. And as Tom mentioned in his comments, the restructuring activities (indiscernible) and power gen we expect to be done by the middle of the year. So you should expect power gen margins to improve as we grow through the year from those actions.","Jamie Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG","Okay, great. I'll let someone else get in queue. Thank you.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question is from Ann Duignan of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Good morning.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Good morning. I just want to go back to your market share growth expectations of roughly 1%. That would equate to something less than $200 million, and I think that there was an expectation out there from investors that this market share growth, our market outgrowth will be significantly higher than that. Can you just talk to that a little bit and give us a little bit of color and maybe it's a \u201915 event, not a \u201914 event, but if you could just address that, that would be great.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Two things to highlight; as you -- just to make sure we\u2019re level set. We separate two things, new products and market share you know that I think from our previous thing. So we look at those products that we launch and the market share gains by there it goes in new products. And then we look at market share those that gain where we have the main product and we just gain shares. So there\u2019s some separation between those two. And if you combine them you\u2019re looking at more like 2.5% than you're like to. That said, you\u2019re calculation to our terms is right. I\u2019ll let Rich comment a little bit more about how things are going. But one of the big movements of course is in North America, and we have of course gained some of the share already. So, what you\u2019re looking at is one year versus the other. But I'll let, maybe Rich you can talk a little bit about what's going on with the market share gains in North America.","Richard J. Freeland","Okay. Good morning, Ann. I'll just start with the mid range which is probably the most visible. So we\u2019ve, really two good things going on there, the market size is growing. So unlike heavy duty we have market size has gained from the last three years. Our share has grown from 50 to low 60s and now we\u2019re projecting 70% share. So that\u2019s the biggest piece and the most visible that we\u2019re going to have here. The products are terrific and we\u2019re gaining that. We also have series of new products coming out that Tom alluded to. So in China the 10, 12 liter we\u2019ll introduce this year, and so that\u2019s a combination of some new products and market share while there\u2019s another very visible one.","N. Thomas Linebarger","I think also and we\u2019ve got -- as Rich said we\u2019re ramping up in our mid-range business, so not all -- we won't get to 70% on day one, just as we had in 2013, we launched the product and then they had to market and when it gets to other people and all the rest of that. So, I think there\u2019s some ramp up assumption there as well. So, we\u2019re hopeful obviously to drive faster and get more shares; but what we tried to do is, do the most realistic how we can on that.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that\u2019s great color. I appreciate that. And just a follow-up on Power Gen, philosophically I know it's not probably a fair question given the size of the business whether that\u2019s Caterpillar\u2019s and the different mix because you don\u2019t have turbines in there. But can you talk about, what are some of the other structural differences between your Power Gen business and Caterpillar\u2019s, is it you\u2019re more low horsepower ready exposure or is it investments in new products to gain share. If you could just talk a little bit about the structural differences between you and some of your competitor\u2019s?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Just broadly speaking, I\u2019d say the biggest difference in our business and Caterpillars business is turbine. So the simplest way to compare the numbers would be that, and that is the big difference by the way. It's a big difference in how, what the cycles are right now, it's pretty noticeable. The second thing I think that we do have a components business which includes alternators, and as if we mentioned in our remarks the alternator business based in Europe has had a really rough time because volumes are falling so quickly in large power projects and that\u2019s in a high cost structure environment. So we are addressing that point and I think we\u2019ll see much better margins and results in that business as a result of those changes. But structurally turbine\u2019s is by far the biggest difference. I think if you do the math on there and see the difference in market that will explain most of the difference if you\u2019re looking for.","Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you. I appreciate it and I'll get back in line.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Hi, good morning.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Good morning, Jerry.","Richard J. Freeland","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tom, could you just flush out for us the opportunities on the fulltime light and heavy platforms based on the range of applications that you\u2019re targeting the engines for? Where do you think is a reasonable penetration rate target separately from the light and heavy duty platforms. And then from a margin structure I know this business is, should we think of a similar profitability profiles as we see in Dongfeng Cummins today?","N. Thomas Linebarger","I\u2019m going to let Rich talk a little bit about the markets and the growth side, because he\u2019s been working that for a while now and (indiscernible) an insight on that.","Richard J. Freeland","Good morning, Jerry. So just reminding folks in both of these products it's a different approach where we introduced in China with a brand new engine, so and then expand globally. So our objective and our results so far as we have emerging market cost with world class performance. So introduced in China and then take it up to global standards. And so I\u2019ll touch first on the 10, 12; we will introduce -- we said we would introduce it in Q2 and we\u2019re on track to do that and that will be for the 10 and 12 liter product in a partnership with Foton. That product and work is going on, and I in fact announced that it will meet emission standards off highway and meet current and future emission standards globally. So unlike the 2838 [ph] we will start in China and most of the volume will be in China as you look for the next 18 months. But we\u2019re talking to customers globally on this terrific product. On the 2838 [ph] there with same product, same strategy again introduced in China and then expand with the delays in that sub-4 standards we really had to test the strategy, can we sell this product globally? And in fact the sales have been higher outside of China than inside of China, in places like Russia, Brazil and now in Europe at Euro 6 standards. And from your second question on the margin structure very similar margin structure although it shows up a little bit differently and that we\u2019ll take a margin at the joint venture and then take a second margin when we sell the product to customers beyond our partners.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Rich just a clarification there, the ultimate penetration opportunity within Foton\u2019s own platform is just within China based on the range of applications you\u2019re targeting; where do you think the penetration rate it can go for your business over the next couple of years?","Richard J. Freeland","We\u2019re targeting to get to 25% market share in the heavy duty market, and again that won't be overnight in there, but it's a 300,000 market and so it's bigger than U.S. right now that 10 and 12 liter space. But it will not be a slow ramp up as we\u2019ll be introducing product by model and rolling that out.","N. Thomas Linebarger","The light duty as Rich said Jerry has been a slower penetration rate largely due to the fact that NS4 we designed the product to replace their existing engines at NS4. We have been making some progress there. Where we can get to is not clear, because Foton\u2019s own strategy in light duty and heavy duty are slightly different. But they\u2019re the market leader in light duty, and so they have a huge range of products that are very low end all the way up to higher end in terms of features in light duty. In the heavy duty market they\u2019re pretty much going at the mainstream and upper end markets, so our product kind of fits where they\u2019re trying to go and that\u2019s why Rich said that we\u2019re going to kind of start at a pretty good penetration rate and stay there provided to launch well and hit our quality targets et cetera. The light duty I think, we\u2019re just not clear how far it can go, but we really have -- it's all on the upside now. We really have not had much penetration inside Foton in China to date, and the NS4 standards are starting. And as we mentioned in our remarks they\u2019re starting to increase the share they take and that means we\u2019ve got a lot of volume. I mean they\u2019re a very, very large producer of light duty vehicles in China.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate the color. And then on the U.S. heavy duty side, a bit of volatility in the market share numbers. Can you just talk about the 38% market share target for \u201914; how do you gentlemen expect that to play out over the course of the year and any meaningful platform shifts that we should be looking for?","Richard J. Freeland","Okay. Yes, Jerry so we\u2019ve been saying for some time in the 35% to 40% range where we ought to be in any quarter because you can get variation just based on build rates at different OE\u2019s and so pretty confident on the 38% it's where we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years. Some slight changes sure whereas the, as PACCAR has increased their production of the 13 liter the MX product. We\u2019ll see some of our share which was planned to go down at PACCAR. And again it's an excellent product the 13 liter for that market we\u2019re partnered with them providing components in that space and that will be offset by some increases at Navistar and increases in our natural gas product in the heavy duty space.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Thank you very much.","Richard J. Freeland","And I guess just lastly, the incremental \u2013 we'll see that start early in the year, the increase from the Q4 number.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Thanks.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thanks, Jerry.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Your next question is from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Alexander Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies","Hi, guys. How are you'll?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies","I guess I had another follow-up question here on the Foton engine. You mentioned that you're gunning for a 25% share of China's heavy duty market. I guess that implies that you'll be using the Foton joint venture to sell engines to some other truck OEMs within China, and was just wondering if there might be a conflict there if people interpret that \u2013 say your first auto or whomever you're buying an engine basically produced by Foton. Do you view that as a problem?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Let me comment. So we're partnered with Foton there and our goal is to replace the existing business but also help Foton grow share with competitors there. So it's a combination of both. And then selling the product broader outside of China on top of that. And Alex just broadly speaking the 25% we're looking for we already have a significant share with Dongfeng from our DCEC joint venture. So when we do a set of market share targets, we're adding the two together to look at total heavy duty market share. We are trying to sell to some others but the conflict that you mentioned is real. That is exactly right in the truck companies, the integrated ones are not so interested in buying an engine from a joint venture from their competitor but there are some smaller companies. For example, I think we mentioned on our previous call we've been selling to one of the affiliates of Dongfeng (indiscernible) and we even signed them some engines from DCEC but I think those kind of companies you also can sell other engines too. So what we'll end up doing with regard to which engines go to which we'll see but the primary customers of those in terms of heavy duty market share will be DCEC to Dongfeng and the Foton joint venture into Foton.","Alexander Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies","Okay, that makes good sense. I guess my last question here is if you could give an update on the very high-horsepower hedgehog engine and what the update is there? If you're starting to see some initial uptick or initial interest from which segments and when you expect to start getting some volume there? Thanks.","Richard J. Freeland","So we're on schedule for this product and part of this schedule said we'd begin market seeding this year in the power gen markets, the diesel power gen markets. So in fact that will happen and we've received orders and we'll begin shipping in the second half of the year. We're also \u2013 we talked about entering new markets beyond power gen and in fact we are on target with that. We're not ready to announce who that is or when that is, our partners will do that. But those are products that will begin to sell. So from a product development standpoint, we're on schedule. And from where we plan to be on getting agreements with customers or selling in the power generation business, we are on schedule at this time.","N. Thomas Linebarger","(Indiscernible) you're going to see announcements that are going to \u2013 most of them will come next year. It's not that we won't do anything this year because we are. We're doing a lot of market seeding as Rick said, but next year is when we'll start to see. So these customers are using it here and that kind of thing. Again, mostly because each customer wants to do development with us and then they want to announce when they're kind of ready. I'm not saying there will be no announcements this year, I can't say that for sure but most of them are going to come next year.","Alexander Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies","Okay, very good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Good morning, guys.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Hi, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Tom or Pat, can you talk a little more about your engine margin in 4Q? We know about mix but can you talk about the increase in product coverage that you mentioned and maybe quantify the inventory write-down in the oil and gas that you took?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, I'll take the product coverage and maybe Rich can comment (indiscernible) oil and gas inventory write-down. Back in Q3 remember we took a favorable changing estimate we have at least from time to time where we reassess the warranty claims with engines in the population with a favorable adjustment in the third quarter. So that's really the delta when you look at Q3 to Q4. And that cost range in business sequentially almost 1% to 2% point. So it was insignificant for them. And then on inventory.","Richard J. Freeland","Just to quantify that, that was about $7.5 million the one-time write-down, which will not repeat.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Okay, that's helpful guys. And then I may not be doing this right but I'm going to ask it anyway, Pat. So if I look at the segment guidance that you gave and then I look at the overall 48% guidance, the segment guidance seems to equate to the middle of the range, toward the high end of your 48% range and that's includes eliminations. Am I doing that right? Are you discounting your segments to some extent or am I not doing that right?","Patrick J. Ward","(Indiscernible) so the way to think of eliminations going forward, as we acquire more of our North American distributors, the elimination percent will go up. So historically we've been in the 16% to 18% range and we should be thinking more of a 20%, 21% number this year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Okay, so that's the answer to that.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital","Okay, that's fair. I'll get back in queue. Thank you, guys.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Thank you very much for your question. Our next question is from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Good morning.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a couple of question, just on your on-highway outlook by region and you've got China down 7% in 2014 and India and Brazil flat and India flat, North Korea very weak 2013. So I'm wondering how your outlook kind of compares to current order run rates and generally how much visibility do you have in those markets right now?","Richard J. Freeland","It varies by market as you guessed how much visibility we get. In China we get a little bit less because the market numbers published statistics are just not quite as reliable. We do have very good relationships with the OEMs. I think we get their best. Here the question is how good is theirs? And really there's been quite a bit of volatility related to this when is NS4 going to go. In fact order rates for NS4 equipment were higher in Q4 than we expected both on the components and the engine side which again was encouraging in the sense that the OEMs are trying to implement NS4. But how many are selling through there's no data on that today. You can't see how many end customers are buying them, so it's a little bit hard to know. It's tough to make (indiscernible), is it going to go through. So that's why we see some volatility in China. Again, what we're thinking through is as you kind of look across the whole year and the NS4 gets steadily implemented, volumes will likely shrink because of the sort of excess production or purchases in the fourth quarter last year. It's just simply as I recall looking across the year but we just think there's going to be a fair bit of volatility. On Brazil we do have a little bit more visibility but again there was definitely some cost relation involved solely created by the whole thing about FINAME. FINAME is such a big benefit to purchasers especially of larger trucks that the fact that program is varying a little bit, I don't think people really know how much effect that's going to have on customers. And so there's a little bit of guess work involved with that. We do think our current order rates are pretty consistent of what we've got, but we really don't know over a longer run how that's going to play out. So to your question there definitely is more uncertainty and volatility associated with some of those international markets than you might see in the U.S. India, there's not that much of volatility, there's just not that much action. That market was clobbered really hard last year. I'm not saying it can't go lower but it's really low right now and there's not much energy I don't think can make it stronger. Is that helpful on those markets?","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, that's great guys. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on China. So I guess when you couple your outlook for China on-highway being down 7%, the uncertainty with NS4, you mentioned \u2013 it sounds like a pretty tepid outlook for the excavator market in China in 2014, so clearly pretty anemic environment. How does that impact your customers' appetite for a lot of the new products that you're planning to release this year and over the next several years, because clearly some of your customers have got \u2013 particularly on the construction side have got to be struggling right now?","N. Thomas Linebarger","They are. I think to the point you raised, I think the customers \u2013 we have seen lower uptake of products. We talked about the light duty engines. I mean the light duty engine plan was a lot faster launch and penetration of Foton than we've seen. Now as we have said, we were able to scramble and move the international sales plan ahead of its original and we got a lot of good sales of exports on the light duty engines. But the penetration at Foton is in terms of just what we had anticipated some years ago is several years behind and that\u2019s just because of the -- Foton did not have much appetite to take on a higher-tech engine until NS4 goes in, but it is going in. So they are now doing it. Again, whether they\u2019re happy about it or not, there they are putting it in and the result and the reason is they need the technology. I think in the construction side, our construction partner LiuGong on our joint venture there is really seeing those products as a way for them to compete not just domestically but internationally. So they have quite a bit of appetite, I think as they\u2019re of course seeing exports as a big opportunity for them to grow in what's otherwise an anemic home market. So, there is a lot of energy. So, I would say generally speaking, energy level is high but penetrating in the China market without the need for emissions technology, if you\u2019re product is more expensive it's very difficult to do. I think that\u2019s one of the really terrific things about a new heavy duty 10 and 12 liter engine as Rich and his team have worked incredibly hard to make sure that engine is competitive on a like-for-like basis with existing products while still offering the benefit to upgrade to new technology and all of the other fuel economy and the other benefits that our technology can offer them. That\u2019s a really hard design challenge, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re able to do it in this heavy duty engine and I think that\u2019s kind of a [C-Change] [ph] for us as a Company.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question is from the line of Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Good morning guys.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Good morning, Steve.","Richard J. Freeland","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","I am wondering if we can talk just a little bit about heavy duty truck here in North America in the last couple of months as order rates have been, it looked to me to be stronger than what you\u2019re factoring in for 2014 which I suppose is prudent. But can you just give a little color on what you\u2019re seeing vis-\u00e0-vis those order rates and if you think there\u2019s some reason that things will decelerate and then as you\u2019re doing that, should we still think of this as one of the higher incremental margin businesses that you're able to flex up production a little bit?","Richard J. Freeland","Steve, I\u2019ll go and take a first short at this. So, well we\u2019ve seen in four months it looked pretty good now, in particularly the last two months. And all the signals that we all look at, look positive although they have for some time I guess is the concern that I have got here. So, but I think the way you got to think about us is we\u2019re, right now the industry is building fewer than orders are, so backlogs are growing. And so the one thing I can\u2019t say is, when it does change we tend to change fairly significantly, because at a certain point you have to build more than orders to take that backlog down. And so we have not built that in at this point, because we have been -- there\u2019s been a couple of false alarms on this right over the last two or three years. So I think we\u2019re pretty prudent. What we do know, if it swings it swings heavy and that\u2019s what we\u2019re good at. We\u2019ve got capacity in place, we in fact invested over the last couple of years anticipating not knowing when it happened but knowing it would at some point. So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing right now as we\u2019re watching this closely seeing is there going to be an inflection point where build rates go up to either match orders or in fact go up to start taking backlog down, and we\u2019re from a capacity standpoint our position to respond to that when or if that happens.","N. Thomas Linebarger","And Steve that\u2019s really what makes the incremental margin good in this business. So we have got one plant very efficient assembly plant. We got a really good supply chain. We have heavy content on the engine. We have components and we have the engine assembly. We have a good position in the market. So, yes it's a good incremental margin and bridges plants, especially the Jamestown plant, it's a terrific ramp up plant and so yes, we\u2019ll do really well. But I just -- I want to go back to Jamie\u2019s original question though about our posture. We watched the heavy duty truck market start out stronger two years in a row. And so we\u2019re just -- we would love it to be stronger, don\u2019t get me wrong, that would be really good. But we took a little more conservative posture none in terms of how we estimate financials, but in terms of, hey what's the economy going to do because frankly we were a little more aggressive in the last two years and that didn\u2019t pay out so much in this -- in the markets that we find ourselves in. So we are not counting the chickens yet basically. But that said, all the statistics that you talked about are there. This is the market that\u2019s ready to find more than a replacement and we\u2019re definitely ready to supply it. So if that happens we will benefit for sure.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","And just to be clear, there\u2019s nothing in your conversations with your customers or the fleets that would suggest there\u2019s any big kind of drop off in orders in the near term?","N. Thomas Linebarger","No, there definitely is not, and just to see the conversations with end customers and OEMs really sound the same as they did for the last year or two. So everybody sees the same data, all the big fleets they running their business pretty efficiently, they feel like they\u2019ve been doing the same thing for a long time. So, one of the problems I think in this situation is that conversations aren\u2019t that different. The order rates are definitely up, nobody things they\u2019re going to rank that down or anything at least as far as I have heard. But there\u2019s not nobody bubbly either, it's kind of the same. I mean Rich you should say if you feel differently it. It's about the same kind of conversation. So I guess from that point Steve, it\u2019s hard to read those TVs a little bit.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. And maybe Tom, can I ask you a philosophical question, you were kind enough and maybe you regret this already, but you laid out some growth scenarios for us at the analyst day, sort of getting to the bottom end of what you gave us for 2015 is starting to look like perhaps the stretch would certainly get some double-digit top line growth in 2015 if we get there. How do you think about those targets? Is this something that you really want to manage to or is this just sort of a case where the world changes and we just have to sort of roll with that?","N. Thomas Linebarger","The way that I would think about those Steve, same as I talked about before is that what I am trying to layout for investors is, what\u2019s our best estimate of what we think the markets are going to do and what we\u2019re going to do, what's our strategy to deal with that environment. And again at this point it's hard to say where we're relative to those targets. Some things may result -- it wasn\u2019t that long ago and we definitely didn\u2019t have a linear track on our growth targets. We expected the earlier years to be worse of course we were in not such a great market when we gave those. And it will come down to the rate of recovery of economies in 2015 and beyond, and that right now that\u2019s hard to tell. But if economies recover well, I feel very, very confident in those numbers. And if they don\u2019t recover to your point we\u2019ll have to go back and say well, instead of kind of a medium level set of economies as we anticipated we had another -- we had really lousy ones and so here\u2019s where we\u2019re going to be. And we will adjust to course if we see differently, but right now its way too early to say and a few things are worse than we thought at that point, but it's really early days and again it will just really depend of the recovery. We have positioned ourselves incredibly well in the markets that we\u2019re in. That\u2019s the most frustrating part of this whole environment that we\u2019re in, because I keep having to tell you guys how good we\u2019re going to do when markets improve and they not haven't really improved, but we have terrific leadership in markets and products with customers. So a little bit of turn on these economies you mentioned right, heavy duty truck but any of them really and we will see significant benefits. So, right now I\u2019m just watching and what I\u2019m using those goals as is -- how we\u2019ll respond to that environment as it comes.","Stephen Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thanks, Steve.","Richard J. Freeland","Thank a lot.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you very much.

Sir, please go ahead.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2018.","Joining me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger, our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward, and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland, will all be available for your questions after our prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2018. Pat will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.","We delivered strong quarterly sales and record profits in the third quarter. Revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the third quarter of 2017, with growth in all of our operating segments and most major geographic markets. EBITDA was a record $983 million, or 16.5% of sales compared to $788 million or 14.9% of sales a year ago.","Engine business revenues increased 17% compared to a year ago, due to strong demand in on-highway markets in North America and growth in construction both in China and North America. EBITDA for the quarter was 14.9% of sales compared to 11.8% a year ago. EBITDA percent increased with the impact of higher material costs more than offset by the benefit of higher volumes, improved pricing and lower warranties.","Sales for our Distribution segment grew by 10% year-over-year, driven by higher demand for new engines and for parts and service in off-highway markets. Third quarter EBITDA was 8% of sales compared to 6.8% in the third quarter of 2017. EBITDA percent and dollars have improved throughout 2018 because of targeted price increases and cost control measures.","Third quarter revenues for the Components segment rose by 14%. Sales in North America increased 25% and revenues in international markets grew 2%. Increased truck build rates in North America along with sales from the automated transmission business drove domestic growth. International sales increased through strengthened European truck markets offset lower demand in China. The automated transmission business contributed 5% to segment growth.","EBITDA for the third quarter in the Components segment was a record $288 million or 16.4% of sales compared to 16.9% in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA margin declined due to the dilutive effect of the automated transition business, which reached its one-year anniversary in the third quarter.","The share of heavy-duty trucks in North America with an automated transmission has risen steadily over the last year, with adoption rates now at 73% in new trucks. Fuel economy benefits and improvement in drivability have lead to the strong adoption of the technology and even Cummins is a market share leader in North America.","Power Systems sales in the third quarter grew 5% year-over-year, with higher demand for power generation equipment and an increase in sales to oil and gas customers, partially offset by a reduction in marine revenues. EBITDA in the third quarter was 14.7% of sales compared to 10.5% a year ago, driven by the positive impact of higher sales and the benefits of previous restructuring actions.","In our electrified powertrain business, third quarter EBITDA was a loss of $30 million. There's a strong customer interest in our technology and we are actively developing products for urban and shorter-range applications where we expect the quickest adoption of this technology.","Now I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the third quarter of 2018, starting with North America, and then I will cover some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America grew 17% in the third quarter due to growth in demand in most end markets and ramp-up of the automated transmission business.","Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks grew 23% in the third quarter of 2018 while sales of our heavy-duty engines increased by 30%. Our year-to-date market share through August was 34%, up 1.5% from last year. Demand in the medium-duty truck market remains near record levels, with industry production of medium-duty trucks improving 24% in the third quarter and up 17% year-to-date.","Our market share in the medium-duty truck market is 81% year-to-date through August, up from 79% a year ago. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 17% compared to a year ago and are on track to be flat for the full year.","Engine sales for construction equipment in North America increased 36% in the third quarter, reflecting general strength in the economy and a 6% increase in U.S. construction spend. Engine sales to high-horsepower markets in North America were flat compared to a year ago.","Higher demand from oil and gas customers was offset by lower marine sales while mining revenues were flat. Current oil prices will support continued investment in fracking, an important market for us in North America. While fundamentals for this market remain strong, we have seen OEMs reduce their orders in the second half 2018 due to pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin impacting the ability to increase production.","Revenues for power generation grew by 10%, due to higher demand in the global data center and North American recreational vehicle markets. Orders were above shipments for the third consecutive quarter, with industry supply chain challenges constraining production.","Our international revenues increased by 6% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China including joint ventures were $1.1 billion, a decrease of 7%, due to lower sales in on-highway markets.","Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China decreased by 24% compared to a year ago, in line with our expectations. Year-to-date, our market share was 12% through September compared to 14% last year.","Third quarter market share improved to 16% from 11% in the first half of the year, as we increased power penetration of our engines at our OEM partners. We continue to work diligently with our partners in preparation of new product launches for NS VI emission standards in 2019. For example, we recently received certification on our 12-liter heavy-duty engine, fitted with a Cummins fuel system, turbocharger and aftertreatment system, making the ISX12 the first heavy-duty engine certified to the NS VI standards in China.","Industry sales of light-duty trucks grew by 8% in the third quarter and our engine market share was 7%, in line with our full-year guidance. Demand for excavators in China in the third quarter increased 34% from a year ago. Our market share through September increased to 15%, up 1% year-over-year.","Revenues for our Power Systems business in China increased 8%, due to growth in engine shipments to mining customers, higher demand for power generation equipment for data centers and increased sales into the domestic oil and gas market. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $543 million, an increase of 20% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased 39% compared to a year ago, driven by strong economic growth and domestic infrastructure investment.","Year-to-date, our market share is 40%, unchanged from 2017. In Brazil, our revenues increased by 16%, primarily due to a recovering economy resulting in improved demand for trucks compared to a weak 2017. Third quarter revenues were the strongest in four years.","Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2018 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We continue to forecast total company revenues for 2018 to be up 15% to 17%. We are maintaining our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America at 286,000 units, up 29% compared to 2017. We continue to expect our market share to be at the high-end of the market share range we gave of 31% to 34%. In the medium-duty truck market, we are maintaining our forecast for industry production to reach 133,000 units, up 13% year-over-year.","We are increasing our market share expectations in this market to the top end of our prior guidance range of 75% to 78%. We continue to expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for the full year, compared to a very strong 2017 and at the highest level in 10 years.","In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be up 1%, unchanged from our prior guidance. We are maintaining our outlook for medium and heavy-duty truck sales of 1.3 million units, 1% lower than 2017. Having said that, there is uncertainty about the demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China over the next 9 months to 12 months, given the impact of China's blue sky initiative, which includes certain incentives to replace older NS III trucks and the potential for a pre-buy of NS V vehicles before the implementation of the more stringent NS VI regulation in the middle of 2019.","Our year-to-date market share in the medium and heavy-duty truck segment in China is 12% and we expect full year market share to be 12% consistent with our prior forecast. In the light-duty truck market, we now expect growth of 10% in 2018, up from our previous guidance of 5%, primarily due to government policy changes designed to increase demand. In our light-duty truck market, we expect our full-year share to be 7%, consistent with our prior projection.","In India, we expect total revenues including joint ventures to be up 20% year-over-year, higher than our previous forecast of 18%, due to higher outlook for truck demand. In July, the Indian government surprised the industry by introducing regulations that allow higher loads per vehicle. The new regulations caused a sharp decline in truck sales in July followed by a recovery in August and September. Underlying demand for trucks remains strong, and we expect the industry to produce a record number of trucks in 2018.","In Brazil, we continue to forecast truck production to increase 20% in 2018 compared to a weak 2017. Improved domestic demand for trucks in Brazil offset lower demand for exported Brazilian trucks in Argentina.","We expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to increase 20%, down from our previous forecast of 35% growth, with oil and gas shipments up 66% and mining shipments up 30%. These compare to our prior guidance of oil and gas up 100% and mining up 40%, respectively.","While engine shipment growth is moderated from level seen in the first half of the year, we continue to benefit from higher rebuild and part sales due to size and utilization of the engine population in the field.","In summary, we have maintained our full-year outlook and expect to deliver record sales, EBITDA, operating cash flow and earnings per share in 2018. Our full-year EBITDA range of 14.8% to 15.2% represents incremental EBITDA margins of 20% at the midpoint, excluding impact of our two startup businesses, automated transmissions and electrified power trains, but including the campaign in tariff-related costs.","We expect tariff-related costs of $80 million in 2018, down from our previous estimate of $100 million, and our plans and estimated cost for the aftertreatment campaign in North America remain unchanged. Tariff-related costs in 2019 are expected to be $50 million more than our prior projections, due to the finalization of Section 301 List 3, and we expect to offset the majority of the tariff costs through a combination of pricing and supply chain adjustments.","During the quarter, we delivered just under $1 billion of operating cash flow, allowing us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. In Q3, we returned $682 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plans to return 75% of operating cash flow this year.","Our Board of Directors recently approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, underscoring our plans to continue returning cash to shareholders in the future. We also continue to actively pursue opportunities for acquisitions and partnerships that will add to our profitable growth while maintaining strong returns.","Last week, we received regulatory approval for the previously announced purchase of Navistar's 50% equity of the JAC Navistar Diesel engine company. The new joint venture will continue its operations at its manufacturing facility at Hefei.","Cummins already supplies some light-duty midrange and heavy-duty engines to JAC Motors for its domestic markets in China as well as its global operations. This joint venture will continue offering leading NS V diesel engines, and focus on developing new products to meet NS VI standards.","In October, we also announced that we have signed a Letter of Intent with Isuzu Motors to explore partnership opportunity in the powertrain area. We're optimistic that this partnership will result to increased growth and profitability for both companies.","With that, I would like to thank you for your interest today. We had a strong quarter. We're on track for record full-year results, extending our track record of improving performance over prior cycles and continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are also making significant strides in executing our strategy to drive more profitable growth in the future.","Now let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the company's third quarter financial results before discussing the performance of the operating segments in some more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2018.","Third quarter revenues were $5.9 billion, an increase of 12% from a year ago. Sales improved in each of the operating segments driven by stronger demand in global on-highway, industrial and power generation markets.","Sales in North America, which represented 61% of our third quarter revenues, grew 17% from a year ago due to increased demand for our Engines and our Components to meet higher levels of truck production and for construction equipment.","International sales increased by 6% from last year due to higher demand in India, Latin America, and in China from on-highway and construction markets. A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted international sales by 3%.","Gross margins were 26.1% of sales, up from 25.4% a year ago as a result of stronger volumes, more (16:56) warranty expense and favorable pricing, which more than offset the headwind from currency and from tariffs.","Selling, admin and research and development costs of $833 million were $13 million lower than last year and 200 basis points lower as a percent of sales. Increased research and development spend related to investment in new technologies was more than offset by lower variable compensation expense.","Joint venture income of $90 million decreased by $5 million compared to last year due mainly to weaker truck demand in China. Other income decreased by $23 million due to the absence of a gain recognized in the third quarter of last year from the sale of power generation rental assets to acquire our (17:43) Distribution business.","Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were a record $983 million or 16.5% of sales for the quarter, compared to $788 million or 14.9% a year ago. EBITDA as a percent of sales improved primarily due to the positive impact of the higher sales warranty and variable compensation expense, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar.","Net earnings for the quarter were a record $692 million or $4.28 per diluted share compared to $453 million or $2.71 from a year ago. Our tax rate in the quarter was 13.3%, which included $37 million or $0.23 per share of favorable discrete items, most of which related to the 2017 tax reform bill.","In addition to this we have now lowered our projected full-year effective tax rate to 21% excluding discrete items compared to our prior guidance of 23%. Excluding the discrete tax items, the net income attributable to Cummins in the third quarter was $655 million or $4.05 per diluted share.","Moving on to the operating segments. Let me summarize their performance in the quarter and then the outlook for the full year. And then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and concluded with some comments on the cash flow.","In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 17% from last year. On-highway revenues grew by 17%, driven primarily by increased truck production in North America. Off-highway revenues increased by 14% as a result of stronger demand for construction equipment in both China and in North America.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $405 million or 14.9% of sales. This compares to $276 million or 11.8% a year ago. Benefits from stronger volumes, warranty expense and favorable pricing actions more than offset increased material costs.","We expect full-year Engine segment revenues to be up 17.5% to 18.5% compared to a prior guidance of 17% to 19%. Our forecast for EBITDA margins remains in the range of 13.25% to 13.75% of sales.","For our Distribution segment, third quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, an increase of 10% compared to last year. The growth in sales was primarily driven by higher demand across all product lines in North America and favorable pricing partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.","EBIT for the quarter increased by 29% to $155 million or 8% of sales compared to $120 million or 6.8% a year ago. Benefits from the higher sales, favorable pricing and low variable compensation expense more than offset unfavorable currency movements and the absence of the gain of a divestiture of assets related to the power generation rental equipment last year.","For 2018, Distribution revenue and EBITDA guidance is unchanged with revenues projected to increase 9% to 11% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 7% to 7.5% of sales.","For the Components segment, Revenues were $1.8 billion in the quartera, 14% increase from a year ago. The Eaton Cummins joint venture contributed 5% to growth. Sales in North America increased 25% due to higher heavy-and medium-duty truck production, while international revenues grew 2%, with lower demand in China offset by stronger sales in Europe.","Segment EBITDA for the quarter increased by 11% to $288 million or 16.4% of sales compared to $259 million or 16.9% of sales last year. The decline in the EBITDA percentage is due to the impact of the Eaton Cummins joint venture.","For 2018, we expect revenue to increase 22% to 24% compared to our prior guidance of up 23% to 25% due to the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. And we continue to expect EBITDA to be in the range of 14% to 14.5% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.","In the Power Systems segment, third quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. Power generation sales grew by 10% as a result of higher demand for power generation equipment in North America, the Middle East and in India.","Industrial sales declined by 1%, as increased sales to oil and gas customers were offset by a reduced demand for Marine equipment. EBITDA increased by 47% to $163 million or 14.7% of sales in the quarter up from $111 million or 10.5% last year, driven by the positive impact of the higher sales and benefits of the previous restructuring actions.","For 2018, we now expect Power Systems segment revenues to increase 12% to 14% versus our prior guidance of up 15% to 17%. Although demand in mining and oil and gas markets remains strong, we have seen a modest decline in near-term orders as customers focus on redeploying recently purchased equipment.","EBITDA margins are forecasted to be between 13.75% to 14.25% of sales compared to a previous guidance of 13.5% to 14%, as a result of continued improvements in our operational performance.","In the Electrified Power segment, EBITDA losses were $30 million as we continue to invest in new products and get closer to the launch of the 2019 products. For the full year, we now expect a net expense of $85 million to $95 million. And for the company we continue to project revenue growth of 15% to 17% this year. Foreign currency headwinds in the second half of the year are now expected to fully offset the benefit to revenue that we experienced in the first half of the year compared to a prior estimate of an increase of $100 million for the full year.","Our third quarter revenues were negatively impacted by $70 million compared to a year ago and we expect the headwind in the fourth quarter of $150 million at current rates. Income from our joint ventures is expected to be flat in 2018 in line with our previous guidance. We are forecasting EBITDA margins to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.2% for 2018, unchanged from our previous guidance.","Full-year incremental EBITDA margins are projected to be 20% excluding the impact of the Eaton Cummins joint venture and the electrified power train business but including all the campaign and tariff-related costs.","Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities for the third quarter was $915 million, $270 million higher than last year. And we anticipate operating cash flow performance for the year will remain within our long-term guidance of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditure during the quarter was $175 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $361 million. And we start to expect the full year capital expenditure will be in the range of $730 million to $760 million.","As we indicated during our previous earnings teleconference, we plan to return approximately 75% of the cash generated from operations to our shareholders in the forms of dividend and share buybacks this year. In the third quarter we repurchased 2.8 million shares with the previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase program and made dividend payments totaling $183 million. For the first nine months of the year, we have returned $1.4 billion which includes the repurchase of approximately 5.3 million shares.","In summary, we delivered very strong operating performance in the third quarter with 12% growth in sales, EBITDA up 25% from last year and operating cash flow of over $900 million. And we remain on track to deliver record sales, EBITDA, operating cash flow and earnings per share in 2018.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Pat. Now we're ready to move to the Q&A portion of the call. You can please try and limit your questions to initial question and a related follow-up and then get back in queue, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Tom, I'm wondering if you could expand on the China National VI opportunity set for you folks. What is the incremental components opportunity as you see it? What's the timing of the line reviews, if you will? And then in terms of the enforcement actions next year, how do you expect the enforcement to play out on this emission cycle compared to others?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. So let me just first talk about how the NS VI thing will play out. I'll ask Mark to comment a little bit on the numbers for each of the component in engines. But how the NS VI is going to go now is originally the plan was for 2020 with some cities going earlier and then the country going across the 2020. The blue sky initiative, which is China's effort to obviously to reduce pollution and clean up the environment, many, many cities have pulled forward now. And the national implementation is now moved up to the middle of 2019.","What will actually happen, how it will be implemented across the country, cities versus the full country, I think there's still some uncertainty about that actually. I mean, even though I would've said that they were locked down on the middle of 2019, I think given economic challenges and other things, I'm not as clear as I was then. So we'll see. We are driving our programs to be ready for the middle of 2019.","In addition to that, they've also launched this program I mentioned in my script about offering incentives to turn in NS III vehicles. So if you have an older truck, you can get compensated for turning it in and purchasing a newer truck, which, of course, is trying to drive older more polluting trucks off the road. And we're not sure what impact that's going to have on demand, but it has already had a positive impact on demand to-date. So we'll see what happens over the next 9 to 12 months.","There's also of course this general decline in the need for trucks given that the economy is not growing as strongly. So, all these factors are coming in together. And that's why I mentioned in my remarks, it's just not clear to me, especially over the next 12 months what demand is likely to do.","Our opportunity though is pretty clear and we see both opportunity for market share gain and components addition into each of our engines that we sell, which represents a big sales growth opportunity for us. And, Mark, you might want to highlight further numbers.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Yes, over China and India, because we've got similar regulations coming in, in India as well, we've got about an incremental $700 million of components revenue opportunity there, Jerry, and about 70% of that plus is going to be in China.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then in Power Systems, really strong margin performance this quarter, despite what I would imagine was a negative surprise from demand standpoint in mining in particular. Can you just talk about the year-over-year improvement? How much of that was the restructuring benefits and any other moving pieces that played out in the quarter for Power Systems?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","I think there's no one factor really, Jerry. It's just a combination of good operating performance and a tight supply chain environment. And most of it is really on the cost reduction side and the volume.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","I guess to add to that, as you know, we've had a pretty strong program now over several years and the restructuring benefits that we mentioned we've been tracking over time and those are now playing through. There's still some yet to get in the alternator business, but broadly speaking, we've worked through most of those restructuring activities and with volumes increasing, even when they're not as much as we were originally expecting in mining and oil and gas, we're still seeing benefits of higher volumes in a lower cost structure. That's fundamentally what's going on and why we're seeing improved margins.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. I guess two questions. Tom, probably understanding you don't want to talk about 2019, but a lot of your customers are talking about sort of extended visibility into 2019, in particular on the heavy-duty truck side. So can you just talk to which markets you feel most comfortable with that we could see sort of growth next year?","And then the other question I keep getting from investors is as they think about 2019 they're trying to understand the correct earnings base to grow earnings off of. So, when we think about 2019 and the right base, can we add back the product campaign costs? Or do we include that in the base as we think about things?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Let me let Rich talk a little bit about market since he's been together the plans, he's been paying pretty close attention to where markets are and then I'll come back and talk a little bit about the campaign.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. Let me just circle around two or three of the bigger markets, Jamie, then you can follow up. Let's start with the truck North America. You see the numbers; it still looks really good. I mean we're \u2013 retail sales are strong. The freight data continues very strong. I'd say we have seen maybe some leveling of what the spot rates are now that we pay attention to, but we're right now the backlog of 286,000 units, okay? And I don't see that backlog going down significantly between now and end of the year. So I think we're going to enter 2019 in a pretty strong position on North America trucks. I don't think we're done there.","Kind of the same story on medium-duty truck in North America. I think Tom talked about China, so I think there's more downside in China. We've seen kind of potentially offset by this blue sky on NS V. We think that could be as much as 100,000 units incremental to what it would've been next year in China. So I think that'll help shore that up a little bit.","The PowerGen business, the power generation business we think still has more momentum going into 2019. And so we're going to end the year there again with over the last three quarters we've added about $150 million of future orders going into next year, which is the strongest we've been in five or six years.","And then we touched a little bit on mining and oil and gas. We've seen a pause in both of them. And so I think from a \u2013 in the second half of the year, we do view that as a pause right now based on what we see capital spending going in those industries, so actual rates going up from where we are in the second half of the year. So that's some of the bigger markets that we've got out there.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","And I'll let Rich comment more on the warranty and emissions campaign, but we do not expect the emissions campaign to repeat as a P&L item. Obviously, we have to still execute the campaign so that's going to take \u2013 happen over several years. But we do expect that we will not repeat the expenses there and that was a big hit to us in 2018. So of our total warranty numbers, which were something like 0.1% for the year, 1.6% of that is this emissions campaign.","So as Rich just talked about we're kind of that at 2.5, 2.4 level and we're trying to drive that down. So as we put together the plan, we'll be trying to put a warranty plan together and the actions that we're taking, we hope to drive that number down for 2019. We haven't finished our plan yet, so will see what we come up but we do not expect that significant hit of 1.6% to continue.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","How you doing, Steve?","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Good. Thanks. Just on the JV, I think last quarter you said you were looking at profitability in 2020. It seems like you maybe hit the breakeven a little bit faster than expected. Was that just volume-related? And how does that timing change? Or how does that achieving the breakeven earlier change your view of timing of profitability?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","I think we had a really good Q3. I will say there were a couple of one-time positives in Q3, Steven, that helped us out. But we are generally ahead of schedule. We've talked about 2020 as a breakeven, and I'm optimistic that we will certainly achieve that and potentially beat that. But there was a couple of unusuals in Q3. Small, but it helped us get to breakeven a little sooner.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then you guys have done a handful of deals and partnerships. But it sounds like you had a much longer list of things that you've been reviewing in the hopper. Can you just give us a sense of how that pipeline looks for deals and JVs? And how many of these partnerships as we think about over 2019 would be additive to earnings versus sort of just net cost additors and fill technology are the partnership blossoms and develops?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Steve, it's a great question. And what I'll do just given time is I'll try to give a reasonably short answer, and then obviously we can talk more about it in Investor Day or through calls. But broadly speaking, we've got several major growth initiatives that which I laid out the last Investor Day where we have a set of candidates that we're looking for. It's not a gigantic universe. We started with a big universe, but we've really narrowed down the places that we like to grow through acquisition or partnership.","And then what we're looking for is the opportunity so that we could make that partnership or acquisition at a cost that we think drives positive return for shareholders and grow profitable growth for our company. And given asset prices and thing that's not that easy to do right? And we're just going to make sure that we get the right spot on that and that's so it's not a gigantic universe.","The second area that we're looking is in these new technology areas we need to build capabilities. That's a very big universe. There's a lot of companies. But then again, we want to make sure that we're getting capabilities that add to the ones we have. And so the example is the battery companies we purchased, and just recently EDI. Very, very good acquisition, not very large in size and, as you mentioned, tend to have more technical capabilities than they have earnings. So those are kind of the ones that produce earnings in the future, and basically produce expenses today.","And then the third category is the partnerships you see with JAC, and now this Letter of Intent we have with Isuzu, which are basically trying to make sure that in our core business there is a lot of companies looking around trying to figure out what they're going to spend their investment on. And we want to make sure that as those companies think about investing less in diesel or natural gas or want some support on their new investments in electrification and other technologies that they see us as a potential partner.","So we are very active in that space. We have a discussion, at least I do at least twice a month, and I think Rich is about the same with different large OEMs around the world thinking about this issue. So those are very active and there is a lot of potential partnerships there. It's the people in our industry, but those are very active discussions.","So that's kind of the field. So in total it's a pretty large set of potential. But each one is pretty focused on either building capabilities, forming partnerships to add to our base or looking for these particular growth opportunities at the right price. Those are kind of the combination of things we're looking for.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","That's very helpful, Tom. Just any sense of whether it's sort of net additives to earnings or dilutive. Or...","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","I would say this, that the partnerships that we form are generally speaking additive to earnings or neutral. The technology investments for the most part are not. And the other \u2013 the opportunities for growth I mentioned at the start, those would be additive to earnings significantly, but they're fewer and harder to do.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, Tom.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. And your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. First just on the incremental margins on the Engines and Components segments, if we back out some of the charges from a year ago and looking at double-digit top line growth, your incremental seem to come in a little bit below kind of target range and from quarter-to-quarter any number of swings. But just wanted to understand supply chain-related pressures, anything that was specific to the quarter? And kind of general outlook for seeing a little bit better flow-through moving forward?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Joe. You're right. There's a lot of moving parts. I would say both took a little bit of a hit on FX and both segments had some challenges from supply chain, probably around $10 million in each business in the quarter from kind of expedited costs and things like that. And then the rest is natural variation.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Is there anything in general that you see is preventing you from getting closer to 20% plus kind of incrementals on the EBIT line moving forward in those segments?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Not in the base business. We've got the joint venture which is \u2013 we've talked about separately, but no not in the businesses.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And...","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Joe, I'd add one more thing, just, Kevin, for you. This year and then looking forward tariffs is a bit that hits both of those businesses too. And so, we got hit with about $30 million in Q3 and we'll get another $50 million in Q4 in tariffs. Tariffs either direct through the tax, if you will, or through indirect, through metal market increases. And so those are a little bit of a headwind we've got in this year.","We have very active plans to mitigate those going forward. Okay? So just from a modeling standpoint, so we are going to hit those incremental margins, there's no question about that. We've got a little bit of a headwind there. It's probably worth just spending a minute on how it looks going forward.","So Tom mentioned in our earlier statement, the gross tariff impact, either direct or indirect now is at $215 million annually. Okay? Think of that and $150 million of that is direct tariffs and $100 million in metal market increases. We'll manage the metal market like we always do, through suppliers and through contractual ranges. So that $100 million in metal markets will go hopefully through the course of 2019.","The $150 million on direct tariffs, we're actively working on that. We've got pretty aggressive plans short-term to address about a third of that, where we can address it quickly as where we already have capacity set up someplace in the world, so we have got capability and capacity where we can move production. So you know, one example that in our Power Systems business, we do alternators in China. We have capacity in India. We're in the process. Those will be moved yet this year. And so we've got actions like that they're moving forward. So a bit of a hit in the second half of the year. The impact of that will decrease as we go forward in 2019.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","When you think about some of the actions you can take both on the direct and the metal markets and we're running right now at $250 million just because there is timing sensitivity to some of this and how quickly you can reroute supply chains change suppliers. What do you think about that $250 million being in 2019 just given the timing sensitivity to the actions you can take?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Just repeating, so I said $150 million of that is direct impact with tariffs. We'll get rid of $50 million of that with the actions we've got in place in the short-term. And through the course of the year we'll work on the additional $100 million. The actual metal markets those will go down through the course of the year just on normal contractual agreement that we have. So the majority of it being managed out each quarter getting a little bit better.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","So if you just kind of do the math roughly speaking, Joe, I mean we said we think there is kind of like an $80 million-ish kind of this year number and not that much opportunity to mitigate, right? A little bit through pricing, a little bit through metal markets not much because it's all delayed.","Next year it's $250 million for a full year number. Again, you're comparing a half year number with a full year number but the full year number $250 million, $100 million of it we think will address through metal market not everything happens in the first day of the year. But we think we'll decrease it to zero over the course of the year and so you can kind of average that.","And then of the $150 million you got $50 million mitigated now and then you're going to keep going. So if we think we have $80 million this year, we're something over $100 million right now without our secondary mitigation factor. So we're hoping to get that year-over-year number to be not much of an increase year-over-year. But it won't be zero impact next year.","But again, trying to get it down to a number that's not much of an increase over this year. And that's with piles more new tariffs coming in. So we're being as agile as we can on it and moving fast. But, as you mentioned, things take time, so that's what we're trying to manage through.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's really helpful. One other question on the AMT and the JV and the Endurant out over a year now, I was just trying to think about your kind of primarily area of focus on the net market. I think one is probably just keeping up with demand with higher penetration rates. But when you think about some medium-duty opportunities there, some overseas opportunities there are you pivoting at all and putting a little bit more attention on some other growth areas in the AMT world at this point?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Definitely. That's a little bit when we were talking about profitability and when it reaches profitability a part of that is the heavy-duty Endurant is doing terrifically well. Sales are going well, but we're also investing in the JV, we're also investing in engineering, we're building up more versions of the transmission to meet more markets. And then also we are looking at other markets around the world at medium-duty markets so that we're very active in that.","As you know, each market has kind of got their own plan for when the price reaches the customer where they want to adopt. But our experience so far is once it does it adopts pretty quickly. So I just got back from India, for example, and right now I don't think a full-blown AMT is really at the price point that the market will accept. But it's a matter of time and I don't think it's a matter of a decade either. I think it's a matter of a couple of years before the fuel economy benefit begins to look like it works for a bunch of professional fleets that are growing there. So can each market will be different, but we are positioning ourselves to be part of those markets as well developing country markets as well.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. There's obviously a lot of moving parts in China and a bunch of different markets you serve. But could you give your general impressions of where you think the trade war has affected demand in a material way in an accelerating way and then whether blue sky or other things are offsetting it or whether there's worse ahead? I'm just curious about how big an impact you are seeing there.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. I guess, generally speaking, the tariffs have not been good for Cummins. I'll just speak about that and then I'll come to the general economy in the following ways we just discussed, they've just driven up cost or just more taxes to Cummins as we try to \u2013 because we are a global company and we serve markets all over the world and we move parts back and forth. Again, we generally build in the regions that we sell. So it's not a \u2013 we're not moving most of our products but there is some number that we're better to build it in one place than all places. And of course as we increase tariffs, it just means that we have less markets that we can serve from one place.","For example, our Light-Duty Engine, 28 and 38 Engines that we make in our Foton Cummins joint venture, we make several hundred thousand engines there. We have an opportunity to probably sell some of those in the U.S. a few thousand though, but with a big tariff, we don't. And so that's just an opportunity we probably won't be able to pursue and we're not going to set up a plant for a few thousand. So that's a good example.","I would also say that, in general, it appears to me that the Chinese companies that we compete with are not paying as much in the tax there because of currency weakening. In fact their costs are not increasing at the same rate that ours are. So generally speaking, I think we're becoming less competitive against them not more.","Your specific question might have been more about demand in China, though. And I would say that the economy in China, it is not growing at the same rate. How much that has to do with the trade war versus all the other trends in China is not at all clear to me. What we're are not seeing is that the Chinese government or Chinese customers are yet saying well we're not going to buy from that American company or that American company which, of course, we're very fearful of.","We don't know if and when that's going to happen, but we have not seen that yet so far. So that's a good thing. We are seeing decreased demand, as Rich said, in the truck market. And the blue sky, all that stuff is kind of making things more complicated. It is hard to read the exact signal, but it looks like we're seeing decreased demand.","But, again, we can't tell what that's due to. I know that the Chinese government is worried, though. And I know that some of their activity is to promote in our industry are to kind of offset potential weakness from trade and other kind of economic weakening.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thank you for the answer. And a clarification, I'm sorry. The $150 million in tariff incremental cost next year, on which bucket and at what rate is that? Is that a 25% on $200 billion? Or are you able to get clarity on what that is?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","I don't think so at this time. We can talk off-line on that.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","We're going to have to do some math on that to get it exact.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Fair enough.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yes.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tom, how should we think about the EBITDA losses in electrification? I mean, you've taken \u2013 you've increased them a little bit. I think you've made some acquisitions in that area. I'm not sure where you put some of those acquisitions, but I think maybe it's related to that.","But more importantly, over the next several years what is the general trajectory we should be thinking about? I mean, you've talked about commercialization of electrified powertrains and I think late 2019 early 2020. Correct me on that if I'm wrong.","But what about the losses here? Do they get wider before they narrow? Because I think most people are just kind of sort of linearly taking this up to a flat number in the next several years. And I'm wondering if like you actually have to invest more first before you can actually see that inflection.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question and here's what \u2013 you are right that the reason this year's up a little bit is because we purchased EDI. So the purchase of EDI just added more expenses. And since they weren't in a profit position when we acquired them that just meant that our third and fourth quarters are a little higher in expense levels than we had originally intended.","You remember we laid out kind of our $500 million investment, which included R&D investment and acquisitions over three years. And we still think that's going to be roughly correct. We don't have exact number. But because they're some moving parts, which I'll talk about that but that feels about right to us still. But to your P&L question, I do think the losses widen before they narrow.","And I think that reflects the number of product programs and prototype and other demonstrator projects that we're doing. Because what essentially it's a market that's burgeoning. I mean, it's being created as opposed to existing.","So we're trying to basically ensure that OEM customers and end-user customers that are thinking about using electrification products think that Cummins is a good supplier for them. So if you're just absent all those demonstrators and all those different kind of projects, then they don't think that you're a supplier. So we want to make sure that we're in those.","But frankly, most people are ordering some number and then not ordering again for a while because the economics aren't perfect. The markets that look like they are right for actually trying some at some numbers are urban buses and then short-range vehicles like things that work in warehouses and on ports.","And so we are focusing \u2013 overwhelming focusing our attention on those. So, the launch that you mentioned, which you did have the timing right, end of 2019 beginning of 2020 is buses. And we have a launch again a year later another version of the powertrain for buses and then following right after that will be these other short-range vehicles.","So we will be investing and what's widening the expense is really prototype demonstrators were down the road plus the investment in these product programs to make sure we're ready for production launch in those few markets.","And then the revenue side is the side that's very difficult to say. So the hard part about calling the breakeven or cash breakeven in this business is we just don't know what the revenue side is. We know a bunch of bus fleets big ones that want to buy a lot of them.","But we don't know the rate of adoption that goes more broadly across the bus market. It looks like to us like it's going to go pretty fast, but you just don't know and then you don't know how much you're going to win. So the breakeven point is kind of hard to predict. What is easy to predict is the loss is likely to widen a little bit before it goes.","And I do expect to begin to earn revenues though, significant ones in the sense that they'll begin to offset some of these losses beginning in 2020 and probably more so and even in 2021 when we have multiple versions of our powertrain out for buses.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So the implied loss for the fourth quarter in electrification. I think in electrified power I think is about $30 million. Do you think that is a good run rate to use for next year or does it actually widen even more than that?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","I think that's a good base to work.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","So maybe a slight widening, but not a big exponential growth like 5% to 10% off of that up off of that maybe precisely.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. So we'll be adding some engineering, but again, right now we've got our programs in place and they're funds have been going. So not a big change.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I just want to ask you a little bit more about the slowing that you're talking about in mining. Can you give a little bit more color on that? When did that start for the order slowdown? Or is it any particular geographies anything like that that you could add?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","I'll take a shot at that. We're trying to understand a little bit ourselves. So we now saying mining up 30% for the year, we were saying up 40%. And we've seen most of the slowdown is in new production. So, in new equipment going to the field.","Utilization still looks pretty good. The CapEx for next year that we're hearing from the mining sites is growing 7% a year. And so I just think there's a lot of history there with people that carried away the last cycle and bought a lot of equipment, there's a little more consciousness out there right now. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. And we're seeing the parts and service strong. And so our estimate is we'll see it bouncing back from where we are in the second half of the year next year.","And we talk regular communications, not a long list of OEMs that we sell to and not a long list of mine sites. So we don't think we're done on the cycle yet I guess is I think where we are right now.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But, Rich, is it more North America, or is it in China or Australia? Or is it global?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","It's pretty broad-based. It's pretty broad-based.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks very much.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks so much. We've had a lot of questions about incremental margins and I just want to see if I can possibly ask you to simplify it for everyone all these puts and takes electrification campaign costs are positive. Maybe headwind of variable comp costs a little bit better-than-expected. Just how should we think about overall incremental margins for 2019 at this point?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Well, I think it's pretty consistent with what we said at Investor Day. The base business we commit to a lot at least 20% incremental EBITDA margins on the base business. And we will continue to invest in the JV. And we will continue to invest in electrification beyond that. So no change really from what we said this time last year. We will give more specific guidance as we always do on our fourth quarter call in January.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","And we've delivered a 20% incrementals on the business while absorbing the after-treatment campaign costs earlier in the year.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Right. Much appreciated. And then just to go back to electrification. There does seem to be appetite both internationally and on road do you have the agreement with Hyundai you announced for off-road. You are investing more heavily in this space?","And then, Tom, I think you said that you're having a more frequent number of partnership discussions versus a year ago. So can you just sort of frame for us, basically how you're framing to the customers Cummins value proposition here? Is it really on the integration side? Is it around power conversion? Where do you see Cummins best able to compete versus what you may be out there in the market?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question. And there's essentially three big areas I think customers see us as in add in their powertrain strategy including electrification by the way is that we have focused on the powertrain. And basically at this point in time most OEMs are looking for partners here. It's just very difficult to figure out how to invest in all the things they had to invest in, be it autonomous, new vehicles, meeting emissions in all these locations, all the investments they need to make in capacity and different kinds of vehicles, and then all the power trains they need. Most of them are going to do some powertrains.","And even when they get to electrification, they're looking at this and saying I need to be in it but I need partners. I just don't think I can do it on my own. And I'm talking about partners from parts of the world that never wanted partners on anything, those people. Even they look at this and say it's just too much.","And so we are playing our role we've always played, which is we will see and we'll do the parts of this that you don't want to do, so we'll sell you components, we'll sell you engines, we'll sell you systems, we'll sell you a parts of our battery system, we'll sell you all of it, et cetera.","With regard to specific technologies within the electrification space we've kind of laid out our focus areas. So we are definitely investing in battery packs and our value proposition there is that we will develop battery packs that work for commercial vehicles. It doesn't mean that we won't use battery cells that cars also use, but we won't just make car battery packs. And the reason is it just doesn't work \u2013 different power, different energy, different durability and life.","And so, much like engines, there are diesel engines made for cars and higher volume, but because we are focused on commercial vehicles, we can essentially not only apply the system, but design the system to better work with the applications and duty cycles that apply for commercial vehicles.","Second thing we're going to do is we're going to have a service network and support network that can support your vehicles and your use of electrified powertrains. And that's a pretty big benefit in a market where the new players don't really have anything like that.","And, again, you might think well there is less service and less parts in the car, but there's still stuff to do. They're still in a bunch of service and support work to do even if it's only recharging or replacing batteries but it's a lot.","So our service network is a big added for both OEMs and also and end user partner. So big bus fleets are worried if they use and somebody who doesn't have any support or any presence in the market that they'll buy the things and they'll be stranded and with no support.","So I think that those are kind of the key value propositions. I think it's working well. It's as I mentioned earlier the challenge for us is it looks a lot of investment at the front end for a good opportunity, but where the revenues come and at which pace is still a few years off and I think that's what we're dealing with today.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. That color was very helpful. Thank you so much.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","You're welcome.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time. And, as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mark Smith Vice President of Financial Operations. Please go ahead.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, good morning everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the second quarter of 2018. And with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer Pat Ward; and President and Chief Operating Officer Rich Freeland.","We'll all be available for your questions after our prepared remarks. Before we start please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in our forward looking disclosure statement and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report and any subsequently filed quarterly reports.","During the course of this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you Mark. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2018. Pat will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.","We delivered record quarterly sales and profits in the second quarter. Revenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the second quarter of 2017, with growth in all of our operating segments and most of our major geographic markets. EBITDA was $897 million or 14.6% of sales compared to $764 million or 15% a year ago.","During the second quarter we finalized our plans and our full cost estimate for our previously disclosed product campaign to address the performance of an after treatment component in certain on-highway engines produced between 2010 and 2015. In determining the best course of action to support our customers we have elected to increase the number of after treatment systems to be addressed through hardware replacement compared to our estimate last quarter.","As a result we recorded a charge of $181 million or 3% of sales in the second quarter and we believe that we have now fully you provided for the expected costs of this campaign. The charge was shared between the Engine and Components segments. We've reached agreements with the appropriate regulatory agencies regarding our proposed actions and we will launch that campaign in phases starting in the third quarter this year and expect to substantially complete the campaign by the end of 2020. This issue does not affect any of our current products which are performing very well and our market share remains strong.","And to that point Engine business revenues increased 17% compared to a year ago due to strong demand in on-highway markets in North America and growth in construction markets in both China and North America. EBITDA for the quarter was 13.4% of sales compared to 14% a year ago. EBITDA percent declined as the benefits of higher volumes, improved pricing and increased joint venture earnings in China were more than offset by a $91 million charge related to the product campaign.","Sales for our Distribution segment grew by 16% year over year driven by higher demand for new engines, parts and service in off-highway markets as well as some targeted price increases. Second quarter EBITDA was 7.3% compared to 7.4% in the second quarter of 2017. EBITDA increased 14% in dollar terms but declined slightly as a percent of sales due to a lower mix of parts sales. Second quarter revenues for the Components segment rose by 30%. Sales in North America increased 36% and revenues in international markets grew 22% as a result of rising market demand, strong market share and the success of new products aimed at lowering emissions.","Sales of the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission business contributed 10% to Components' segment growth. EBITDA for the second quarter was 12.6% compared to 15.7% in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA declined as the benefits of stronger sales and material cost reduction programs were more than offset by the charge of $90 million related to the product campaign.","Power Systems sales in the second quarter grew 23% year over year driven primarily by higher demand for power generation equipment and an increase in sales to oil and gas and mining customers. EBITDA in the second quarter was 14.9% compared to 8.8% a year ago. The benefits of stronger volumes, improvements in quality, cost reduction programs and stronger joint venture earnings in China all contributed to EBITDA margin expansion.","In our Electrified Power Train business, second quarter EBITDA was a loss of $21 million in line with our projections. Given the potential for this technology, especially in urban and short range applications, we will continue to invest in development and new product programs ahead of broad market adoption.","Now I will comment on the performance of some of our key markets for the second quarter of 2018 starting with North America and then I'll cover some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America grew 22% in the second quarter due to growth in demand in most of our end markets and the ramp up of the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission joint venture.","Industry production of North American heavy duty trucks grew 20% in the second quarter of 2018 while sales of our heavy duty engines increased by 38%. Our year to date market share through May was 33% in line with last year.","Industry production of medium duty trucks improved 16% in the second quarter while our engine shipments grew 15%. Year to date our market share in the medium duty truck market was 81% through May up from 79% a year ago.","Total shipments to our North America pickup truck customers were decreased by 20% compared to a year ago due to a short-term adjustment to production by one of our OEM customers.","Engine sales for construction equipment in North America increased 18% in the second quarter reflecting general strength in the economy. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America rose 42% compared to a year ago driven by higher demand in both oil and gas and mining customers. And revenues for power generation grew by 9% due to higher demand in the data center and recreational vehicle markets.","Our international revenues increased by 18% in the second quarter of 2018. Second quarter revenues in China including joint ventures were $1.4 billion an increase of 9% due to higher sales and off-highway markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China increased by 13% compared to a year ago.","Year-to-date our market share was 11% through June compared to 14% last year. We are confident that we'll regain this market share as we increase penetration of our engine at Foton, ramp up our new market, our new partnership with JAC and launch new products for NS VI with all of our partners in China.","Industry sales of light duty trucks grew by 25% in the second quarter and our engine market share was 7%. Demand for excavators in the third quarter increased 74% from a year ago in China. Our market share through June increased to 14%, up fully 2% year-over-year, driven by strong performance by our OEM partners.","Revenues for our Power Systems business in China increased 53%, due to growth in engine shipments to mining customers and higher demand for power generation equipment for data centers.","Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $575 million, an increase of 33% from second quarter a year-ago. Industry truck production more than doubled year-over-year following the introduction of broad Stage IV regulations in April last year. Year-to-date market share was 42% through June, up 2% from 2017, with Tata trucks powered by our new BSIV compliant engine systems. In Brazil, our revenues increased by 29%, primarily due to a moderately recovering economy resulting in improved demand for trucks compared to a weak 2017.","Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2018 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are now forecasting total company revenues for 2018 to be up 15% to 17%, higher than our previous guidance of up 10% to 14%, reflecting a stronger outlook for industrial, power generation and construction markets as well as stronger market share in North America on-highway markets.","We are maintaining our forecast for industry production of heavy duty trucks in North America at 286,000 units, up 29% compared to 2017. We expect our market share to be between 31% and 34%, which is unchanged from our last quarter. However, we now expect to be at the higher end of this range.","In the medium duty truck market, we've increased our forecast for industry production to reach 133,000 units, up 13% year-over-year and above our prior forecast of 124,000 units. We expect our market share to be in the range of 75% to 78%, an increase from our prior guidance of 72% to 75%.","We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for the full year of 2018 compared to a very strong 2017. In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be up 1% compared to our previous guidance of being lower by 2% in 2018. We have raised our outlook for medium and heavy duty truck market demand slightly to 1.3 million units from our prior forecast of 1.2 million units, representing a flat market compared to last year.","In the light duty market, we now expect growth of 5% in 2018, up from our previous guidance of no growth. We expect our market share in the medium and heavy duty market to be 12%, up from the first half of this year but down from our prior forecast at 14%.","In light duty, we expect our full year share to be 7% compared to our previous guidance of 8%. In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to be up 18% year-over-year, lower than our previous forecast of growth of at least 20% due to a lower outlook for truck demand.","Earlier this month, the Indian government surprised the industry by introducing regulations that allow higher loads per vehicle. The new regulations have caused a sharp decline in truck sales, as customers await upgraded models from OEMs in response to the regulations. Underlying demand for trucks remains strong and we expect growth in truck sales to resume once OEMs and customers adjust to the new regulations.","In Brazil, we now forecast truck production to increase 20% in 2018, up from our previous guidance. We expect our global high horsepower engines to increase 35%, up from our previous forecast of 30%, reflecting strong demand from mining customers and an improved outlook for sales of power generation equipment.","In summary, we have raised our full year outlook and expect to deliver record sales, EBITDA, operating cash flow and earnings per share in 2018. We revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.2%, down from our previous guidance of 15.4% to 15.8% with the benefit of stronger sales offset by the charge for the product campaign in the second quarter and the addition of approximately $100 million of trade tariffs and tariff-related cost inflation in the second half of the year.","Full year incremental EBITDA margins are projected to be 20%, excluding the impact of the Eaton, Cummins joint venture and our electrified power train business, but including both the product campaign and the tariff-related costs.","During the quarter, we returned $393 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and recently announced a 5.6% increase in our quarterly cash dividend. We now plan to return 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2018, up from our previous plan to return 50%.","At our Analyst Day last November, we discussed several growth platforms that we're working on to drive future profitable growth. For each platform, we said that we would evaluate the best options for growth between organic investment, partnerships and acquisitions and we continue to make progress in executing this strategy.","Consistent with our goal to be a leader in electrified power trains for commercial vehicles, we recently announced that we will acquire Efficient Drivetrains, Inc. or EDI. Based in Milpitas, California, EDI develops and produces hybrid and fully electric power solutions for commercial vehicle applications.","The acquisition of EDI will complement our existing capabilities in electrified power trains and we expect to complete the acquisition in the third quarter of this year. For those of you planning to attend the IAA truck show in Hannover in September, you'll have the opportunity to view a range of Cummins products, including our electrified power trains and commercial vehicles.","In discussing our plans to grow in attractive markets last November, we covered an approach to growth in the light commercial vehicle market which we said would be likely through consolidation or a partnership. And we said that we would pursue with discipline acquisitions that could increase our participation in larger horsepower, power generation, oil and gas, rail and marine markets.","In May, we announced plans to form a joint venture with JAC Motors in China, building on our 20 year relationship between the two companies. This joint venture will be focused on the light commercial vehicle in China the largest market in the world and global export markets.","In forming this new alliance, Cummins will acquire Navistar's interest in the joint venture with JAC. The change in ownership will go into effect upon completion of regulatory reviews and we are continuing to actively pursue acquisitions and partnerships in the larger horsepower industrial markets.","Thank you for your interest today. We had a strong quarter and are on track for record full year results, extending our track record of proving performance over prior cycles and continuing to return cash to shareholders. We are also making significant strides in executing our strategy to drive more profitable growth in the future.","Now let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the company's second quarter financial results before discussing the performance of the operating segments in some more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Second quarter revenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of 21% from a year ago and a quarterly record for the company. Sales improved in each of our operating segments driven by stronger demand in global on-highway, industrial and power generation markets. Sales in North America which represented 59% of our second quarter revenues grew 22% from a year ago, due to increased sales of engines and components to entire levels of heavy and medium duty truck production and stronger demand for industrial engines.","Our international sales increased by 18% from a year ago, due to higher demand in China, India, Europe and Latin America for on-highway construction and industrial markets as well as benefiting from a weaker U.S. dollar.","Gross margins were 23.5% of sales down from 24.6% a year ago, primarily due to the product campaign charge that Tom just discussed. The campaign charge negatively impacted our gross margin by 300 basis points offsetting the positive effects of the stronger volumes, favorable pricing and material cost reductions.","Selling, admin and research and development cost of $832 million were $51 million higher than last year with most of the increase occurring in research and development. As a percent of sales, selling, admin and research and development spending was 13.6%, a decrease as a percent of sales by 180 basis points from a year ago.","Joint venture income of $110 million increased by $12 million compared to last year. Earnings before interest and tax, depreciation and amortization were $897 million, or 14.6% of sales for the quarter compared to $764 million, or 15% a year ago. EBITDA as a percent of sales declined due to the campaign charge which more than offset the benefits realized from the stronger operating performance in the quarter. Excluding the campaign charge EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 17.6% of sales.","Net earnings for the quarter were a record $545 million or $3.32 per diluted share compared to $424 million or $2.53 from a year ago. Effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.5% in line with our full year guidance of 23% and down from 26.4% last year.","Moving on to the operating segments. Let me summarize their performance in the quarter and the outlook for the full year and then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some comments on cash flow.","In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.7 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 17% from last year, due to a 16% growth from on-highway sales and a 20% increase in off-highway revenues primarily due to growth in construction markets.","Segment EBITDA in the second quarter was $362 million or 13.4% of sales. This compares to $323 million, or 14% from a year ago. The benefits from the stronger volumes, higher contribution from joint ventures and very good operating leverage were partially offset by the campaign charge and investment in new products. Including the campaign charge, EBITDA margins for the segment were 16.8% in the quarter.","We now expect full year Engine segment revenues to be up 17% to 19% compared to our previous guidance of up 10% to 14% due to continued strength in North American truck and international construction markets. We are forecasting EBITDA margins to be in the range of 13.25% to 13.75% of sales which includes the campaign charges booked in the first half of the year and compares to 13.5% to 14% in our previous guidance.","For the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $2 billion, an increase of 16% compared to last year. The growth in sales was primarily driven by higher demand for both new engines and parts and service in North America, favorable pricing and the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.","EBITDA margins for the quarter increased by 14% to $145 million or 7.3% of sales which compares to $127 million or 7.4% a year ago. The EBITDA percent declined due to a lower mix of parts sales. For 2018, distribution revenue is now projected to increase 9% to 11% compared to our previous guidance of up 6% to 10% due to strong off-highway demand for engines and parts. We are now forecasting EBITDA margins to be in the range of 7% to 7.5% of sales versus our previous guidance of 7.75% to 8.25%.","For the Components segment, revenues were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, a 30% increase from a year ago and a quarterly record. The Eaton, Cummins joint venture contributed 10% to growth. Sales in North America increased 36% due to higher medium -- higher heavy and medium duty truck production while international revenues grew 22% as a result of strong growth in Europe and India and the depreciation of the U.S. dollar.","Segment EBITDA was $237 million or 12.6% of sales compared to $228 million or 15.7% of sales a year ago. The positive impact of the higher sales and favorable material costs were offset by the product campaign charge. Excluding that campaign charge, EBITDA margins were 17.3% of sales in the quarter.","For 2018, we now expect revenue to increase 23% to 25% compared to our prior guidance of up 18% to 22%. Stronger than expected demand in both the North America truck market and in Europe are the main contributors to the improved outlook. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14% to 14.5% of sales which includes the campaign charges booked in the first and second quarter compared to 15.25% to 15.75% in our previous forecast.","In the Power Systems segment, second quarter revenues were $1.2 billion, an increase of 23% from a year ago. Industrial sales rose 37% as a result of stronger oil and gas and mining demand. Power Generation sales grew by 17% as a result of higher demand for Power Gen Equipment in North America and in China.","EBITDA more than doubled in dollar terms to $186 million or 14.9% of sales in the quarter, up from $90 million or 8.8% last year, driven by the positive impact of the higher sales, favorable material costs and higher joint venture earnings. For 2018, we now expect Power Systems segment revenues to increase 15% to 17% versus our prior guidance of up 7% to 11% as a result of stronger demand in industrial and power generation markets.","EBITDA margins are forecasted to be between 13.5% and 14% of sales compared to our previous guidance of 13% to 13.5%. And in the Electrified Power segment, EBITDA losses were $21 million due to our investment in new products. For the full year, we expect a net expense of between $60 million and $80 million in line with our previous guidance, as we continue to invest in new products.","And as you heard from Tom, for the company we're raising our outlook for revenues to be up 15% to 17% this year versus a previously guidance of up 10% to 14%. The increase is driven by continued strength in North American on-highway markets and an improved outlook in power generation, construction and mining markets.","For foreign currency, primarily driven by a weaker U.S. dollar is expected to increase revenues by approximately $100 million this year. Income from our joint ventures is now expected to be flat in 2018 compared to our previous guidance of down 10%. We're forecasting EBITDA margins to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.2% for 2018, down from our previous forecast of 15.4% to 15.8%. Full year incremental EBITDA margins are forecast to be 20%, which excludes the impact of the Eaton, Cummins joint venture and the electrified powertrain business, but does include all the campaign and tariff related costs.","Turning to cash flow. Cash generated from operating activities for the second quarter was $590 million, $143 million higher than last year. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $114 million bringing the year-to-date total to $186 million. And we still expect the full year capital expenditure will be in the range of $730 million to $760 million.","In the second quarter we returned $393 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. For the first six months of this year we have returned $734 million, which includes the repurchase of approximately 2.5 million shares.","As Tom mentioned, our Board of Directors recently authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend of 5.6% to $1.14 per share and we now plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to our shareholders this year in the form of dividend and share repurchases.","In summary, we had a very strong operating performance in the second quarter. And we are on track to deliver record sales, EBITDA, operating cash flow and earnings per share in 2018.","And before I turn back over to Mark, I would just like to take a minute to recognize and thank Adam Schumm for all his contributions in investor relations over the last 2.5 years as he prepares to move on to his new role in our Emission Solutions business. And at the same we'd like to welcome James Hopkins who is taking over from Adam into Investor Relations.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Great. Thanks Pat. Now we're the ready for questions. We do have plenty of time available. So please, if you can limit your first question to one question and one related follow-up and then get back in queue. Thank you very much. We're ready to start.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah, I was wondering if we could start with the discussion around material costs. It sounds like that was favorable across several segments, Components and Power Systems and others. Could you expand your expectations for the second half of the year? And then related to that how you're thinking about price realization for the second half of the year?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Hey, Adam, this is Rich. Let me start with that. I'll just talk a little bit since we referenced it, the whole pyramid of metal markets, material costs and tariffs, and then we can come back to impact kind of for the second half. So, roughly, the way I think you should think about it is, it's about $200 million of impact to the company annually. So roughly half of that in the second half of this year. And it's split between material costs, so metal market increases and tariffs about 50%-50%. And the way that we'll manage the kind of the metal market material cost piece of that is through contracts we have, both with suppliers and with customers.","And so there can be a lag effect on those, but we'll manage those through the channel kind of over two to four quarters; a little faster in components, a little slower in engines. From a tariff standpoint, so again half of that $200 million, there's a couple actions we'll take which relates a little bit to your question. So we can make some short term supply chain changes, where we already have supply bases set up around the globe. And maybe a third of those we can mitigate in the shorter term. The balance of that, of the tariff-related, will either be done through pricing, much of that you'll see a little bit yet in the second half, but most of that will begin in 2019, and also we'll look at kind of longer term supply chain changes to address that.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Adam, it's Tom. The only thing I'd add is we've been pretty successful in finding cost reductions in our material cost area. That's, you mentioned the first half being favorable. We are still seeing, we have been in an inflationary environment but we've been working hard to find reductions.","Our view, in our industry, is we have the most efficient supply chain from a cost point of view. We've got a very effective global supply chain. We have a bunch of folks on the engineering and purchasing side that work to find reductions all the time. And so we're getting that net $50 million benefit from cost reduction every quarter in the last couple quarters. And that was hard work and we feel great about that. We're going to continue that work. That doesn't change.","The frustrating thing about the tariffs and steel and aluminum tariffs as well is they just drive inflation. So what's happening is we're just adding taxes and inflation to our cost structure, which was already inflating given how strong the economy was. So that's just going to drive more cost into the business. We'll do our best to pass that on to other people. And, of course, readjusting our supply chain to deal with tariffs is frustrating because it's a really cost effective and efficient supply chain. It is what it is. We'll have to do it, but it's a frustrating situation to be in considering how well we're positioned today as a manufacturer with our global supply chain.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Got it, thank you. And then, secondly, on the lowered truck market forecast for India, I'm wondering if the weight regulation change means that there could be a change in the size of engines that your OEM customers are looking to buy going forward.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. It's a good question. I think what we're sorting through, kind of the timing of the new introduction. It's a positive to us. So it's going to move to bigger engines. We're positioned really well, especially in the six cylinder side, where Tata uses their own engine at the four cylinder. So we're going to learn how you move up into a higher horsepower, which will be a positive for us.","Adam Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Tom, wondering if you could talk about how the JAC acquisition fits in within the broader China partnership structure for you folks? What's the ultimate market share opportunity that you folks are targeting now? Does that add to the 20% target you had before? And then, from a near term standpoint, you mentioned the lower market share in the quarter. I'm wondering if you folks can just flesh that out a bit in terms of the path to get back towards prior year market share levels too?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for that, Jerry. Yeah, you highlighted, the China situation, we've gone backwards a little bit in market share. I mean, our business has been great, the market's been incredible. So our business has been doing well, but our market share has dropped a little bit, and we could have been doing even better. And part of that was related to the quality issues we had with the ISG some time ago. We have now resolved those, but we're still regaining penetration at Foton, as a result of that. We feel confident we will do that. I was just in China. I met with Foton and we've been meeting with them extensively. We're very confident that we will restore penetration into the heavy-duty market and that will drive up some.","Second thing is, this JAC partnership fits in and since that there is a very large light-duty market, it's the largest one in the world in China. Plus, JAC also has a relatively significant export market. Again, they're mostly targeting markets that are similar emissions levels to China. So, and of course that would, as China moves to China 6, that expands their potential export markets. They make an inexpensive, but quite capable small truck. So we're happy to add them into the partnerships.","We see that as being able to drive our light-duty market share from something like 7% or 8% today to 15% over some number of years. Our plan says five. We'd like to move faster, but our plan says five years, we get back up to 15% plus.","So with that, and the heavy-duty penetration and then at NS VI, that's, again we'll have another shake out where some of the smaller players will be unable to get to China 6. That's a very, very tough standard. And we think our partners, using Cummins engines, will again gain share, which we think will bring us back to our old numbers and passed again.","We need to get a little further on the NS VI. We'll work to kind of figure out exactly where we'll get by when. But, that's what I said in my remarks, I'm highly confident that we will get back to our old market share numbers and passed again based on these three things.","The JAC numbers, again they'll take a little bit to ramp up, because we're just getting started with them. It's not even approved yet. But I think the Foton work will start. We're probably at our low point today. So in the next few quarters, we'll start to see that ramp back up again, and then China 6 and JAC follow on.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then, it was nice to see the better operating leverage in Power Systems. Can you just talk about whether you folks are completely done with the manufacturing transition that you're working through and consolidating some of the facilities and just give us an update if you think we're on a path to meaningfully improved incremental margins starting with this quarter?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay, Jerry. Thanks. Yeah. I'm really pleased with the progress that's been made there. It's kind of been a three-year journey both in taking cost out, restructuring that business, and gaining share and introducing new products. And so you saw that kind of for the first time coming through. We've introduced a lot of the cost saving pieces, but there's still another -- there's still a piece left which was our plant closure that in Stanford that we're just now finishing. So, we've had, it's actually been a negative synergy this year. So we've had the restructuring costs. We'll have an additional $20 million savings with that one beginning in 2019. So lots of good work there kind of from cost, product introduction, market share gain; I feel really good about it.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","And then, Jerry, we're really at mid-cycle there too. So our view is that not only are we're seeing the benefits of the costs, but we're also really midway through the ramp. So we expect to continue to see benefits from increased revenues as plants get fully utilized and we feel good with our supply chain, we're having to work hard to make sure our supply chain stays on good lead times. But that's the work we're good at, so we feel confident about that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. I guess two questions. One, Tom, just a little more color on the decision to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders. I mean is that to signal larger M&A is over? Or is that just signaling you think your stock is really cheap right now and we're all missing something? So I'm just trying to understand what you're trying to tell the market with that statement.","And then my second question, can you comment on any markets where you have visibility into 2019 because lead times are extended, and that is I think about sort of normalized incremental margins. I'm just thinking about 2019 versus 2018. I'm assuming the product campaign costs, obviously, they go away. Is the JV and EV investment, does that change, I mean at all in (37:26) sort of risks that tariffs or price increases are an incremental negative to 2019 because some companies are already talking about that. So I'm just trying to think about, how I think about one-time items in 2019. I can make my own forecast on the end markets? Thanks.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks Jamie. Thanks for those questions. So on the 75%, as I mentioned in my remarks -- in my opening, we are continuing with our strategy. So we are still seeking to drive partnerships or acquisitions in the large power area. We're still driving, trying to drive growth in our distribution and telematics area. So the strategy hasn't changed, but what we are trying to signal with the 75% is three things really. Number one, our performance this year is really good. Our cash flow is really good. And our needs for investing in the business are less than the cash flow we're generating. And so we want to make sure that we don't need to inventory cash. We have very strong balance sheets. We can return cash flow to shareholders and still meet all our needs and that's a good thing.","Second thing is that there are no imminent needs for the cash. Obviously if we were months away from a large acquisition we would not do that. But, so what we are seeing is that we are not imminently doing things. We are still actively working on that. And again there's been a lot of rumors and things about what we've been involved with. I think what I guess I wanted to remind everyone is that our intent in all of our growth partnerships, acquisitions, et cetera, is to remain disciplined and to make sure that the result of the acquisition is a positive impact for shareholders not just more revenue.","And so we're continuing to do that and as we look at the field today we are active. There are a number of things which would be attractive to put into Cummins, but right, we just don't see it eminently happening. But we are active on a number of partnerships and acquisitions as we, we announced two more this quarter and we will continue that. So the signal is still moving but nothing imminent. I think that'd be the safest way to say.","And the third thing we wanted to signal is that we think the stock is significantly undervalued. I mean, it's obvious that in the last quarter with the emissions issue and maybe people getting worried about cyclical peaks that our stock got, had a pretty heavy wet blanket on it and we think it's overshot.","Our view is the earnings of the company are incredibly strong. Our incremental margins are good. And we don't think we're at the peak. We think we've got quite a bit more room to run. And, by the way, in each cycle, down cycle, we do better and strengthen again each up cycle. So we do believe, in fact, that our stock is a good investment now. So, it's all three of those things and thanks for giving me a chance to talk about that.","With regard to the \u2013 2019, obviously we don't want to forecast 2019, but a couple things you mention I think do deserve some highlights. We are expecting to finish our warranty numbers around 2.4% this year, as Pat said. So we are coming down into that same low 2% range that we said we would get to. And we have done a lot of work to improve the quality of launches and the quality of the product. So we believe that that's going to be a good tailwind going into 2019.","In addition, from the point of view of all the tariffs and material costs, there's no question that right now we're fighting an uphill battle, but it's not clear how long all these last. It's not clear what administration plans are there.","So what we're trying to remain, is resilient as we can. We have a very cost effective supply chain. We're going to try to keep that in place. We're going to make the moves that we need to make short-term to try to minimize the impacts, we're going to pass on prices where we can, as Rich said.","But, we have a very good supply chain organization that's working to continue to drive costs down. So again we, we're planning to mitigate, I guess, is the main point. So while it's a short term a pretty nasty hit we will work hard to mitigate those plans.","And I think we will have some positive impact on those. So while it will be a headwind, we'll make this headwind smaller by the time we get to next year. So those are both worthy of commenting on.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi guys.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi how are you?","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I'm doing okay. A couple questions both related to China. So first on the JAC joint venture was just wondering if you could comment on the risk of any overlap or perceived overlap with the Foton 2.8 and 3.8 liter engines to the extent that that creates any I guess friction between your two OEM partners?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. I mean both Rich and I have spent time with Foton recently about that and there's no question there was some friction about it. They do compete in the market.","And by the way we're -- this is a thing we deal with everywhere. We're an independent engine maker, so everyone loves the fact that we're independent. So, we have lots of volume and we'll work with them but then they're annoyed that we work with their competitors.","It's both, right? It's always both. And so I think those are things that we work through pretty regularly. We, they were frustrated, we did have a lot of discussions. I think we're through that now.","I think that Foton has now said that we understand where our opportunity to work with you is and they're excited about that. Again Rich had good discussions. Anything you would add Rich?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","No, I mean like we always do, in building scale try to find win-wins in this. So we will be able to utilize existing capacity and share that across the different ventures to help mitigate that so everyone will see a lower cost out of it too. It's a piece we always try to implement.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Very good. And the second one I know this is maybe a bit of unfair given the amount of uncertainty here with tariffs and everything. But was wondering whether you've had the opportunity to reevaluate or look more closely at the plan to import the 12 liter blocks from China into the U.S. Class 8 market, the extent to which the landscape has changed at all? Clearly, trading things between China and the U.S. looks as though it's going to become incrementally more difficult. So I guess any comments on that as well as maybe an update on that program in general would be helpful? Thank you.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","No it's a very fair question and we've been looking at it. So we do pick-up some headwinds on some tariffs that hit some of the products that we're introducing. At this point, the high dollar ones, the block and head are not included on the tariff list. And so I think we feel pretty good we can mitigate those costs that are coming in. It's a nice low cost engine that we've got. We're able to use the scale we've got in India, the whole strategy of -","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","In China.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","I'm sorry. Thank you. In China, introducing the product in China, building scale, building a low cost supply base and then moving it across. So, we give back a little bit of that with this plan, but we're going to move \u2013 we're moving ahead with the program.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","And by the way, sorry for this paid political announcement, Alex. But this is a little bit of my frustration is, that product was developed with engineers, purchasing people, et cetera, a whole bunch of people in the U.S. And so the fact that we might use some of the volume or some of the components from China to help build up and then of course assemble in the U.S. and have assembly jobs here that we might lose those because of this tariff. It just seems exactly backwards of what we're trying to achieve. So it does seem, I get, to say that I'm frustrated with this would be a understatement. And again, I'm hopeful that what we're in for here is a lot of tariffs to get everybody to the table and then we get to the table and then we take this away, because this doesn't seem to be helping very many people.","So I'm, that's what I'm hopeful for. But in the meantime as Rich said we are actively looking for ways to mitigate and to figure out which of these things we keep in place, the supply chain to keep in place and which ones, if they have longer term impacts, we switch around.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So you kept your NAFTA Class 8 outlook intact. At this point, is that mainly a function of production capacity? How backed up do you see orders? And what does that tell us as an early indicator for 2019?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, Noah, exactly right. So, when we looked at the backlog, right now the backlog at 235,000 units, is the highest it's been since July of 1999, okay? So it's a very robust backlog. I think you're going to see that backlog continue through the end of the year just for the reason you gave. So the OEMs, the truck production is being constrained by a variety of supplier constraints. I think you might see some relief here and there. But, I think that limits how quickly the backlog can be addressed and how much production will go up the second half of the year. So it gives me a little more bullish that we're going to end the year, this year, with a really strong backlog. And again, the fundamentals look pretty good also. I mean, the retail sales, the stuff we all look at, the freight, the rates. And so the underlying fundamentals are pretty good. The, and like you said, the production is being constrained right now. So I think that bodes well for us going into 2019.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. And then, if we can get an update on your electrification program, seeing that spending ramp up and you did agree to acquire EDI this quarter, as you mentioned. So, now you'll have a short haul Class 8 offering with actually a track record in trains and bus (47:50). And we are seeing that short haul market appear to be developing. Some of the industry data we've seen, as playing to several tens of thousands of confirmed orders for electric trucks and buses to be delivered over the next six year. Wondering if you could provide us with some color on any pre-orders you're seeing for your electric power train offering? And just generally how we should think about the state of the program?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yes, I think from a segment point of view, you've got it right, that essentially transit bus is the number one, where I think if we have a good offering, we'll have customers that want it. It's, in transit buses the big cities especially have committed to moving towards electric or hybrid or some combination of these things. And they're wanting to step by step it, because the charging infrastructure and all the challenges related to running electric powertrains are still in front of most of them. They don't have that all figured out. But they all want them. And so our first launch at the end of next year is there. And we have a number of pre-orders for those. In fact, we are in our first months of production, we'll only be supplying orders that we already have.","And then with regard to the light duty vehicles, especially again urban short range vehicles, there is a lot of interest in that area. And again, when you do the math on it, you can make it work, as long, again as you have a way to manage the charging and charging infrastructure. So those that go away and come back to the same place are going to have a lot easier time of it than those that have to go and stop and then go somewhere else and go somewhere else. This kind of challenge, same as we saw with natural gas, will be an issue for electric vehicles. But again lots of interest.","And as you said, one of the reasons we are interested in EDI is, not only do they have, have they already fulfilled orders, but they have a really good ability to put together prototypes, demonstrators, pretty quickly so people can actually get out and try it. Because, I think, today, there's a lot of interest. But again, most of the interest is, we'd like to try some. We'd like to try it on this leg, see how it goes, see what the charging's like. And it's really difficult to know if you want to move your whole fleet there or your business model can work on this unless you can actually start dealing with some of the practical issues.","And now, with where lithium ion batteries are, and the system in total is, as compared to several years ago, you are at a place where you actually have some practical jobs you can do. So I think that's why people are interested in trying it. So we do feel like there's plenty of interest relative to our capacity. What we're trying to do is make sure that we have a commercially viable powertrain so that we're not just doing demonstrators and prototypes forever; that this is actually a thing that can work in larger scale.","And so we have both efforts going on, making sure people can try things and see that and that will really start at the end of next year, we'll start putting production units in. But right now, we're doing mostly trials and prototypes. We want to be able to do that so people can try, but then also move to this commercially viable long run, segment replacing, kind of powertrain. And that's still in the development and launch phase next year.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Really appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. This is Chris Laserinko on for Andy.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Just have a quick housekeeping item. The press release this morning didn't have the unit shipments for Power Systems. Can you provide that or will you be providing that going into the future?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. We can provide it. Yes. As you know, unit shipment for those is, because of the revenue varies, a whole lot by unit that if, it's not as meaningful, as the heavy duty ones where there's unit prices are really similar. But we can definitely provide it to you and I think, Mark, actually...","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Well, I see it in the copy of the 8-K, but I'll follow-up with you to make sure.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay, great.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. So the next question I have is the engine segment updated guidance supply is about 15% to 18% incremental EBITDA margins. Kind of relative to the 20%. I just wanted to know the difference between. But also that 15% to 18% suggests a little bit better operating leverage from the first half of 2018 and the second half of last year. Just wondering if you can provide some color around the cadence of the incrementals in the back half of the year between Q3, Q4 and what's giving you guys the confidence that you can generate that additional leverage?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","I think there's two factors going on. One, we're going to have lower earnings in China in our joint ventures. So that's typical seasonality. We forecast for the market to decline in the second half, so that's going to be a drag. On the other hand, obviously, we don't have the charges and the warranty in the first half of the year. Generally, volumes are remaining strong, with higher North American heavy duty truck production. So those are the puts and takes really and a little bit of the tariff costs.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","And the underlying operating performance is very strong.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yes, underlying operating, I guess that's maybe, Chris, just backing up a step. Underlying operating performance throughout the year is quite good. And I know it's frustrating to get these incremental margins, because it depends on what you include and what you exclude from last quarter and this quarter. But simply put, underlying operating margins are good. We had the campaign in the first half of this year and a little bit of the last half of last year. That kind of distorted the numbers some. I mean, those are real issues. So they belong there, but they're distorting the numbers.","Then, we've got, as Mark mentioned, in the second half, you've got these incremental costs related to tariff and material cost inflation and then a little bit of dip in China sales. But other than that, if you kind of move those around in your model, the basic operating performance goes, you're seeing sales grow and you're seeing 20% plus incremental margins on an operating basis across the whole way.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then in the Power Systems segment guidance, you increased the revenue outlook pretty handily. And there's just kind of, I hate to call a 50 basis point move slight, but there's 50 basis point move in the EBITDA margin guidance. Just wondering if there's something embedded in this. Is it conservatism? Or is it kind of a real time look at what's going on with production costs, freight or other supply chain issues?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","It's the same two issues really, the Engine business with the buying patterns in most of our end markets in China are typically weaker in the second half than the first half. So that's true for Power Systems, which has a large joint venture in China, off-highway markets. And then, they'll also suffer a little bit on some of the tariffs and related inflation. But overall, we're expecting a very strong year, as Tom said earlier and Rich said.","Chris Laserinko - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'm wondering if you could give us just a little more color on your domestic oil and gas exposure, how fast that piece is growing? Where is it relative to peak and trough levels? And where you see it going from here?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Let me go ahead and start here and then, so it's doubled this year off of very low numbers. So it's been a really solid just as we started the year. I think it's going to be, it's going to continue to go up, it's going to be bumpy kind of quarter-to-quarter, how we're going to see new orders going in and so we've actually projected a little bit of a decline in the second half of the year of new orders.","Having said that, we're putting a lot of population out there, we're gaining share and so I think the trend remains really good. We're, it's hard to say what normal cycle is on this quite frankly. But I think, at least my view is, there's more, lots more upside than down if you look over an annual basis; quarter-to-quarter there's just going to be some big orders and then some periods of shorter or small orders kind of quarter-to-quarter.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's hard to measure against peak just on revenue because we're selling more advanced products now with the introduction of Tier 4 emissions regulations. And then with all this extra new equipment going into the field over the last 12 months we expect that rebuilding, parts and service activity to continue to build. But yes, through the first half of this year we've already delivered more than all of last year, but probably a little bit of a pause while this equipment's put to work, but the underlying demand seems pretty stable right here.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on the Eaton joint venture. When do you think you'll hit a breakeven level on EBITDA in that business? I think you're targeting profitability next year, but what about a breakeven level?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","I think what you're going to see is, again, it's a loss this year. We're looking really at 2020 till we get to that, to a profitability standpoint. So the rate of losses kind of think of it half next year and then moving towards profitability in 2020.","And I think the good thing is the products, part of the strategic investment in the product was that we develop the best powertrain in the market. And that piece I, we feel, so both the financials are on plan, but what I feel even better about is when you see it in our market share numbers is that the combined powertrain product is doing terrific. As we've introduced the new product, and more importantly, is we've done the integration work between the engine and the transmission.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","So the key to the profitability is expanding those gross margins and we have seen steady progress so far. We just need to continue that going forward.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Tom, you guys have provided some helpful details on costs related to tariffs and trade. Could you talk a little bit about demand? Is there any demand impact factored into back half of the year guide? Certainly, backward looking it doesn't look like we've see any impact. But, based on customer interactions and what you're hearing out there and in particular North America and China, is there any direct demand impact that you're seeing at this point?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Not really. I mean, I'm grateful that were not, it's a good question. Both in terms of just, when I was just in China, I was looking for signs that people are beginning to change preferences and saying, well we don't want to buy American products. And, I didn't see any of that on the consumer level, no less in the industrial level which would be kind of secondary, which is good. I mean I think that's always a possibility in China and the problem is once you lose the share it's pretty hard, I mean if you lose the customer it's pretty hard to get it back.","And so far I haven't seen any of it. I mean, I didn't hear a whiff of it. I asked around a lot. I asked customers, I asked our employees, just what are they seeing and nobody seeing any of that. There's definitely some negative feeling about the negotiations or about the administration but not, nothing against American or American companies today, so far, and vice versa in the U.S.","And I think in the U.S, I do, I'm very worried about the inflationary effects, but the economic numbers now are good enough that people seem to be driving right through it. So I guess mostly what I'm worried about now is when and if things turn down, how bad is that and are we going to have inflation and economic downturn at the same time because of, because the inflationary effect. So, again I'm worried about that. But right now it is just not visible anywhere. People are busy. They're buying stuff there. Fleets are, as Rich said, fleets are so busy and making so much money, they're just busy buying trucks and trying to put more trucks to work and find drivers. So far so good is what I'm seeing.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I appreciate those details. Last one is on the $200 million cost impact that you've sized, it sounds like pricing will be able to address the raw material side of that and then some supply chain switching can address a portion of the tariff side of that, basically sounding like it's $100 million back half of the year headwind, but rolling into 2019, we shouldn't be thinking about a $200 million headwind. In fact, it sounds like that headwind might be down year-over-year overall.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","It's hard to know about the net. The way you're thinking about it is right. The net, we just don't know yet because again there's some decisions as Rich was highlighting about, do you move the supply chain or do you feel like the tariffs are temporary? So you just suck it up. Do the price things you're trying to do stick or not? As you said on the whole material cost side that mechanism is pretty much in place, that's likely to go. There's always delays on either side. We try to delay them from putting it in our cost side and our customers try to delay it from putting it in the price side but broadly speaking the agreements are in place.","It's the other ones where there's just more left to play for. So, our supply chain group as you guess, is super busy trying to figure out how to mitigate that. So we'll have a much better view of what we think the net effect is when we do our 2019 plan and of course the environment is changing pretty quickly too. I mean my guess is between this call and next call there'll be another announcement either to add tariffs or take them away. And so we're not sure which it is but I wouldn't know which one I hope it is, but we'll see which one it is. So, I think we need to be pretty nimble in terms of thinking about how we mitigate the costs.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hoping for the latter. Thanks very much.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, thank you.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you very much.

Sir, you may begin.","James Hopkins","Thank you, Chelsy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the fourth quarter of 2018. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland; and Vice President of Financial Operations, Mark Smith.

Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","With that out of the way, we will begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Tom Linebarger","Very compelling, thank you, James. Good morning, everybody.","I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2019. Pat will then take more details about our fourth quarter financial performance and forecast for the year.","Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 were $6.1 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 with growth in all of our operations segments and major geographic markets. EBITDA was $896 million or 14.6% compared to $769 million or 14% a year ago.","EBITDA increased as a percent of sales due to the benefit of higher volumes, improved pricing, lower warranty costs and the absence of tax reform impact on JV earnings in the fourth quarter last year. These positive factors more than offset an increase in research and engineering to support new product development and the negative impact of tariffs.","For the full year, Cummins sales were a record $23.8 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Our EBITDA margins were 14.6% compared to 14.8% in 2017, with the impact of higher sales, improved pricing and the benefit of cost reduction programs offset by product campaign charges in the first half of the year and the increase in research and engineering. EBITDA dollars were a record $3.5 billion.","Engine business sales increased by 18% in 2018 due to stronger production of heavy and medium duty trucks in North America and higher demand for construction equipment globally. EBITDA was 13.7% compared to 12.8% in 2017 due to the positive impact of higher revenues and improved pricing, partially offset by product campaign charges.","Sales for our distribution business grew by 11% driven by increased demand in North America and Europe. Full year EBITDA was 7.2% compared to 7.1% in 2017, with the benefits of improved pricing offset by the impact of strong U.S. dollar and currency volatility in Africa.","Full year revenues for the Component segment increased by 22% due to higher truck production in North America, Europe, India, and Brazil. The Automated Transmission business contributed 6% to segment growth. For the full year EBITDA was 14.4% compared to 15.6% in 2017 as the benefits of higher sales and material cost reduction programs were more than offset by product campaign costs and the dilutive effect of the new Automated Transmission business.","The Automated Transmission business delivered revenues of $543 million in 2018 driven by stronger demand in North American heavy duty truck market as well as higher-than-expected penetration rates of automatic manual transmissions which reached 73% of new heavy duty trucks in 2018.","Customer feedback on the new Endurant transmission has been very positive and joint venture profitability is benefiting from transitioning to selling the new and improved products.","Power Systems sales increased by 14% in 2018 driven by higher demand for power generation equipment and an increase in sales to oil and gas and mining customers. EBITDA was 13.3% compared to 10.1% in 2017, driven by the positive impact of higher sales, lower warranty costs and improved pricing.","While EBITDA margins improved significantly for the full year, they were below our expectations in the fourth quarter due to stronger-than-anticipated demand for power generation equipment, our alternator business, which is still in the restructuring process, incurred additional production costs and premium freight to meet delivery commitments.","EBITA percent in the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by lower joint venture earnings in Africa, the impact of tariffs and a lower mix of parts sales. We do though expect to grow earnings in 2019 as a result of stronger power generation sales, improved pricing and sustained improvement in our alternator operations, all of which will offset weaker demand from oil and gas customers,","In our Electrified Power business, full year EBITDA was a loss of $90 million, in line with our forecast. We continue our targeted investments in areas which we expect to see broad market adoption, primarily in urban and shorter range applications.","Included in the fourth quarter results were two non-recurring items with combined negative impact of $58 million of EBITDA. These items were cost related to closing a start-up electronic logging device business and the impact of marking to market assets that underpin our non-qualified benefit plans.","The mark-to-market loss was driven by volatility in debt and equity markets in the fourth quarter. The ELD business was part of our strategy effort to increase digital services to customers and included the design of a smartphone based app that help truckers meet electronic logging requirements in the U.S. While this specific market did materialize as we expected, we continue to launch new digital products that serve our end customers' needs.","Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2018, starting with North America and then I'll comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America increased 19% in 2018, primarily due to higher levels of truck production.","We also experienced growth in sales of engines and parts to customers in oil and gas, construction and mining markets, as well as the full year impact of the Automated Transmission business.","Industry production of heavy duty trucks increased to 286,000 units, an increase of 29% from 2017 levels, supported by strong freight rates, improved fuel economy and new trucks. Our market share was 34% for the full year, up from 33% in 2017. The market size for medium duty trucks was 232,000 units in 2018, an increase of 9% from 2017 and the highest level of production in over a decade.","We maintained our clear leadership in the market with full year market share of 80%, up from 78% a year ago. 2018 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in North America. We shipped 150,000 engines to pickup customers in 2018 and recently unveiled a next-generation 6.7 liter turbo diesel engine, hosting a first-in-class 1,000 feet - power torque in a Ram Truck at the Detroit Auto Show. 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of Cummins availability in Ram Trucks.","Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 31%, driven by record levels of non-residential construction and the strongest year of residential construction spending since 2006. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America increased by 18% from last year, driven by demand from oil and gas and mining customers while power generation revenues increased by 10% year-over-year with particular strength, demand from data center customers.","Our international revenues increased 12% in 2018. Full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $4.8 billion, down 2% compared with 2017, with lower sales in on-highway markets partially offset by strong construction markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China decreased by 2% from the record level experienced in 2017.","Within the truck market, construction related dump truck and specialty vehicle sales were up 45% in 2018, while tractor and flatbed sales utilized primarily for line haul applications were down 10%. Our market share in 2018 was 12.7%, down from 14.8% in 2017 due to lower market share at our OEM partners, mostly driven by the change in market mix toward construction related vehicles.","The light duty market in China grew 10% in 2018 and our share ended the year at 7%, in line with our guidance. Industry demand for excavators set a new record of 203,000 units in 2018, an increase of 45% from 2017 levels. Our market share ended the year at 15%, 1.5% higher than in 2017, due to market share gains made by several of our key domestic OEM partners.","Revenues for our power systems business in China increased by 29% due to increased demand for power generation equipment and growth in industrial engine shipments to mining customers.","Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $2.2 billion, a 23% increase over 2017. Industry truck production was a record in 2018 and increased 22% from the year previous. Our truck market share ended at 40% which was flat when compared to last year.","Sales in our components segment increased more than 40% due to increased content associated with the transition to BS-IV emission standards in the truck market beginning in April last year. Strong economic growth and infrastructure investment also led to a 10% increase in power generation sales during the year. In Brazil, our revenues increased by 27%, mainly driven by a 27% increase in truck production.","Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on some individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2019 to be flat to up 4% from 2018, driven by an increase in heavy and medium duty truck production in North America and Brazil, as well as increased demand in power generation markets. We expect most of our end markets in China to decline in 2019, while European and Indian end markets are expected to remain relatively flat.","Industry production from heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 292,000 units in 2019, a 2% increase year-over-year. The industry enters 2019 with a record backlog and high visibility production levels in the first half of the year.","We expect our market share to be in the range of 32% to 34%. In the medium duty truck market, we expect market size to be 134,000 units, a 2% increase from 2018 with our market share projected to be in the range of 74% to 76%.","Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be flat compared to a very strong 2018. In China, we project domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat in 2019. We are currently projecting a 10% reduction in heavy and medium duty truck demand and a 7% reduction in light duty truck demand. ","We expect our market share in the medium and heavy duty truck market to be in the range of 13% to 14% in 2019, up from 2018. Our share in the light duty market will be 8% to 9%, up from 7%, with growth coming from our new joint venture with JAC, which became operational in December. There continues to be uncertainty around the adoption of National Standard 6 in China this year.","Our projection for industry truck sales to decline by 10% in 2019 assumes low industry demand for NS-6 compliant products, with adoption concentrated in urban use vehicles for Tier 1 cities. In the event that the enforcement of NS-6 standards accelerates adoption, we anticipate that overall truck sales could decline additional 10% below our current forecast, but our content per engine would increase.","Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 25% from record levels in 2018. While 2019 demand will be down, it will still represent the third highest year of sales on record. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be flat in 2019. We anticipate industry demand for trucks to be 5% lower than the record levels experienced in 2018.","Demand will be muted in the first half of 2019 as elections take place, but we expect strong growth in the second half of 2019 ahead of the planned implementation of Bharat Stage-6 standards in April of 2020. We also expect 5% to 10% of growth in construction and power generation markets as continued infrastructure investment drives incremental demand.","We expect to see growth in all of our businesses in Brazil this year due to improved economic conditions. We expect truck production to be up 13% in 2019 and power generation demand to increase 15%. We project our global high horsepower engine shipments to be flat in 2019 with a 5% improvement in new engine orders from mining customers as they replace aging equipment.","Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to decline by 40% with sales continuing at levels experienced in the second half of 2018, following robust fleet replacement in the first half of last year.","In summary, we expect full year sales to be flat to up 4% and EBITDA to be in the range of 15.75% to 16.25% of sales. The improvement in EBITDA this year will be driven by positive pricing, material cost reduction and lower warranty and variable compensation costs, partially offset by metal markets and tariffs. We returned a record $1.9 billion in cash to shareholders in 2018 in the form of dividends and share repurchases and currently plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2019 as well.","Before moving on to Pat who will discuss our financial results in more detail, I'd like to take a few minutes to share some of the progress that's been made in our Electrified Power business unit this year. 2018 marked the first full year of operations of our Electrified Power business unit.","In 2018, we announced partnerships on- and off-highway OEMs and are working on electrification solutions in products ranging from bus to medium duty trucks, light commercial vehicles, excavators and drayage trucks.","Vehicles with Cummins' electrification content were on display at several industry events and to date we have over 11 million miles of testing and development on vehicles with our electrified power technology. We have begun selling battery electric power train systems to Bluebird for use in school bus markets in United States and are progressing toward launches with additional customers including Geely for transit buses later this year.","We are continually assessing and innovating across a broad portfolio of power solutions from diesel to natural gas, fuel cells, hybrid and fully electric options. We plan to provide our customers with the right technical solutions for their application at the right time and to continue to be the leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment.","As we begin 2019 in the 100th anniversary of our company, we continue to see the benefit of our leadership in diesel technology as well. The next-generation 6.7 liter turbo diesel engine and Dodge Ram pickup trucks bodes the first-in-class 1,000 foot pound of torque and was announced at the Detroit Auto Show in January. The new lightweight Cummins X12 engine will be available in a number of chassis in 2019, including several of Daimler Trucks North America.","Customer demand for our industry-leading ISX15 liter engine remains strong and we are producing at all-time record levels. Finally, Amtrak announced on December 21st that it would be purchasing 75 charger locomotives for delivery starting in 2021 equipped with our QSK95 engine.","I want to close with a brief salute to our CFO, Pat Ward. Pat has served our company with distinction for more than 30 years, including last 10 as CFO. Throughout his career he's demonstrated remarkable ability to identify the key areas to focus on to drive improvement in the business and then to partner with our business leaders to deliver outstanding results.","I'll miss Pat for lots of reasons, but most of all because he's committed servant, a trusted advisor and a great friend. Pat leaves behind a very strong finance function and has been working closely with Mark Smith to ensure a smooth transition. Congratulations Pat on your well-earned retirement and also to Mark as our new CFO.","Now let me turn it over to Pat for the last time.","Pat Ward","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone.","I will start with a review of our fourth quarter results before moving on to the full-year 2018 performance and finishing off with outlook for 2019. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.1 billion, an increase of 12% from a year ago and a record fourth quarter for the company. Sales in North America increased 17% as a result of higher commercial truck production and improved demand for construction and power generation equipment.","International sales grew by 6% mainly driven by standard demand in Europe and Asia-Pacific from power generation and construction customers. A stronger US dollar negatively impacted international sales by 4%. Gross margins of 25.2% of sales, 10 basis points higher than a year ago.","The positive impact of higher volumes, favorable pricing and lower warranty expense were offset by increased supply chain and operational costs along with a less favorable mix of sales in our Power Systems segment.","Our selling, admin and research and development costs of $887 million increased by $36 million with all the increase coming in research and development, they were 100 basis points lower as a percent of sales.","Joint venture income of $79 million was $23 million higher than last year due to the absence of a $49 million tax charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017. Excluding that tax charge, earnings declined mainly due to weaker sales at our on-highway joint ventures in China.","Earnings before interest and tax, depreciation and amortization were $896 million or 14.6% of sales for the quarter compared to $769 million or 14% of sales last year. As Tom just mentioned, included in the fourth quarter EBITDA results were a $24 million write-off of an investment in our very own electronic vehicle logging company and a $34 million adjustment of mark-to-market losses incurred in company-owned life insurance investments which we use to fund our non-qualified benefit plans reflecting volatility experienced in markets and financial markets in the fourth quarter.","Net revenues for the quarter were $579 million or $3.63 per diluted share and included a $0.43 negative impact from the two investment losses I just mentioned, partially offset by a $0.15 benefit related to the 2017 tax legislation and other discrete tax items. This compares to net earnings last year of $503 million or $3.03 per diluted share, excluding the $777 million in one-time charges related to tax legislation.","Our tax rate in the quarter was 14.1%, which included $51 million or $0.32 per share of favorable discrete tax items. Excluding the discrete items, the operational rate was 21.3% in the quarter.","Well, let me comment on a full year results and provide some more details on our performance. Full year revenues for the company were a record $23.8 billion, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year. Sales improved in each of our operating segments driven by higher commercial truck production in North America, strong demand in global construction and power generation markets, as well as improved demand in oil and gas, and in mining markets.","North American revenues increased by 19% in 2018 and represented 51% of our total revenues. International revenues improved by 12% with higher sales in most regions, including Europe, Brazil, China, India, Japan and Australia. Gross margins of 24.1% were 93 basis points lower than last year. The $368 million after treatment campaign within the first half of 2018 and headwinds from currency and tariffs were partially offset by higher volumes, favorable pricing actions and material cost reductions.","Selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $156 million with almost all the increase coming from increased investments in research and development and were 160 basis points lower as a percent of sales.","Joint venture income increased by $37 million compared to last year. The 2017 joint venture income included a $39 million tax charge related to the tax legislation that I discussed earlier. Excluding that tax charge, 2018 joint venture income results were flat year-over-year.","Other income was $97 million lower than 2017 as a result of the mark-to-market losses incurred on company-owned life insurance investments, gains recorded on the sale of the assets in 2017 and some from foreign currency losses.","In total, EBITDA was a loss of $3.5 billion or 14.6% of sales compared to $3 billion or 14.8% a year ago. Net earnings were $2.1 billion or $13.15 per diluted share, both full year records for the company.","This compares to $1.8 billion or $10.62 per share in 2017, excluding the $777 million in one-time charges related to tax legislation. The operating tax rate for the full year, excluding $14 million of discrete benefits, was 21.1% compared to 58% last year or 24.5% adjusted for the tax legislation.","Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the quarter and for the full year of 2018 and then provide a forecast for 2019. I'll then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year.","In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, an increase of 18% from last year. On-highway revenues grew by 17% from higher heavy and medium duty truck engine sales primarily in North America. Off-highway revenues increased by 21% as a result of stronger demand for construction equipment in China, North America and in Europe.","Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $393 million or 14.6% of sales. This compares to $271 million or 11.8% of sales a year ago. The improvement in EBITDA percent was driven by benefits from the higher volumes and from favorable pricing actions. For the full year, revenues increased 18% from a year ago and EBITDA increased from 12.8% to 13.7% of sales.","For 2019, we expect revenues to be flat to up 4% with growth in North American top markets and improving demand in Brazil, partially offset by lower construction demand in China. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% compared to 13.7% of sales in 2018, driven primarily by lower warranty expense.","For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were a record $2.1 billion, increasing 6% compared to last year. The growth in sales was primarily driven by stronger demand for power generation equipment and parts and service in North America, partially offset by reduced demand for engines in oil and gas markets. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $140 million or 6.8% of sales.","Compared to last year, the fourth quarter EBITDA margin increased by 50 basis points as a result of higher sales and favorable pricing actions, partially offset by the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. For 2018, the Distribution segment had both record sales and EBITDA. Sales grew by 11% compared to last year and EBITDA increased by 13% to $563 million or 7.2% of sales.","We expect 2019 revenues in the segment to be flat to up 4%, primarily due to increased demand for parts and service and power generation in North America, along the favorable pricing, partially offset by the impact of a stronger US dollar. EBITDA margins are projected to be in the range of 7% to 8% of sales compared to 7.2% in 2018.","For the Components segment, revenues were $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 14% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased by 23% due to higher heavy and medium duty trucks production and the impact of the Automated Transmission business. International sales grew by 3% with lower demand in China, more than offset by stronger sales in Europe and in India.","Segment EBITDA was $278 million or 15.7% of sales compared to $214 million or 13.7% of sales a year ago. EBITDA improved, driven by the benefits from the higher sales, lower warranty expense and material cost reductions. For 2018, our Components segment delivered record revenue which grew by 22% due to strong on-highway demand in North America, Europe and India, in addition to the impact of revenues from the Automated Transmission business.","EBITDA as a percent of sales decreased from 15.6% last year to 14.4% in 2018, primarily driven by higher warranty cost recorded in the first half of the year. For 2019, we expect Components revenue to increase 1% to 5% as a result of growth in North American and Brazilian on-highway truck markets, partially offset by weaker demand in China.","EBITDA margin is projected to be in a range of 15% to 16% of sales, up from 14.4% in 2018. Lower warranty expense will be partially offset by increased investment in preparation for the upcoming India Bharat Stage-6 and China National Standard-6 emission regulations.","In the Power Systems segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.2 billion, up 9% from a year ago. Power generation sales grew by 13% driven by increased demand for power generation equipment in North America, Asia Pacific and in India.","Industrial sales were unchanged compared to last year. EBITDA margins were 10.3% in the quarter, down from 11.3% last year. The EBITDA margin decline year-over-year is primarily due to the increased supply chain and operational costs [indiscernible] along with a less favorable mix of sales and lower joint venture earnings.","2018 was a record year for our Power Systems segment in terms of revenues which grew by 14%, primarily driven by increased demand for power generation equipment and stronger demand in mining and oil and gas markets. EBITDA increased by 49% to $640 million with margins expanding from 10.1% to 13.3% of sales, driven by higher volumes, lower warranty expense and favorable pricing.","For 2019, revenues are expected to increase 3% to 7%, with growth in data center markets, increased motor revenue and higher demand for mining engines, partially offset by lower demand in oil and gas markets. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 14% to 15% of sales, up from 13.3% in 2018, primarily due to the positive impact of stronger returns, stronger revenues and the benefits of actions taken in 2018 to rationalize the manufacturing footprint of our automotive business.","In the Electrified Power segment, EBITDA losses were up $29 million in the fourth quarter and $90 million for the full year, in line with the guidance. For 2019, we expect a net expense of $120 million to $150 million as we continue to make targeted investments in this space. And as Tom mentioned, we have now projecting total company revenues to be flat to up 4% in 2019.","Increased demand globally for power generation equipment, primarily data centers and improvements in truck production in North America and Latin America drives the majority of the growth in revenue. Foreign currency headwind is expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately $300 million. In terms of our joint ventures, we expect it to decline approximately 5% as a result of lower demand for heavy duty trucks in China and in India.","EBITDA margins are projected to be between 15.75% and 16.25% of sales for 2019, up from the 14.6% recorded in 2018. We expect EBITDA margins in the first quarter will be at the low point for the year due to seasonally weak demand in our Power Systems and Distribution businesses.","With reduced warranty and variable compensation expense along with pricing and material cost improvement will positively impact margins, partially offset by tariffs and investments in the Automated Transmission business, the Electrified Power segment and in Components primarily related to China National Standard-6 and India Bharat Stage-6 emissions.","We are currently projecting our effective tax rate to be 21.5% in 2019, excluding any discrete items. Turning to cash flow, cash generated from operations was $990 million in the fourth quarter and a record $2.4 billion for the full year.","We anticipate operating cash flow in 2019 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditure for the full year was $709 million and we expect that our 2019 capital investments will be in the range of $658 million to $700 million.","In 2019, we had a record a $1.9 billion to our shareholders of 7% to 8% of operating cash flow. We repurchased almost 8 million and increased our dividend by 5.6%. Our capital allocation plans remains consistent with what we told you previously. We will maintain a strong financial position to sustain across cycle and issuing our business levels. We will focus on growth targeting high return investment with organic and inorganic. And for 2019, we plan to attend 75% of operating cash flow to shareholder.","We are poised with the record sales, EBITDA, earnings per share and operating cash flow in 2018. And there are on investment capital for top quarter. That being said, we had clear areas where we could have done better and you can see from our guidance that we expect in improving in operating margins in 2019.","And just before I finish, I do want to thank you all for your interest in Cummins, as well as my role as CFO. The Company is in a very strong position and I look forward to following trends continuing success as a shareholder.","Now let me turn it back over to James.","James Hopkins","Thanks Pat.","For the consideration to others in the call, I'd ask that you limit yourselves to one question and related follow-up, and if you have additional questions please rejoin the queue. Chelsy, we are now ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alex Potter","I guess first of all it sounds like pricing has been a tailwind in 2018 across the number of your segments you called it out - I guess a multiple times. Just wondering the expense we should expect that to be a tailwind again in 2019 and which areas you think the biggest opportunities are? Thanks.","Rich Freeland","This is Rich. It was a tailwind in 2018, in fact it will be a little bigger tailwind in 2019. And the primary areas we are able to get some pricing is in the parts business, and some of our power generation markets. Again some of that will be needed to offset the impact of tariffs that we have also coming in 2019.","Alex Potter","Also I was wondering if you could comment on Nissan, you mentioned a big monster diesel engine you're putting in the ram pickup. If you can comment I guess on both of those platforms, both ram and Nissan how those have - I guess developed relative to your initial expectations and what the outlook is there over not just in 2019 but over the next couple of years, diesel penetration for that type of vehicle, as well as Cummins market share? Thanks.","Rich Freeland","Let me start with the Chrysler. So we're really excited about this. We\u2019re going to be in the lead in the torque that's what this engine and that market remains strong. It's going to - 150,000 last year and we see that continuing. We are basically - it's the supply chain trying to keep up to produce them.","We will see that in Q1, will be the low point also, it will lower than net run rate in Q1 as we go through the model in your change and the transition there, and some issues kind of working that up. And we are excited and basically the whole industry is trying to add capacity to meet the demand.","On the Nissan front, that one still remains below our expectations with what be our projections, someone correct me, but we're in the 15,000, 20,000 engine range for that which is been relatively flat. So that one continues to - is not gotten the traction we wanted on the 5-litre V-8. And so I would say from the Chrysler standpoint you see only upside in '19 and continuing, as we grow share and Nissan relatively flat at the low levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Pat and Mark congratulations. Pat we\u2019ll miss working with you. I'm wondering Tom, if you can talk about major electrification product milestones that you expect over the next year, you mentioned some of the highlights on a trailing basis. Can you just talk about the number of new platform that you folks are going to be participating on over the next 12 months, what your win rate has been to begin on the additional platforms and then any updated thoughts on when the revenue contributions here will accelerate obviously provided guidance for '19 but I'm wondering if your longer-term thoughts involved at all.","Tom Linebarger","So big milestone this year of course are the transit bus launch Geely that's something we've been working to really since the beginning of the business. We see the transit bus market is kind of the - may be the most obvious adopter, the one where the significant incentives in the cities to drive towards electrification, the application itself towards electrification either pure EV's or potentially with a small engine to get you back to base.","So we think it's a good application for electric vehicles. So that's where we're targeting the - launch is the big one. We got a good order for that so we're pretty excited about that and pretty focused on the. I mentioned grades trucks and in fact grades trucks have a very similar application in terms of their relatively short range, pretty easy to charge, those are pretty predictable.","So we think that's another area that's going to go we've got a launch partner there Geely, I don't want to announce ahead of them. So I think those are really our two major platform milestones and I mentioned that we're already working with Bluebird and we are trying to get some more launch partners in the school bus side all those just reflect the ones that we think will early adopt.","And kind of one level lower Jerry those are pretty big milestone for us to have our battery pack that we're developing meet the performance standards at least for our first generation that we're looking for that's a pretty big deal to. So we got a milestone related to our battery pack then related to the entire electrical system launch.","Further out, there is a the number of applications we're looking but I would say that we are pretty strongly focused on these near-term milestones, a lot of the work going on, it's a big effort for us to get right, and then we'll look forward.","And with regard to revenues, I would say we're still in kind of the market development phase. I would be remiss to give you a good view on revenues. I think market adoption in this - markets that I mentioned is likely to move you with some steadiness but still I've heard people project that the transit buses which I again I mentioned is one of the best markets, might be 50% electric in panel for more years.","That's a long time. And that's for new buses which means there's you've got all the diesel buses still selling. So I would still love to call the transitions. I think what we're thinking about is trying to get our products ready to convert in these markets that are moving fast and then see what kind of adoption rates we get and then we'll start being able to call more of the financial side about what we think ramp out revenues. I know that's a little bit satisfying, it is to me anyway. But we're still trying to manage these launches and make sure that we're available and then we'll be able to figure out kind of where the launches go.","Jerry Revich","Really appreciate the color, and on the X12, I'm wondering if you can update us on any traction with additional OEMs, nice to hear the data point on Daimler, how close are you to rolling out with others and do I remember correctly you had spoken about that platform potentially adding 2 to 4 points of market share. Is that still the way to think about it when it's rolled out?","Rich Freeland","This is Rich. We've added Daimler, of course we'll let OEMs make their announcements on that but currently there's Daimler and some kind of smaller distributor OEMs that we've signed up.","Tom Linebarger","I think Autocar, Rich. Autocar you know is the refuse specialty vehicle and they - they're kind of using the ISX12, the big launch vehicle for them and they've launched engine for them and it's a new platform. And they're pretty excited about it too. So I think that - and it kind of fits, the ISX12 fits their application really well. So I think that will be another important launch for us.","Rich Freeland","So we're looking at close to 5,000 this year Jerry. And so I think for the market share gain of a couple of points, I still think that's out there. I think it's kind of a couple years out there though where we need to add some more.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Regarding the comment about North America, Tom not to nitpick on the choice of words but I thought it was interesting you said visibility to the first half of 2019.","Tom Linebarger","Yes.","David Raso","Some of your key customers are saying visibility with the backlog as large as it is, late 2019. So I'm just trying to clarify how are you viewing the current backlog, how long you can carry us, what do you think of orders and any thoughts around North American truck production in the back half of the year?","Tom Linebarger","I'll let Rich talk about that.","Rich Freeland","Yes, the backlog is big, all right. It's close to 300,000 units and we're projecting a 290 market with our projections. And so I think it's just - we might be being a bit conservative because it is strong through the whole year. We're just going to pay attention to what's going on with cancellations, what's going on with freight rates.","But I would say we don't have any insight beyond that. It actually looks pretty strong and I'd say there's growing confidence. We have projected a bit of a reduction in second-half of the year, slight one. There's more and more confidence that could fill in though, Jerry. So we're just paying attention to it and so you know what our assumptions are as what we try to do here.","Tom Linebarger","And I think your question about the words is a good one. We were trying to call a difference between us and truck makers. It's just that we are always - we've seen a lot of these cycles before and we've seen sometimes when order board cancellation start they can happen fast. We don't have any reason to think that's going to happen here. So we're watching the truck orders just like you guys are and we got to not such great orders and we just want to keep our eyes on it. But we are planning that this as we said that the year is going to be a good year and definitely the order board is falling off if we don't see cancellations that we'll have a terrific year.","David Raso","Okay, I appreciate the clarification and also on truck in China. I mean we all know you're not that exposed to the dump truck market, you're more about freight flat bed. So within that industry baseline view you have of down 10 where you're more exposed the freight haul kind of flat bed market. Can you help us with the mix, how do you view that market which is more relevant here?","Tom Linebarger","We're not forecasting a big mix shift year-over-year, I mean again one of the things that happened is in China they're clearly stimulating construction growth. And there was also some changes in rags on inside the truck market which grows more of these construction trucks. So you've got stimulus and this change in rags which drove this mix shift.","It's pretty dramatic, I mean normally the mix shift is just not something that we would call out but frankly these two things combine shifted a bunch and as you said our engines are more for these longer range things. So we got negatively surprised our market share. I mean that's what happened and so we were disappointed with the market than market share.","So we're thinking to ourselves that there maybe a little mix shift back because we won't have the special factors anymore but we're not thinking that that there's a big - they're certainly not any negative trends, if anything that the market share trend should be - I mean mixed trend should be slightly positive for us.","The big news in China really is how does NS VI get enforced? So what's going to happen with the standard how tightly did they enforce it on the first day. We were thinking we were heading into a time where now all these enforcements they'll be launched, they'll all be enforced aggressively across the country but because of the economic situation in China it looks like that's not going to happen and we're going to move back to some of those old enforcement plans where the cities would go first and things are moving slower which means we're going to be in a fair bit of uncertainty in the market we think for 12 or 18 months while the NS VI stuff gets enforced overtime. So I think that's driving most of the uncertainty as opposed to the mix.","Mark Smith","And fright is pretty flat.","Tom Linebarger","Yes, freight is flat. Mark was just adding that freight is flat. We're not calling for a disaster. We think things are going to continue to move along fine, but mix is slightly favorable maybe is what we hope. Again, we didn't call it that well last year but we think it's favorable this year and we think that this NS VI thing is what we're really having to manage.","David Raso","And I'll pass for the time here but just sort of level set here on, if there is a downside risk to the volume to the NS VI, how much is the offset of your content?","Tom Linebarger","Yes, that just totally depends on how it goes. But I guess our feeling is that to the extent we're exposed at all on revenue which relates to the market that'll be to our benefit in the long run. We think we gain share in NS VI, we think we gain content and margin in NS VI. So it's - we think it's a win for Cummins the faster it moves.","That said, you know to project does it mean we'd be down x points, it's really hard to say given the ways it could go. But let's just say that we would - we're ready for it to be enforced as fast as it can go. That would be the best thing for us financially.","Mark Smith","Content would be consolidated 100% owned.","Tom Linebarger","Yes, where as you know the engine sales JV versus the components are 100%.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","I guess first question just on the guide. I know you've talked bigger picture headwinds, tailwinds in terms of price cost, tariffs, warranty, incentive comp, is there any way you can quantify on a basis point level just so we can understand what your assumptions are there? I think your top line assumptions are reasonable. I just want to know what the other puts and takes are?","And then you know my second question Tom or maybe to the whole team. As we think about previous downturns I think Cummins has always done a very good job supporting higher trough earnings during number of different diversification initiatives or share repo whatever. As we think about 2020 and if the downturn does come, what are the puts and takes we should be thinking about because as I think about this next downturn I'm more concerned investment costs are going to be higher and you're really only lever to help support EPS would be repurchase? And by the way congrats Pat and Mark.","Tom Linebarger","Great question Jamie. Thank you. And as you said we are having a pretty forward stance on cash flow and repurchases as we've had in previous times like this where we think if we start to see financial downturn ahead, we will be aggressive on making sure we support our stock and we\u2019re into position to do that and our cash flow will be strong.","But I think just let me break the two questions. I'll have Mark, kind of go through the detail that you asked about. I think he can do a good job of squaring that and then maybe I'll have Rich talk a little bit about how we're posturing the Company to approach a time when business is strong but maybe over the horizon looks like a downturn.","Mark Smith","So pricing is going to be about 80 basis points plus, variable compensation 40, warranty of 140, then we get to those less exciting part of the list, tariffs takes away about 50 basis points, metal markets 40. If you combine the pricing metal markets then tariffs, Jamie, that leaves you about neutral on all of those and then slight tick up in research and a slight tick down in year-over-year earnings as the balances China markets we modeled currently will be a little bit low. Those are the moving parts.","Rich Freeland","And just a little comment on how we think about the cycles Jimmy. Just internally we talk about the mantra is you embrace the cycles, okay. We were in the upturn, you went to downturn which means that you have improved earnings at the trough and you had improved earnings at the peak and so we\u2019re committed there.","So you can imagine given that we had a good run in a lot of our markets then we had above replacement cycle. We have plans ready for downturn. So we\u2019ll do what we always do, which will flex down quickly when we see that's coming. And we already have plans in place to do that.","We\u2019ll also look to structurally change the company through the downturns so things you can\u2019t do and things are going fast on how we just change the way we structurally do business. So we have those things they were thinking about, and then we\u2019ll continue to invest in growth areas through the downturn when others don't.","So we got a strong balance sheet, so we try to do these three combinations so we come out of this thing, we come out stronger each time. So we\u2019re committed to continually improving. We commit to 25% decremental margins through the downturn and we\u2019ll do that again. And then maybe I\u2019ll turn it Tom just a little bit from balance sheet, share repurchase how we think about it.","Tom Linebarger","Again we will continue to generate strong cash flow throughout the period. And so that we\u2019ll manage that through of course making sure that we don't spend more capital than we need to and saw we\u2019re watching that now as we see things leveling out and maybe heading down. And we\u2019ll continue to step up share purchases where we think we don't need as much cash flow to invest.","So those things are the things you heard from us before and I think what we're trying to do is make sure that each time we approach this, we capture the things that look well in the previous downturn include the things that didn't work as well as we\u2019d like, and leadership team is already having significant discussions about that as we enter 2019.","So our plan this year has steps - is already taking steps and anticipating this thing turning back down at some point. Again we don't know when as in my conversation with David outlined, but we know it's coming.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks congrats Pat and Mark, tough act to follow there after Jamie's comment. First clarification on this segment reporting basis, where the 58 million write-down of mark to market recorded in eliminations?","Mark Smith","$24 million in eliminations Andy, 16 million in the engine business, and then the balance evenly distributed across distribution, power systems and components.","Patrick Ward","And the reason Andy that some get distributed it\u2019s because they just we take it we took the electronic volume logging device write up as a corporate costs. And then we allocate across the businesses right, that's why it ends up that way spread across. It wasn\u2019t that those businesses has had anything to do with it, it just got allocated as part of corporate expense.","Andy Casey","And then just on China truck you answered a lot of it - with respect to David's question, but are you looking for the full year drop to be driven mostly by the first half with flattish performance in the second half?","Mark Smith","Say that again Andy.","Patrick Ward","On China truck do we have a view about this kind of quarter-to-quarter seasonality\u2026","Mark Smith","It\u2019s still the same seasonality we have in the second half.","Tom Linebarger","Yes, the second half weakness really is driven by the - and its six anticipation. And that\u2019s the part and just apart that we are frankly - it\u2019s not our visibility isn't so great as I try to highlight. We have a view and it is reason to view as you can get, but it's just going to come down to people who think or people whose adoption rates going to be faster or slower.","And I think what we're saying now is we\u2019re saying that we think they\u2019re going to hit tier 1 cities which will mean that they'll be very little volume effect people that just not that many trucks purchase for that, it\u2019s mostly buses and things maybe rough used vehicles.","So most of the trucks remain to the old standard which means it will kind of truck along at steady freight rates with a small decrease where we\u2019d see a significant move potentially downward as people thought, the NS VI standard comes in. the price goes up a fair bit and I think I'll just wait now and of course the people thought that\u2019s going to happen one month from now they might buy more, coming in front. So these are things we\u2019re acting against each other plus a relatively weak economy.","All those coming together are just making it difficult to predict, but right now what we got is steady per staff drop in the second half and that's about as best we could do sitting where we sit down.","Andy Casey","And then one last one electrified power - the expected losses in 2019 are stepping up a little bit. Just want to make sure are we still looking for that same 500 million investment that you outlined in '17 Investor Day?","Patrick Ward","Yes, no change in the overall investment plan, the expense run rate you're seeing is really. So we have a fourth quarter run rate that we\u2019re kind of running across the year. So, we have our teams staffed up now for those milestones I talked about they are staffed, they are working towards delivery. We\u2019re not changing very much, we\u2019re just kind of sticking to it.","As I mentioned it these milestones are big deals we want to get those right, we\u2019re not trying to get distracted by a lot of other things. And so we still see that 500 million number to be okay. I mean you can\u2019t predict it perfectly but it feels like the right place for us still.","And not too much change in what we\u2019re focused on and what we\u2019re doing. A lot of people working hard though I\u2019m giving at a pretty steady picture, but there is a lot of work going on to make sure that we get that battery pack what we wanted and the overall electric vehicle system where we wanted. And so I would - those people will be sad if I said it was all smooth. They are working hard but again I think from a investment point of view you should think on the same plan, on the same run rate no change.","Tom Linebarger","All right, thank you everybody. Appreciate your interest in Cummins today. And we\u2019re ready to take phone calls late this afternoon.

My name is Steve, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a Q&A session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mark Smith, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Mark A. Smith","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss, Cummins\u2019 results for the first quarter of 2014. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President of our Engine Business, Rich Freeland. We\u2019ll all be available for your questions at the end of the prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial metrics. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today\u2019s webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now, I\u2019d like to begin with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger.","Tom Linebarger","","Thank you, Mark, and congratulations on being a Vice President. I know it must be those thrilling disclosure statements that got you that promotion. Good morning everybody on the call. I\u2019ll start with a summary of our first quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. As usual, Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.","Revenues for the first quarter were $4.4 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the first quarter of 2013. First quarter EBIT was $528 million or 12% of sales, compared to $437 million or 11.1% in the same quarter last year. We delivered incremental EBIT margins of 19% driven by stronger performance in the components and engine businesses, as well as demand improved in on-highway markets in North America and China.","Engine business revenues increased by 11% year-over-year and EBIT improved 200 basis points to 10.5%. The components business delivered record quarterly revenues and earnings as sales increased 21% and EBIT margins increased by 190 basis points to 13.6%. Both businesses demonstrated that as end markets improve, we can deliver strong incremental margins. And as Pat will discuss later, we have raised our outlook for both businesses for the year.","Revenues in the Distribution segment increased 22% in the first quarter, but earnings declined year-over-year due to the negative impact of currency movements, costs associated with distributor acquisitions and IT infrastructure investments. EBIT for the quarter was 8%. We will still see earnings growth in subsequent quarters as the pace of distributor acquisitions accelerates and acquisition related costs are spread over a larger revenue base.","End market demand in North America is improving, which will also contribute to increased earnings. We are on track with our plan to acquire our North American distributors and we expect to deliver incremental revenues of at least $400 million and add earnings per share of between $0.20 and $0.25 this year from the acquisitions consistent with our prior forecast. Our guidance for the segment remains unchanged, with full year revenues expected to grow between 22% and 30% and EBIT to be in the range of 9% to 10%.","In the Power Generation business, revenues declined by $107 million or 14% due to lower revenues in India and North America. Gross margins improved 10 basis points year-over-year despite the revenue drop, but gross margin dollars declined. EBIT margin declined from 6.8% to 3.9% due to the reduction in volumes and the negative impact of currency movements, particularly the appreciation of the UK pound against the U.S. dollar. We do expect revenues to increase in the second quarter with demand improving in North America, China and the Middle East.","For the full year, we still expect revenues to be flat year-over-year, but we now expect EBIT to be in the range of 7% to 8%, lower than our previous forecast, due mainly to the impact of the stronger pound.","Now, I will comment on some of our key markets starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 25% in the first quarter and as a result of improving demand, we are raising our full year outlook for most on-highway markets. Shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 22,000 units in the first quarter, an increase of 18% from 2013 levels. First quarter market share was 40%. We now expect the full year market size to increase by 12%, up from our previous forecast of an 8% increase. We still expect our full year market share to be at 38%, unchanged from our previous guidance.","In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered more than 19,000 engines in the first quarter, up 74% from a weak quarter last year, following the implementation of the EPA 2013 emissions regulations. We now expect the market to grow by 9% for the year, up from our previous expectations of 7% growth. Our market share improved to 66% in the first quarter and we expect to achieve full year market share of 70%, consistent with our prior forecast and 7% higher than 2013.","Shipments to Chrysler increased by 31% in the first quarter, compared to a very weak quarter a year ago when demand was low due to Chrysler\u2019s model year changeover. We expect that for the full year shipments will increase 5% compared to 2013, up from our previous forecast that shipments would be flat.","Power Generation\u2019s revenues declined in North America by 11% year-over-year. In the first quarter of 2013, we experienced very strong orders for data centers, which did not repeat in the first quarter this year. Power Generation order rates increased during the quarter and we expect stronger revenues in North America in the second quarter.","Our international revenues were flat year-over-year with growth in China and Europe offset by declines in India, Australia, Mexico and Brazil. As I will discuss, we are raising our full year outlook for China and lowering our forecasts for India and Brazil.","First quarter revenues in China including joint ventures were $720 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The growth was driven primarily by stronger demand for engines and components in on-highway markets. Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 12% for the first quarter as demand remained strong ahead of the expected transition to the NS4 emission standard.","In the first quarter OEMs increased the production of NS4 compliant vehicles to between 15% and 40% of total output depending on the OEM. The variation in build mix between OEMs reflects their specific strategies in target segments, as well as general market uncertainty regarding both the extent of enforcement of the new regulations and the strength of end-user demand for the new vehicles. Some OEMs including Dongfeng are actively promoting the transition to NS4 product. However, it appears that the OEMs that have ramped up their production of NS4 vehicles more aggressively have lost their market share.","Last week, the Ministry for Industry and Information Technology, MIIT, published a directive that sales of NS3-compliant vehicles must cease by the end of this year. This is a positive development and clear plans for strict enforcement of regulations have not been shared. With the deadline for sales of NS3-compliant vehicles now set it would be logical to assume the demand for NS3 vehicles will remain strong for the remainder of this year. But with OEMs already having shifted a significant proportion of production to NS4 vehicles, it\u2019s not yet clear how overall industry demand and OEM production will play out in the second half of the year.","Overall demand in the first quarter did exceed our original expectations and our current forecast assumes that industry demand is flat for the year, an improvement from our previous forecast of a decline of 7%.","Our shipments of light-duty engines in China more than doubled year-over-year as our partner, Foton, increased the proportion of its trucks powered by the 2.8 liter and 3.8 liter engines manufactured in our BFCEC joint venture. Demand for power generation and construction equipment is expected to grow by less than 5% for the year, consistent with slower growth in the economy and unchanged from our view three months ago. First quarter performance was consistent with our full year view.","Overall, full year revenues in China including joint ventures are now expected to grow 15% for the year, up from our previous guidance of growth of 11%. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $385 million, down 25% year-over-year due to weaker demand across most end markets as the economy remains very weak. Industry demand in the truck market declined 7% in the first quarter, compared to the first quarter last year, but did rebound from very low levels in the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect the truck market to be flat for the full year, unchanged from our view three months ago with much easier comparisons to come in the second half of the year.","Power Generation revenues in India declined 46% in the first quarter. Demand in the first half of 2013 remained strong due to power shortages, but weakened significantly in the second half of 2013 as the economy slowed. Demand remained weak in the first quarter this year. The implementation of new emissions regulations in the Power Generation market called CPCB II were delayed from April 1 to July 1, pushing back sales of higher value products for Cummins. For the full year, we now expect Power Generation revenues to decline by 15%, down from our previous expectations that revenues would be flat.","In total, we now expect revenues in India to decline by 8% for the year, compared to our previous forecast that revenue would be flat.","First quarter revenues in Brazil were $183 million, down 11% from the first quarter last year. Business and consumer confidence in Brazil has weakened as the economy has slowed, hurting demand for capital goods. Industry production of trucks declined 19% in March, as orders slowed and OEM inventory levels increased.","In order to reduce inventory, a number of OEMs are playing shutdown from second quarter that will lead to a sharp reduction in industry production. We now expect that the full year truck market could decline by as much as 20%, compared to our previous forecast that industry production would be flat compared to 2013. We now expect our full year revenues in Brazil to decline by 15% due to the weaker truck demand.","In summary, we currently expect company revenues to increase between 6% and 10% for the full year, up from our previous forecast of between 4% and 8%. The increased forecast reflects stronger demand in North America and to some degree, China. Within international markets, our improved outlook for China should offset weaker demand in India and Brazil. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 12.75% to 13.25%, consistent with our prior forecast.","We have said in previous quarters that as end markets improve, we expect to deliver strong incremental margins. I\u2019m pleased that in the Engine and Components businesses, we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated our ability to grow margins as demand increased in the first quarter. We are on track to deliver the benefits associated with the distributor acquisitions in North America and we expect that as demand in Power Generation improves and we complete our restructuring actions, we will demonstrate clear improvement and profitability.","Thank you for your interest today and now I\u2019ll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our first quarter results and full year guidance in more detail.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. First quarter revenues were $4.4 billion, an increase of 12% from a year ago and much stronger than we anticipated three months ago. Including demand in on-highway markets in North America and in China and the better than expected start to the year in Europe, resulted in higher than expected revenues in both the Engine and Components segments.","North America sales, which represented 56% of our first quarter revenues, were up 25% from a year ago, primarily as a result of higher demand in on-highway markets along with the impact of acquisitions in the Distribution segment. International sales were flat with continued weakness in international power generation markets and negative foreign currency movements offset by growth in our Components segment.","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, sales were down 4%. The decrease was driven by lower demand in global power generation markets, which impacted both our Power Gen and Distribution segments, as well as expected weakness in European and North American construction demand after their transition to Tier 4 Final emission standards from the 1st of January.","Gross margins were 25.3% of sales, up almost 1% from last year. The improvement was driven by stronger volume and lower warranty and material costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, primarily related to the British pound, the Brazilian real and the Australian dollar. Compared to the previous quarter, despite the lower revenues, gross margins as a percent of sales remained relatively flat.","Selling, admin and research and development costs were up $66 million from the prior year, but were lower as a percent of sales. The acquisitions in our Distribution segment accounted for $18 million of this increase. Compared to last quarter selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $11 million. Joint venture income of $90 million was up $8 million compared to a year-ago and up $10 million compared to the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by contributions from joint ventures in China where truck demand was higher compared to the first quarter of 2013.","Earnings before interest and tax were $528 million or 12% of sales. This compares to 11.1% of sales last year, reflecting a 19% incremental EBIT margin. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted EBIT margins by 30 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. Compared to the fourth quarter, EBIT margins decreased by 30 basis points from the lower revenues.","Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.83, compared to $1.49 a year ago, an increase of 23% with a tax rate of 29.9% in the quarter including discreet items.","Let\u2019s move on now to the operating segments and further discuss the first quarter performance and the outlook for the full year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 11% over last year. The increase was driven by strong demand in North American on-highway markets, partially offset by a 15% decrease in high-horsepower revenues primarily related to weak mining and power generation markets.","On-highway revenues were up 24% compared to the prior year as a result of the increased demand in North America. Compared to the prior quarter, sales were flat. Sequentially, we experienced stronger demand in North American on-highway markets, offset by lower demand for construction and agriculture engines in North America and in Europe as the industry transitioned to Tier 4 Final standards.","Segment EBIT was $269 million, or 10.5% of sales, up from 8.5% last year as a result of the higher volumes and more material and more product coverage costs. Sequentially, margins improved by 140 basis points.","For the full year, we now expect revenues to be up 6% to 8%, higher than our original guidance of 4% to 6%. Increased demand in North American on-highway markets will more than offset the weakness that we are seeing in Brazil. We continue to expect industrial revenues to be flat in 2014 and high horsepower volumes will be flat to down 10%. EBIT projections for the full year remain unchanged at 10.5% to 11.5% of sales.","The Components segment reported record sales of $1.2 billion and a record EBIT margin of 13.6% in the quarter. Revenues were up 21% from last year and up 8% from last quarter. Compared to the prior year and the prior quarter, the higher revenues were primarily driven by increased demand in North American and Chinese on-highway markets, along with increased demand for aftertreatment systems in Europe post transition to Euro 6 standards on the 4th of January this year.","Segment EBIT was $167 million, or 13.6% of sales, up from 11.7% last year, as a result of the stronger volumes and lower material costs, which offset a negative impact to margins from foreign currency movements.","Selling, admin and research and development cost grew at a slow rate in sales, positively impacting margins by 150 basis points. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins increased 130 basis points, or an 8% increase in sales. The sequential increase in margins was driven by higher volumes and lower credit coverage costs.","We now expect revenue growth of 10% to 15% this year, higher than our previous guidance of 8% to 12%. The increase is a result of stronger demand for all four businesses in North American truck markets and in China where we expect truck production to be flat in 2014 compared to our previous projection of down 7%. We are raising our EBIT projections for the full year to 12.75% to 13.75% and this compares to our full year 2013 margin of 12.1%.","In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $639 million, down 14% from last year and 16% lower than last quarter. Year-over-year, we saw weakness in North America and international markets, particularly in India, which was down 46%. Sequentially we saw lower demand in most markets with North America down 21% and international revenues down 13%. EBIT margins were 3.9% in the quarter down from 6.8% last year. The lower volumes had a significant impact in margin performance and foreign currency movements, primarily a stronger British pound negatively impacted margins by 110 basis points.","EBIT margins were lower than those reported in the fourth quarter by 220 basis points as a result of the lowered volumes and the negative currency movements. For 2013 we continue to expect sales to be in the range of minus 3% to plus 3% and we are lowering EBIT projections for the full year to a range of 7% to 8%, mainly due to the impact of the unfavorable foreign currency movements.","For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $950 million, an increase of 22% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions accounted for 21% of the growth year-over-year. Organic growth was 6%. However, unfavorable foreign currency movements lowered segment sales by 5%. The organic growth was driven by strong service demand especially in North America, compared to last quarter, revenues declined by 11% or 15% excluding the acquisitions. Standard North American service demand was more than offset by weakness in global Power Generation markets.","EBIT margins for the quarter declined from 12.2% last year to 8% due to the negative impact of foreign currency movements, which impacted margins by 200 basis points and also from the costs associated with distributor acquisitions and IT infrastructure investments. Compared to last quarter, margins declined by 250 basis points, as a result of the foreign currency movements and the dilutive impact of acquisitions on the EBIT percent.","For 2014, we continue to forecast revenue growth of between 22% and 30% over last year, with 3% organic growth and the balance from acquisitions, and we expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 9% to 10%. Our North American acquisitions remain on track to add $400 million of revenue to Cummins in 2014 and earnings of between $0.20 to $0.25 per share.","As Tom mentioned, we now project total Cummins revenues to be up 6% to 10% in 2014, driven primarily by improving North American on-highway demand and the impact of distribution acquisitions. We continue to expect higher horsepower markets to be flat to down 10% this year, and total industrial markets to be flat, which is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.","We are increasing our expectations for revenue growth in North American on-highway markets. We continue to see weakness in a number of international markets. We have lowered our expectations for truck production and reserve for 2014, and see no signs of demand improving this year in India.","We now expect the joint venture income will be flat when compared to 2013. This is an increase from our previous guidance of down 10% and is driven by increased expectations with truck production in China, which Tom discussed earlier, along with strong performance in our North American distribution channel.","We continue to project EBIT margins for the Company will be in the range of 12.75% to 13.25% of sales, compared to 12.5% last year. We remain focused on driving improvements in our gross margin in 2014, particularly for more material cost and from our supply chain initiatives. The full year tax rate is projected to be 28.5%, excluding any discrete items and our tax rate guidance does not assume that the research and development tax credit is extended into 2014.","Finally, with regards to cash flow, we produced $263 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, lower than the amount we produced last year as a result of an increase in working capital associated with higher revenues and an increase in our pension contributions in the quarter. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 13% of sales for the full year.","As expected, our cash and marketable securities balance decreased by over $500 million in the quarter. This reduction was driven by $419 million outlay in share and repurchases as well as from the acquisition of a North American distributor. The Company returned $534 million of cash to shareholders in the first quarter, including the repurchase of 3 million shares consistent with our commitment to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.","And finally as we discussed in our last call, we still expect to invest $700 million to $800 million on capital expenditure projects this year and between $400 million to $500 million related to the previously announced acquisition of the North American Distribution channel.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark A. Smith","Thanks Pat and Steve. We are now ready to move on to our question-and-answer section. I would request that everybody try to limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up and then please get back in the queue. Okay, we are ready to proceed, thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Please standby for your first question and it\u2019s from the line of Alex Potter. Please go ahead, Alex.","Alex E. Potter \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","Hi, guys good quarter. I guess first of all just starting off on India. It sounds like they have got a couple of people out there starting to make some incrementally more positive comments on (indiscernible) demand in India. It sounds like you guys are seeing that. What do you think about that?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. Alex I would just say that it's way too early to call the turnaround in India. We obviously have a bullish medium to long-term outlook on India. We think there's a lot of positive trends in the country about developing middle-class and all the other things we have talked about before at our Investor Day. But short term the economy is in pretty bad shape. They have got budget deficits. They have got a divided government. The elections aren't even complete. I don't think they finish for another couple of weeks, counting of the votes. There is still quite a bit of turmoil.","So there's no direct action from the government to resolve some of the critical issues. Road building's slowed to a halt. A lot of the things that were going well have really slowed down over last year, not to mention, just the basic macroeconomic effect. So our view is it's too early to call, and as you mentioned, our results are pointing out that things have definitely not turned around. If anything, we should see some stabilizing and given the comparisons in the second half, we will see some improvement I think, but that's just because the second half comparisons are so much weaker.","","Alex E. Potter \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay fair enough. And then I guess, secondly on restructuring in Power Gen, if you could just give an update there, where do we stand, when do you think you start to see some positive I guess margin normalization as a result of restructuring in Power Gen? Thanks.","","Tom Linebarger","","We do expect that to be largely done with the restructuring that we talked about by the end of this first half. So the second half, we'll begin to see results. We've done significant restructuring in the large alternator business.","We've reduced headcount in our European operations there and also moved some of our production into lower cost plants. So we've done quite a bit of work. It's taken a long time. And unfortunately volumes have been slipping away, while we've been taking actions, making the incremental benefit of those each step of the restructuring seem less good, because each time we make steps, the volume slips lower. But we do expect those actions to be done by the first half and to begin to see improvements in the second half.","As again, what we hope is that volumes stabilize and then begin to improve. If they do, we'll see significant improvements in margins in Power Gen. We have lowered our costs. We are positioned well to ramp up. Our plants very low utilization today, almost across the board in Power Gen and as volumes start to ramp up, we'll see benefits.","Alex E. Potter \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","Okay, very good, thanks a lot.","Rich Freeland","","Alex, just a quick follow-up, you didn't ask on the India piece. Tom mentioned, we've got a lot of capacity there, because we invested in aftermarket sales, but part of our gross margin improvement you're seeing is, we're utilizing those plants to export more and more product. And so, be it on Engines, Components, in the turbo area or even from a technical standpoint, getting more of our engineering capability out there. So, we've been able to use the investment we've made there to apply it to the rest of the business.","","Alex E. Potter \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","","Okay, interesting. Thanks a lot.","Tom Linebarger","","Thanks Alex.","Operator","","And your next is from the line of Jamie Cook. Please go ahead, Jamie.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Hi good morning.","Tom Linebarger","Hi Jamie.","Rich Freeland","","Good morning.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Just a couple of questions. Just on the new Engine guidance, I'm surprised we're not taking our margins up, given the revenue increase. Is that just sort of high horsepower? Can you just talk through the puts and takes of that or do you see that high end is more likely? And then on the Power Gen side, you talked a little bit, I think about, it sounds like order trends might be improving in North America, can you just give a little more color on what you're seeing \u2013 what you've seen post, the first quarter in terms of order trends in any particular markets? Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","","Pat, why don't you talk about margins and I'll talk a little bit about Power Gen?","Patrick J. Ward","","Yes, so we left the Engine segment margin consistent with the previous guidance of 10.5% to 11.5%. We did 10.5% in the first quarter, Jamie. We are expecting to see improvement as we go through Q2 through the end of the year, but at this stage, it's still a little bit premature to think about increasing that.","As Tom mentioned, we are a little bit uncertain about how China is going to play out in the second half of the year. That was a big help to Richard's business in the first quarter. So at the moment we are fine with 10.5% to 11.5% and we will see how things are three months from now.","Tom Linebarger","It is true what you said about high horsepower. We are seeing mining decline further on the negative side and we are \u2013 but we are seeing of course North America stronger, China stronger and marine markets stronger. But there are some puts and takes even within the\u2026","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","How much worse was mining in the quarter relative to last?","Patrick J. Ward","","28% in revenues.","Tom Linebarger","","Down 28% in compared costs.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. Down 28, units were a bit more than that.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Okay.","Tom Linebarger","","And you see there is further deterioration again. Fortunately, marine \u2013 commercial marine has come back a little bit so that's helping a little bit. Generator is still weak, so in high horsepower we are still not really improving much. It's really been in the truck side that we are seeing improvement both in China and North America. On the Power Gen side can you do your question one more time?","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","No. I just wondered, if you could give a little more color or just on order trends with the optimism around them as sort of improving and then just what you are seeing in the emerging markets?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. We just saw orders increase through the quarter. So we saw orders step up each month. January was very low, which again is not atypical for Power Gen to get seasonal low orders in January. And then during the quarter they picked up and so that's why we feel confident that second quarter revenues will improve for Power Gen North America. We also saw some improvement coming in China and in the Middle East.","Again all those are against the backdrop of pretty weak markets. That so it's not that things are booming or anything. But we definitely saw improvement through the quarter and so we believe we will see revenues step up. Some places that aren't really stepping up yet, I mentioned big project markets or the big, large rail markets, stuff like \u2013 business that Aggreko is in. They're a very large customer of ours, big projects that we sell those large alternatives, so those really aren't improving still, and again we do expect them to at some point, but I think that's a function of, sort of, general economic improvement in markets outside the U.S.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","And sorry, I hate to ask this, but did you have any weather impact in the quarter on the quarter or in terms of order trends or anything like that?","Tom Linebarger","I can't speak so much to order trends. I can't say logistics costs were higher. We definitely saw some increase in logistics costs due to weather and trucking around the U.S., I talked to quite a few people and that seems to be a pretty common theme, logistics costs were higher due to bad weather.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","","Are you willing to quantify that or not?","Tom Linebarger","I'm not unwilling, I'm just unable to quantify at this point, but I know, Mark will have some figures for you, he can share with you.","Jamie Cook \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Okay great, thank you.","Operator","","And your next question is from the line of Adam Uhlman. Please go ahead.","Adam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research Co. LLC","","Hi, guys good morning.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning Adam.","Adam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Can we talk through the China NS4 transition a little bit more. I guess I'm trying to understand better how difficult it would be for OEMs to switch back to NS3, if they feel like they have a little room to sell more of those trucks and if there's any risk to the Components guidance from that?","Tom Linebarger","Yes, so they definitely can switch their production at least until the end of the year. It seems like they can do it largely at their choice. There's a couple of problems. One is that some of the cities are requiring NS4. And so depending on how vehicles are registered, that impacts the customers' demand.","Second thing is that many of the OEMs have put in significant investments in technology Dongfeng included, I mentioned them, but many of the others as well have put in significant investments, and therefore they'd like to use those investments, and they of course have launched new products with good features and good capabilities and they'd like to get the new customers to see those features and buy those features and so, they have in part what is a regulatory issue to deal with and in part, which is just new vehicles, new capabilities kind of moving the technology of the market up and since they've made the investment, they'd like to transition the customer.","So, they have a vested interest frankly in moving production to NS4, but as I mentioned in my remarks, the market is still uncertain as to how quickly that uptake is going to be, how many customers are willing to pay for the new features as well as the other benefits and yet have to pay for the emissions technology and the enforcement techniques even after the end of the year are not clear. The government has talked about enforcement techniques they're going to use in the past. We just haven't seen much practical, on the ground evidence of those enforcement methods yet. So, anyway a lot uncertain, I guess, is what I'd say to you.","With regard to Components forecast, clearly, we have components content that we're selling on NS4 that we're not selling on NS3. We do have significant components content on NS3 too, but we won't have aftertreatment on NS3. So that it will affect our forecast depending on how big of a change it is. Remember, we have a pretty conservative ramp up forecast for the year.","So I think the downside risk to our emissions related equipment forecast for China isn't very large. Right now, it's looking better than we planned, but there's not much \u2013 I don't think there's a big upside potential given the way I'm seeing things play out and there's not a big downside either.","Adam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Got you, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, I might have missed it, but Pat, could you walk through the currency impact to sales and profits for the quarter and then what's embedded in the guidance for the year? Please.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. So for the quarter Adam, year-over-year, currency impacted sales by $90 million, and for the EBIT line of the income statement, impact comes by around $25 million, $26 million. So that's a 330 basis point headwind I did reference to in my remarks. For the full year we are probably looking at somewhere around $130 million to $200 million sales impact year-over-year and somewhere in the region of $80 million to $100 million EBIT impact, that\u2019s currency rates (indiscernible).","Adam Uhlman \u2013 Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Nicole DeBlase. Please go ahead.","Nicole Deblase \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Yes, good morning guys. Congratulations on the good quarter.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you.","","Nicole Deblase \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So maybe just elaborating a little bit on what you are seeing in Brazil. I think you mentioned that production there was down 19% in March. I mean, has that decline continued into April or could it get even worse than that due to the inventory issues?","Mark A. Smith","Well we are seeing \u2013 Nicole this is Mark. We are seeing OEMs planning significant shutdowns into the second quarter. I think without commenting specifically on our numbers in April we are expecting a big cut in industry wide production in the second quarter. Then the outlook for the third quarter somewhat uncertain we will keep going on other than how much commercial activity there is going to be. Typically Q3 is seasonally the highest quarter in the year, but it's hard to see that right now. So I think clear move down, not clear what the catalyst for improvement in the short term.","Nicole Deblase \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just going back to maybe the Engine margins; I know you guys kind of walked through the headwinds, but I mean you guys did do 29% incrementals this quarter which was really very impressive. So I mean what could cause moderation in incremental margins for the rest of the year in that segment?","Patrick J. Ward","Let me start and I will ask Rich to jump in. If you go back to the first quarter of last year Nicole, that was a pretty weak quarter for the Engine segment, especially North America medium duty truck revenues. So that had a significant impact on Q1 last year and maybe the incrementals probably look a little bit better than what they really are on a normal trend basis. Going forward, I think we're looking at 20% incremental EBIT margins for the segment for the rest of the year, and I'll let Rich make any comment he wants to add on to that.","Rich Freeland","I think that covers it, Pat. Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","The only thing I would add is, both Rich and I have been out to a bunch of plants this last quarter, and the thing I would say is, our plants are just doing an amazing job of figuring out how to get cost and productivity in weak demand environments. I was at Daventry in the high-horsepower plant, our mid-range plant in the U.K. I was in India, where, again demand \u2013 we're at 40% utilization in some of these plants, and these people are finding ways to reduce costs, break-even, even make a little bit of money at 40% utilization.","So, as things ramp up, we will make significant incremental margins in the Engine business, there's no question about it. What we just don't know is; what's the ramp up rate, especially outside the U.S., North America?","That's the place it looks like it is improving, you see clear trends. Most of the other places in the world, the markets are still not that great. China was good, but again, a lot of uncertainty and a whole bunch of other places, not great. But we do think that those markets will turn around at some point and when they do, our plants are really going to generate terrific incremental margins, and again, we just got a taste of it, but I think in Q1, and we're getting a little bit more of it through the year, but really it's not that strong of our economy in most for Cummins yet, and our hope is that switches around pretty soon and we'll really be able to demonstrate the power of the Company and the Engine business in particular to generate incremental margins.","Nicole Deblase \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay thanks Tom, that\u2019s really helpful, I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich, please go ahead.","Jerry D. Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning.","Tom Linebarger","","Good morning Jerry.","Patrick J. Ward","","Good morning Jerry.","Jerry D. Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","On the new products side, I'm wondering if you could just talk about the expected startup of the Cummins Foton heavy-duty production given the fact that you're seeing some NS4 sales now in the market overall. And then Tom, if you could just touch on any Tier 4 final market share developments that you could talk about. I know you were optimistic about a few more releases. How is that shaping out and how does that factor into the outlook for your industrial business this year?","Tom Linebarger","I've got Rich here and I know he's just \u2013 he's been following both of those really closely. I'll let him start on those.","Rich Freeland","So, on the \u2013 to start with China, in the ISG product, so we're on track to introduce in Q2, which we've been saying for some time. The ramp up in 2014 is tied to the NS4. So, we think we've got a fairly conservative ramp up through this year, and then, see the big step up will happen in 2015. So product on schedule, reliability on schedule, cost on schedule. Some uncertainty still on the NS4, but we will go into production as planned.","Then the second question was on Tier 4. Yes, so we had a bit of a pre-buy than we went through. We're now introducing a product, we\u2019ll, see the big ramp up will be in our high horsepower, where it'll begin to happen. And so, we're excited about that in the sense that we feel we're the one Company that's already demonstrated this technical capability because we've been doing this for almost a decade now in non-highway markets and so, we're excited about that. There's some different technologies being introduced. People are having different solutions and once again, we've played through this before in other markets, be it SCR, not SCR, we like our product, we like our position there as low to high horsepower.","Tom Linebarger","We were the first, just recently by the way, the first Company to receive Tier 4 certification in the large, the high horsepower power generation equipment. So, just to Rich's point, we are out there first. We have a clear solution. We\u2019ve have had on the \u2013 at the shows and available for people to see now for some time. So we think customers are ready for this. There is clearly a price premium that people were trying not to pay. So as long as they could find Tier 4 Interim or use credits they did that. It's getting hard now, it's getting harder and harder to do that with Tier 4 Final.","So we will begin to see transition to those technologies, and we think we have a good position with regard to our competitors in terms of the quality of the product and people's knowledge of how it works and why it's going to be a better cost of operation for them.","Jerry D. Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you and Pat on the currency, are there any markets where you might be able to offset those headwinds from a transactional standpoint with pricing and then if you could just breakout the impact and distribution of FX versus the acquisition costs that would be helpful?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. We have been looking particularly on the Distribution segment at where we can take some actions to offset the foreign currency headwinds and that will obviously be more of our own placing than anything else. So that's what the power and the huff team are looking at just now and I don\u2019t have any other update to give you on that at the moment. The second question was the impact on the currency\u2026","Jerry D. Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","The Distribution business.","Patrick J. Ward","That was about $40 million in revenue and about $20 million on EBIT, so when you compare Q1 to Q1.","Tom Linebarger","Australian dollar and Canadian dollar were the two biggest hits on the DVU.","Jerry D. Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace. Please go ahead.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey guys, congratulations on the quarter.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you Ted.","Patrick J. Ward","","Thank you Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","","I apologize if I missed this earlier but in Power Gen, the revenue guidance is unchanged at plus or minus 3%. The operating margin target was reduced 75 basis points. Was that mix or costs or can you just maybe quickly step through what the changes were there?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, Ted. So this is Pat. Let me take a crack and then if Tom may want to jump in. The major change from taking it down by 0.75 from the midpoint is from currency movements and that's the British pound. So we have a high cost structure in the UK with Power Gen and the strength of the British pound compared to year ago is having a significant impact on the profitability of the segment. There's a smaller impact on restructuring from what we said before on our last call. We're seeing volumes continue to deteriorate in Germany in particular, and that's going to mitigate some of the benefits that we anticipated getting from the restructuring benefits in the second half of the year, but the real driver is the foreign currency impact.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes.","Tom Linebarger","So I will just shed from 30,000 feet for the Power Generation business because we had a disappointing year last year. We really wanted to set a target that represented good improvement but was achievable. And as Pat said, we gave up all of our room and our plan because volumes were weaker. And then the pound came in and just made it go down. So we really \u2013 I mean obviously lowering guidance is not something we want to do and we're working really hard to improve the profitability in that business. Tony and his team have really put a lot of effort into reducing costs, while still trying to make sure that we're gaining share and winning business around the world and keeping our market position, and that's a tough balance they're striking. But we did give up our sort of room with the volume side and then this pound thing, it now looks like it's just going to carve 0.75 right off the top. Again, we'll see what happens with the pound, but that's how it looks right now, which is why you see the guidance lower to where it was.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, that's really help and the second part is related. Could you just step through the geographies within Power Gen and kind of help calibrate it for full year expectations? I think you said North America was down mid-teens, but how are you thinking about the North American Power Gen market for the year? And then, same thing for EAME, which I think you said was up in the first quarter and in Asia Pac, which I think you said was up on China?","Tom Linebarger","Yes, so, it\u2019s a good question. So, if you just look at longer term trends. North America's been improving. So, North America, even though was down quarter-over-quarter, we had a good group of sales to the data center market last year, so the comparisons were a little worse, but broadly speaking North America's on an improving trend in Power Gen. So, we're seeing good improvement there.","The other place we're seeing some improvement is the Middle East. Middle East had a weaker year last year, as lot of the rental companies cut back a lot in the Middle East and we're seeing Middle East kind of steady out and improve. Where we're seeing deterioration is in India, so, India was a significant drop off in the second half of last year and that weakness continues and though we're going to have this transition to a new standard which should increase the price and value of genset, that was delayed. So, what that means as far as transition rates and all that kind of stuff, we're not sure, but it just adds to the weakness of the problem.","In Europe, the European market is improving a little bit, but the big downside in Europe, is there's a lot of project kind of work and project companies, Aggreko, I mentioned already, large generator set project companies that we sell to there that are selling across the world in these big projects. They're all doing quite \u2013 the revenues are very weak. They're all doing poorly. And they're not buying hardly any equipment and right now, I don't see any improvement in that trend. So, that trend is, it's been bad for a while and it continues to be bad. So, that at least gives you a sense. So, while Europe is fine, generator sets to Europe, it's not a great market. The economy is still pretty weak there, but it's improving slightly. Our European sales that we report include all of these kind of project sales which are not going very well.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks a lot this quarter, guys.","","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Rob Wertheimer. Please go ahead.","Joe J. O'Dea \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hello, good morning. It's Joe O'Dea on for Rob.","Tom Linebarger","Hi Joe.","Joe J. O'Dea \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question is just on NAFTA heavy duty. You took your production outlook up about 3% for the year. But when you frame that against the continued strength in industry orders that we've seen, it seems like there could be more upside. So could you just talk about your order book for Class 8 heavy-duty engines? And is it just more that the recent orders are sort of more spread out and longer dated?","Rich Freeland","That's a good question. The way we took it up as you said, and the way we are paying attention to it is what's the backlog look like and what's the OEM kind of order board look like and when will they be taking build rates up. So I think where we stand right now is as an industry order boards are in pretty good shape. So there is actually some, not backlog, but some future orders out there kind of in the four to eight week range. So I'd look at it, we will see production better matching what sales are.","So you look over the last four or five months, production has been less than sales as these order boards have filled up. They are at a nice healthy rate now, not too big, not too small. And so I think there will be a little less volatility in there, in the production rates given that that's been a steady increase. So we are a little bit behind ACT. ACT is a little bit higher than us, I think 10,000 units and clearly that's a scenario that could happen. There is a scenario for either more upside or downside, but we think we are pretty well matched kind of at a likely rate for right now.","Tom Linebarger","Just at a broad, in terms of just estimation, if your question is, is there potential strong growth? Of course, there is. But as Rich said we\u2019ve been in a market that's had some volatility and then it had some brief ups and turns down. So we're just trying to strike the middle of that range and think about what's going to happen next, but we're prepared. We've been working on making sure we have capacity to deal with fluctuations in the market even if orders strengthen quite a bit, to make sure we can supply all of our customers when they need it with the right product. So we're ready for more upside, that'd be terrific. But we maybe estimate that where we think the most likely cases and there's some at risk on either side.","Joe J. O'Dea \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then on the component side, is the sort of adoption curve of technologies trending faster than you had expected in any particular areas? And then specifically, within emissions solutions, the 1Q revenue was pretty strong. Is that a reasonable run rate or was there anything unique in the quarter there?","Patrick J. Ward","I don't think there was anything unique. I think production rates depend on the implementation enforcement of the regulation. So, all the business is planned around the timing of those regulations. So if you went back two years, of course, China is much slower than we thought. If you go back to Power guidance at the start of the year, certainly the first half of the year is a little bit better than we thought.","So again, enforcement is going to be the longer term driver of the business beyond the next couple of quarters.","Joe J. O'Dea \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Patrick J. Ward","I think the other thing I'd say is, we\u2019ve baked in a pretty dire scenario in Europe for emission solutions given the Tier 4 Final emissions regulations and the Euro 6 on-highway regulations. Now it's at least OEM build of trucks not so much construction and a little ahead of what we saw in the first quarter, not so much construction.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz, Barclays Capital.","Andy Alec Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Nice quarter.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you.","","Andy Alec Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","So Tom, maybe it's a little unfair, this question, but after a quarter like 1Q and given a better North American truck market, are you guys feeling better about your ability to deliver sales in the range you predicted for 2015? Somewhere above that $20 billion number? Again, I know it's early, but you have that guidance out there. So any better visibility as we sit here today, or do we still have to worry about the international markets when it comes down to it?","Tom Linebarger","Yes, I mean, Andy, you know, I'm the CWO, the chief worrying officer. So, I do quite a bit of worrying about markets, and as I mentioned a little bit earlier, there aren't that many good markets now. There's markets that aren't a disaster and there's markets that are doing better. I mean, the North American truck market is the one market I can say it's actually getting pretty good. Still not a boomer yet; if we were discussing but it's maybe on its way to one; but really, most of the other markets, are not very good. So, again, we'll see what happens from here, but I do believe that if we get some turnaround and just the basic economic growth rates across the world and I think Europe is doing a little better than we thought and U.S. is definitely picking up. If we get some of these other emerging markets to get going, we'll see very, very good growth and then I could comment much better about where we see the end of 2015.","Right now, I think it's pretty uncertain about what 2014's going to finish out like and how that sends us into 2015. So, I guess, while I'd love to give you more or less confidence, I'd just right now, I don't feel like I have any more visibility than I did three months ago or six months ago. I do think that we are positioned incredibly well, as I mentioned. Our plants are ready to take the volume. They are working at very efficient and productive levels. Our products are leading in the markets across the world. As they things \u2013 as these markets pick up we will grow and we will grow incremental profitability significantly. So I feel very good about that. I'm just having trouble calling is, so when do some of these emerging markets and these other project markets I think start to turn back and that's really difficult for me to say.","Andy Alec Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","So Tom, let me ask you a related question about China then. That's another place that's been very difficult to forecast. It's done better actually for you over the last year. But how do you reconcile sort of the negative macro that we hear pretty regularly on China these days versus your performance here? And how worried are you that things could turn? Because we get that question sort of all the time, and we know you're putting a lot of new products into the market, you're getting share. Is that really the answer, but how much visibility do you have?","","Rich Freeland","Yes, so a couple of things to think about China. One is that the infrastructure growth rates in China have definitely slowed down. And that's why you see construction markets, Power Gen markets start slowing. That has happened and it is definitely happening. You can see it almost everywhere, just number of claims deployed, definitely slowed down. And we really haven't seen significant improvement there. They\u2019ve still got a very robust economy. Right GDP growth rates are still going, very large urban populations that are making products and buying products and things like that. And so that's driving trucking. Trucking is still going and they have a lot of big road infrastructure. They have gigantic logistics costs in the country that they're trying to reduce. So trucking well it is not unrelated.","Trucking growth rate can continue even if infrastructure growth rates, things like build out of cities, new factories, et cetera, airport slowdown and that's exactly what we're seeing now. There's also this weird instability in the truck market related to these new technologies and that's kind of an overlay that makes it hard \u2013 it creates more noise than signal on the short run about what's going on in the economy.","I would just tell you that from our perspective, the Chinese economy is still significantly weaker than it was just a couple of years ago, and that's really at these infrastructure things. Construction equipment sales are way down. Yes, they're up a little bit from year-over-year, but the comparisons are dismal. So this is very small growth. Power Gen market is not back, so there's still a lot of growth left to come in China when the global economy starts to heat up again, they start building infrastructure.","Even mining of course is impacted by the Chinese economy in this way, whereas I think trucking can proceed and still move ahead as they try to just move goods around China, even as they switch more to consumer versus build and export, that also still promotes trucking. So that's kind of how I'd reconcile those comments.","So we're feeling good about the truck market in China. We're just uncertain about with the overlay of emissions, which products are going to be sold when and what kind of impact is that going to have on customers.","Tom Linebarger","I guess I might add one thing, just as you mentioned, the hedge we\u2019ve got on the overall market is just the new products we've got going in. There's a couple of examples. The heavy-duty market, we virtually have no market share, as we introduce the new product regardless of what happens to market size, we're going to see growth there. The same thing in LiuGong, our joint venture, where we've not been in some truck market, we're now there and we're producing and as the emissions come, we're going to add Components and we're going to have a lot of volume on our 2.8 and 3.8. So we've got some tailwinds on that kind of regardless of some of the macro market.","Andy Alec Kaplowitz \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","","Tom Linebarger","","Thanks Andy.","","Mark A. Smith","I think there is time for one more question.","Operator","And that question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann. Please go ahead.","Stephen E. Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Thank you. Couple of you guys had mentioned materials costs a little bit lower in some of your prepared comments. Just anything to tease out there? How should we look at that going forward?","Tom Linebarger","So, here's Pat. Pat will tell you about material cost.","Patrick J. Ward","It was a little positive in the quarter, close to 1% benefit year-over-year and as you look out for the full year, I think we're still looking at a 1% type of number. So, none of that's really coming from metal markets, Steve. That's all what was going on within the purchase and supply chain organization, but assuming metals are pretty much flat for the full year.","Stephen E. Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then I guess just to quickly go back to the engine business, I mean it looks like your biggest increase was in the heavy duty. And I assume that's North America, which I would think of as kind of your best margin in the segment there, which sort of begs the question of mix getting a little bit better here. But I guess maybe you can dissuade me from that, or are we looking a little conservative with the flat margin?","Tom Linebarger","Just a caution on mix, I'd say, Steve, I think you noticed, that the way to think about mix for our company usually is, where we had strong market positions and leading technology, we tend to get, retrieve better margins than when we're entering markets, we have weak market positions or our technology lead is not so big. So, heavy-duty broadly is a difficult one, but I would say that heavy-duty North America, you know our market positions are pretty good. What's more is, now because of the content that we have on the Engines, we now have the technology components on there, a lot of them are ours. That helps us with thinking through incremental margin. So you not only have margins in the Engine, but you have margins in the Components which helps you.","So, I guess, broadly speaking, I would say, the North American truck market is a good market for us, but saying, is it better mix, it just depends on compared to what, like compared to markets where we're not very big and just entering, yes, compared to other \u2013 some other markets, not so much. So it just depends. But we do like \u2013 we are good in the market. We do have a good position. We do like it and it is generating good margins for us now. Again part of the incremental thing you are seeing though is again at plants that are not even near capacity adding incremental volume. That really generates good incremental margins.","Stephen E. Volkmann \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","Okay, great. I appreciate it.","","Mark A. Smith","All right. I think our time is up. Thank you very much. And I'll be available for you for calls later on.

Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I will start with a summary of our first quarter, including comments on the performance of our businesses, then I will talk about our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of our first quarter financial performance and our full year forecast. As anticipated, we experienced weak demand in a number of our end markets and geographies in the first quarter.","Revenues were $3.9 billion, a decline of 12% year-over-year. EBIT for the quarter was 11.1% of sales compared to 14.7% a year ago. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, all 4 businesses delivered reductions in SG&A costs for both year-over-year and sequentially, due in part to the restructuring actions we implemented last quarter. The Component segment delivered very strong results this quarter, delivering record gross margins despite revenues being down 7% year-over-year. EBIT was 11.7%, down from 13% a year ago due to lower volumes and higher research and development spending to support future growth. However, EBIT percent improved 280 basis points from the fourth quarter due to higher volumes and overall cost improvement. We expect that the component segment will continue its strong performance this year, as demand in on-highway markets in North America improved from first quarter levels. We have raised our full year EBIT guidance for the component segment, as Pat will cover in more detail.","First quarter revenues for the Distribution business were flat year-over-year. EBIT margins at 12.2% increased 10 basis points compared to a year ago and improved 140 basis points sequentially, due to a strong mix of aftermarket revenues. Our full year EBIT guidance for Distribution is unchanged.","The Engine business experienced the most significant decline in demand with unit volumes down 18% year-over-year and revenues lower by 19%. Unit shipments of High Horsepower engines declined by 24%, due to weakness in mining, oil and gas and power generation markets. EBIT margin for the quarter was 8.5% compared to 13.3% a year ago. Engine business margins were negatively impacted by the lower volumes, especially the sharp decline in shipments of High Horsepower units, as well as higher warranty costs. Performance in our Power Generation business fell short of our expectations in the first quarter. EBIT margin was 6.8%, down from 9.7% year ago and the lowest level since the first quarter of 2010. As a result of the weak performance in the first quarter, we have lowered our guidance for Power Generation for the full year. However, we have not changed our expectations for the business for the rest of the year, as we believe Q1 was a low point.","In total, while we have adjusted our guidance up for Components and down for Power Generation, we are not changing our overall guidance for the company. We still expect revenues to be flat to down 5% for the year, and we still expect to deliver EBIT in the range of 13% to 14% of sales.","Now I want to talk in more detail about our sales and our key markets. As I said, overall company revenues declined by 12% in the first quarter, with revenues in North America declining 15%, international revenues declining 10%. In North America, our revenues were most heavily influenced by a decline in on-highway markets. Our shipment of engines for North American heavy-duty trucks were 19,000 units in the quarter, a decrease of 37%. Demand declined as our industry continued to run at lower production levels following a period of overproduction in the first half of 2012. Retail sales for the industry have exceeded industry production for the last 6 months and OEM backlogs are increasing. We do expect to see sequential improvement through the year, driven largely by replacement demand. For the full year, we are adjusting our forecast for the market size to 233,000 units, down from our previous forecast of 240,000. Our market share for the quarter was 41.6% through February, and we are maintaining our full year market share forecast of 40%. We shipped 11,000 units to the U.S. medium-duty truck market this quarter, a decrease of 23% year-over-year. Demand is expected to increase in Q2 and beyond, as OEMs continue to ramp up their production of 2013 models. We continue to expect a full year market size of approximately 109,000 units in 2013, an increase of 2%, and our market share to be approximately 52%.","Demand from Chrysler decreased in the first quarter by 17%, due to the planned model year changeover that started in January. For the full year, we expect shipments to decline by 10%, in line with our previous forecast. Our international revenues decreased by 10% in the first quarter of 2013, with the most significant declines in Europe and China, and relatively flat markets in Brazil and India. In the Brazilian truck market, our unit shipments increased by 20% compared to very weak levels last year. We are raising our estimate of 2013 industry sales to increase 19%, compared to our previous forecast of an increase of 15%. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about improvement in the Brazilian economy, although truck industry sales declined 8% in quarter 1, and industry inventory increased by approximately 12% from fourth quarter levels. Continued growth in the economy and the availability of credit will be important factors determining full year truck demand in Brazil. In total, our revenues in Brazil declined 8%, with the improvement in the truck demand more than offset by the impact of depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar.","Moving to China, our first quarter revenues in China included joint venture -- including joint ventures, decreased 11% year-over-year, with the decrease due to lower demand in most end markets. Demand for excavators remained weak in the first quarter, with industry sales down 26%. We did observe a modest reduction in inventory levels at OEMs in the first quarter, but we continue to believe that it will take most of the year to normalize industry inventory levels. Our forecast for our own revenues in the construction market has not changed significantly in the last 3 months, with no growth expected in Engine shipments this year. The truck market in China for medium- and heavy-duty trucks combined declined by 12% in the first quarter, as uncertainty over the strength of the economy continued to impact the industry. The revenues of our Dongfeng-Cummins joint venture were down 11%, in line with the market. We expect a modest increase in orders for the second quarter. At this time, we are maintaining our full year forecast for industry sales to be flat year-over-year. Having said that, actual industry behavior is going to be heavily influenced by the final implementation rules for the new NS4 emission standard scheduled for July of this year.","Just last week, there was a meeting of the largest 8 domestic truck manufacturers, the so-called C8, and out of that meeting came a set of recommendations to the government on how to proceed with the implementation of NS4 regulations. We are still evaluating these recommendations. However, on first review, it appears that the truck manufacturers are seeking a phased approach to NS4 implementation which would likely defer widespread adoption of fully compliant solutions, including aftertreatment, to 2014. It is not clear at this stage what impact, if any, these recommendations will have on the government's approach to implementation of NS4, or even when the government will respond to these recommendations. As a reminder, our current forecast assumes slow adoption of aftertreatment in 2013.","Volume and revenues at our Light-Duty joint venture with Foton continued to grow in the first quarter, with revenues for the domestic market up 90%, off a low starting point. We continue to have high expectations for the growth of our Light-Duty engines, both in China and in other markets. The joint venture is now consistently operating above breakeven. Power Generation revenues, including joint ventures, declined 13% year-over-year, with the pace of industrial activity in China still relatively weak. Orders for the second quarter currently indicate a modest improvement with the first quarter -- from the first quarter, and we expect the full year to be at least flat with 2012 levels. For the full year, we still expect total revenues in China to be up 5%, with growth in Light-Duty engines driving the increase. First quarter revenues were in line with expectations, and our current full year forecast is unchanged. In addition to the market-specific factors I have discussed, uncertainty remains about the rate of improvement of the Chinese economy as a whole, and we continue to monitor conditions in China very closely.","Business conditions in India have weakened further and we are lowering our outlook for the truck market. In prior calls, I have discussed measures taken by the government to address the fiscal deficit that have not been helpful to truck demand. Road-building has also slowed in India, and overall confidence for capital purchases has weakened. Industry sales for the medium and heavy commercial vehicle market declined 33% in the first quarter. We are lowering our full year view of the market and now expect a full year decline of 14%, compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 5%.","In the Power Generation business, we experienced an 11% growth in revenues in the first quarter, driven by continued power shortages in the country. As a result, our full year forecast is that revenues will grow by 10%, despite weaker economic conditions, though clearly, the outlook is more uncertain. In Europe, we experienced a 12% decline in revenues year-over-year, with the Power Generation business most negatively affected. Power Generation revenues in Europe were down 45%, with demand in Russia notably weaker in the first quarter. We do not expect revenue growth for our Components -- sorry, we do expect revenue growth for our Components Business next year, with the introduction of Euro 6 emissions regulations, but for this year, Europe will remain challenging across all of our businesses.","I will conclude my market comments with an update on our mining business. 3 months ago, we predicted that our full year revenues, including aftermarket, will decline by 25% for the full year. Actual first quarter revenues declined by 28%. Overall customer sentiment has been a little more negative over the last 3 months, and our revised mining revenue guidance is for a decline of 27%. Not a significant change, but certainly, we do not see any signs of improvement in the near term. Aftermarket revenues were down year-over-year, but in line with the fourth quarter levels.","Although uncertainty exists in a number of markets, we do expect that the first quarter marks a low point for revenues this year, and we expect to see sequential improvement in revenues, driven most significantly by on-highway markets in North America, in which we have strong market share for Engines and Components, and by the construction market in North America. Power Generation demand should also improve from first quarter levels, driven mostly by seasonality and increasing demand in North America.","I've covered a lot of ground on markets, but before I turn it over to Pat, I would like to share some of the recent company news that highlights the strength of our partnerships and our ongoing focus on bringing new products to market. At the Mid-America Truck Show in March, we revealed the new integrated engine and transmission combination of a Cummins ISX15 engine and Eaton transmission, that will deliver both improved performance and 3% to 6% better fuel economy for truck customers. Also at MATS, we highlighted the new Cummins Westport ISX12 G natural gas engine that is now in limited production and is generating a lot of interest among end-users. At the recent BAUMA show in Munich, we displayed 3 all new off-highway engines. The new QSM 12-liter engine, the QSF3.8-liter engine and the L9.3 made at our Guangxi Cummins Engine joint venture. These engines are designed to offer leading performance and emissions at world-class cost levels for off-highway equipment. They are also the most recent examples of a strong pipeline of new products that will help drive strong profitable growth as our global markets improve.","Thank you for your interest today. And now, I'll turn it over to Pat.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter revenues were $3.9 billion, a decrease of 12% from a year ago, reflecting expected weakness across many markets and regions. As I said during the fourth quarter earnings call, we expected a tough first quarter, and it came in pretty close to what we were thinking back then. North America sales, which represented 50% of our first quarter revenues, were down 13% from a year ago, primarily as a result of lower demand from on-highway markets and also continuing weakness in the oil and gas market. International sales decreased by 10%, driven by weak demand in both power generation and in mining markets.","Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, sales were down 9%. The decrease was driven by weakness in the North American bus market, following the emissions change, and in the Chrysler business, due to the planned model year changeover which occurred in January of this year. Mining revenues also declined sequentially as we had projected, and we experienced normal seasonality in the Distribution and Power Generation businesses.","Gross margins were 24.4% of sales, down from 26.8% last year. The decrease was driven by the impact of the reduced volumes, unfavorable mix and higher warranty costs, partially offset by the benefit of improved pricing and lower material costs. Margins also decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, due to reduced volumes and an expected increase in our warranty costs.","Selling, admin and research and development spending was down $30 million from last year and down $7 million from the previous quarter. Both the sequential and year-over-year reduction in spending was concentrated in administration expenses. Joint venture income of $82 million was down 21% compared to a year ago and was flat compared to the prior quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by a lower contribution from our joint ventures in China and in India, where truck demand was lower compared to the first quarter of 2012. Earnings before interest and tax were $437 million or 11.1% of sales. This compares to 14.7% of sales last year and 12.4% in the previous quarter, excluding special items. And as Tom said, we expect this to be the low point of our performance this year. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.49 compared to $2.38 a year ago, with a tax rate of 27.6% in the quarter.","Now let's move on to the operating segments and further discuss first quarter performance and the outlook for the full year. All the numbers and comparisons exclude the $52 million pretax or $35 million after-tax restructuring charge that we took in the fourth quarter of 2012. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 19% over last year. The decrease was driven by weak demand in oil -- on-highway and oil and gas markets in North America, and by a 28% decrease in global mining revenues. This weakness was partially offset by improving demand in the Brazilian truck market, where revenues were up 26% and across global agricultural markets.","Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down 8%. Sequentially, we experienced weaker demand for Chrysler and North America bus engines, along with weakness in mining and in oil and gas markets. Segment EBIT of $195 million, or 8.5% of sales, was down from 13.3% last year, as a result of weaker volumes, unfavorable product mix, higher product coverage costs and a lower joint venture contribution. This was partially offset by improved pricing and lower material costs. Sequentially, the decline in volume, a more unfavorable product mix, the higher product coverage costs and increases in research spending resulted in lower margins. For the full year, we continue to forecast the revenue for the Engine segment will be down 5%, driven by weakness in industrial markets, particularly in mining, partially offset by improved demand in the Brazilian truck market. EBIT projections for the full year remain unchanged at 10% to 11% of sales.","In the Component segment, first quarter revenue was $1 billion, down 7% from last year and up 8% from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior year, the lower revenues were primarily driven by a reduced demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market and lower demand in Europe, partially offset by increased demand in Brazil. Sequentially, sales increases were driven by strength in North American and Brazilian truck markets. Segment EBIT was $119 million or 11.7% of sales, down from 13% last year. Continued technical investment on lower sales and higher coverage costs resulted in lower margins compared to a year ago. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins increased almost 300 basis points, or an 8% increase on sales. The sequential increase in margins was driven by higher volumes, improved pricing and lower material costs. We continue to expect revenue growth of around 2% this year, primarily as a result of increased penetration of aftertreatment systems in the North American heavy-duty truck market, and growth in the Brazil truck market being offset by weaker demand in both Indian and European truck markets.","We are raising EBIT projections for the full year from 10.5% to 11.5% of sales, to 11% to 12%, due to strong gross margin performance. This compares to a full year 2012 margin of 10.8% of sales. In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales of $746 million, down 4% from last year and down 2% from last quarter. Year-over-year, we saw weakness in Europe and Russia, partially offset by increases in India and in our North American military business. Sequentially, we saw a deterioration in Europe and Russia, partially offset by continued strength in India. EBIT margins were 6.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 9.7% last year. While lower volumes and unfavorable mix contributed to this lower profitability, we also had some unplanned costs that negatively impacted margins, including warranty costs in our alternator business and some gas project costs that were higher than expected. We expect to see improvement in the second quarter, as these costs don't repeat, and volumes improve sequentially.","EBIT margins were slightly lower than those reported in the fourth quarter, as a result of higher product coverage costs, partially offset by reduced administration expenses and increased pricing. For 2013, we continue to expect sales to be down 3% compared to last year, primarily due to weakness in Europe and in Russia. We are lowering our EBIT projections for the full year from a range of 9% to 10%, to a range now of 8.5% to 9.5% of sales.","For our Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $778 million, an increase of less than 1% compared to the prior year and a 14% reduction compared to the prior quarter. During the quarter, the Distribution segment acquired a North American distributor, which added revenue of $21 million. Excluding acquisitions, first quarter revenue decreased 11% compared to the prior year and 17% sequentially. In both comparisons, organic growth is lower due to weaker demand in power generation markets in Europe and in Russia, North American oil and gas markets and global mining markets. EBIT margins for the quarter were 12.2%, flat with margins a year ago, with positive mix being offset by reduced joint venture contribution and higher selling and administration expense, which were both impacted by acquisitions.","Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins improved by 140 basis points, driven by positive mix and higher joint venture contribution. For 2013, we continue to forecast 10% growth in revenue over the prior year, including the impact of acquisitions, and expect EBIT margins in the range of 11.5% to 12.5% of sales. And as Tom mentioned, we continue to project total Cummins revenues to be flat to down 5% in 2013, with sequential improvement throughout the year, driven mostly by recovery in the North America on-highway markets, with modest improvements in a number of international engine and power generation markets also contributing to higher revenues starting in the second quarter. We continue to project EBIT margins for the company will be in the range of 13% to 14% of sales, compared to 13.6% last year, and as we discussed on the prior quarter's call, for the full year, we expect pricing to add 50 to 100 basis points of margin, and lower material cost to also benefit margin by 50 to 100 basis points. These will help offset the headwinds from lower volumes and unfavorable mix, as well as from higher product coverage costs. We are now projecting the tax rate for the year to be around 29.5%, excluding any discrete items. The increase in the rate over last year and over previous guidance is due to changes in the geographic mix of forecasted earnings.","Finally, with regards to cash flow, we produced $428 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter. We did increase inventory levels in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of last year, we knew that some parts of the business would have very low volumes at the start of the year. For example, in our manufacturing plant that supplies Chrysler, we knew that with the model year changeover volumes, we'd be very light at the start of the year, so inventory levels were cut back at the end of the fourth quarter. Also in some parts of our business, we expect the second quarter demand will be higher than first quarter; for example, parts of the Engine and Components businesses that supply on-highway markets in North America. So inventory has increased in those locations. In the parts of the business with the weakest outlook for the year, for example, in our High Horsepower engine business, we have made good progress in reducing inventory and continue to reduce inventory levels throughout the first quarter.","There are always opportunities to improve our inventory management. And we're not suggesting it was perfect globally, and we do expect inventory and working capital metrics to improve as the year progresses. Overall, we did reasonably well in managing cash flow in the first quarter. The company's financial strength is reflected by a single A credit rating from both Fitch and from Standard & Poor's. In addition, Moody's recently upgraded our unsecured debt rating to single A3 status. The strength of our balance sheet allows us the flexibility to continue to invest back into the company and also return value to our shareholders, even during periods of volatility. As we discussed on our last call, we expect to invest $850 million in capital expenditure projects this year. We announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program last year, and have started to repurchase stock in April and will continue to do more in the second quarter. Over the last 3 years, we've almost tripled our dividend and remain committed to further increases in a stable and sustainable manner. We are well-positioned to continue to return cash to our shareholders, in addition to funding our organic growth plans.","The first quarter results represent an expected trough in both sales and profitability for the company in 2013, based on our current view of global markets. Although revenues were down across most major markets, there are signs of improving demand from these low levels, particularly in on-highway markets in North America where we continue to have a very strong market share.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Pat. We're now ready for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Please standby for your first question, which is from the line of David Leiker of Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just want to make sure -- one item first, and then the follow-up on that. It sounds like you -- these first quarter results were as you expected to fall in the quarter. Is that accurate?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and then if we look through the balance of year, it looks like most of your end-market assumptions really don't assume any sequential improvement in demand. Year-over-year, you have comps. But sequentially, that seems like you're expecting something pretty similar to what we saw here in the first quarter? Maybe North America truck will look, you know, better just given where the build rates ended up there?","Patrick J. Ward","I think if you look at the guidance we've given for the full year, David, that we do expect sequential improvement in revenues beginning in the second quarter. And we think that will help provide a platform for improved margin performance, too, for the company throughout the remaining 3 quarters of the year. The first quarter, as you mentioned, was expected to be low. And as we went through the quarter, it was encouraging to see that the performance both at gross margin level and in EBIT margin level improved month after month. So we started off the quarter close to 10%. We finished off the quarter close to 13%. So that made me feel good that we've got momentum going into the second quarter that can carry us forward towards this guidance.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, maybe it's more accurate to say, given the current level of demand that you're seeing here in April, that you're -- things generally are sequentially at the current pace, is that fair?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. That's generally fair. I mean, the only thing, I guess, I would add, is that, as I mentioned in my remarks, Power Gen was lower in margin than we expected. That was the one that -- it did a disappointing run [ph]. There were a number of items that occurred in the first quarter we did not expect. But overall, revenue levels for them, even for them, we thought were right. The second thing that happened, as Pat was mentioning, is the -- our January was weaker than we expected. We had a lot of bus orders and other prebuy orders at this end of last year. I'll let Rich give you more details on that. But it just slowed down our first quarter, and as I talked about in my remarks, mining weakened even a little bit further. So things were weaker in January. But again, as Pat said, we really started to strengthen through the quarter and began to look more like we expected in total for the quarter, with the right trajectory. Now we are expecting sales to improve Q2 to Q4 as we had planned, and again, it's not major market recoveries.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Now I guess, what I was trying to get at is...","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. No, North America, as we said, people were basically producing below demand. And now, they're going to step-up and produce a little above demand. We have seasonality in Power Gen. So there's nothing dramatic. But the results across all those markets is a reasonably decent step-up in sales as expected, and without this kind of major adjustment in January that we had to fight through. So those things combined lead to better results. We also, of course, finished all of our restructuring actions, those are all through. We're seeing benefits of those in our expense line. So we feel pretty good about the margin step-up we've laid out through the quarter.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Now, great. And what I'm trying to get at, I guess, is that when you look at some of these end markets for other industrial companies, there's expectations that the second half is significantly better than the first half. When you look at Eaton's estimate for Q4, North America truck production at 78,000. Now you're not baking those types of assumptions into your numbers, it sounds like?","N. Thomas Linebarger","I'll let Rich get -- that's a good question, so let me let Rich comment on North America truck.","Richard J. Freeland","Yes, let me do that. Let me just add one more bit of technicolor around the midrange side. Where we got a little surprised, quite frankly, was in the midrange side around bus, RV, firetruck. We saw OEs increase their orders in Q4, and basically, bought most of their Q1 demand in Q4. And so we got a little positive surprise in Q4 and a bit of a negative surprise on Q1, on that. And that was part of the -- we've seen that come through and we've seen orders get back to kind of a normal rate, kind of the end of March, early April. On the heavy-duty side, we've taken our overall forecast down from 240,000 to 233,000. So that does imply an increase sequentially through the year; you can do the math on that. I won't give quarterly guidance. We are seeing that increase in production rates has started here in Q2, where we forecasted to be to get to that 233,000 or [indiscernible].","N. Thomas Linebarger","Right. There's no magic surprise in Q4. We're already seeing build rates come up now, I guess, is the main point there.","Operator","We another have question for you. This one is from the line of Jerry Revich at Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you gentlemen can flush out a couple of assumptions behind your guidance on the Navistar aftertreatment business, specifically, what kind of sales contribution are you assuming, and what's your heavy-duty truck market share assumption? And Tom, did I hear you right? You're assuming 52% market share in medium-duty, where I think you're running a couple of points ahead of that in the first quarter. So would you mind just flushing those points out a little bit?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, I think -- I'll let Rich add if he wants to. I think, heavy-duty, medium-duty; we're thinking 40%, heavy duty, 52% in medium-duty. And both of those were a little ahead in the first quarter. And just basically, our general view is those things fluctuate based on the market shares of our -- of the end-use truck manufacturers and other variations. So that's why we do it, we look across the year and take an estimate based on those fluctuations. So we don't see major changes happening. It's the same progressions we've seen across all the markets. But so far, we've seen good strengths, for people using our products, good feedback on our products, so that all remains good. With regard to aftertreatment systems, as you know, we did get our system and -- on the 13-liter engine Navistar, approved by the EPA. That was good news. We don't give any specific forecast by customer on sales because, obviously, that's confidential to them and those things vary quarter-to-quarter. But I would just say that we are pleased to see that, it was a lot of hard work by both companies to get them approved. And those will start -- sales will start -- I mean, they're starting now. They are Q2, we're going. So we're off and running on those things which is a good sign.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Mark, you laid out pretty significant Components content increase coming up on Tier 4 Final in one of the appendix slides here, and I don't know that you've used it in the past here. Can you just frame for us the Cummins opportunity on non-Cummins engines, and just help us understand the pace of the transition that you expect in 2014 versus 2015?","Mark Smith","I think -- so the comment on the pace, Jerry -- I don't think I want to talk about so much on the new wins at this point in time. But on the pace, you've got the between 175-horsepower and 750-horsepower engine sizes going to Tier 4 Final next year. And then, quite frankly, the bigger dollar content per engine opportunity for Components, both are important, but also comes 2015, 2016 on the high horsepower engines above the 750-horsepower. So those are going to come in 2 waves, if you like.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, and then we've also got -- Jerry, remember, as I mentioned in my remarks, Euro 6 starting in 2014. So while we can't comment on individual wins until the customer does, because they still reserve the right to talk about their products, what I'd say is that we feel very good about our position with regard to Euro 6 and Tier 4 Final, both for our own products but also for winning business with our Components company on other people's engines. At BAUMA, for example, in Munich, Rich and I were both there, and if you looked around the construction business there, there were Cummins engines in just about every booth, except 1 or 2 obvious ones, that we were all over the show. And the reason is because we have a very good Tier 4 Final solution and people see us as an opportunity to grow business, both in their home market, but also internationally -- as they spread their business internationally. So I think our off-highway engine business -- everything we said about people wanting to partner with us to be able to get the technology and to grow globally, was showing up there at that -- in that show.","Operator","We have another question for you. This one's from the line of Jamie Cook at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Linda Yuan","This is actually Linda Yuan, in for Jamie Cook. Could you go into a little more detail on your end-market outlooks? I know you guys already went into mining, but sort of those other segments like oil and gas, ag, construction?","Mark Smith","Yes, sure. Okay. So construction for the full year, I think, we were fairly flat across all our markets we do expect -- we had a fairly low Q1 in North America following on from our weakish second half, but we do see improvement going forward. But in aggregate, for construction, across the globe, flat full year. Oil and gas is very weak, so we're going to be down, heavy double-digits, still year-over-year. Natural gas prices have improved, but we still need to work through the excess equipment in the market in North America. We are seeing increased orders in China for oil and gas, frac-ing engines, but the volumes there are still relatively low. Which -- and in the mining, ag...","N. Thomas Linebarger","Ag.","Mark Smith","Ag is a relatively small part of our business, very low single-digits, but up -- was up quite, is one of the few segments that was actually up significantly in the first quarter and will be probably up double-digits for the full year, driven by North America and Latin America.","N. Thomas Linebarger","That is one of the questions we get, is, why are we still seeing oil and gas business down with natural gas prices adjusting upwards? And I think, our view is that natural gas prices being up will certainly positively impact the industry; it just hasn't really that much yet. There is still a relatively high number of unused frac rigs out in the market. And crude oil production has gone up; it has not gone up very much. And so those -- we still need gas companies to feel like the price is right, that they want to produce -- put it more out of the ground, and then they need to use up the frac rigs they have. So that's why we still have a relatively conservative view. We do think the higher prices will help; it just isn't going to do it yet and it's going to still take a few more quarters, we think, before there's a move in our demand.","Linda Yuan","Okay, great. And then moving over to Engines. You guys saw a little bit of unfavorable mix this quarter. I mean, going through the rest of the year, how should we kind of expect that mix to trend -- yes, kind of through the rest of the year?","Patrick J. Ward","I don't think the mix is going to change very much, as we go through the rest of the year. I mean, you heard Tom's comments in the mining business. But then I think it's a little bit more pessimistic than what we said 3 months ago. So I wouldn't anticipate much change. The one business that might be a little bit better, but only marginally, is Power Generation. That may pick up a little bit from a mix perspective, more in the second half of the year, I would guess, than the first half of the year. But overall, I don't think we're going to see much change in the mix profile.","Operator","We have another question for you. This one's from Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, so I like the color you guys gave on sequential margins in the quarter, but if you just take the quarter overall, I mean, if I'm doing the math right, it looks like almost 40% decrementals. It's not like you guys, to some extent. And I guess, maybe Pat, was there extra warranty cost that really threw the quarter off? I know R&D was up; what do you expect for that going forward? But is it just -- I can't believe that you kind of expected that result on the margins side. I know you talked about Power Gen being a little weaker than expected, but on the Engine business; that's what I'm focused on.","Patrick J. Ward","I think, Andy, it's exactly what we expected for the company overall. If I go back to -- you obviously don't see the plan we share with the Board, but if I look at our first quarter plan, where we came in both on revenue and profits, it was within a very small range of number, of a difference. So Engine business came in exactly when we thought; we knew the margin was going to be happy, [ph] as well as the [ph] unfavorable mix with mining. They were taking a much higher warranty cost, with the higher accrual rates in the 2013 engines. And for the Engines segment, well, the warranty cost probably was a headwind of 1% relative to what we'd seen in the fourth quarter. So it was not a small number. Distribution came in exactly where we thought it would be. Components, as Tom said, a little bit better, and then the ones -- the one negative, relative to what we were anticipating, is Power Gen. But overall, when you look at it for the company, it was pretty much in line with what we'd expected.","N. Thomas Linebarger","That said, Andy, there's no question that your point about decrementals is right, that it's not what we're aiming for. I think that Pat's talked a lot about what our goals with regard to decremental and incremental margins are, and this is definitely higher. So this is not the kind of quarter we're aiming for and we -- while we knew it going in, it was a difficult quarter. And then some of the things that we saw that we didn't expect until the very end were as much activity on prebuy in the midrange segment. And then the mining segment, while we knew it by the fourth quarter, as Pat said, it dropped really quick, it dropped really significantly in our High Horsepower Business. So we had to adjust very quickly. So I think that once you take the trend over a couple of quarters, I think you'll see the decrementals in line with the way that we think about it. So just in terms of averaging the numbers, Q1 was not great on decrementals, not where we want to be. But if you take it over a couple of quarters, our view is that you'll look back at us and say, \"Yes, that's the decrementals that they're looking for\" and then you'll see the same thing on the incrementals. But just in terms of timing, seasonality, prebuys, a whole bunch of stuff hit this quarter that made it sting more than we would expect normally.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Tom, is it fair to say that by March, a lot these things that were stinging stopped stinging whereas that they were really bad in January? Is that what you're trying to say?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, not to carry the insect analogy too far, yes. I would say that they were stinging less. But no, you're definitely right. So we -- the reason we have confidence in our forward estimates is that we saw improvement month over month, whereas we began to pick up orders some. Again, they weren't gigantic increases, but they were enough. We were starting the -- the negative adjustments got through the system. We started to see improvements as we went January, February, March, and by time we left March, and now as we look into April, we're already seeing improvements that make us confident that we'll get the kind of incrementals that we're looking for, as volumes increase. There are uncertainties out there. I don\u2019t mean to overstate the position; I talked about some of my markets [ph]. There are uncertainties in markets. But assuming we get the sales that we got in here, our view is that we can make the margins based on what we've already seen this year.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Tom, a related question comes up then. How is this really different from last year? I mean, last year, we had a strong North America that sort of dissolved as the year went on, and we were expecting an improvement in emerging markets that didn't happen. This year, we're starting out weak again. And you're kind of expecting the whole business to rebound over time. I mean, I appreciate your comments very much on January through April. Is that what gives you more confidence in the rest of the year, or something else?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, there's some pretty different -- big differences. For one thing, the first half of last year, remember, North America was good, and what we saw with the fall; this first quarter, North America was not good. And what we're seeing that's different is that after several quarters of producing at less than demand, we are now seeing them begin to increase order rates. Right? So we've already -- as Rich mentioned, we've already seen increases in order rates. It's a little bit different. We're not -- and the second thing, I guess, I'd highlight as a major difference, is, we were expecting improvements in the emerging markets and we didn't see them. This year, we are not improving -- expecting improvements in the emerging markets. So there's really none of that built into the forecast. What we've got built in the forecast from a sales point of view is seasonal improvements, this thing I talked about with North America, the basic kind of things that just because Q1, they did a prebuy and now they're just going to go back to regular order rates. So no heroic improvements in demand. And then just getting back to our normal orders and shipment rates that fit that demand, that's all we're really expecting to do here. So there's really nothing, no heroic assumptions anywhere. And I would say that, again, if something drops off dramatically like it happened in the second half of the year last year, then that would make things worse. And we just don't expect that. We just don't see, given our conservative forecast in markets, that there's something that's going to drop off a bunch more. As -- you heard Rich's forecast for North America; it's not aggressive.","Operator","We have another question for you. This one's from David Raso at ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Not to belabor the margin issue, but I think, by far, it's the major issue here with the release. So we're just trying to better understand it. The rest of the year guidance implies basically 100% incremental margin. $117 million of sales gain year-over-year; you need $128 million of EBIT gain year-over-year. Right? So we have to see a big reversal on how the margins just played out. So this first quarter, the revenue decline year-over-year, isn't much different than what we saw in the fourth quarter and third quarter. And since then, we have laid off 2% to 3% of the headcount, I assume some other cost actions, and maybe, the warranty maybe was bigger, but -- and I appreciate the mix comment, but I'm still trying to appreciate, why are the decrementals this much worse after some cost actions, and then the next 3 quarters, I have to look at an incremental margin -- which, I know it's a low number, 1% revenue growth. So it's possible when the revenue growth is that low. But obviously, 100% incremental is not a walk in the park. So can you help us better understand what happened and why the incrementals would be so positive the rest of the year?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, so David, let me take a shot at that. When we look at the incremental margins going forward, and if you look at it from a first quarter baseline, the numbers that take us to the midpoint of our guidance are closer to 35% to 40%. So you can talk to Mark afterwards about the calculation. But we've allotted that type of incremental margin improvement before. And as I see the Engine business picking up as we go through the first quarter, I'm pretty confident that, that trajectory is going to continue to play out. The fact that the decrementals in Q1 were as steep as what they were -- I apologize because we're repeating ourselves here, but really, the negative mix impact, the Engine business, in particular, suffered from the lower High Horsepower volumes; it was a very significant headwind. In addition, we had the higher warranty costs that we tried to talk about in our last call and explained that the impact of those. So there wasn't anything else in there. There was a couple of oneoffs in the Power Generation business that helped them in the first quarter. But the key drivers for that decremental was the lower volumes, the unfavorable mix and the higher warranty costs, all of which we expected as we came into the quarter.","N. Thomas Linebarger","I would just add, David, we did see the improvements in SG&A from the reductions we made in Q4. And on the other hand, we did stay the course on our R&D spending. That was something we decided strategically to do, was to continue to invest in our new products and make sure that we were ready -- while other people may be hesitating, we're going to continue to release new products so that as markets improve, we position ourselves for growth. That was obviously a decision we made that we could have made differently, but we decided that was the thing to do. And as a result, we have a lot of new products coming out and we will have again next year, and that, I think, positions as well for growth. So those were decisions we made that, of course, impacted quarter results. But I think they were the right ones for the company, long run.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I mean, is there a price cost change? Because Pat, I mean, you can talk sequentially, but I'm looking at it properly, year-over-year, first quarter down 40. The mix in the fourth quarter, we already had mining down, oil and gas down, and then since then, we've taken some costs out. At least, that was the way it was presented in October; about 1,000 and 1,500 heads coming out. So again, I'm just trying to gain comfort. Is there something about heavy -- High Horsepower that you already have in order book, that's notably improving on the High Horsepower to make it clear the mix snaps back?","Mark Smith","No.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It is 100% incremental year-over-year in the math for the rest of the year. I'm just trying to understand, I mean, obviously, the revenues were generally in line with what people thought. It was similar to declines in the last 2 quarters. It's all about the margin.","Mark Smith","Right. So we are not expecting a snap back in mix. The mining drop was much more significant in the fourth quarter -- first quarter year-over-year that it was in the first quarter, significantly.","N. Thomas Linebarger","More in the first than the fourth.","Mark Smith","More in the first than the fourth. Sorry. So that was that. We're not really, other than we expect seasonal improvement in High Horsepower demand from the Power Gen business to the Engine business going forward, that's really the only improvement in High Horsepower going forward. And again, as Pat said, if you start from the Q1 base and look at what we need to deliver from that base, which we accept has got some costs in there that we wouldn't expect to see on a run-rate basis, we're talking in the 30% to 40% of incrementals going forward from where we are, and we feel comfortable with that.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And just one clarification, the tax rate, before it was 26%. Do you remember correctly that, that did not include the tax benefit in the first quarter?","Patrick J. Ward","That is correct. The 26% did not include the discrete item, the R&D tax credit that related to 2012, that we did book in the first quarter.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And the 29.5% also doesn't include the tax help?","Patrick J. Ward","29.5% is the operational rate for the full year, excluding discrete tax items.","Operator","We have another question for you. This one's from Ann Duignan at JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can we take a step back and talk a little bit about your outlook for market share for the heavy-duty business? It was very obvious at the Mid-America Truck Show that you and Eaton joining forces to deliver new products is more of a defensive move to react to the Price, Lenner and Volvo [ph] offerings of their own drivetrain. Should we think about the 40% market share as being the ultimate potential for this business? Should we expect market share to decline somewhat as we move forward?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Obviously, it's going to be our goal for it not to decline. And so we -- the dynamics of the heavy-duty truck business and Engine sourcing really haven't changed in quite a while. We are now kind of the only independent engine company in -- at least in these developed country markets, and what we're trying to do is make sure that we offer technologies and systems that make customers think that partnering with us, in addition to making their own, makes more sense for them and gives them more technology they can use to sell value to customers. So that remains our strategy. And they -- our customers remain focused on ensuring that they have technology that they need and that they don\u2019t depend just on one supplier. That hasn't changed either. And all of our customers are thinking about what technologies they want to own and what technologies they want to buy. So we have very open and frank discussions with them about that. So what that means, as far as final market share, I think depends on which players make which decisions in there. But we've talked about this before. Our market share is not our #1 measure of success. We want to make sure we have profitable and profitable growth in the heavy-duty business, and that's what we're aiming for. We think our market share reflects the fact that today, we can still offer technologies that even though our customers make their own engines, they think that our technologies help them sell more trucks to customers. And again, I don't mean to get overly philosophical on you, I just mean, it's really hard to say that there's a peak or a valley or whatever, in market share. It just depends on how well we continue to do that.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, that's a fair point, and it's good to hear that market share is not the ultimate goal. Switching gears a little bit onto natural gas. Could you give us an update on the 12-liter engine and where we are with that? Are you taking orders for that already, or is that for later in the year?","Patrick J. Ward","Let me let Rich update you because, obviously, there's been quite a bit going on in that this year.","Richard J. Freeland","Okay, so no, we are taking orders. Okay? Beginning in April. So we've offered [ph] some ratings. And then we'll continue, we'll offer some higher horsepower ratings later in the year, kind of in the August, September, October range. So we're right on track with what we said, with the April introduction.","Patrick J. Ward","That-- and that's a big deal because, of course, as more customers want to explore options of using natural gas and we really were limited to a 9-liter and that engine just isn't big enough for some of the applications people want to try it on. So the 12-liter really gives customers a chance to try it in a broader range of applications. And since there's so much interest in natural gas, it's just the right product at the right time, in our opinion.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, and the final question, just a quick follow-up on that. If the 12-liter and the 15-liter are highly successful, then what's the impact on the aftertreatment business, since for spark ignition you don't need aftertreatment?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, it would obviously be -- push aftertreatment demand down. So from our point of view, this is, of course always -- when we -- we have a range of technologies in the power technologies we're looking at, so -- and using all over the world, and the impact of using one over another definitely -- there is cross impact on the companies. There's no question that if we -- if natural gas grows, then the need for FCR on those engines isn't there. So that demand would go down for those products. Now again, the good news for us is we sell a lot of -- we're pretty high market share in natural gas engines. So the trade-off looks okay to us, so far. But we're always looking at technologies that are going to add value to engines systems and component systems. So we do a bunch of work on the component systems and natural gas, too, not just FCR.","Operator","And we have another question from -- sorry, this one's from Tim Denoyer at Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Not to beat the Engine segment margin too much, but a couple of other components if you could just give us a little bit more color on sort of how that goes through the year. I mean, did you see the full impact of the price increases in the first quarter? And you've talked about warranty costs coming down through the quarter; I think you said there was 1 percentage point increase in warranty costs from 1Q -- in 1Q from 4Q. Can you give us a sense of how that might ramp down through the year? And I guess, the same kind of question on raw materials. Are you expecting a bigger benefit through the year?","Richard J. Freeland","Okay. Yes, I'll take a shot at that. So a few things going on. So we do see the volumes going up. To hit our midpoint, we need to be in that 35% to 40% incremental margins, which is a place we've been before and feel very confident we can get there. There's a few pieces of it. One is, as the volumes come up, we -- January was a pretty bad month for us. So we saw some really low demand in many of our plants. So we will get the incremental there. We are going to see warranty going down in the range of 0.5 point. As you know, we set warranty on our new products at a higher rate, and then as we demonstrate that the products are doing well, we take our rates down. So we will see warranty coming down through the years, sequentially. We are seeing and driving increased supply chain improvements, which is a key piece of our action, which is logistics cost, but also on material costs. So we're having success on driving material cost down. So it's kind of the combination of normal incremental margins, warranty down, some material cost down, and then not continuation of some the, really, the January issues that we had, gets us in that -- which is a place we've been before, in that 30.5% to 40%.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes, sure. And then, just as a follow-up. On Brazil, you've got a few -- there are a few truck OEMs building plants down there, at the moment, you have good relationships with. Can you give any sense of R&D activity, and is there any market share pickup in Brazil baked into your guidance for this year? I think they are [ph] potentially opening these plants, the 3 of them later this year?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, we don't expect a big impact this year, Tim. I think -- but we have a lot of activity going on in this. I think this is just an extension of our strategy that said, \"Hey, we can use our global position and partnerships around the world to help our customers grow in the markets they want to grow into.\" I think Brazil is a perfect example of that. So there's a number of OEMs going into Brazil who -- who are trying to be part of the growth of that market, and who can use Cummins engines, both because we have leadership position at market, we have a strong brand name, and we have service operations there to help support them. So we are very active doing application work and other kinds of work with customers and potential customers in Brazil. But I think although some will open, there aren't going to be significant volumes this year. And some of them, I think, it will take them -- even after they theoretically open, production won't begin for some time. So I think there may be some impact next year, but it's probably a year or 2 before we see significant volumes for most of those new players coming in.","Operator","The question is from Rob Wertheimer of Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just one quick question on R&D. Was it any heavier than expected in the quarter or different seasonality this year? And this, just generally, Power Gen's been on a multi-decade uptrend. I'm just curious if you can explain any more needed [ph] on geography, whether it's credit-related, the general weakness, prime power versus back up. Just any more color on that market?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. Nothing really unusual in R&D. The only thing that kind of influences quarter-to-quarter swings are if we are buying significant prototypes in major programs, and there is a little movement each quarter and we had less of it in Q4 and more of it in Q1, and that's just -- but that's normal and what we expected. With regard to Power Gen, the geography I'd give you is that, generally speaking, our developing country markets which have been growing infrastructure at a pretty high rate have clearly slowed down in the last couple of years. So places like China and India, infrastructure development have slowed down. India, we still see power shortages, which have held up the market, but the rate of growth has definitely slowed as the infrastructure slowed. And I think as those markets begin to pick up again, we'll see demand increase. And those are -- think of those -- that product primarily as prime power or at least part-time usage; it's not standby. And then generally weak economies across the world have driven down non-res capital spending now in most markets. Of course, that's significantly true in Europe, but it's also been true in the U.S. now for several years, and low non-res capital means low standby markets. So really the only places where we've seen improvements in power generation have been data centers, where we continue to see activity there, and then kind of spot issues. Power shortages and other kinds of things, where there's just these chronic shortfalls in power, we have seen -- continued to see strong markets. But the basic trends on both the developing country infrastructure, which require more grid support or companies needing generators to run their factories when the grid ground's [ph] out, or just basic standby markets, have been down now in a slump for a couple of years, and that's what you've seen, which -- in revenues and Power Gen.","Mark Smith","Thank you very much, everyone.

Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland.

Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of the number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties are available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. A copy of our press release and financial statements and today's website presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","With that over the way and I\u2019ll now pass it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I will start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2015. Pat will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. ","Revenues for the fourth quarter were $5.1 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Fourth quarter EBIT was $661 million or 13% of sales excluding one-time items compared to $566 million or 12.3% of sales a year ago. For the full year Cummins sales were $19.2 billion up 11% year-over-year. Our full year EBIT margin was 13.2% in 2014 excluding one-time items, an increase from 12.5% in 2013. Incremental EBIT margins were 19%. The components and distribution businesses delivered record revenues and earnings in 2014 and the performance of the engine business also improved. ","There were two areas in which we performed below our own expectations; first profitability in the power generation business did not improve in 2014 as we expected which was disappointing. We have taken further options to lower cost including exiting alternative operations in Germany and combining two global lines of business to improve efficiency and reduce cost. EBIT margins in the power generation business are expected to improve from 6.9% in 2014 excluding one-time cost to between 8% and 9% in 2015 assuming no revenue. ","Second quality cost as we've been talking about throughout the year in the engine business exceeded our expectations in the first half of 2014 and resulted in full year warranty cost increasing by 0.5% as a percent of sales. As you know we've been improving the quality at launch of our new products and reducing quality cost for more than four years, so our expectation for performance in this area are high. ","Beginning in the third quarter we focused significant resources on driving improvements in product quality and customer service operations both to improve product performance and to ensure that our customers were not impacted. Our products were performing extremely well even in the eyes of our most demanding customers and we expect that quality related cost will be lower in 2015. This will remain an area of high focus for us this year. ","Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2014 starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 20% in 2014 with approximately 6% of the growth coming from acquisitions in our distribution business. The North American heavy duty truck market reached approximately 268,000 units in 2014 an increase of 23% from 2013 levels. Our full year market share was 36%. The medium-duty truck market size was approximately 127,000 units in 2014, up from 13%, excuse me up 13%. We strengthened our position as the market leader in the medium-duty truck engines market in 2014 with our market share increasing to 72%. Shipments to Chrysler increased by 9% in 2014. Also in North America revenues in our Power Generation business decreased by 9% with shipments to the U.S. military down 39%. Sales to our traditional market segments including non-residential construction were flat year-over-year. ","Our international revenues increased by 2% in 2014, with growth in China offsetting weakness in Brazil and India. In Brazil, our revenues decreased 17% due to weakness in the truck market. Industry truck production decreased by 26% as the economy slowed. Revenues in our Power Generation business increased as water shortages reduced hydroelectric power output and increased the need for generator sets. Our performance in China was strong despite weak economic conditions and was one of the highlight for 2014. ","Full year revenues in China including joint-ventures were $3.3 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year reaching record levels. The growth in 2014 was driven primarily by stronger demand for engines and components for on-highway markets as the truck industry began the transition to new NS4 on-highway emission standards. Industry demand for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks in China decreased by 7% for the full year as orders slowed ahead of the broader transition to NS4 compliance. ","The proportion of industry truck products that was NS4 compliant in the fourth quarter of 2014 was estimated to be 45% with some customers increasing to 70% by the end of the year. Our full year engine market share increased from 10% in 2013 to 12% in 2014 and we also experienced strong growth in our components business. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 78% as Foton increased the proportion of its trucks powered by the 2.8 liter and 3.8 liter engines manufactured in our BFCC\u2019s joint venture displacing competitor engines. ","Industry demand for excavators China dropped 20% in 2014, the third consecutive year of decline. The market for power generation equipment in China was flat in 2014, with slower growth in infrastructure and weak power needs reflecting underlying weakness in the Chinese economy. Our revenues increased 4% year-over-year due in part to increased market penetration especially in the telecom sector. ","Full year revenues in India including joint ventures were $1.3 billion flat year-over-year with improving demand in the truck market offsetting continued weakness in power generation. Industry truck production increased 10% to 249,000 units and our market share increased by 5% to 42%. Revenues for our power generation business declined by 23% as market demand remained very weak due to the overall pace of the economy and the impact of a transition to new emission regulations in mid-2014.","Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2015 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are currently forecasting total company revenues to grow between 2% and 4% in 2015, with growth in North America, new products and distributor acquisitions offsetting continued weak international markets and the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The market size for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 29,000 units in 2015, an increase of 8% year-over-year with our market share projected to be stable at approximately 36%. In the medium-duty truck market we expect the market size to be -- to increase by 1% to a 128,000 units and we project our market share to be 67%. ","Shipments to Chrysler are forecast to be flat with 2014. ","In China we expect domestic revenues including joint ventures to increase 15% in 2015, as revenues from new products and emissions related content more than offset continued weak industry demand. We expect the market size for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks in China in 2015 to decline by 6% from 2014 level. Current industry forecast project at 70% of truck production in 2015 will be NS4 compliant up from an estimated 38% in 2014. Despite we anticipate decline in market size we expect our revenues including joint ventures to grow as volumes of our new ISG engine increased and we gained more market share. ","Revenues for our component business will also improve. Demand for our light-duty engine in China is expected to grow by 30% in 2014 despite no growth in the market as Foton continues to use a higher proportion of our engines. We expect industry sales of excavators to decline by a further 9% in 2015. However this will have little impact of our financial performance given the already weak levels of demand. ","In India we expect total revenues including joint ventures to increase 5%. The new government has made infrastructure investment a big priority and we are cautiously optimistic that demand will improve in the second half of 2015. We expect industry truck production to increase 8% to 270,000 units and demand for power generation equipment to increase modestly up to 5% for the year. ","In Brazil we expect truck production for 2015 to decline a further 15%. As you all aware the government backed finance program called tsunami has been an important source of financing for the commercial vehicle market and recently the government tightened [churns] of the program for the second year in a row raising interest rates 400 basis points and limiting loans to 70% of the vehicle price. This will not help truck demand given the already weak state of the economy. ","We will see an increase in volumes of a number of important new products this year. There is a lot of excitement in China surrounding our new ISG heavy duty engine which launched last year with volumes expected to grow throughout 2015 increasing our market share in the largest truck market in the world. Our largest engine the new QSK95 will go into production in 2015. We have already secured customers in power generation, rail and commercial marine markets. In addition you may have seen the Cummins V8 light duty engine featured a new Nissan type pickup truck at Detroit Auto Show and we're looking forward to the production of this vehicle later in the year. ","The benefits from our distributor acquisitions continue to exceed our original estimates as Pat will cover in more detail. We completed seven distributor acquisitions in 2014 with a further three planned for this year and I want to thank all of the employees in our distribution business for their support and ongoing commitment to our customers through the transition. ","Although there are a lot of positives to look forward to in 2015 risk remain, particularly in the global off-highway markets and emerging markets. Weaker infrastructure spending in China and Latin America, declining commodity prices and the transition to new emission standards in developing economies all present risks to off-highway market demand. I am confident that our market position will improve in 2015 as our leadership in tier four final emissions regulations and the introduction of new products will enable us to outgrow weak end markets. ","Our revenue guidance for 2015 assumes that our industrial revenues in the engine business will decline by 4% in 2015, with weak demand expected in global mining and construction markets. Naturally there is concern about the risk from the decline in oil prices. Our direct to engine sales to oil and gas extraction activity currently represents less than 1% of company revenues, and while it's very appropriate to be cautious about the outlook at least in the near-term our volumes should hold up better than the overall market given our advantage in having tier four final products available ahead of our competitors. ","Our commercial marine business also has some exposure to offshore activity and our power generation business supplies power to oil dependent regions such as the Middle East. Our current projection for off-highway engine and power generation revenues already reflect flat or declining revenues in most markets. ","In this environment of uncertain demand particularly outside of North America it's important that we continue to find way to reduce cost and improve productivity in our business while making critical investments in our future. We expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 13.5% to 14% up from 13.2% in 2013 with lower material cost, the benefit of actions in the power generation business and improvements in quality all contributing to margin expansion in 2015. ","In closing I would like to comment on some recent changes to our leadership team. First I want to thank Pamela Carter, our distribution business leader for outstanding contribution to Cummins over the past 18 years. We will miss her leadership and our commitment to our customers, our people and the communities in which we operate. Second I want to congratulate Tony Satterthwaite and Antonio Leitao advancing leadership for the distribution and power generation businesses respectively. I am confident in their new roles they will continue to drive profitable growth in those businesses by ensuring that our customers succeed. ","Thank you for your interest today and now I will turn it over to Pat who will cover our 2014 performance and our 2015 guidance in more detail.","Pat Ward","Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I will start with a review of the full year 2014 financial results before moving on to the fourth quarter performance. All the numbers in comparisons will exclude charges totaling $32 million or $21 million after-tax related to cost reduction activities within the power generation business. ","Full year revenues for the company were $19.2 million up 11% compared to the prior year and a record for the company. The strongest stride of revenue growth in 2014 was driven by strength in North American and highway markets along with the impact of acquisitions in our distribution segment and record revenues in our parts business. The acquisitions within the distribution segment accounted for 3% of the revenue growth. ","North American revenues increased 20% last year and represented 36% of total 2014 revenues and that's up from 32% in 2013. International revenues increased by 2% compared to 2013, the highest sales in China partially offset by weakness in Brazil and in India. Unfavorable currency movements negatively impacted full year sales by 1%. ","While our total sales increased by 11% earnings before interest and taxes increased by 17%. Gross margins of 25.4% was 70 basis points higher than in 2013 with higher volumes, lower material costs and positive mix partially offset by unfavorable currency movements and increased cost related to quality improvements. ","Selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $309 million in the year. The acquisitions in our distribution segment accounted for $94 million of the increase. Joint venture income includes $9 million compared to last year with higher earnings in China partially offset by the impact of the [indiscernible] acquisitions in North America. ","In total, earnings before interest and tax were 13.2% of sales in 2014, up from 12.5% of sales in previous year and this increased to a 19% incremental EBIT margin. Net income was $1.65 billion or $9.02 per share or $9.13 per share excluding the cost associated with the cost reduction actions in the power generation business. This compares to $1.5 billion or $7.91 earnings per share in the previous year. The operating tax rate for the full year was 28.4% with discrete items increasing this to an all run rate of 28.7%. The operating tax rate was lower than the guidance we provided back in October, primarily due to the impact of the research and development tax credit which was passed late in 2014. ","Now let me comment specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance. Revenue of $5.1 billion was 11% higher than the previous year and 4% higher than third quarter levels, representing a record quarter for the company. Acquisitions accounted for 5% growth year-over-year. Compared to the prior year North American revenues were up 22%, due to continued strength in on-highway markets along with the impact of acquisitions in our distribution segment and strong growth in parts. ","International revenues were down 2% due to weak demand in the Brazilian truck market, general weakness in Eastern Europe and Russia which impacted most business segments on from unfavorable currency movements. Compared to the third quarter revenues increased 4% due to acquisitions and stronger demand across all four segments. Gross margins for the quarter were 25.4% of sales and improved 60 basis points year-over-year, with benefits from higher volumes and lower material costs partially offset by unfavorable currency movements and from increased cost relating to quality improvements. ","Sequentially the gross margins declined from the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase in quality costs and from the adverse impact of currency movements. Selling, admin and research and development as a percent of sales increased by 30 basis points compared to the prior year and declined by 30 basis points compared to the third quarter. Joint venture income was $76 million, 5% lower than the prior year and 23% lower than the prior quarter due to the impact of the acquisitions and lower earnings in China. Interest before interest and tax -- earnings before interest and taxes was $661 million or 13% of sales up 70 basis points year-over-year and increased to net financial EBIT margin of 19% compared to fourth quarter of last year. ","EBIT margins were down from third quarter levels as a result of the lower gross margins. Net earnings for the quarter were $444 million of $2.44 per diluted share and $2.56 excluding the charges associated with the cost reduction activities in the power gen segment. The oil and tax rate of 24.2% included a $24 million benefit from the research and development tax credit that was passed late in the year.","Moving on to the operating segments let me highlight their performance during year and in the fourth quarter and conclude with the revenue and profitability expectations for 2015. In the Engine segment fourth quarter revenues were $3.8 billion, an increase of 11% compared to last year and 1% compared to the third quarter. Compared to last year North American on-highway revenues were up 19% driven by strong demand in truck and bus markets. Products revenues were up 18% driven by strong demand in North America. Sequentially revenues increased less than 1% with modest growth in on-highway revenues offsetting the weakness in construction and agriculture markets. ","Segment EBIT margins were 11.1% of sales in the quarter compared to 9.2% last year and 11.7% in the prior quarter. Compared to last year the increased volumes, lower material cost and cost leverage more than offset higher warranty expense. Sequentially the margins were lower by 60 basis points due primarily to lower joint venture income. For the full year revenues were up 9% from a year-ago and earnings before interest and taxes grew 18%, and improved from 10.4% to 11.2% of sales.","In 2015 we expect revenues for the segment to be flat to up 2%. On-highway revenues in North America will improve as industry production grows and heavy-duty truck market and we expect another record year in our parts business. We expect global industrial revenues will be down in 2015 due to lower demand in construction, mining, oil and gas and agriculture markets. Due to the continued weakness in industrial and power generation markets we anticipate high (horse power) [ph] volumes will be down 5% to 10% in 2015. ","2015 EBIT margins are now forecasted to be in the range of 11% to 12% of sales compared to 11.2% of full year 2014. Lower material costs, quality improvements and higher joint venture earnings in China are expected to drive the majority of the EBIT margin improvement. ","The component segment delivered record sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter up 16% over the prior year and 3% from the prior quarter. Compared to last year the higher revenues were driven by increased truck demand in North America along with increased revenues for the after-treatment systems in Europe and China related to the new emission regulations in both regions. Sequentially, higher revenues were primarily driven by increased demand in China due to the new emission regulations. ","EBIT margins for the quarter were 12.1% of sales compared to 12.3% of sales last year and 13.4% in the prior quarter. The decrease in margins over the prior year was driven by unfavorable currency movements and higher warranty cost partially offset by lower material costs. Compared to the prior quarter higher warranty expense and unfavorable currency movements negatively impacted margins. ","2014 was a record year for the components segment in terms of revenues, EBIT dollar and EBIT percent. Revenues were up 18% and EBIT grew [13%] and improved from 12.1% of sales to 13.4%. ","We expect another record year in 2015 with revenues projected to be up 4% to 8% primarily due to stronger demand for all four businesses in the North American heavy duty truck market and growth in China related to the implementation of new emission standards. EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 13.25% to 14.25% of sales which compares to the 13.4% recorded in 2014. ","In the power generation segment fourth quarter sales were $760 million flat compared to the last year and up 1% sequentially. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 weakness in India as well as in Eastern Europe and Russia was partially offset by stronger demand in Africa, Latin America and in the Middle East. Sequentially revenues increased in North America, Latin America and the Middle East and was partially offset by lower demand in China. ","In the fourth quarter we recorded a $32 million charge associated with cost reduction actions. Our actions included reorganizing the power generation business into three lines of business reducing overhead in the process as well as the closure of a large automotive facility in Germany. We expect to realize the full quarterly benefit of these actions beginning in the second quarter of 2015. ","EBIT margins were 7.1% of sales in the quarter compared to 6.1% in the prior year and 8% last quarter. Compared to last year the improvement was due to 30 basis points improvement in gross margins and from the lack of a one-time expense [probably] fourth quarter of 2013 that impacted joint venture earnings. Sequentially lower joint venture income negatively impacted margins by 50 basis points. ","For the full year power gen revenues were down 4% from 2013 levels and EBIT margins dropped from 7.3% to 6.9% of sales. Gross margins did improve by 60 basis points despite the lower sales however this was offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements in particular from the British Pound. ","For 2015 we expect power gen revenues to be flat but down 4%. In the United States [indiscernible] Military revenue will be offset by moderate growth in our base business along with revenue from our [indiscernible] line of gensets. ","International markets remain weak and we anticipate lower oil prices could result in lower demand in several markets. EBIT margins will improve in 2015 to between 8% and 9% of sales and this compares to 6.9% for full year 2014. The increase in margins will be driven primarily by savings related to our previously announced actions and from some currency benefits given the recent depreciation of the British Pound against the U.S dollar. ","For the distribution segment fourth quarter revenues were a record $1.7 billion an increase of 58% compared to last year and 31% sequentially. Acquisitions accounted for 31% of the growth year-over-year. Organic growth of 11% before currency impacts was driven by stronger parts demand in North America and higher demand from oil and gas customers compared to very weak levels a year ago. ","Unfavorable currency movements negatively impacted sales by 360 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to the depreciation of the Canadian and Australian dollar. EBIT was a record $138 million for the fourth quarter an increase of 48% compared to last year and 21% compared to the prior quarter. Margins decreased from 10% of sales last year to 9.3% due to unfavorable currency movements which negatively impacted the margins by 100 basis points and from the dilutive impact on the EBIT percent from the acquisitions. ","For the full year the segment delivered record sales and record profits. Revenues were up 38% and EBIT dollars improved by $103 million of 27%. EBIT as a percent of sales declined from 10.3% to 9.5%. For 2015 we're forecasting revenue growth of between 23% and 27% with the majority of the growth coming from acquisitions. We expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 8% to 9% of sales. ","Based on current exchange rates, currency will negatively impact margins by 90 basis points. We completed seven acquisitions of North American distributors last year which added approximately $0.40 to earnings per share, we will complete an additional three acquisitions this year and expect that the aggregate impact of all the acquisitions will exceed the $1 billion in revenue and $0.50 in earnings per share that we projected at the last Analyst Day for 2015.","Finally let me turn to cash flow, we generated a record $2.3 billion in cash from operating activities last year, which brings to 12% of sales. We continue to use that cash and invest back into the company and to the some volume to our shareholders. We returned 52% of the cash generated from operations to shareholders in 2014, a total $1.2 billion, which represents an increase of 48% over the amount returned in 2013. We increased our dividend by 25% last year and repurchased 4.8 million shares for a [outlay] of $670 million. ","We continue to invest in the business with $743 million in capital expenditure projects and a net $436 million for acquisitions. We also contributed $205 million into our pension plans and they are now fully funded. As Tom mentioned we are projecting total company revenues to be up 2% to 4% in 2015. Growth in on-highway engines and components in the U.S. and China, distributor acquisitions and revenues from new products will drive most of the growth and offset a 3% headwind from currency based on current exposures. ","We expect EBIT margins of 13.5% and 14% for 2015, and this compares to 15.2% for full year 2014. Similar to 2014 the EBIT margins will be at the low point in the first quarter, improvements in gross margins material cost, restructuring and quality improvements coupled with stronger joint venture revenues in China will drive the EBIT margin this year. We are currently projecting the tax rate to be approximately 29.5% this year, excluding any discrete items compared to an operating tax rate of 28.4% in 2014. Our tax rate guidance does not assume that the U.S. research and development tax credit is extended into 2015 which will negatively impact the rate by one percentage point when compared to last year. ","We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2015 will be within a long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million. We expect our cash balance decline this year as execute and distributor acquisitions and we remain committed to returning 50% of operating cash to shareholders in 2015. ","As Tom said, [indiscernible] improve upon we are pleased with the 2014 results, with growth in both revenues and in earnings. We also saw improvement in our return metrics, both return on net assets and return on equity over 2013 levels and we expect further improvement in 2015. ","Now let me turn that back over to Mark. ","Mark Smith","Thanks Pat. And we are now ready to enter in the Q&A session. If you could limit your first input to one question and a related follow-up please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Alexander Potter with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed. ","Alexander Potter ","Hi, guys. I was wondering first if we could touch on EBIT margins in the engine business. Back at the Analyst Day in 2013 I think you expected 12% to 13% EBIT margins by 2015 and then today the guidance is 100 basis points lower than that, on the top-end and bottom-end of the range. So just wondering what do you think the biggest delta now versus back then was presumably ForEx had some impact but I was wondering if you could elaborate?","Tom Linebarger","Let me pick that one of and then maybe Rich will jump-in. When you look at Alex I was talking about was most probably three areas. One, as you mentioned foreign exchange is having a headwind across the company, given the rates on those versus 2013. ","Secondly, we still see weaker demand for high horsepower industrial engines weaker demand in emerging markets, than anticipated back then which is having an impact on margins. ","And then finally as we have talked about, we are working through some quality issues although the [indiscernible] as a percent of sales came down, we are incurring more cost in our manufacturing facilities to make sure we protect customers and that\u2019s one in higher than what we have anticipated back in 2013. So Rich if anything you want to add to that?","Rich Freeland","The only thing I would add Alex is just I will comment a bit on the quality cost. So we talked back then, we have been on the path to reduce quality cost over multiple years, in fact from 2009 to 2013 we took warranty cost down to 180 basis points. And we assumed we are continuing that in 2014. And as we talked in Q2 we had a bit of a setback on that in front of our high dollar cost and we have invested in some litigation efforts and the fact we have seen the working cost comedown a little bit better than what we told you back in Q2, but we are incurring some cost to do that, we've been testing albeit in premium freight and [indiscernible]. So I'll say that the three that Pat outlined are the three, just want to give a little more technical on the quality cost. ","Tom Linebarger","And Alex as you know, this is Tom, China is the story where we are actually are on our estimates from those dates despite the market being pretty weak and especially in infrastructure spending, so unlike the high horsepower story which worsened from our estimates and we had trouble figuring out a way to catch up in China we have been able to get back to our estimates at our Analyst Day despite pretty weak markets. ","Alexander Potter ","Okay. That segways into the next question. I was wondering if you could comment on the ISG. Appreciate the breakout in the release talking about profitability by segment there at the Foton joint venture. I was wondering I guess A your outlook on market share internally at Foton with the ISG and then B the point at which you think that particular segment can start turning a profit? Thanks guys. ","Tom Linebarger","So let me talk at market share at a higher level and then we can offline we can break that down or give you the more detail. But what we said back at Analyst Day is we want to our market share up to 17% kind of from the 10% to 17%. With the ISG we're now -- we will exit that about 12% this year we will get 12% for this year with additional ISG. In fact we will -- our plans call for India in 2015 at 15% market share in this space and that's really on the strength of the ISG. From a profitability standpoint we incurred some pretty high launch cost in Q4 and so we move into profitability in 2015 immediately on that price, so you will see the improvement there and that's reflected in our guidance. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. ","Jerry Revich ","I am wondering if you could take about now that we have seen greater enforcement on NS4 standards in China, how much higher is your market share on after treatment, are there non-engines in the country or were you successful in converting all of the stock bonds business and some of your other partners, can you give us some color there?","Pat Ward","Yes, I'll take a shot and Tom can jump in but we've been -- more recently I have -- just on the NS4, we ended the year about 45% and I think you said 38% for the full year on NS4 compliance. It looks -- we're certain now that that grows to 70%, so that growth. From an after treatment standpoint, we'll be at 20% market share in after treatment. Primarily with our joint venture partners both with [indiscernible]. ","Tom Linebarger","But again, you know I think you know that the market for after treatment is still volatile market because although there is stronger enforcement it's still not consistent across the country and it's still kind of developing. So there is still a number of different products out in the market. I think our view is that where our products are making very good progress, our partners are using our products and getting good performance out of them, so it's just going to take some time to settle out for us to have any view really about what stable market share is. Right now we're on to make sure that our products earn the reputation of reliability and durability and performance and that's really important for the long run. It's a huge market and we want to make sure we have a long-term sustainable share in that market. ","Jerry Revich ","Okay and then on currency it sounds like you had a transactional headwind in distribution and components in the quarter, can you just talk about any opportunities to push pricing to offset the transactional headwinds in '15 and any opportunities to switch sourcing at the margin or maybe lean towards one supplier versus another to mitigate the headwind in '15, can you give us some color there please?","Tom Linebarger","Yes I think it is something that we're always looking at to see if we can move the needle on the Jerry, I don't think I would expect anything later to change on our currency profile given the different geographies that we are in [indiscernible]. ","Pat Ward","No, I just think just from a sourcing standpoint while we have -- we've got a broad base of sourcing opportunity as we tend not to chase currency rates around with that but where we see they will stick for some time we do have a case where we do that -- we do some of that. ","Tom Linebarger","I think the simplest way to think about currency for Cummins is that we have -- we built a lot of natural hedges in our business because we manufacture in lots of locations. But places where we have more costs than revenues as you guess would be in the U.S so strong U.S dollar is not ideal for us. That said we use a lot of global sourcing, we sourced products -- materials from all over the world almost no matter where we assemble which helps us on that. The business unit that\u2019s most exposed to currency is distribution business because we have revenues and profits in all of these countries and so we get translation hits as they come back to the U.S we translate them into U.S dollars and those are hard things to figure out and naturally hedge too. And frankly as Rich said by the time you figure it out it will be switched to something else. That said in our core business we're always looking for ways to build natural hedges and we've been really successful on that and we're going to continue to do that in our sourcing side. ","Pat Ward","And just a little bit more color on that. For the full year 2014 the currency movements negatively impacted sales by $174 million, so 1% in EBIT by just over $30 million. So when you look at as a percentage of sales that moved the EBIT from [\u201913 3 to \u201913 2], and as Tom just said the more significant impact was in distribution. So their EBIT margins not by but 1% because of currency\u00a0but overall for the company, we do have a profile that helps us simply more than just some other companies do when it comes managing us. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Please proceed. ","Ann Duignan ","Hi, good morning guys this is Ann Dulgan here. I just wanted to follow-up on the distribution business. You talked about your exposure, direct exposure engines to oil and gas. Can you talk about your distribution\u2019s exposure to oil and gas?","Tom Linebarger","We have distributors -- of course our distributors in Texas and we have distributors in the Middle East and when we were talking -- in my remarks I was talking about how we have power gen sales in regions which are impacted by oil and gas. And I think all those regions will be impacted. So the distributor will be impacted of course by the sales of oil and gas equipment which you know about but we kind of figured that\u2019s fits in that kind of less than 1% of sales idea. But the general business conditions in those regions will likely be negatively affected. And we don\u2019t have a quantification for that per se, but every one of those distributors within one of those regions has the potential for being more broadly affected just because business activity goes down. ","So we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to be, but we think it will be limited to those regions and we think it will be -- we will see what it is when we get there. Again so we are not trying to make this exposure seem less, we just don\u2019t have those direct sales but there is a lot of indirect things and that\u2019s why we were pretty conservative in our view about where high risk our engines sales are going as well as where large power generation equipment is going. ","Pat Ward","Couple of comments, so first of all of course distribution half the revenues are in aftermarket. Needless to say in mining which has been very heavily negative on the engine side in our aftermarket sales are being flat or even for the last three years so we'd expect the impact there on distributors to be less than any impact on engines. And as Tom said in his remarks at least for now we are better positioned for tier 4 final of course not just oil and gas but in some of the segments. So we think we can hold it relatively well. ","Ann Duignan ","Okay, I appreciate the color. On the quality cost, can you just give us a little bit more color it's so uncharacteristic of Cummins to be talking about warranty issues or premium freight or increased testing. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what exactly is going on there? Which region? Which segment? Is it isolated? Is it across the board? Just so we understand what exactly is going on. ","Tom Linebarger","As I said in my remarks, we have just been driving a much stronger expectation for how we are going to launch products. I think I mentioned in one of our previous calls, we are launching north of 70 new and improved products a year now. So our company on a global basis, we are basically in a new product introduction business. And that\u2019s the way our customers can get ahead of their competitors is because they have new and improved products to go against them with. And so what we tried to build over the last decade is this new product introduction machine where we can launch new products that come out at quality levels that are better as good or better than the ones that they are replacing, which if you go back to the 90s was not our history, and so that\u2019s the activity that I have been talking about.","And what we had is a bunch of new product introductions in recent years that especially related to onboard diagnostics and things like that. Our launch rate was not as good as the one and as Rich said in his comments it wasn\u2019t that we had more failures, it's that our failures were more expensive and more complicated. And so we just wanted to make sure that we invested in resolving the issues quickly which we always do, but also making sure customers had no impact so that\u2019s making to our customer service operations are on the spot right away, we make sure customers have no impact. Again a lot of other companies had issues with onboard diagnostics and other things too, we just want to make sure we did better than anybody else. So we want to invest extra attention in making sure customers impacts were low and then also just get all the product issues resolved. ","So if investments across the board there to make sure that the impact is limited. And again that\u2019s the kind of thing where with increased focus, we expect to have lower and lower large quality costs as we go through as a company, and that\u2019s where we want to be world-class as the new product introduction leader. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Pease proceed. ","Jamie Cook ","Just to follow-up on Ann\u2019s question and then I have a separate question. Can you quantify what the cost of 60s quality issues, what it is in 2015 or what it was relative to your expectations so we can get a sense for what the incremental spend is and also how we think about warranty year-over-year and then just quantify. And then I guess my second question is can you just comment on the order trends that we have seen in heavy duty truck over the past couple of months in October. I think in November they were really weighted towards 1OE in particular. Can you talk -- I know what you said with your market share opportunities but can you talk about one, why those orders were abnormally high. Do you think market share for the OE sort of normalizes throughout the year and does the strength I guess also in the orders that you have seen make you view I guess the truck build forecast for '15 is there more upside or did the orders I guess that we've seen recently pull from the latter part of the year? Sorry there were a lot of questions in there. ","Tom Linebarger","Yes. I will let Rich do the order board release and just on the quality side I will just say Jamie in terms of quantification I mentioned the 0.5% increase in the year for the engine business and again how we have been trying to bring it down. I don't want to -- I am not going to give more quantification of all that. I did -- we did talk about as Pat said in his remarks that there was impacting gross margins so there is a lot of areas we're investing in. We also said we expect as we go through 2015 to see improvements in those areas. ","Jamie Cook ","But you won't quantify what the improvement is '15 versus '14 I guess that's what I am trying to figure out?","Tom Linebarger","Well we did. That's within our margin guidance. ","Jamie Cook ","Okay but not a number just that that helps margins?","Tom Linebarger","Right. ","Jamie Cook ","Okay. ","Rich Freeland","Okay. There were a lot of question in there Jamie -- on the South America truck but let me take a shot at it if I have missed a piece of it I will follow-up. Just on the -- I'll start with the market size which I don't think we have a view different than anyone else and so all the things we look at around freight activity, to that question kind of multiyear highs, used truck prices are up if you look at 10% in 2014. And then the orders remain high even in January with 35,000 plus old truck orders the backlogs are strong with the OEs, this lower oil price is lower, diesel price I think helps carrier's profitability. So most of the signs look pretty good on the overall market, so are we too conservative or too aggressive we have got an update for share and that feels about right kind of the balance is our scenario better or worse yes there is but that's what we've assumed. ","On the market share we're projecting 36% going forward and we came in and that looks solved, if you look at our placement at OEs it's about where we thought it would be, okay and yet we missed a little bit in 2014 we thought it would be a 37 and I think two things happened there -- they are not big it added up to 1% they are not a change but our share is high at NAV, right at 75% and their share is down below what they would have expected and that's public information, so a little bit lower there that cost us. And then while it's not a big number we had assumed natural gas growing to 3% of the market and that didn't happen and that's worth about 1.5 points of share being at 1% and those two at 3% given that we have 100% share in natural gas. ","So we didn't a sea change in market shares by OEs, we don't see a big change in what our share is with those OEs it's about where we thought it would be. And so and I wouldn't read too much into any one month as you know there is lots of variation kind of month to month. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Andrew Casey","A question on the implied incremental EBIT margins and the guidance, if I am doing the math right it looks like they are about 30% to 35% despite a 10% drop in JV income and then your comments about the weak high horsepower demand. Given you touched on the lower warranty expense on the power gen restructuring benefit, is there anything else that you want us to consider when we look at those incremental margins?","Pat Ward","Yes Andrew this is Pat one of the important items to keep in mind is material cost. So in 2014 material cost benefited on margins by just over 1%, sales we're expecting it somewhat similar to that and maybe slightly below but certainly close to a 1% improvement in gross margins as it fell to the bottom-line in 2015. So we take material cost, the power gen restructuring, the quality cost that Tom was just talking about. We will have more joint venture income, we will have some lower other income as we've been picking some one-time gains this year on distribution acquisitions all that kind of gets us into that guidance range of 13.5% to 14% or relatively modest revenue growth. ","Andrew Casey","And then just kind of going back to the topic of the day the weaker oil prices, given your distribution breadth can you comment on whether you are seeing any project delays or cancellations on U.S or elsewhere and if so can you kind of give us some regional detail?","Tom Linebarger","I think in North America right now and we haven't seen any cancellations -- again we saw new emission compliant products out in the market so for those products, we can say zero cancellations because it's appropriate to be concerned but that being zero. I think more broadly power gen some concerns about what\u2019s going to happen in the Middle East is one area, but no big rush of cancellations or big changes in trajectory yet.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Ross Gilardi ","First I just had a question on components, when you are baking in a lot of deceleration on a top-line in the components and how much of that is FX and are you actually seeing that deceleration in your order book now or is that an attempt at conservatism?","Tom Linebarger","I think firstly obviously whilst North America continues to grow its Class A bills and so is been growing at the same rate as we saw 2014 versus \u201913. Medium-duty North America is also this can actually going to be a relatively flat. And those are the areas where we are at. Today we have the highest revenue. Offsetting that will be growth in China so a significant growth in China and I think Brazil is another area we are forecasting another 16% decline in Brazil. So you combine those with a little bit of currency that\u2019s how you getting arranged with. ","Pat Ward","And just to help you Ross in currency question. In the fourth quarter of Q4 to Q4 the currency impact on component revenues was about 1.5% to sales. And as we look at 2015 its going to be closer to 3% for this segment. ","Tom Linebarger","The U.S. and China will be the biggest top-line growth. ","Ross Gilardi ","I understand all the components you forecast, but I am just asking are you actually seeing this type of deceleration in your orders now or is it just a more of a forecast on what these different regions will do?","Tom Linebarger","Only in Brazil. ","Ross Gilardi ","Only in Brazil you are a seeing a deceleration?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. ","Ross Gilardi ","Okay. And then...","Tom Linebarger","I think in North America, up in China up also, Brazil [indiscernible]. ","Ross Gilardi ","Okay, and then for engines I was just wondering if you can comment on sort of just broadly medium-duty versus heavy-duty I mean you have got a pretty tepid outlook for North American medium-duty up only 1%. And sort of in your mind when you look at all of the drivers of medium versus heavy what do you think is accounts for the biggest difference and heavy being so much stronger than medium over the last year and it looks like into 2015 as well. ","Tom Linebarger","I think just a little different place in the cycle where we are in that. So if a medium-duty gets -- tends to have less variation and less peaks and valleys in the cycle. So it\u2019s been a little steadier on that. So I think it\u2019s more just where we are in the cycle is what I am looking at here.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Please proceed. ","Joel Tiss ","I just had from some more like small questions. I just wondered why when sort of this new burst of cost cutting or whatever maybe it's not new but when you look at 2014 the SG&A was 15 inventories are up 20% and the accounts receivable up 11. So if we're going into this kind of slower growth environment especially on the inventory side, what\u2019s going on there?","Tom Linebarger","Yeah Joe it is a great question, as you guessed, we spent a fair bit of time talking about those things ourselves. So let me just start with the inventory side, the mix of business is definitely changing as we acquire distributors we definitely acquire more inventory. So essentially our chain lengthened is that to think of it. We are now have inventory one step closer to customers. Now if you look at the total asset intensity it\u2019s got less capital and it looks fine, but from an inventory point of view there is definitely more inventory in the system and that\u2019s affecting working capital ratios a bit. And also when we talk in our analyst meeting we will try to update our working capital stats which are changing a little bit and it\u2019s not a dramatic change but it\u2019s a little bit of a change with more distributors in there. ","But still we could do better on inventories there is no question about it and one of that challenges is when we operate our plants in especially the high horsepower area at very low utilization and then people are dropping in orders and you are taking whatever you can get, your inventory turns suffer and so that\u2019s -- I talked on many times on this call about how important it is for your operations to be able to adjust up and down to variation revenue and this is the kind of thing where if we are doing the best in the industry responding we can do little bit better on those ratios so we are very focused on. ","On the SAR side that\u2019s another area of really big importance for us. We have to keep our cost down and they are growing as you quite rightly noted. And we are trying to balance between how do we make sure we will remain a technology leader and relevant in launching new products so that we can continue to partner with people and that they feel the need to use our engines and use our generators and components and that's a big investment and we're doing it globally now and we got to make sure we have systems and infrastructure to support that on the other hand we got to keep our cost under control. So we're striking that balance it's one of the things our management team spends the most attention on. And as you heard from us in these remarks we're striking the balance a little differently in the power gen business than we did two years ago. And we made one change last year and we will make another change this year to strike that balance little differently. And those decisions are tough to make but they need to be made in order to make sure we can continue to grow profitability. ","Pat Ward","Let me just come back to the working capital, we spend a lot of time looking at working capital Joe we focus on the [indiscernible] as you know and if you look at the growth in inventory you are right it's been up by $450 million year-over-year with vast majority of it, $360 million was through acquisitions. So we acquired all that inventories build -- we have not had the full benefit of actually being able to trigger inventory and to sales, when you look at inventory turns, but I actually [indiscernible] last year probably the [indiscernible] which we expect it for the reasons Tom gave that from 5.4 times down to 5.3. And when I look at working capital as a percentage of sales we have gone from 18.9% fourth quarter of last year to 19.3%, so I think we're actually doing quite well monitoring that but of course we always can do better. ","Tom Linebarger","We could do better. ","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim [indiscernible] with Citigroup. Please proceed. ","Unidentified Analyst","Just on the -- you talked earlier about the raw material cost and the benefits there, can you just update us on what we should be thinking about from a pricing perspective obviously you have got outlining pretty tough conditions for high horsepower and then power gen being down contrasting with higher North America on highway which just you put all the things together it's not the best setup from in terms of your ability to get pricing. So how should we be thinking about price overall in 2015?","Pat Ward","You're exactly right, from the way you just described it, we're not assuming any overall benefit from pricing in our guidance for 2015 for the reasons you just gave. ","Tom Linebarger","And Tim you didn't ask the question but I am sure people will wonder about it, are we seeing broad discounting in power gen things like that and we are not. There still are -- there are places where we see it in system starts but broadly it's still not broad and there is not a consistent move on pricing which is good, and we hope that remains and so that's why we think we can maintain the spot price environment in the year.

Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter results and finished with a discussion of our outlook for 2019. Mark will then take you through more details of our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year.","Revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were a record $6.2 billion, an increase of 1% compared to the second quarter of 2018. EBITDA was a record $1.1 billion, or 17%, compared to $897 million, or 14.6%, a year ago.","Lower campaign costs, positive pricing and lower material costs more than offset our increased investments in research and engineering, the impact of tariffs and lower joint venture income in China.","Engine business revenues were flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago. Revenues in North America, increased by 7%, driven by higher industry production of heavy and medium duty trucks, as well as continued strong demand in construction markets.","International revenues declined by 15%, primarily as a result of lower demand in Chinese light duty truck and construction markets. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 15.4%, compared to 13.4% for the same period in 2018.","Lower campaign costs, improved pricing and lower material costs more than offset lower joint venture income increased investment in research and engineering, and the negative impact of tariffs. Sales for our distribution segment grew by 2% year-over-year, driven by higher demand for power generation equipment in North America.","Second quarter EBITDA was a record $172 million or 8.5% of sales, compared to 7.3% in the second quarter 2018. EBITDA margins benefited from higher volumes and positive pricing.","The second quarter revenues for the component segment declined by 2%. Sales in North America increased 5%, driven by higher truck build rates, while revenues in international markets declined by 12%, as a result of lower truck demand in Europe, China and India. EBITDA for the second quarter was $297 million, or 16.1%, compared to 12.6% in the same quarter a year ago.","The increase in EBITDA margins was primarily due to lower campaign costs, and the benefit of material cost reduction programs, which more than offset increased development and increase investment in the development of new products, aimed at emission standards in China and India.","We are currently selling a limited number of national standard six products for specific urban applications in China, such as sanitation vehicles and will ramp up production in 2020, and again in 2021, when all medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles are scheduled to comply with NS6 standards.","In India, we will begin producing new products later this year, as we prepare for a transition to the broad stage 6 standard in April 2020.","Power system sales in the second quarter declined by 3%. Demand in industrial markets declined 11% due to lower sales of oil and gas and mining engines, while sales of power generation products were flat.","Power generation sales increased 12% in North America, driven by continued strength in the data center markets offset by 11% decline in International markets, mainly in Europe and the Middle East. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by 2%.","EBITDA in the second quarter was 14.4%, compared to 14.9% a year ago, the decrease in EBITDA was due largely to lower joint venture income in China, where we experienced declined demand for standby generator sets.","In the Electrified Power business, EBITDA was a loss of $33 million in the second quarter, in line with our expectations, as we invest in the development of new products for commercial launch, beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.","Now, I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the second quarter of 2019, starting with North America, and then I'll cover some of our largest International markets.","Our second quarter revenues in North America boost 7% to a record $3.9 billion driven by higher industry build rates of medium and heavy-duty trucks, continued growth in the sales of construction equipment and increased sales of power generation equipment to data center customers.","Industry production of heavy-duty trucks grew 19% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to a year ago, and 4% compared to the first quarter of this year, supported by a strong, but declining industry backlog.","Our market share through June was 35%, compared to 33% a year ago, representing our highest market share in five years, and reflecting the strong performance of our products in the eyes of our customers.","Production of medium duty trucks increased 14% in the second quarter. A growing U.S. economy, coupled with high levels of consumer spending, low unemployment and low interest rates continues to drive demand for medium duty trucks. Our market share in the medium duty truck market was 78% through June, compared to 80% a year ago.","Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 20% compared to a year ago, as we increased production of a new engine for RAM2500 and 3500 pickup trucks. Year-to-date shipments for pickup truck customers have increased 6%. Engine demand for construction equipment in North America increased 10% in the second quarter and remained that historically high levels supported by non-residential construction and infrastructure spending.","Revenues for power generation grew by 12% due to higher demand and data center markets partially offset by lower sales to recreational vehicle OEM. Demand for engines in oil and gas markets declined by 91% due to a sharp reduction in purchases of new fracking equipment.","Our international revenues decreased by 6% in the second quarter of 2019, compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.5 billion, an increase of 3% over the prior year. Higher power generation equipment sales to datacenter customers and engine sales to oil and gas markets were partially offset by lower demand and on Highway in construction markets.","Industry demand from medium and heavy-duty trucks and China decreased by 9% compared to a year ago, even though the market was positively impacted by a pre-buy of natural gas engines ahead of the move to NS6 standards in July. We estimate that the impact of this pre-buy was approximately 20,000 units, increasing market size by 5% in the quarter, our market share improved to 12.8% this quarter from 10.9% a year ago, as we increased our share at full-time.","We expect further improvement in our market share in subsequent quarters due to further share expansion at our OEM, and a shift in the market towards over the road trucks versus construction related dump trucks.","Industry sales of light duty trucks declined by 9% in the second quarter, and our engine market share was 8%, which is 1% higher than a year ago. This increase was driven by our new joint venture with JAC, which launched in late 2018.","In the second quarter, the light duty market was impacted by increased enforcement of loading regulations, significantly reducing both second quarter industry demand and our projections for the remainder of the year.","Some truck model has historically been registered as light duty trucks are now to be classified as medium duty trucks, which limits access to urban areas and requires additional licensing for drivers.","Second quarter demand for excavators in China increased 4% from a year ago. Our market share increased from 15.3% to 15.6%, driven by the strong performance of our local partners. Demand for power generation equipment was down 3% in the second quarter, with lower demand for standby power, partially offset by growth in data center markets.","Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures was $516 million, a reduction of 1% from the second quarter a year ago with lower industry truck production and the impact of a week a rupee partially offset by increased demand for power generation equipment.","Industry truck sales decreased 21% year-over-year in line with our expectations with lower demand driven by the timing of elections, as well as challenges in the truck financing industry.","Within the truck market, we saw more severe decline in heavy duty applications where we have the highest share.","Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We now expect company revenues to be flat for the year, which is at the low end of our prior guidance range. We're maintaining our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America at 300,000 units, up 5% compared to 2018.","The industry backlog declined this quarter to below 200,000 units from its peak of over 300,000 eight months ago. While inventory is elevated at 80,000 units. Our guidance assumes lower industry production of trucks in the fourth quarter, driven both by fuel workdays as well as reduced build rates.","We expect our market to be at the high end of our prior forecast of 32% to 34%. The combination of the increased capacity of fleets and lower freight demand has resulted in lower utilization of available equipment in the industry.","Because of this reduced utilization, we've seen lower demand in our parts and remanufacturing business. We expect parts demand to continue to be relatively weak through the end of the year as dealers begin to reduce parts inventory in anticipation of lower market activity.","In the medium duty truck market, we are maintaining our forecast for industry production of 140,000 units, up 6% year-over-year and we expect our market share to be in the range of 74% to 76% unchanged from prior guidance. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for 2019, compared to a very strong 2018 and unchanged from our expectations three months ago.","In China, we now expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 2% in 2019. We are maintaining our outlook for medium heavy new truck demand at 1.2 million units, representing a 10% decline from last year.","In the light duty truck market we now expect a 12% reduction in demand, compared to our prior guidance of 7% down, this decline is driven by the more stringent enforcement of overloading regulations I discussed earlier, we expect our market share in the medium and heavy duty market to be in the range of 13% to 14% and in light duty, expect our share to be 8% to 9%, both in line with our prior guidance.","We now expect industry sales of excavators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2018. This compares to our prior guidance of down 10%, and it's driven by increased exports of excavators developing countries primarily in Southeast Asia.","In India, we now project revenue, including joint ventures to be down 5% compared to our prior guidance of flat. We anticipate industry demand for trucks to be 17% lower than the record levels experienced in 2018 and compared to our prior guidance of down 5%.","Truck demand is being negatively impacted by the continuing high cost and low availability of credit in India shadow banking system, which has been under pressure due to defaults by non-bank lenders. We continue to expect power generation and construction to grow 5% to 10% due to continued infrastructure investment.","In Brazil, we are now projecting truck production to increase 2% in 2019, down from 13%, three months ago. Economic growth has not accelerated Brazil as much as we anticipated this year. The GDP growth now projected at 1%, lower economic growth has resulted lower demand growth in truck, construction and power generation markets, compared to three months ago. We now project our revenues in Brazil to be down 10% compared to our prior projection of flat.","We continue to expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to be down 5% this year, we project demand for oil and gas engines will decline 40%, which is unchanged from a prior guidance.","However, we now anticipate sales in North America will decline by 75%, compared to our 60% down expectation three months ago with lower demand for new equipment in the Permian Basin, as well as reduced demand for engine rebuilds.","This deterioration in our outlook for North America is offset by increased sales to China. The demand for mining engines has moderated over the last three months as commodity prices have fallen and capital budgets have been cut.","We now expect mining engine sales to be down 5% lower than our prior guidance of up 5%. Demand for power generation equipment was flat in the second quarter, and we expect demand to remain at second quarter levels to the remainder of the year. We expect revenue to be flat for the full year with growth and data center markets and increased military revenue offset by lower sales of generator sets to the RV market, lower demand and backup power applications in China, and a drop in large plant power applications in Europe.","In summary, we're now expecting revenues to be flat for the year at the low end of our previous guidance, driven by lower demand in international truck markets, moderating aftermarket demand in North America, and the negative impact of the stronger U.S. dollars, we are maintaining our EBITDA guidance of 16.25%, to 16.75% of sales as lower joint venture income and the impact of lower volumes will be offset by lower material and other costs.","During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 15%, the 10th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. We continue to project returning 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. In June, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the majority of shares a fuel cell systems provider Hydrogenics Corporation for $290 million. This agreement is still set to Hydrogenic shareholder approval, as well as other customary closing conditions.","Strong execution across all of our businesses resulted in record revenue being translated into record EBITDA and operating cash flow in the first half of the year. As we move into the second half of 2019, our guidance projects that revenues will decline from second quarter levels as several of our end markets experience lower levels of industry production.","The company is well-positioned as we move this period to repeat our track record of increasing cycle over cycle earnings and returning significant cash to shareholders. We will continue to invest in technology to ensure the future success of our stakeholders, while reviewing areas for additional cost reduction and efficiency gains, as we have in prior cycles.","Now let me turn it over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of the drivers of our strong financial performance in the second quarter, and then comment on our revised outlook for the full year.","Second quarter revenues were a record $6.2 billion, up 1% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 7%, and International revenues declined by 6%, currency movements negatively impacted overall company revenues by 2%.","Earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization or EBITDA were a record $1.1 billion or 17% of sales for the quarter. EBITDA increased by $161 million over the second quarter last year, as a result of stronger gross margins and higher other income, which more than offset increased research and development expenses and lower joint venture income.","Gross margin of $1.6 billion, or 26.4%, improved by $201 million. Results for the second quarter of 2018 included a $181 million charge for an engine system campaign. In addition to lower campaign costs, improve pricing benefits from material cost reduction programs more than offset the impact of higher tariffs year-over-year.","Our selling administrative and research costs $880 million increased by $48 million year-over-year, driven primarily by new product development in the engine components and Electrified Power segments.","Joint venture income declined by $14 million, driven by weaker demand in light duty truck and power generation markets in China, in addition to some increased expenses in China associated with the launch of new on highway products, to meet the new National 6 emissions regulations.","Other income of $43 million increased by $18 million, primarily driven by $18 million of mark-to-market gains on the investments that underpin our non-qualified benefit plans. The mark-to-market gains were recorded other income in the income statement, and with eliminations in our segment reporting.","The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.4% down from 22.5% in the second quarter last year, and in line with our full year forecast of 21.5%. Diluted earnings per share were $4.27 in the second quarter, up from $3.32 last year, resulting from stronger earnings, a lower effective tax rate and the positive impact of share repurchase activity completed over the prior 12 months.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $808 million, bringing the year-to-date total to a record of $1.2 billion, up $747 million from the same period last year, driven by stronger earnings and a much slower pace of working capital expansion.","I will now comment on our revised guidance for 2019. For the engine segment we expect full year revenues to be down 2% to up 2%, compared to our previous guidance of growth of 1% to 5%.","This lower revenue outlook is the result of a weaker projection for parts sales in North America, weaker demand in that Chinese light duty truck market, and a slower pace of economic growth in Brazil.","We've revised our forecast of EBITDA margins in the engine business to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16% driven primarily by the impact of the lower sales outlook, and weaker joint venture income in China.","For the distribution segment, we now expect revenues to be 1% to 5%, compared to our prior guidance of 2% to 6% with a slight adjustment driven by a stronger dollar, and therefore a higher currency headwind.","We are raising our outlook for EBIT margins -- EBITDA margins to be in the range of 8% to 8.5% compared to our prior guidance of 7.5% to 8.5%, driven by stronger operational performance, which more than offsets the negative impact of a depreciating dollar.","2019, we now expect components revenue to be between down 2% to up 2%, compared to our prior year projections of growth of 1% to 5%, driven by a lower demand in China and India.","We've raised our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.75% to 16.25%, up from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16.25%, driven by stronger operational performance year-to-date.","In Power Systems, revenues are forecast to be down 2% to up 2% unchanged from our prior guidance. We're also maintaining our focus for EBITDA margins, to be in the range of 13.25% to 14%.","In the Electrified Power segment, we continue to expect the net expense of $120 million to $150 million, as we continue to make targeted investments and that advance new product development towards commercial launch.","The net impact of the changes to individual segment projections is that we now focus total company revenues to be flat in 2019 at the lower end of our previous range of flat to up 4%.","Tom said, we are maintaining our forecast for company EBITDA margins to be in the range of 16.25% to 16.75% full year operating cash flow is projected to exceed 10% of sales.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $133 million, bringing our year-to-date, total investment to $242 million, and we still expect our full-year investments to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million.","In the second quarter we have returned $179 million to shareholders, for the first six months we have returned $458 million through dividends and share repurchase activity.","As Tom mentioned our board recently approved a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, which reflects our confidence in the long-term performance and commitment to strong shareholder returns. We expect to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year through share repurchase and dividend.","To summarize, we delivered a strong second quarter, and record first half of the year in terms of sales EBITDA and operating cash flow. These results extend our track record of improving earnings cycle over cycle, delivering first quarter return on invested capital and enabling us to invest in future growth, while maintaining strong cash returns to shareholders.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Tom.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Mark.","As you remember, we announced on April 29th and then discussed in our first quarter earnings call that we'd initiated an internal review of our emissions certification and compliance processes for our pickup truck applications as a result of conversations with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board. Our review continues, and we are proactively working closely with the EPA and CARB and other agencies to address their questions.","During conversations with the EPA and CARB about the effectiveness of our 2019 pickup truck applications, the agencies raise concerns that certain aspects of our emission systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emission control systems and did not fully comply with the requirements for certification.","As a result, our internal review has been largely focused on the agency's concerns. We are working closely with the agencies to enhance our emission systems to improve the effectiveness of our pickup truck applications, and to fully address the agencies requirements and meet the expectations of our customers.","Consistent with the values and the history of the company, which include a strong commitment to compliance, we\u2019ll work with regulators and other agencies to address the issues identified in our internal review and develop future technologies that will advance our industry.","It's too early to conclude on any changes that we will make to our processes and organization as a result of our internal review. It's also too soon to know what the response of the regulators will be to our view, or to determine any potential financial consequences.","Now, let me give it back to James to open for Q&A.","James Hopkins","Thanks, Tom. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Michel, we're now ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. I guess two questions, one for Mark one for Tom. Mark, just on the change in engine guidance understanding you took your sales down a little -- the margins I guess were down a little lower than what I would have thought, so if you could just help me understand the puts and takes there?","And then Tom, a question for you on 2020 understanding you probably want to frame that more, when we get to your Analyst Day or the fourth quarter, but can you just -- given you touched so many markets, can you give us some view on how you're thinking about 2020 given the macro concerns out there, and then any positives and negatives, investors should think about outside of the markets that could help or be a drag on Cummins that are within your control? Thank you.","Mark Smith","Okay, Jamie, so quickly the two main drivers of the lower margins for the engine business, lower top-line outlook which in part is due to a kind of leveling off of parts demand in North America, and then of course the lower outlook for joint venture, it is principally driven by China, especially driven by Canada lower outlook for the light duty market, which is really all negative impact the JV earnings which constrict off the EBITDA percent. So those are the two primary reasons otherwise everything else is pretty much in line.","Tom Linebarger","And with regard to next year I will just make a few general comments, Jamie and of course we'll be very detailed when we get to the Analyst Day about what we're seeing. But broadly speaking, as you know many of our markets are either at or near cyclical peaks in our view, which means that inevitably we will start to see some of these markets decline.","We don't know the exact quarter, we done a fairly detailed projection for the U.S. truck market because there's a lot of data and it\u2019s easier to do. But even that has some variance depending on who in the industry you ask.","Most of the other markets have more variance as to when people think they thought but many of them will inevitably fall at least to some degree, so we are prepared for 2020, and even into 2021 for markets to be relatively lower cyclically, at least many of our major ones and we are prepared in the following sense.","We are already managing our cost to make sure that our capacity levels and cost levels will be at the right place when it's time and making sure that we're the first to be ready and the first to react. And so, a lot of our focus is on ensuring that were prepared from a cost structure point of view for that cyclical downturn that's how we ensure that in the next downturn we have better margins than the prior downturn.","The second thing is that our products are performing incredibly well, that's why you see many of our market share projections sort of tipping towards the higher end of our estimation for the year as because we think our products are performing very well.","We think that serves us well in downturns because a few points of market share can make up some cyclical downturn. So, we will continue to emphasize the quality and performance of our products and we will continue to launch new products. So that when we're in downturn, our competitors will see us continues to go from strength to strength because in downturns as well, we also think we can gain market share and commitment from customers.","Also, we will be seeing some gain hopefully from the SS6 and NS6, we've been investing significantly in engines and components for those launches and we think we'll be ready. We feel ready now and we think our products will outperform competitors and we think that will give us a chance to step up our market positions in both India and China, which we think will be lasting positions.","So those are just some of the puts and takes, again, not all markets will follow the same time, we have a very global market and as you know, not all the cycles of the same, but we are just prepared for cyclical downturns are turning into this mode. It says while this is lower and we're going to make sure our cost structure right and we will gain share from competitors and continue to launch new products in a way that conditions are better for the fall the upturn.","Jamie Cook","Thank you. That was helpful. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Our question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. On your down 10% earnings from JVs in your guidance. I think that implies around flat for the second half versus down 15% to 20% in the first half that, how much of that is easier comps or is it an expected pickup in sales, emission guidance for something else.","Mark Smith","So, I think we will start to see a tail off certainly on a system side of our joint venture earnings towards the back half of the last year, so your method is exactly right, Steve. There is no assumption [ph], it is just kind of leveling out in aggregate and flat in the second half of the year.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then could you just clarify the parts outlook to what extent are you already seeing a lower demand exiting the quarter, I think you had 2% growth disclosed in the distribution segment. So, has that already started to turn negative or are you just adjusting production and anticipation of lower demand later this year and the next year?","Rich Freeland","Steven, its Rich. Let me give just a little background on parts, some perspective. We are parts and service business for last three years which has grown about 10% a year, since we put more and more product out there and more complex power trains, we've seen some pretty rapid growth in that.","What we forecast about 4% to 5% growth again this year, including pricing and what we've seen is bit of a fall back on that. And mostly in North America as we look to truck utilization, the data is not a strong here, but our hypothesis is that older trucks are not being run as heavily and so therefore our parts and service down a bit. And when that happens, we've seen -- there will be some adjustment, kind of in dealer inventories and adjustment there.","We don't think inventories are bloated at this time or excessive. I think just some prudent trimming of inventories is what I would expect to see. Again, this reduction that we put on our forecast basically says we will still be flat to last year.","So, at a record levels and so it remains bullish going forward. We're putting out about 1.5 million engines a year, so over the last three years. So those engines move into the parts consuming business. So, we think a little bit of adjustment second half of the year, bullish long term.","Steven Fisher","Great, thanks, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer of Melius. Your line is open.","Rob Wertheimer","Actually, yeah. My question was on parts, and that that was fantastic color Rich, on the past growth rate, et cetera. Just out of curiosity, I mean, you mentioned it all tickets bloated, how much of your sales goes to non-Cummins, I guess distribution? If you're willing to give that number?","And then, do you think is the six-month adjustment? And then, were kind of all clear. Part of the reason I'm asking is just we didn't see this sort of slowdown as you had in pack car, obviously selling to someone markets.","Mark Smith","Yes, so I would say, I don't have exact numbers in but more than half, the channels putting split more than half going to through non-OEM channels. So, there is a wide range of customers buying inventory.","Tom Linebarger","What Mark is saying is more than half of go through OEM dealer channel versus our own channel. And that's in the truck side. And as you said, the adjustments, the adjustments in parts, they're kind of hard to predict this time. Because there relatively small adjustments in grand scheme of parts inventories, but they can have an effect on a quarter. And we see this every downturn there are some adjustment. And frankly, we're not that good at predicting much quarter it is.","So, we're now kind of we were surprised that it was now, but it was. And I think what Rich is saying is that every time we see this, we see it every downturn, it tends not to be lasting very long. Parts is a very stable business, our services business, so, we don't expect it to keep going down, we expect it to level off. And then we expect to see it continue to increase in future quarter.","So, we're just trying to be prudent that it seems inevitable in a downturn that dealers will adjust some inventories. And we saw a little bit of that in this second quarter and we expect to see a little bit more of it as we go on second half of the year.","But we'll see, right what happens. And like you said, everybody is going to have different circumstances depending on where they're holding inventory, how much they're holding and all that kind of.","I think we should just expect variability, but it's inevitable if you just look over the cycle that parts inventory dropped some in the downturn, and then they rise up again as things start to rise.","Rob Wertheimer","Perfect. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning.","Tom Linebarger","Hi, Ann.","Ann Duignan","Maybe you could walk us through the different regions of your business and comment a little further on which one markets you see as being at peak. I mean, everybody understands North America heavy duty, and maybe the impact that has on components also. But what other end markets do you feel are post peak?","Tom Linebarger","In, most of the truck markets are at or near peak. I mean, Brazil is a notable exception, because it's kind of running along the bottom, but most of the others. So, India is already on the way down, China look like it's on the way down. Heavy duty, you talked about, medium duty is holding strong, but it's been up for a while.","So, it just, and Europe is the one we are not sure about. But even that showed a little weakness in this last quarter. It's hard to say exactly how much what that means. But we've heard some rumblings out of Europe that some of the truck makers are getting concerned.","So, it's sort of hard to find a truck market that doesn't feel peakish, if not already headed down the other side. It looks to us like mining is a little bit of a different story. It doesn't look like it's at peak, but it's definitely leveled off.","I mean, there's just nothing else to say about that. Now, whether it's going to turn back up again or just sort of steadily grow we're not sure that's kind of our view is that it's going to have a slow growth from here for a little bit longer, but there's no question that compared to a year ago. It's leveled off. And so that that doesn't look like it's got a whole bunch more left in it.","And then I'd say construction markets. U.S. construction markets still strong but at some point, if after the truck market, it feels like construction market has to also tail down and we already think China's got to start tailing down because China has been up for a while and unless they continue to stimulate the market is likely to head down.","India, India has got some -- the government has continued to invest and stimulate there, and we think they probably still will. So, India might hold up a little longer on the construction side. But again, that's some of them. But you remember and we show where we kind of put all the markets up there. We'll bring that that to the Analyst Day, and we'll kind of put all the markets on there.","But suffice it to say those we look at that there's more kind of up and around the top of the that little hills and then there are at the bottom on their way up. So, we're just being realistic about what that means for revenues in 2020.","Ann Duignan","Okay, I appreciate that. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Mark Smith","Jerry, hi. Good morning.","Jerry Revich","Tom, I'm wondering now that you folks have Isuzu joint venture setup, can you just update us on the market share opportunity for you folks on light duty diesel globally. I'm wondering, if you could flush out what the opportunities set is and what the strategy is now with the joint venture and how it fits in for the company's overall opportunity set.","Tom Linebarger","Sure, it's early days in that joint venture, but we're really pleased with our conversations. It's a terrific company, I mean it's not a company that we had done a lot of business with until we started having conversations with them. But although we've always been impressed with them from afar, they we kind of feel like at least in the off-highway market where we see each other, they're the one the engine that we think is actually competitive to ours, and we think highly of them.","So anyway, we've had terrific conversations, but we are early days as to kind of what the market share opportunity.","But here's how we're thinking about it together, is that the two companies are both spending a lot of investment -- putting a lot of investment into the various technologies that will occupy the commercial industrial equipment space. So, think about not only diesel but natural gas and hybrid and electrification and fuel cells and start to think about what that means.","Then they also have a truck business which has to identify -- also has to do autonomous safety, other integration of their vehicle. So, they're thinking about all the investments they need to make in that all the investments they need to make in power train and coming up and thinking that tips us over a company our size.","So, but they need to be leading, there's no room for laggards, there is not going to be any second place is there, I mean, they're the strongest truck company in Japan, they have a terrific market share in Southeast Asia and they're the second largest and diesel engine maker with us.","So, what we're going to try to do is figure out how we can make sense and rationalize these investments in these various technologies, and it's my sense that they would like to figure out a way to do that, so that Cummins can do a lot of the investments in the power train, and they can focus more investment on the truck.","And if they can do that in a way that allows them to ensure supply, make sure they're leading utilize the technology and assets they have, I think that's going to be a solution that they like. But there -- there's a lot of conversations about to have about how you do that.","And the reason we think this is really a great opportunity for both companies is if we can figure this out, I think a lot of other OEMs around the world would like to figure out something similar there. There all of us are stuck with the same problem of a lot of investment in new technology for essentially the same markets and essentially the same size, which looks like an equation that again, keeps most of us over unless we can figure out some solutions to either add content and or find new ways to rationalize investment.","So, I think it's a really important set of work that we're doing, that could be indicative of how some of the other industry discussions go.","Jerry Revich","That's really interesting. And on the shorter-term side, you folks are preemptively looking at markets where demand could be weaker. Can you just update us on your framework for detrimental margin, so the detrimental margins were really in the teams on this revision, which was nice to see, are you optimistic that you can achieve better detrimental than the mid-20s that I believe you\u2019ve targeted in the past?","Mark Smith","Well, we will give you a more precise of that in the Analyst, Jerry, as we get a closer view on those markets, but as clear goal of improving cycle-over-cycle earnings, and you're right, yes, in the second half of this year, we will be in the kind of mid-teens, I think we've got to balance that against just some of the investment needs in the near-term on some of the new technologies.","So, we'll come out and give you a clear answer, but you should be clear, that we committed to improving those earnings on the down cycle as well as the up.","Jerry Revich","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Leiker of Baird. Your line is open.","David Leiker","Good morning, everybody.","Mark Smith","Thank you, David.","David Leiker","I wanted to talk a little bit, how you get a great amount of detail in terms of year-end markets and what you're looking for. I was wondering if we could dig into a little bit further in terms of that pace of production going into the third quarter and fourth quarter. We're hearing different things from different folks that, build rates may hold up through the end of the year.","But just you're seeing lower -- you're thinking that daily build rates actually fall as we go through Q4. That something you're thinking that might happen? Are you seeing that in some of the schedule says you look further out towards the end of the year?","Rich Freeland","Okay. Hey David, this is Rich. So, a few things. One, we're not seeing it in the short-term schedules, they remain strong. We see out our visibility through Q3. And what we're doing just planning for a scenario, where production begins to fall off as the backlog goes down.","And so, we have no visibility to that. We've just seen it in past cycles that some OEMs don't run at this elevated rate, because people are working pretty close to capacity right now. As a backlog comes down, what we've seen in past cycles is people begin, don't run full steam all the way to the backlog is gone. They begin to moderate their production schedules.","So, we haven't seen a lot of that, we built that into our guidance, but that will happen in Q4. And of course, there is a scenario where that doesn't happen. And we're prepared for that also. But that's the vision we have is more on what we've seen in past cycles, David.","David Leiker","Okay, great. Thanks. And then just one additional item on the balance sheet. The working capital numbers pretty high. It looks like receivables and inventory. Mostly just any thoughts on that and where you think that trends over the second half of the year? Thanks.","Mark Smith","I think, when we look at our metrics business. There are pretty similar to where we were last year, our inventory hasn't certainly kind of leveled off in the second quarter. So, I would expect to be in that kind of the 20% of sales range for working capital overall, past dues were in pretty good shape, collections are in good shape. So yes, but to the extent we're facing some weaker outlook then would expect to bring it down. And there would be some positive cash flow impact from that earlier in the downturn.","David Leiker","I was looking on the cash flow statement and your pretty significant use of working capital in this quarter versus the same quarter last year?","Mark Smith","Yes, that's just Q2 this one of the strongest quarters ramping up from Q1, which I don't see\u2026","David Leiker","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Mark Smith","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Uhlman","I had a follow-up on David's question on the cash flow. I guess, the share repurchase has been kind of low so far this year. And you reiterate the plan of returning 75% of the operating cash to shareholders this year. I'm just wondering, if any depending deal activity or potential deal activity could lead to a pause in that share repurchase plan for the second half of the year?","Mark Smith","I guess, there are a number of factors that go into share repurchase in any given quarter. But we just restarted our current expectation is we'll get to around 75% of operating cash flow item. I guess there are some scenarios in which that could be a little bit different. Those are not the ones that we see right now for this year.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Got you. And then on the power gen markets, it sounds like the data center demand has been holding up relatively strong. I wonder, if you could talk through what you're seeing with your order rates? Have you seen any kind of -- any softness within the data center market and just how much visibility do you really have on the global gen set market at this time?","Rich Freeland","That remains -- that look strong, as far out as we can see. And then the core activity is good. Our hit rate on getting market share on that. So, I mean, the general consensus is, we're not giving 2020 guidance, but that looks strong through the end of the year into next year at least.","Tom Linebarger","And the bright spot, Adam has been this China side. One of the things we've always been worried about is how big is the data center market relative to the total, because we've kind of been looking at it as a U.S. and maybe European phenomenon. But now we're seeing starting to see developing countries, especially China, build out data centers and because of our position in that market that had kind of the premium end of the market. We've been actually been able to develop quite good share.","And our team in China has done a terrific job ensuring that as these data center markets start to build out that come in since the player that they look to. So, I think, again, that's a big reason why you're seeing continued strength in data centers is that although it's just one segment of the market, we're seeing it build globally. So, it's -- I think that's steadied out the growth and kept it robust for longer.","Mark Smith","Yeah, we're seeing a little bit of increase in our military business, and then a little bit of weakness in the all these segments in North America, which has been on a multiyear strong run. So that's feels like it's cycling down a little bit.","Adam Uhlman","Great. Thanks.","Mark Smith","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Hi, good morning. I'm just trying to gain comfort with the margins. Obviously, the downside operating leverage which is really critical to the story looking into 2020. So, I'm just trying to understand like say the engine division.","If a year ago, we adjust for that campaign charge. We just saw the engine business year-over-year have up sales a little bit, but profits down over $40 million. While the second half of the year, engine business supposed to have revenues down over $200 million, but profits only down about $40 million to $50 million.","So just coming off that second quarter performance, it obviously is implying the second half is a lot better, despite somewhat notable sales decline. Can you help build some confidence on what is changing in the second half? I assumed materials, -- I'm just trying to understand after that second quarter, our comfort with the second half margin for engines.","Mark Smith","Yes, David, it's Mark. So, I think we've just got some moving parts in some of those different comparisons. So, number one, the first a tougher compound China JV earnings partly due to adjustment in light duty, I think that comp gets a little bit easier in the second half of the year.","And then we're lapping with a higher tariff run rate, remember the actual tariff expenses in the first half of the year close to zero. And so, we're just kind of lapping on those higher numbers. And then of course, we're doing relatively well on certainly on the heavy-duty market share.","So, I think by and large, there is nothing heroic in the second half of the year, we've taken down our outlook for part, as Tom said, some of the actually weaker outlook are leveling off, maybe a better way to describe it already occurred in the second quarter. So, we're not expecting a significant down shift. For those, I think, are the major moving parts, not a significant amount of change in price, or material cost, first half to second half.","David Raso","Yeah, I guess, I pushed back a little bit on the JV income. I mean JV income was down about 10% in engines year-over-year. It seems like the second half is not terribly different, in the context of your overall company JV income for the second half.","So, is there some number around the materials or something about mix that we can again, gain comfort that we can handle that biggest sales decline in the second half with ...","Mark Smith","That was just really back up to the overall company guidance, we've delivered something like 71% for the full -- for the first half of the year, we're at 16.25% to 16.75%. We've kind to maintain the margin guidance on a slightly weaker revenue outlook. So generally, things are going pretty according to plan on the cost side. So, I've got I think we would what we know today, that's our best guidance, and I don't think there's anything heroic in the numbers.","David Raso","I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you very much.","Mark Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alex Potter","Yeah, hi, guys. If you could comment a bit on the light duty policy changes that you're seeing impact demand in China in the truck markets and the reclassification from light duty to medium duty? Is there -- well, first of all, I guess any qualitative commentary you can offer on that policy would be helpful.","But then secondly, is there a reason to think that you could have demand shifting to the medium duty side of the market as a result of this and if so, presumably, the Domfront [ph] joint venture should be able to capitalize on that?","Tom Linebarger","Thanks, Alex. Just a couple of qualitative points and I'll let Rich add if he has more. This is the -- if you're in China, they call this the blue-plate issue, you get a blue plate if you're light duty. And if you -- and what this means is you have easier driver licensing requirements. It's closer to a car license, and you can access the very inner parts of the city, you can imagine why that would be a smaller vehicle, lighter vehicles, less congestion, et cetera.","And the rules were already in place, it's just that they didn't enforce them quite as tightly in every city, and so now what they've done is they've, just picked the day and all of a sudden enforcement started.","To say that it had disruption in the market would be an understatement. So, I, when I was in China recently, there wasn't a single OEM that didn't complain about this, because it just all of a sudden happened and it created absolute havoc in the market.","So, my -- I'm wondering, in part, if there'll be some sort of compromise proposal to kind of rationalize this a little bit, because it really takes a lot of vehicles that were previously being sold and used in cities and brings them outside of the city.","And again, it's not just the fact that you have to spend more money to get more licenses that you can't actually get into all the spots. So that there's a significant change and the ones that can get in have to be very lightly loaded. And so, you're now you're afraid moving capacity has just reduced significantly.","So anyway, there that there's a bunch of that going on, I'd say there's only so much you can figure out about that in China and how fast that's going to move like you know, from your experience.","But my sense is that if there's quite a bit of consternation, and there's some -- some potential outcome where things get compromised or rationalized that whether or not this demand moves to medium duty is another question.","My feeling is that there's not a lot of movement there. Because really, this is the part that takes the final -- it is the final mile delivery stuff. And most of the larger cities anyway have restrictions on vehicle size, doing that final mile delivery. So, a medium a bigger medium duty truck is not really going to solve your problem. And they maybe don't need so many more of those.","But, you know, could be -- there could be some substitution. I think the biggest impact for us was, we got this new JAC JV, we've got Foton going and they're both going gangbusters with great products and great -- great trucks and so it just kind of came to a screeching halt for a second while, this thing is getting rationalized. We think we still have a great line-up in either case, it's just that it, it had a pretty abrupt hit in the second quarter.","Alex Potter","Okay, thanks. Thanks very much. That's super helpful. And then I guess one you mentioned the relationship for Foton there, I noticed that you Yuchai just announced the joint venture partnership of some kind with, with Foton, is there a potential for overlap there with what Cummins does? I guess any commentary there would be helpful as well.","Tom Linebarger","So I -- here's the situation as you know, each of the OEMs has a number of businesses and another number of segments that they're trying to make sure that they're competitive and, and, you know, they use domestic engines and some of those segments and they use joint venture engines with us in other segments, and then a fair bit of those for export. And so, they always have to have multiple partnerships to cover themselves.","Not to mention there are a number of government programs where they need to have domestic engine supply to comply with it. So we are, you know, we're now after, after many, many years there, we're now getting more used to this kind of thing where we, we think we've got the engine thing, good to go.","And then all of a sudden, there's another partner in, but again, al-in-all, we still feel very good about our partnership with photon. And Rich, I know has spent some recent time with him, so I want to let Rich comment to on the photon partnership.","Rich Freeland","Yes, so I would say our relationship with photon is as good as it's been in recent years. In fact, both relationship there and then the customers view of the Foton Cummins product. So, in fact, our share of Fotons so is up from 46% a year-ago, to in the mid-60s now.","And so again, I think it's just as Tom says, the nature of the business there's going to be multiple options, always and so our strategy remains the same to work with the partners develop the best power train product and let customers choose, since we've kind of get used to it there will be customers will have multiple options, but right now I feel really good where we're positioned with Foton.","Alex Potter","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Tom Linebarger","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Noah Kaye","Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First a shorter-term question on 2019 pricing, I believe you've been expecting about an 80-bps growth from pricing and I think a lot of that had to do with the parts business. You know, what are the current expectations, and can you still get that sort of price growth in parts if we're seeing lower activity levels?","Mark Smith","I think this puts and takes around the business. But that's round about where we said at the start of the year. So yes, a little bit lower on parts. But overall, we're in that 80 basis points range for the year. Again, the pricing hasn't gone down, just a little bit a little volume gain.","Noah Kaye","Okay, that's helpful. And then longer-term I mean that you just formally adopted the CO2 regs, for the first time for heavy duty trucks. You already talked about potential Euro 7. Can you talk a little bit about the potential tailwind there for new components business over the coming years and how you think you are positioned? And maybe even kind of contextualize some of your recent investments, electrification, fuel cells, in light of those red?","Tom Linebarger","I think, thanks for that. No, I do think those are just those regs. By the way, those are tough and draconian. There isn't a single OEM that is feeling nonplussed about those. But here's what I say is it they are just -- they are emblematic of what we're going to see across the world. And so, and especially now that regulators have in their sights, some of these new technologies, which look like they have lower, at least local emissions and the potential to potentially be economically viable.","Things like of course, electrified power trains, or hybrids, or fuel cells, et cetera. Once they have those in their sights, and they think they can be economically viable, they are going to shove regulations harder, for obvious reasons. And Europe is, of course, one of them. But we will see them inevitably in the U.S. and elsewhere.","So, we think that the content - and that's kind of linked back to my conversation, when Jerry asked me about Isuzu. I think all of our customers, and Cummins are all seeing significant investments required in power trains, power train components, and systems. And as well as in vehicles in order to be competitive and at the front end of their markets.","Everybody has a good view of what those kinds of might be. But the amount of investment, the number of models that have to be covered, the different regulations that they're going to have to meet cities, countries regions, it looks daunting.","So, what we're -- what we think is that that's the space where Cummins has historically been most successful. When that's kind of the technology challenge in front of us, we've made a bunch of investments, as you know, in EV, in hybrid in diesel and natural gas.","And if we can complete this transaction with Hydrogenics will also have the beginnings of fuel cell offerings. So, our intent is to have the power train of choice for each of these, these providers, and including providing components in those technologies for them to integrate their own systems.","So, we think, again, we will be at the forefront of technology. So, we are talking to every European manufacturer about the role they'd like us to play in their system, and everyone has a different view about that.","We're clear that they are the system provider, and we're there to support them technically. And we think as you said it, whenever there is technology change, whenever regulations are challenging, that's the tail when to come in, because that's essentially what we make, that's what we differentiate on. That's where we our meals are made.","So, we will invest you will lead there, we will ensure that that we're ready when they're ready to, to use us. And again, a lot of people are wringing their hands, figuring out how they're going to meet all these requirements. And we're just we show up every day and say, we're ready to help let us know what you want us to help.","Noah Kaye","Right. And it would seem to me just that in a market where you're providing a lot of subcomponents currently. And you're going into alternative power trains, where not every OEM is going to do a vertically integrated, power train. I mean, they may spec their motors outside or something like that. I mean, there's more of a gain opportunity, it would seem to me at lease.","Tom Linebarger","It seems to me too. Although I'm sure there'll be plenty of others that also see that. So, we'll show up with others there too. But I agree with you that it looks like an opportunity to us. We just don't want to get our cart in front of the horse. It's up to our OEMs to announce what they think. But we will be pushing hard to help those OEMs meet that standard with technology and components that we have.","Noah Kaye","Thanks so much.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you.","James Hopkins","Great. So, with that, it looks like we're at the end of our hour. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your interest in Cummins today. And as always, I'll be available for any follow up questions this afternoon. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 Cummins Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. We will have a question-and-answer session later and the instructions will be given at that time.","And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call to the VP of Finance Operations, Mr. Mark Smith.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the second quarter of 2017. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger, and our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward, who will be available for your questions after our prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in our forward-looking disclosure statement in our slide deck and our filings with the SEC, particularly in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading Investors And Media.","Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Brilliant. Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second-quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2017. Pat will then take you through more details of both our second-quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.","Revenues for the second quarter of 2017 were $5.1 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the second quarter of 2016, due to stronger demand for trucks and construction equipment in North America and China and improving orders from customers in mining and oil and gas markets. EBIT was $620 million or 12.2% compared to $591 million or 13.1% a year ago. EBIT decreased as a percentage of sales and was below our own expectations primarily due to higher warranty costs.","Variable compensation costs also increased both year-over-year and versus the first quarter as a result of our improved outlook for full-year earnings. Warranty costs were 3.7% of sales in the second quarter, up from 2.2% a year ago. Two unrelated issues caused most of the increase.","In our Power Systems segment, engine testing at our manufacturing plant identified a component quality issue that may impact engine performance. Although no performance issues have yet occurred in the field, we are taking actions to protect our customers and we record a $31 million charge to reflect the estimated costs of the campaign.","Secondly, we experienced higher warranty claims associated with late light components in on-highway applications in North America that caused us to increase our warranty reserve by $36 million for products delivered in 2012 and 2013. This additional charge primarily impacted the Components segment.","We've made significant improvements to the quality of our products and especially in our new product launches. Cummins' products are performing at record levels of reliability and our market share reflects that strong performance. On the other hand, the complexity of our products has increased significantly to meet tough emissions regulations. Customer expectations have also increased and the environments where our products are used are more demanding than ever.","Thus, we are redoubling our efforts on improving product quality and developing new techniques using telematics and Big Data to complement our existing quality tools. We expect to resolve the specific quality issues we experienced this quarter quickly and we expect warranty costs to decline as a percent of sales by 50 basis points in the second half of the year.","Engine business sales increased by 15% in the second quarter compared to a year ago due to higher industry truck production and growth in our market share. We also experienced strong growth in demand from construction OEMs in China and North America. EBIT for the quarter was 12% compared to 10.3% for the same period in 2016. Benefits from higher volumes and stronger joint venture earnings in China and the absence of a loss contingency charge recorded a year ago more than offset higher variable costs and warranty costs.","Sales for the Distribution segment increased by 12% year-over-year, resulting from 6% organic growth, net of currency, and an additional 6% increase resulting from the acquisition of a last remaining distributor joint venture in North America in the fourth quarter of last year. Stronger parts and service revenues in oil and gas and mining markets in North America and higher parts sales in China drove the improvement in organic revenues. Second-quarter EBIT was 5.6%, flat compared to the second quarter of 2016, as the benefit of higher sales were offset by higher variable compensation costs.","Second-quarter revenues for the Components segment increased by 14%. International revenues increased by 25% due to strong growth in truck demand in China and the sale of new products in India to meet the broad Stage IV emissions regulations introduced in April this year. EBIT for the second quarter was 13.1% compared to 14.9% in the same quarter a year ago. The benefit of the higher volumes and material cost-reduction programs were more than offset by the increase in warranty costs that I discussed earlier.","Power Systems sales increased by 10% in the second quarter, primarily driven by an increase in engine and parts sales to mining and oil and gas customers. EBIT in the second quarter was 6% compared to 9.8% a year ago. The primary driver of the lower EBIT margin was the accrual for the estimated cost of the quality campaign. The business also experienced an increase in commodity costs and higher variable compensation costs associated with the company's improved outlook for the full year.","Excluding the campaign and some additional one-time costs, the business is operating at approximately 10% EBIT margin. With improving market conditions in some key markets and the benefits of our UK manufacturing restructuring still to come in 2018, we are confident that we will see a significant step-up in profitability in the coming quarters.","Now, I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the second quarter of 2017, starting with North America and then I will comment on some of our largest international markets.","Our revenues in North America improved 13% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher levels of industry production and increased market share in on-highway markets. We also experienced growth in sales of engines and parts to customers in construction, oil and gas and mining markets. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks increased 4% in the second quarter of 2017, while sales of our heavy-duty engines increased 16% due to higher market share at 32%, up from 29% a year ago.","Production of medium-duty trucks increased 15% in the second quarter, while our engine shipments increased 27% as our market share improved 600 basis points reaching nearly 80% in the quarter. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 6% compared to a year ago due to strong demand from FCA.","Engine sales for construction equipment in North America increased 31% in the second quarter, compared to a weak quarter a year ago with some OEMs optimistic about the prospects for increased infrastructure investment. Sales of engine shipments to high-horsepower markets in North America increased 147% compared to a very weak quarter a year ago, driven by higher sales to oil and gas customers. Revenues for power generation showed little change from weak levels a year ago with shipments of mobile generators for recreational vehicles helping to offset lower military sales.","Our international revenues increased by 11% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to a year ago. Second-quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, an increase of 28% due to continued strength in truck and construction markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 46% compared to a year ago and our market share for the quarter was 14%, slightly below the level a year ago, reflecting a mix shift in industry sales to dump trucks in which we have a lower share of the market today.","Penetration of our products with our key OEM customers remains very strong. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 35%, above the overall increase in the market of 10%. Our market share rose by 150 basis points from a year ago to more than 8% as we continued to displace local competitors from Foton's vehicle lineup.","Chinese industry demand for excavators in the second quarter increased 102% from a year ago, reflecting a rebound in construction activity. Our shipment of engines to construction customers across all equipment categories increased 125%. Revenues for our Power Systems business in China increased 4% due to higher demand from mining and rail customers.","Second-quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $431 million, a 5% increase from the second quarter a year ago. Revenues for power generation equipment increased 6% and sales of construction engines increased 25%, reflecting growing investment in infrastructure. Industry production of trucks in India decreased 25% year-over-year, following the introduction of the Bharat Stage IV emissions regs in April. In Brazil, our revenues increased by 16%, primarily due to an increase in truck production in the quarter and the appreciation of the Brazilian real.","Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2017 and then comment on individual regions and end-markets. We are now forecasting total company revenues for 2017 to be up 9% to 11%, higher than our previous projection of up 4% to 7%, due to stronger demand in on-highway and construction markets in both North America and China and improving orders from global mining customers. We've raised our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 205,000 units, up 2% compared to 2016 and above our prior forecast of 195,000 units. We expect our market share to be above the midpoint of our prior projection of 29% to 32%.","In the medium-duty truck market, we've raised our outlook for the market size to 115,000 units, an increase of 6% compared to 2016 and 2% higher than our previous forecast. We now expect our market share to be at the top-end of our prior forecast of 73% to 75%. Consumer demand for pickup trucks in North America remains strong with our full-year shipments of engines expected to increase 5%, above our previous projection of 1% growth.","In China, we expect full-year domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to grow 26% compared to our previous projection of a 3% increase. Revenues for the second half of the year are expected to decline by approximately 20% compared to the first half, reflecting an easing in demand for trucks and typical seasonality in construction markets.","Industry sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks are expected to reach 1.25 million units, a 28% increase from last year and higher than our previous forecast of 1 million units, driven in part by demand resulting from the introduction of regulations last year, aiming at curbing overloading. We expect truck market to grow 3% in 2017, unchanged from our previous guidance.","Our market share in the medium and heavy-duty truck market in China is expected to be 15%, flat with 2016. And in light-duty, we expect our share to exceed 8%, up from 7% in 2016. We currently project revenue from all off-highway markets in China to grow by 15% to 20%, up from our previous guidance of 10% to 15%.","In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat to up 3% year-over-year with a 5% increase in off-highway demand and growth from new product sales in our Components business, partially offset by a 12% decline in truck production.","In Brazil, full-year truck production is projected to increase 10% in 2017 compared to a very weak 2016, when the industry experienced the lowest level of truck production in more than a decade. We expect our global high-horsepower engine shipments to increase more than 30%, up from our prior forecast of 10% to 15% growth, as demand from mining customers continues to strengthen. Engine demand from oil and gas customers in North America has exceeded our previous expectations for this year, although visibility into 2018 remains limited.","In summary, we've raised our full-year outlook for sales to increase 9% to 11%. We've maintained our forecast for EBIT to be in the range of 11.75% to 12.5%. Comparing second half to first half performance, we expect lower warranty costs in the second half of the year balanced with weaker demand in China, targeted investments in critical new technologies and some risk from higher commodity costs. With improving demand in a number of important markets, our leading market share and strong operating performance, we remain very confident in the future earnings power of our business.","During the quarter, we returned $241 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and also announced a 5.4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, consistent with our plans to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2017.","Finally, we announced earlier today that we have formally closed our deal with Eaton to form the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission's joint venture. We are excited about working with a capable partner to offer customers leading technology in both automated transmissions and now fully-integrated powertrains. Rising demand for automated transmissions around the world should drive growth for the joint venture and opportunities for our customers and partners.","Now, let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the review of the company's second quarter financial results before discussing the performance of the four operating segments in more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Second-quarter revenues were $5.1 billion, an increase of 12% from a year ago, with sales increasing in each of the operating segments, primarily driven by stronger demand in global on-highway, construction, mining and oil and gas markets, partially offset by continued weakness in power generation markets.","Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our second-quarter revenues, improved by 13% from a year ago due to increased sales of engines and components to meet higher levels of heavy and medium-duty truck production and increased demand in industrial markets.","International sales improved by 11% from a year ago, primarily due to increased sales in China, India and Russia, partially offset by declines in the Middle East and in Africa. Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, which declined from 26.4% a year ago, primarily due to a higher warranty and variable compensation expenses, which more than offset the benefits from stronger volumes and material cost-reduction initiatives.","Selling, admin and research and development costs of $770 million or 15.2% of sales increased by $91 million and increased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points from last year, mainly due to higher variable compensation expenses and increased investments for new products.","Joint venture income of $98 million increased by $10 million from last year, primarily due to increased demand in China for both on-highway and off-highway segment. Other income and expense improved by $18 million due to a gain on a fixed asset sale and higher royalty income. And in the second quarter of 2016, we had a $39 million charge for the loss contingency that did not repeat this year.","Earnings before interest and tax were $620 million or 12.2% of sales for the quarter compared to $591 million or 13.1% a year ago. EBIT as a percent of sales declined primarily due to the increased warranty expenses in addition to the higher variable compensation expense.","Net earnings for the quarter were $424 million or $2.53 per diluted share compared to $406 million or $2.40 a share from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, in line with our previous guidance of 26%.","Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the second quarter and then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some comments from cash flow.","In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 15% from last year due to a 14% increase in on-highway sales, driven primarily by increased global truck production and from strong demand for engines for construction equipment in both China and North America, which drove a 20% increase in off-highway revenues in the quarter.","Segment EBIT in the second quarter was $277 million or 12% of sales and this compares to $206 million or 10.3% a year ago. Earnings increased as the benefits from higher engine and parts sales, material cost-reduction initiatives, stronger joint venture earnings in China and the absence of the loss contingency charge recorded a year ago more than offset higher variable compensation and warranty costs.","We now expect full-year revenues to be up 10% to 12% compared to our previous guidance of up 2% to 6% due to improved outlook in most markets. Our forecast for the EBIT margins is to be in the range of 10.5% to 11.5% of sales, an increase compared to 10.35% to 11.25% that we provided before.","For the Distribution segment, second-quarter revenues were $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% compared to last year. Organic sales for the quarter increased by 7%. Revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 added 6% and this was partially offset by 1% unfavorable currency impact.","The EBIT margin for the quarter was $96 million, an increase of 10% from last year and remained flat at 5.6% of sales due to higher variable compensation cost offsetting the benefits of volume growth. For 2017, Distribution revenue is now projected to increase 9% to 11% compared to our previous guidance of up 4% to 8% due to strengthening off-highway demand for engines, parts and rebuilds. We are forecasting EBIT margins to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25% of sales, slightly lower than our previous guidance of 6% to 6.75%.","For the Components segment, revenues were $1.5 billion in the second quarter, a 14% increase from a year ago and a quarterly record. International revenues increased 25% primarily due to 47% increase in sales in China and the first sales of new aftertreatment systems in India to meet the new emissions standard that was introduced in April. Sales in North America increased 6% due to higher heavy and medium-duty truck production. Segment EBIT was $190 million or 13.1% of sales compared to 14.9% a year ago. An increase in warranty expense recorded for the change in estimate for the prior model year aftertreatment products was the primary driver of the margin decline.","In 2017, we now expect revenue to increase 13% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of up 6% to 10%. The change in guidance is the result of stronger truck demand in China and improvements in the North American truck market. EBIT is projected to be in the range of 13% to 13.5% of sales compared to 12.5% to 13.5% in our previous forecast.","In the Power Systems segment, second-quarter revenues were $1 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Mining revenues increased 50% and oil and gas revenues more than tripled compared to the same quarter a year ago, while power generation sales declined by 5% due to weak demand in the Middle East and in Africa.","EBIT margins were 6% in the quarter, down from 9.8% last year, primarily due to the higher warranty expenses recorded for the quality campaign as well as an increase in commodity costs and higher variable compensation costs associated with the company's improved outlook for the full year. For 2017, we expect Power Systems segment revenues to increase 8% to 10% versus our prior guidance of up 1% to 5%, with stronger demand in industrial markets, particularly in mining and oil and gas markets driving the improvement.","EBIT margins are expected to be between 7% and 8% of sales, unchanged from our previous guidance. And for the company, we are raising our outlook for revenues to be up 9% to 11% versus the previous guidance of up 4% to 7%. The increase is primarily due to stronger demand in Chinese construction and truck markets and an increase in our outlook for truck production and higher demand from oil and gas customers in North America. Foreign currency headwinds are expected to reduce revenues by approximately $100 million, which is a smaller impact than previously forecasted, primarily due to the euro and British pound strengthening against the U.S. dollar over the last three months.","Income from our joint ventures is now expected to increase by 12% in 2017 compared to our previous guidance of flat. Stronger demand in China is driving the year-over-year growth in earnings and is expected to more than offset the reduction in income from the consolidation of the last remaining distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016.","We expect EBIT margins to be between 11.75% and 12.5% of sales for 2017, unchanged from our previous forecast, due to the higher-than-expected warranty costs, offsetting the benefit of higher volumes. And this compares to 11.4% last year.","Looking ahead to the second half of the year, warranty costs will come down. However, the benefit from this will be offset, as we do expect to see weaker demand in China, an increase in commodity costs as well as an increase in targeted investments in critical new technologies. The revenue and earnings guidance provided today does not include the impact from the Eaton Cummins joint venture. We are still in the process of completing the purchase accounting associated with our investment in this new venture, but we do not expect the joint venture to have a material impact on the company's financial results in 2017. We will provide an update on our third-quarter earnings call.","Turning to cash flow, cash generated from operating activities for the second quarter was $447 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $826 million, a 12% increase from the same period last year. We anticipate the operating cash flow for the full year will be within our long-term guidance of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditure during the quarter was $101 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $182 million. And we still expect that investments will be in the range of $500 million to $530 million for the full year.","In the second quarter, we returned $241 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. For the first six months of the year, we have returned $463 million. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to shareholder returns with the recent 5.4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, which is part of the plan to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year.","Although we were clearly disappointed with the increase in product coverage costs in the second quarter, we are encouraged with the progress made so far in our overall performance with sales up 10% compared to the first half of 2016, EBIT up $111 million or 10% higher and earnings per share up 15%. Markets are returning as you can see from the increase in guidance across all four segments and we believe we are well prepared to meet customer demand as market conditions continue to improve.","Finally, I would like to announce that we will be holding our Analyst Day on November 16 in Indianapolis, Indiana and invitations to this event will be sent out in the middle of August.","Now, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. We're now ready to move to the Q&A section of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi. Good morning. My question is I'm trying to think about incremental margins year-over-year on a segment basis. If you pull out the warranty costs for 2Q, it implies the incrementals were about 15% to 16%. Still not fantastic. When you look at the implied second half at first blush, it feels better, it looks like 24%, 25%. But, actually, if you go back to the third quarter of last year and pull out that big loss contingency, it implies the second-half incremental this year still only 14%. So, I know a lot of puts and takes given all the different parts of your company, but I mean big picture, Tom, how should we think about the company's incremental margins as we try to model beyond 2017?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","So, David, let me take the first shot at that and then Tom can jump in with the long-term outlook. So, in the second half of the year, the one other factor that is impacting the margin improvement is the increase in variable compensation costs. So, compared to last year, they're performing much better on a full-year basis. And as a result of that, we will be incurring significantly more higher variable comp accruals in the second half of the year than the second half of last year.","For the full year, all-in, we're still looking \u2013 we've been looking at higher variable comp somewhere around a 20% incremental EBIT margin at the midpoint. So, to your point, we don't have the loss contingency that we recorded last year, but we do have much higher variable compensation costs this year. And I don't think \u2013 I'll let Tom speak for himself in a second, but I don't think our thoughts on the long-term incremental margin targets have changed at all. We've said 20% for some time and I think we remain committed to that.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, that's right. I mean the variable compensation cost thing does normalize. What we have is when we are performing worse than planned because markets negatively surprise us, we have lower variable compensation costs, which bolster our financials. And when things bounce up faster than we expected, the reverse occurs.","But in the end, they work themselves out. So, I just agree with Pat's point of view, we feel like the earnings power of the company remains the same and we still think 20% incremental margins is what we're capable of and what we're demonstrating when we pull out these kind of one-time or unusual period costs. So, we feel just as strong as we ever did about that.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Adam.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","I was wondering if we could start with the quality and the warranty costs. First of all, could you talk through, is there any likelihood of recovery from any suppliers that might have been involved in this or is this all Cummins' components, specifically? And then, secondly, related to that, if you could just spend some time about what process changes are under way to reduce the likelihood of these expenses going forward?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","That's great. I'll take that one, Adam, and let me start with the second question first. As I mentioned in my remarks, we've made a lot of improvement in quality, especially related to new product launches and that has dramatically improved the liability of products over the last several years and our products are performing well in the market as a result of that. But also, as I mentioned, the complexity of the products continues to increase. There are many new markets like China and other markets where the use of the products is really demanding and used in various ways.","And so, what we're trying to do is utilize the benefits of data we're getting from our telematics system to begin to use new methods to improve quality of products, both at launch, but also in longer mileage situations. Because, again, expectations of performance of these products over sustained periods of time have gone up by customers. I think that's normal for every industry. So, we've got to have the ability to maintain quality over a long period of time and, again, over multiple owners and multiple applications.","So, that's why we're using a lot of this new data with new techniques to mine that data and make \u2013 correlate that data with how products perform in the field. So, again, this is not new. We've been working on that for some time, but we now have some pretty useful tools we think we can apply to our quality efforts and we need to do that. That's what I was mentioning in my remarks.","With regard to supplier recovery, it is an area of focus for us. And in the specific quality issues we have in the second quarter, we do think there're some potential for supplier recovery, but right now, what we're focused on is improving the situation for customers, making sure there's no negative impact on customers, getting the products right. Again, we just feel like we're in a really strong position with our products in terms of how they're performing. And, of course, that's shown up in market share. So, we want to make sure we get that right, get the issues behind us and move on and then we'll deal with the supplier recovery issues.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. So, the supplier recovery isn't embedded within your expectation of an improvement in warranty expense in the second half. That's just...","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, we have nothing assumed within that 50 basis point improvement number that you have for any supplier recovery in the second half.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. This is Cleve Rueckert on for Steve. Just looking at your markets, how would you compare the potential for continued strength in oil and gas versus mining? Do they both have the same potential or does one market give you more visibility? And which one do you think would have a bigger impact on Cummins?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Mining seems to be demonstrating a more sustainable improvement path. We have more visibility to it also based on the number of OEMs we serve and our participation in the market, we have more visibility. Again, right now, we don't have long visibility in mining. We don't know where it reaches relative to previous peaks or anything, but it looks like it's on a relatively sustained recovery. And, of course, we're experiencing some of the reasons for that in our commodity costs. We're seeing higher commodity costs coming in as costs which again says that that's more favorable conditions for mining. So, we're seeing some benefit on revenue and some hit on costs.","On the oil and gas side, I'd say we don't see that. First of all, we have less visibility, but secondly in fact, we're seeing and hearing more conservatism in that market. We saw a lot of rebuilds, a lot of redeployment of products, but we didn't see so much new equipment being built and going out in the markets. And what we're hearing is that people wanted to get things redeployed, but there's not a lot of growth in equipment yet. It doesn't mean it won't come, but right now, I think the market's kind of leveling off at best is kind of what we're hearing. Again, there's other people that may be closer and be able to give you more data, but that's what we're hearing.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","And then, just (34:35) mining is about five to six times the size of our oil and gas business, even on current depressed levels.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess just bigger picture going over to some discussion that's been ongoing recently. Can you give us a sense of the relative content or profitability in an electric bus versus a diesel bus?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. I've actually heard that question a fair number of times too. And we will, by the way, be talking at our Analyst Day a lot more about our electrification efforts, including kind of what parts we intend to participate in. But clearly, we don't know yet. I mean there's essentially none sold and those that are sold are ones and twos and they're prototypes. So, we don't really know what the profitability's going to be like. But let me just say two or three words about how we're thinking about it.","We believe that the segments in the market that we serve, some will find electrified powertrains to be advantageous in the next 5 or 10 years, some will not. And so, we don't think that all the markets are going to move. We think they're going to move in phases and some will move relatively soon to at least try some.","And bus is what you mentioned, it's one of the areas that we'll see some activity in buses relatively soon and that we intend to provide a fully electrified powertrain as well as hybrid or range-extended powertrains, we also intend to electrify some of the auxiliaries on our diesel engines and natural gas engines. So, we will be active in the market and we will approach the problem in the same way that we've approached other power solutions problems. We'll look from the customers' lens, try to figure out what their application is and figure out what the best technology to serve them is.","In order to ensure profitability in those efforts, we'll make sure that we have a leading position, which means our technology provides customers with monetary advantage. So, they get fuel economy benefits, they get cost reductions, they get other things of value to them, because that's how we maintain profitability. I don't think one technology is necessarily more or less profitable than the other. What creates profitability is advantage for customers and advantage versus competitors and that's what we're going to see.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you, guys, very much.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I'm wondering if you could talk about the warranty guidance outlook of \u2013 it looks like they're about 3% or so of sales in the back half of the year. I think that's well above the low-2s that you folks have targeted historically and I'm wondering if you've identified incremental products that have product coverage costs coming up in the back half of the year or is this you folks getting recalibrated to the complexity issues that you mentioned? In other words, do you have discrete products where \u2013 that are driving that higher than historical targeted spend in the back half or is that to provide room to execute?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me start on that one, Jerry. First of all, warranty in the second half, we expect to be in the range of 2.7% of sales. We were 3.2% in the first half. So, we're going to be 2.7% for the second half. So, for full year, somewhere at around 2.9% to 3%. As Tom indicated in his remarks earlier, we're dealing with a lot more complexity in the other half in the environment and conditions that these products have to perform in. And while reliability is better and the number of failures is actually lower, the cost of failure is higher. So, we continue to work away at that. We will redouble our efforts to make improvements on it. And I think you will see an improvement as we go through the second half of the year. We're clearly disappointed with what we see in the second quarter and we know that's an area that we're going to have to go after and make significant improvements on.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","It's worth saying that we are not recalibrating our target at all, Jerry. We are adding new tools to get to our target, but we still believe that we can reduce warranty costs significantly from where we are and do it in a way that improves customer performance and customer experience. So, that's what we're targeting. So, we haven't changed and we still see the same kind of targets in reach that we did before, because we made improvement on our prior efforts. So, we kind of took away a lot of challenges and now we're facing new challenges. I think that's just part of being in a competitive industry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And I'm wondering if you could talk about the raw materials in the back half of the year. You folks have been working on reducing your materials spent through reengineering. How much of an offset is that? What magnitude of raw material inflation, pure inflation, are you folks embedding in the numbers and is it fair to assume you're using spot prices when evaluating that dynamic? Thanks.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, so, for the first half of the year, Jerry, we benefited by about 0.7 point in net material cost reduction. It's higher than the first quarter, a little bit more than second quarter. We expect that trend to continue through the second half of the year. And the second half of the year is currently forecast around 0.3 point. So, full year 50 basis points improvement over last year, but on the declining trend as we see an increase in commodity costs in particular.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. I guess a couple questions on the \u2013 back to the implied incrementals in the back half of the year again. You did know we got the warranty. We got China. You noted higher costs associated with investing in technology. Has that changed versus your original assumptions? And can you just tell me what that headwind is as well as quantify the variable comp headwind in the back half of the year? And then, my second question, actually, the implied incrementals in the Power Systems business are pretty healthy in the back half of the year, given that business has disappointed your comfort level there?","And then, my third question, Tom, obviously on M&A, there's been a \u2013 sorry, on M&A, there's been a lot of noise in the clutter with WABCO, with ZF, I'm just trying to get a sense of where you're headed on potential for larger M&A with some of the other players in this space in play. Does that make you feel like you have to be a little more aggressive on the M&A front, because other things could be happening? Thanks.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie. So, let me start with the last one, because I think that's one we've talked about a couple times. The answer is that there has been some conversation with WABCO. Of course, we've paid close attention to that. We have continued with the same strategy on M&A and \u2013 sorry, it may sound a little boring, but same strategy we laid out at the investor conference, which is that we are going to be disciplined about ways to add value through both making sure that it drives profitable growth for the company and does so in a way where we can demonstrate returns over time. And that, of course, means that not only do we have to find \u2013 have a strategy that makes one plus one equals three. It means, if we acquire something, it has to add up to something more than just the combination of the two things.","And, secondly, we have to be able to do it at a cost to generate returns for our shareholders. And so, that's \u2013 as you get, that's a challenge. Having said that, we've been working on it for some time. We have some very good prospects. We are actively working on those. We feel confident that we will be able to make positive moves in the M&A and joint venture front, which will add value to the company.","The size of that will depend on which of our projects succeed, so \u2013 how big each one is. Frankly, we are not trying to make sure that we have a big one. We're trying to make sure that the combination of our organic growth, our joint ventures and partnerships and our acquisitions add up to profitable growth and returns for our shareholders. And so, whether that's in several acquisitions and joint ventures or in one or two is really not our main focus.","So, it is a challenging environment. As it turns out, it's no easier to grow in a profitable high-return way through acquisition than it is organically. They both take a lot of effort and serious-minded work and that's the way we're approaching it, but let me now switch over. Pat, I think you wanted to say a couple words about the incrementals.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Let me just try and answer Jamie's first question. So, if I look at the components that's driving the incrementals in the second half of the year, Jamie, I think the lower joint venture incomes in China, we expect to have about 50 basis point negative impact second half to first half. The higher commodity costs around 15 basis points.","On the technical investment question, probably that's around 25 basis points higher second half versus first half. And then, on the variable comp, I don't have those numbers at hand, but it's probably in the range of 1.5% or 150 basis points higher than the second half of last year. I can't give it to you versus the first-half market, (44:25), but in the second half of last year, variable compensation factor was declining. So, the delta first half to first half versus second half to second half will look worse in the second half of this year, but we can follow up afterwards and get you some more precision on that.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","And I think, Jamie, you asked too, have we changed our outlook on investment in critical technologies. There's no question that we are speeding up some of our investments in both electrification and digital accelerators, the sort of telematics effort. We talked about those earlier. We are definitely speeding up efforts. And the reason we're doing that is we're noting that in some of the shorter-distance markets, the urban markets, there is significant interest from our customers in electrified powertrains and, again, not for gigantic volumes this year, obviously, but it's going to take us some time to get a product range out and ready and we've heard from them and people are interested.","So, we are trying to make sure that our efforts are aggressive enough to make sure we meet customer demand there. So, that's what's happening. It's not a huge amount as Pat said, but it is an increase from what we were anticipating.","With regard to the large \u2013 go ahead, you want to talk about large engine markets, just I'll close that and then you can follow up on that. So, on large engines, we are feeling pretty confident about the mining growth, as the earlier question said, oil and gas, we don't see a lot of \u2013 we're not expecting a lot of growth in the second half, but we are seeing continued strength in mining, which gives us confidence that we'll continue to see some sales growth in the large engine markets and incremental margins there have been good as we mentioned. I mean we had some issues in the second quarter that we think were one-off related, but with regard to engine growth and incremental margins, we're feeling good about that.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's helpful. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question on the North America heavy-duty market share, if you could just talk about the various drivers of that in terms of seeing share come in, in the first half of the year higher than the range you had given and the degree to which some of that is mix-related as we see some mix shift within the industry, otherwise just in terms of preference for the engines and new engines launched recently there, but just to kind of understand some of the outperformance versus initial expectations.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. I think a couple of things. We've seen a lot of variation as the industries move down in build rates through the first and second half of last year, Joe, there's still a lot of volatilities. So, I think we've settled in at more of a sustainable rate. I don't think we're seeing a mix shift in terms of engine displacement. We haven't seen significant changes there. For what you have seen, particularly you've seen one of our customers picking up share that uses \u2013 basically our largest customers picked up share using combination of Cummins and their own engines and that's really helped. That's really helped our position. So, we've got the domestic players picking up share.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. And then on power gen, a competitor talking about some stabilization outside of Middle East. This is another quarter seeing some year-over-year declines, but if you could talk about what you're seeing on the order front, maybe talk about it by region or by major kind of end-market activity, but just whether you've got any signs of some stabilization there, if orders are starting to look encouraging at all.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yes, it's a little choppy in some parts, but the areas that are most troubling are the Middle East. As you said, we were down over 30% Q2 versus a year ago. It's been very tough. Latin America, there's a lot of demand, but we still continued to face question marks about customer liquidity. And so, the net sales are down there.","We are seeing good growth in India. So, it's been a while coming, but within structured investment we're seeing not just in power gen, but in pretty much all of our Power Systems and construction markets. So, India will be up 5% to 10% in power gen this year. U.S. is bumping along kind of low-single digits. In the second quarter, we're seeing strong demand from small RV customers, less demand from the military, pockets of datacenter spends still positive. So overall in the U.S., I'd say low-single digit positive. And then in Europe, it's kind of flattish in total with one or two larger big projects.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","But I think it's fair to say that from a power gen point of view, we would not yet say we're at the bottom and stabilizing. It could be, but we're really looking for some quarter-to-quarter stabilization infrastructure building rates and things like that around the world before we would say okay, now I think we expect things to consistently get better. A couple of times we thought we were at the bottom and stabilizing and then things got a little bit worse. So, I guess, we'd like to see a few more quarters in the power gen space to say that.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Appreciate the details.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Ann.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. A lot of my questions have been answered, the detailed questions. Maybe could get some thoughts from you more strategically on electric vehicles, where you think they will succeed and then versus we get a lot of questions electric vehicles, autonomous, which \u2013 where do you see the opportunities, where do you see the threats for both and do you think autonomous is a reality in trucking at all?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Well, again, we'll spend a fair bit of our time on this in the Analyst Day in Indianapolis. I hope you can join us for that. So, given the time, I'll make my remarks brief. Let me just say that I think both autonomous vehicles if we mean not fully autonomous, but using autonomous technologies are certainly going to be a reality in the trucking market.","So, just as we've seen in car markets, we'll see safety systems come in very quickly and already we're starting to see those and those will increase and offer more, more opportunities for customers in places like yards and ports and places where they want to control how vehicles move around. Those could provide significant value to customers. Over what period of time those will become economically viable and how many customers will buy them, that's sort of the charge ahead. But you know just by the investments that people are making in the truck market that, that technology is moving and people are definitely going to find ways to implement that technology and to try to figure out how to add value for customers.","I think the same is true on electrified powertrains. What an electrified power train looks like in different applications, as I mentioned earlier, remains to be seen, but it'll be driven by how the customer can best operate their applications. So, in places where things go out and back in relatively limited miles, carry loads that are not so heavy, then things like fully electrified or range-extended electrified make sense and especially in urban environments where they're trying to reduce noise, pollution and fueling. So, those are all things that they care about. Electrified powertrains can provide a solution that meets multiple objectives.","And I believe that cities will be pushing for solutions like that, which will mean they'll show up in those areas. And I think it'll happen. In five years or so, we'll start to see some of those buses and pickup and delivery vehicles with electrified powertrains. The question is how many and how many cities really can afford to replace that many of the fleet, that will depend a lot \u2013 on a lot of different factors.","But \u2013 so, I think it's coming, both of these technologies are coming and it will be while we're still sitting here working on it. The question is, in what volume and how many applications and a lot of that is playing out right now. As you heard from me, Cummins intends to be in the middle of those technologies, especially electrified powertrains, because we think we understand customer applications.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And any lessons learned from natural gas? And we've seen new technologies come and go previously, but anything you've learned from prior...","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","It's a great question, Ann. Anyhow, there's many, but let me just put the one out there, which is that infrastructure takes a long time to build. So, the more that your technology depends on common infrastructure or things like it, the less likely it is to occur quickly. The more that local infrastructure or a customer base, customer purchases can allow you to use the technology, the more likely it is to succeed at least in the shorter timeframe.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Thank you. I'll get back in queue and see you in November.","Operator","Thank you.

Are you seeing any mix shift to the heavier engines than you realized in the first half?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Not significantly, Andy. The shares are pretty simple. A little bit stronger in the second quarter. We've seen pockets of vocational customers renewing and they have a strong preference for that 15 liters and I think that's certainly helped in the first half of the year, but on the line haul, no big shift.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. Lot of the questions have been answered.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Steve.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Steve.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Quick question, couple quick follow-ups. I'm just trying to think about sort of the cadence of a couple of these issues. Do you think the warranty expense will be lower in 2018 than it was sort of in the second half run rate of 2017?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, I think it should be. We've got a lot do to kind of plan out 2018, but if we're going to finish the second half of 2017 at 2.7% and then back to comments that Thomas made earlier on that is near and (55:21) where we've been for the last three or four years. So, I would expect it to be lower than that for 2018.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then, I would assume the incentive compensation expense would kind of go away assuming you kind of hit whatever target you set for yourselves in 2018, so that would not be a headwind either?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Right. I mean, that's the idea. We set a plan out, which is based on what we think we can achieve and guidance we give, we set a plan out and if we end up with that plan and that that pays out at a 1.0 (55:53) and that's what we put in plans so everything is as expected. If it's stronger, then we pay out more, and if it's weaker, we pay out less. So, to your point, we reset each year and assuming we hit to the plan in 2018, it would be 1.0 (56:06). Again, the surprise here is that sales growth happened faster than we thought, just as it surprised last year when things were lower than we thought.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Got it. So, you're basically telling me you always want to be paying out more?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","No, I always want to be paying out what we planned.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","All right. Fair enough.","(56:21)","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","On the flip side, I would assume that some of these investment costs, especially for technology-related things, will probably ramp up in 2018 versus 2017?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, we don't know that yet, but that's the way it's leaning. I mean, again what we're trying to do is make sure that we can deliver to customers on two broad new technology areas. One is to deliver much more value in telematics and other services that go along with engines and the vehicles that they operate and secondly, to be able to make sure that we can be in the market in 2019 and across at least several applications in 2020 with electrified powertrains and range-extended powertrains.","So, we will need to increase investments, especially in the electrified powertrains space over the course of the year. How much that is year-over-year, we'll see, but that is a reasonable expectation those costs will ramp up. And, again, we're looking at how we structure that business to make sure that it looks like a long-term growth opportunity for Cummins' shareholders.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, just one quick sort of philosophical follow-up, Tom. I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how big a deal you think the sort of alternative drivetrain market could be, because, clearly, there's going to be some competitors that are going to have fairly deep pockets, perhaps lower cost of capital than you and certainly don't seem in early days always to be motivated by rate of return. Some of them even seem to be willing to set up infrastructure. Thank you for not doing that on natural gas by the way, but anyway I'm just curious if this is one, where you kind of feel like you have to go all in or do you take a more measured approach kind of going forward?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. Here is my view, it's not clear how big a deal it would be and I think we've talked a little bit about some of the reasons and again we'll talk more in November about that, but it clearly depends on how many of the customers these technologies actually give them a better deal. And, right now, it's pretty clear that in some buses, it could. There's a whole bunch of other markets where it's not clear yet, especially because diesel continues to improve, electrified trucks with diesel engines continue to improve, light hybrids continue to improve. So, there's a lot of technologies competing for the same space.","And then \u2013 and I think you can expect from us that we will be all-in in the sense that we will lead in technology. We will not be all-in in the sense that we will not be building infrastructure. We will not be betting on one technology. We'll be betting to serve customers better than others with the range of technologies where the best one is what they need.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Smith, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please begin.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Liz Marin [ph]. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the first quarter of 2015. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We will be available for your questions after our prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in our slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I will start with a summary of our first quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Scott will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Revenues for the first quarter were $4.7 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the first quarter of 2014. First quarter EBIT was $562 million, or 11.9% of sales, compared to $528 million or 12% in the same quarter last year. EBIT percent declined slightly year-over-year with a 50 basis point improvement in gross margin offset by a decline in joint venture income.","Joint venture income declined in dollars and as a percent of sales due to the acquisition of our North American distributors, previously held as joint ventures and an impairment of our investment in off-highway engine joint venture. Joint venture earnings in China increased 20% as we gain market share in truck market. Engine business revenues increased by 1% year-over-year with strength in the North American truck market, offsetting lower demand for trucks in Brazil and in global off-highway markets. EBIT at 9.7% of sales declined from 10.5% a year ago. A strong operational performance from our manufacturing plants and benefits from material cost reduction issues were offset by higher warranty expenses.","As we have discussed in previous calls, we have a very strong focus on improving quality and that implemented changes that will lower our future warranty expense. We expect warranty costs in the second half of this year to be lower than the first half and lower than the second half of last year. Engine business profitability is projected to increase from first quarter levels as sales grow and we capture benefits from quality improvements and other cost reduction initiatives. Revenues in our Components segment increased 6% from year ago, with strong demand in North America driving the growth. Sales in China also increased despite very weak end markets. EBIT at $195 million or 15% of sales was a record both in dollars and in margin percent. We had strong performance from four Components businesses, three of which delivered clear improvement year-over-year.","Distribution revenues increased 55% compared to the first quarter of 2014, with acquisitions adding 57%. Currency reduced sales by 5% primarily as a result of the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, offsetting organic growth of 3%. EBIT for the quarter was 6%, down from 8% a year ago. Currency was the main driver of decline in EBIT percent. A strong operational performance largely offsets the dilution from acquisitions. We expect sales from existing Distribution businesses to increase in subsequent quarters and EBIT percent to improve as we continue to capture strong incremental margins on organic growth.","We're on track to complete three further distributor acquisitions in North America in the third quarter for a total of 10 acquisitions over two years. Based on our current forecast, we expect to add approximately $600 million to company revenues this year, in addition to the more than $460 million added in 2014, exceeding the $1 billion in revenues we projected for this year at our 2013 Analyst Day.","Last year, acquisitions contributed more than 40% of earnings per share and we currently expect to add further 20% this year for a total of at least $0.60 also ahead of our 2013 projections of $0.50 a share. By the end of this year, we have successfully integrated more than 7,000 employees in Cummins and I want to thank those employees for their continued focus on meeting the needs of our customers through this transition.","I'd also like to thank all of our employees who have been working hard behind the scenes to make the integration of these 10 formerly independent businesses go so smoothly. In the Power Generation business, revenues increased by 6% compared to a very weak quarter last year. Gross margins improved year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter.","EBIT improved from 3.9% to 7.2% due to improvements in gross margin and from lower operating expenses as a result of the cost reduction actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2014. We do expect margins to improve further in the second half as we complete the exit of the alternator operations in Germany as planned.","Now, I will comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 17% in the first quarter, due primarily to strength in on-highway markets and distributor acquisitions. Shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 24,000 units in the first quarter, an increase of 8% from 2014 levels.","First quarter market share was 33%. We expect the full-year market size to increase by 8% and project our full-year market share to be 36%, unchanged from our previous guidance. In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 25,000 engines in the first quarter, up 14% from last year, primarily due to higher market share.","We currently project that the market will grow by 1% for the year, consistent with our prior forecast. Our market share improved to 80% in the first quarter, and we expect to achieve full-year market share of 74%, 7% higher than our original projection, as OEMs with Cummins-powered trucks grow market share and we gain penetration at Navistar.","Shipments to Chrysler increased by 2% in the first quarter, and we forecast full-year shipments to be flat compared to 2014, consistent with our view at the start of the year. Our engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 12% compared to the first quarter last year.","While North America is currently the strongest major market for construction equipment sales, all volumes are down as OEM demand for engines was elevated in 2014, ahead of the Tier 4 final emissions regulations, which went in effect at the beginning of this year. Power generation revenues were flat in North America in the first quarter. Sales to the U.S. Military continued to decline as the current contract reached maturity. Our core business excluding Military increased 5% year-over-year. We expect full-year revenues in North America to be flat to up 2%.","Our international revenues declined by 6% year-over-year with lower revenues in Europe and Brazil, offsetting growth in China. First quarter revenues in China including joint ventures were $807 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. The growth was driven primarily by stronger sales of engines and components and on-highway markets despite weak end-market conditions.","Industry demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks in China declined by 33% in the first quarter as the industrial economy slowed and the truck industry continued its transition to NS4 emission standards. We estimate that approximately 70% of the industry truck production in the first quarter was NS4 compliant, up from 50% last quarter.","Our market share increased to 17% from 11% a year ago and shipments increased of our new ISG 10-and 12-liter engines to Foton and we gained share in the medium-duty truck market with Dongfeng. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 50% in the first quarter as we gain penetration of Foton displacing local competitor engines. We're on track to deliver more than 100,000 light-duty engines in China this year representing growth of 28% in a market that is expected to be flat at best.","Our Power Generation revenues increased by 22% year-over-year in a fairly flat market, though performing well and gaining some share in the data center and telecom sectors. Industry demand for excavators in China declined 48% and orders in most categories of construction equipment deteriorated significantly in the first quarter as construction activity continues to contract.Our construction revenues declined by 35%, consistent with very challenging market conditions. ","With weak demand likely to persist for some time, we did impair our investment in one of our off-highway joint ventures that supplies the China construction market during the first quarter. The impairment reflects lower projections for future cash flows than originally anticipated when we formed the joint venture.","Full-year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 15% for the year, consistent with our view three months ago. We've lowered our outlook for the heavy duty and medium duty truck market, and other markets remained weak, but we've made faster progress in gaining market share than we anticipated three months ago to bring an unchanged forecast for revenue growth.","First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $385 million, up 22% year-over-year, primarily due to recovery in the truck market. Industry demand in the truck market increased 33% compared to the first quarter a year ago, and the economy showed some signs of improvement, and truck orders picked up after two years of very weak demand. We now expect industry truck production to increase 15% for the full year, up from our prior forecast of 8% growth.","Power generation revenues in India declined 5% in the first quarter as industry order trends remained weak, especially at the start of the year. We are maintaining our full-year forecast for growth of up to 5% as we see some signs of modest growth and higher risk for our products.","In India, we project total revenues, including joint ventures, to increase 8%, up from our previous forecast of 5%, due to stronger truck demand. Our operations in India have a much wider reach than the domestic market as our manufacturing facilities are an important source of low-cost engines and components that we leverage globally. We expect to grow our exports out of India by more than 10% this year, delivering globally competitive products that are helping the power generation business grow profitably in new markets, for example in Africa.","First quarter revenues in Brazil were $124 million, down 32% from the first quarter last year with a very weak economy exacerbated by low business and consumer confidence. Industry truck production decreased by 49% year-over-year and our engine shipments declined 33% as the medium-duty truck segment in which we are strongest held up better than the heavy-duty segment which declined by 60%.","We have lowered our full-year projection for industry production and now expect a decline of 28%, worse than our previous guidance of down 15%. Very weak production in the second half of 2014 makes for easier comparisons later this year. This explains why full-year production may be down only 28% after such a tough quarter.","In summary, we currently expect company revenues to increase between 2% and 4% for the full year, unchanged from our previous forecast. North America remains our strongest market with India showing tentative signs of improvement. We anticipate weak conditions in Brazil and China this year. The marketing conditions in both countries have dipped further.","Demand in high horsepower markets including mining and power generation also remain weak. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 13.5% to 14% for the year, consistent with our prior forecast and reflecting improvements in future quarters from a number of cost reduction initiatives, particularly in the engine business.","Despite challenging conditions in a number of important markets, we continue to invest in the technology, products and distribution capabilities that will drive future profitable growth. Our successful start to the year in China reflects years of investment and partnership development in that country. We are also winning business in other markets despite weak conditions.","You may have seen the recent announcement from Halliburton that have selected Cummins engines to power the first Tier 4 final compliant fracking installation in North America. This is an important win or an example of the power of combining leadership and technology and emissions capability with a deep understanding of customer support in our distribution business.","Thank you for your interest today, and now, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our first quarter results and full-year guidance in more detail.","Pat Ward","Okay. Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenues were $4.7 billion, an increase of 7% from a year ago. Our strong on-highway markets and the acquisition of North American distributors more than offset weaker investor markets, as well as the negative impact of currency movements which reduced our sales by 3%. All four segments reported growth year-over-year.","Sales in North America, which represented 61% of our first quarter revenues, were up 17% from a year ago, primarily as a result of the higher demand in on-highway markets, along with the impact of acquisitions in our Distribution segment. International sales decreased by 6% due to the negative impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and from weaker demand in both Brazil and in Europe.","Gross margins were 25.4% of sales, 50 basis points higher than last year. The improvement was driven by the stronger volume, lower material cost and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher warranty expense and some unfavorable foreign currency movements.","Selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $37 million from the prior year, but were lower as a percent of sales. Acquisitions in our Distribution segment accounted for $28 million of this increase. Joint venture income of $68 million in the first quarter was down $22 million compared to a year ago, with the impact of distributor acquisitions and a $12 million asset impairment charge offsetting a 20% increase in joint venture earnings in China.","Earnings before interest and tax increased to $562 million or 11.9% of sales compared to $528 million or 12% last year. The positive benefits of the higher sales and more material costs were partially offset by higher warranty costs, lower joint venture earnings and the negative impact of currency movements.","The tax rates in the quarter including discrete items were 26.3% compared to 29.9% last year. Net earnings increased by 14% to $387 million, and earnings per share in the first quarter grew to $2.14, up from $1.83 a year ago.","Now, let's move on to the operating segments to further discuss the first quarter performance and the outlook for the full year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 1% over last year. Strong demand in the North American on-highway markets was partially offset by a decrease in off-highway revenues, primarily related to weaker demand in construction, marine and mining markets. Segment EBIT was $253 million or 9.7% of sales, down from 10.5% last year as lower material cost and productivity improvements were offset by the higher warranty expense.","For the full year, we are maintaining our guidance for revenues to be flat to up 2%. Strong demand in North American on-highway markets including our higher outlook for our market share in the medium-duty truck market is expected to offset weaker demand in Brazil and in industrial markets.","We expect earnings from our China joint ventures to grow as our share of the heavy-duty truck market increases with the ramp-up of our new ISG10 and 12 diesel engines. EBIT projections for the full year remain unchanged at 11% to 12% of sales. For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, an increase of 55% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions contributed 57% growth, with organic growth from higher engine and product sales in Asia Pacific and North America and the stronger demand for power generation equipment in Africa being offset by the unfavorable impact of currency movements.","EBIT margins for the quarter declined from 8% of sales last year to 6%. Margin improvements and existing operations were offset by the negative impact of foreign currency movements, which reduced the segment margins by 170 basis points and by the dilutive impact on the margin percent of the distributor acquisitions. For 2015, we continue to forecast revenue growth of between 23% and 27% over 2014 levels. We now expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 7% to 8% of sale, 100 basis points at the midpoint from our previous guidance, primarily due to currency.","Our North American acquisitions remained on track to exceed the projections provided at the 2013 Analyst Day, as Tom just described. In the Components segment, first quarter sales are $1.3 billion, an increase of 6% from last year despite a 3% headwind from unfavorable currency movements. The higher revenues were primarily driven by increased demand in North American and highway markets.","Revenues in China increased modestly as higher after-treatment sales more than offset the impact of a 33% decline in industry top demand year-over-year. Segment EBIT of $195 million or 15% of sales was a record, both in dollars and as a percent of sales, including from the 13.6% we reported last year. Higher volumes, combined with lower material costs, drove this improvement.","We continue to project revenue growth of between 4% and 8% for the full year, and we are raising our EBIT projections to between 14% and 15% of sales, which is up 75 basis points at the midpoint compared to our previous guidance due to strong performance and cost reduction initiatives.","In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $680 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Organic growth of 8% was partially offset by a 2% reduction due to currency. Year-over-year growth in most parts of Asia, in Africa and in the Middle East more than offset lower military demand in the U.S.","EBIT margins were 7.2% of sales in the quarter, up 330 basis points from last year. Improved operating leverage from higher volumes, along with the benefits of restructuring and from a weaker British pound were the primary drivers of the margin improvement. We are maintaining our guidance for the Power Generation business, with full-year revenues expected to be flat to down 4% and EBIT margins to be in the range of 8% to 9% of sales.","Now, let me summarize for the company overall. For the full year, we continue to forecast total company revenues to be up 2% to 4%, with the continuous strength in North America on-highway markets, with distributor acquisitions and revenues from new products, offsetting weak off-highway markets.","Currency movements are now expected to reduce our revenues by 3.5% when compared to 2014 levels. We continue to project our overall joint venture income to be down 10% as a result of the distributor acquisitions, partially offset by stronger joint venture earnings in China. We expect EBIT margins of between 13.5% and 14% of sales for 2015 and this compares to 13.2% for full-year 2014, excluding the expenses with cost reduction actions in our Power Generation Business last year.","As we indicated three months ago, the first quarter is expected to mark the low point for EBIT margins this year. Improvements in gross margins from material costs, restructuring and higher volumes coupled with stronger year-over-year joint venture earnings in China will drive the EBIT margin this year. An effective tax rate for the full year is forecasted to be 29.5% excluding any one-time tax items.","And finally with regard to cash flow, we generated $173 million in cash from operations in the first quarter, lower than last year as a result of an increase in working capital associated with the higher revenues. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 13% of sales for the full year. The combination of returns to shareholders and capital expenditures resulted in a decline in our balance of cash and marketable securities of $282 million from 2014 year-end levels.","We returned $277 million of cash to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and from the repurchase of 1 million shares and we expect to return 38% of operating cash flow to our shareholders in 2015.","Now, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Okay. Thanks. And I think, operator, we're now ready to turn it over for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Nicole Deblase of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nicole Deblase","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning.","Pat Ward","Hi. Nicole.","Nicole Deblase","So my first question is around what you guys felt with respect to oil and gas this quarter. Did you start to see the deterioration in the first quarter of the year? And if so, has the deterioration continue to Q2?","Rich Freeland","Yeah. Nicole, this is Rich. Actually, the first quarter sales in oil and gas are actually up 67%. Look, it's a bit misleading up, very low comps and we did start to see that deterioration at the end of the quarter. And so, we're now projecting despite a up 67%, 27% drop for the full year. So, we started to see a decline towards the tail-end of the first quarter and we're projecting that going forward.","Nicole Deblase","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question is on the engine margins. Can you guys quantify the warranty headwind that you had during the quarter and what are your expectations for 2Q and then how much of year-on-year tailwind might this be in the second half of the year. If you have any sort of visibility on that would be helpful.","Pat Ward","Yeah. So Nicole, this is Pat. I'll start off and then I think Rick want to say a few words. So in the first quarter in the engine segment, warranty expense was up 1.4% from last year, so 2.6% of sales Q1 last year, 4% of sales Q1 this year.","For the company, warranty expense increased from 2% last year to 2.6% in the first quarter this year. For the full year, we are expecting warranty, as Tom said, to come down as we go through the second half of the year and we'll probably end up around 2.5% for the full year, slightly above the 2.4% we reported last year.","Nicole Deblase","Okay. That's really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thank you. Hey. Good morning, guys.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Tom, I wanted to ask you a little more about China. So, 17% share is an impressive result, I think. What do you think is realistic for the end of the year and into next year for market share? And maybe related, should we expect a \u2013 you talked about a material pick-up in JV earnings. Is it really just the heavy-duty business turning to significant profitability for the rest of the year?","Tom Linebarger","Well, first, let me just talk about market share. I know you were at our Analyst Conference, and the 17% number was what we had projected to say we want to get there by 2018. And somebody asked me, is that your target, and I said, no, my target is 25%. What I'm projecting is 17%, and there's \u2013 because there's risk in all those things. We feel really good about being where we are. 17 years, as you said, it's a good accomplishment. It's where we wanted to be, and that's terrific.","I don't see a lot more market share gain this year. I mean, I think, as we go out of the year in 2017, I'd still feel pretty good because what we will have successfully done is we've got our light-duty business growing well now at 100,000 units forecasted for the year. We've got our heavy-duty business launched, and that product, the ISG is performing really well. And we're gaining some share at Dongfeng back because our engine is doing better in their trucks than some of their competitor engines, and their trucks are doing better. Remember, they were losing all the share with NS4. Now, they are getting some of that back as the NS4 compliance percentage of all the builders goes up. So, those are all good things. Again, I don't project a whole bunch more shift in those markets this year, but we still \u2013 I still have the same target for where I'd like to get over time in terms of market share. Anything you want to add on profitability, Mark, on heavy-duty?","Mark Smith","No, the heavy-duty profitability clearly can significantly reduce or almost eliminate those losses in the first quarter as we've said a quarter ago, so that will pick up. There's still opportunity for the light-duty earnings to grow in China as well as you've said.","Tom Linebarger","Right. Right. And we are still investing in products, so the joint ventures have investments as well as revenues. Both are flowing through there as you know. But right now, the revenues are going a lot better. So, that's why we're seeing better joint venture earnings. And we expect to see step-up in those earnings in China just to be clear and in subsequent quarters which is one of the drivers in engine business margin improvement.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Yeah. Got it. And then, Tom, just about power gen, the quarter itself in terms of revenue growth again gained some optimism after several years of not too much going on outside the U.S. So maybe can you talk about, have we seen or are we seeing any type of inflection in power gen or is that too early to call?","Not really. I mean just to call like it is, that we're not really seeing much of an inflection in power gen. I think what you're seeing in our results is lots of improvement on cost over a long period of time, slower than we would have liked, as you know. But I think we're gaining some traction now in the cost structure and that's why we're seeing better margin. The sales increases are pretty hard fought, frankly. I mean it's really not much better anywhere.","But as we noted, we have a little bit of optimism about India, but even that is pretty early and its optimism in that borders. So, we've got a little bit of signs but not much and most of them are pretty subdued. So, there really hasn't been much change in the markets, I'd say.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. That's helpful.","Tom Linebarger","Just to add to that, Andy. The story in power gen is all about improving profitability on the same level of sales right now. So, we feel pretty good about that and we saw the big step-up in Q1, and just recall the restructuring we took in Q4, the maturity of the benefits of that have yet to be realized. So they're kind of second half of 2015, yet to come.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Joel Tiss of BMO. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","Wow. I didn't think I was going to make it. How's it going?","Tom Linebarger","Hi. Good morning, Joel.","Joel Tiss","I don't usually. All right. So, I just wondered if, I guess, maybe it's not a fair question. But can you give us any sense if you feel like you're kind of maxing out in the operating margins in the Engine business? And I'm just sort of like looking back at the long-term history and companies who had engine businesses have kind of gotten to 10%, 11%, and had trouble getting a lot higher than that.","Pat Ward","I'll go ahead and take that, Joel. The short answer is no. We're not capping out. I'd give you just a couple of reasons. So, the implied guidance we have for the rest of the year, if you say we were at 9.7% in Q1 and we have not changed our guidance for the full year, so we'll be in the 12% range for the rest of the year. Kind of 11% to 12%, rest of the year. So, we're going to see increased volume. We're going to see increased JV earnings; we just talked about from the China growth.","The warranty improvement, which has been a headwind for the last year, becomes a tailwind, being second half of the year and beyond. And then our high horsepower engines are down at kind of historically low levels. And so while the heavy-duty truck is up, we still have the tailwinds which are not here, and we're projecting in 2015 but all of our high horsepower markets are quite depressed right now.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And I just wondered, I'm hearing a little bit from other companies about optimism in Brazil getting better in 2016. I'm not asking for a forecast, just sort of flavor of the market. And any thoughts you guys have about Indian strengths continuing into 2016 also.","Pat Ward","Both Rich and I spent some time in Brazil and there was not much optimism when we were there. It doesn't mean it couldn't get better in 2016. It definitely could, but it was pretty bleak. And the problem I think not only is there's some economic weakness, but there was a lot of uncertainty with Petrobras investigation and other things that were hanging over.","There's a bunch of good things in Brazil which could help. They've got infrastructure development, again, coming. They've got a lot of investments potentially to be made in those oil and gas fields. So there's a lot of opportunity for Brazil to get better. But there's also a whole bunch way on it right now. So it'd be really hard for me to be optimistic about fast recovery in 2016. It doesn't mean it won't happen, but I'm not particularly optimistic.","On South America, in total though, I think has a little bit more opportunity. We also spent time in Colombia, in Chile, in Peru, and frankly, some of those markets have more opportunity even in the shorter run. There's mining in those which are a little depressed. But I would say all those markets are moving faster and have a potential to bounce a little bit quicker. Mexico is another. So the region, we see opportunity. Brazil, we hope comes back soon, but it's pretty down right now.","With regard to India, I sort of talked about this, but there's a big infrastructure development program from the new government, a whole bunch of, what do you say, bureaucracy reduction programs and other things that they're trying to do to take decision making times down, all of which sounds awesome. It's a big country to manage and all the stuff that he and his government wants to go are going to be hard to do. So we are very optimistic about the potential and realistic about the timing and pace.","Joel Tiss","Okay. That's awesome. Thank you.","Pat Ward","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning.","Tom Linebarger","Hi. Jamie.","Jamie Cook","I guess a couple of questions. One, with regards to heavy-duty market share I think you said it's going from 33% to 36%. Can you just sort of talk about your line of sight, is this \u2013 and what's driving this, is it a function of one of the major truck or it's just out of capacity, how much is predicated on Navistar?","My second question \u2013 I'm sorry, back to the engine margins, did the first quarter \u2013 I mean you seem confident in your ability to hit I think 11% or 12% for the year, but did the first quarter fall short of your expectations and what's embedded in engine margins in terms of material cost tailwind as well as any cost-related initiatives outside of warranty? And then last, Tom, I think you mentioned quality issues. Can you just correct me if I'm wrong there or elaborate? Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","That's a lot of questions.","Jamie Cook","Sorry. It's been a busy day.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. Let me start and Mark, can you remind me on all the questions\u2026","Mark Smith","Heavy-duty share.","Tom Linebarger","I'll start just with heavy-duty share. So, we're leaving the guidance at 36%, really lower than that in Q1. And as you know, our share is based off of production. So we get some month-to-month variation and quarter-to-quarter variation just what's being produced even versus what's being told.","So, we can't \u2013 we don't have a lot of visibility but we can see into Q2 and we'll see our share go up, so we have some confidence in that, that the share is going up and we can see it in the order books. And it mixes some again between OEs. So \u2013 and it mixes a little bit, our people building 15-liter or 13-liter at a given time. And so, a little more 13 were built in Q1, but we haven't seen that \u2013 those were all demand shifts in that.","Jamie Cook","Okay.","Tom Linebarger","So, with OEs, we're up in some and down in others, and I think you know generally what that looks, but no fundamental change there.","Pat Ward","Maybe I'll jump in and take the engine margin question, Jamie. So, yeah. It fell \u2013 to be honest, it fell a little bit below where we'd like it to be in Q1. We did go off to a very slow start at the beginning of the year. Things picked up as we went through February and March, so I feel good where we're coming out of the quarter with regard to the guidance for the rest of the year. Tom did make some comment about the asset impairment we took in the off-highway joint venture. That was a $12 million charge in Q1 at the Engine business. The material cost of that tailwind we got in Q1 was around 0.6. We expect that to pick up as we go through the rest of the year. So, they were the kind of key highlights, I think, for the Q1 result and why we feel as confident as what we do about the 11% to 12% margin guidance for the rest of the year.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. And Jamie, the cost reduction issue, the material cost, I'll let Mark give you the numbers for material cost. For material cost, things are \u2013 programs are going well. We're seeing good benefits in those. Plants are producing well. We're getting productivity out of plants. And as Pat said, when we look at the February and March numbers, our confidence went up a lot that we're going to be able to hit the numbers Q2 and beyond even though the quarter was below in January. Frankly, it was just below our expectations. The \u2013 and you asked me if I mentioned quality. That was \u2013 are you talking about the impairment charge?","Jamie Cook","Well, I mean, you just mentioned quality. I'm sorry. You're the fifth company that's reported for me today, but I thought you mentioned quality issues. I just want to make sure. Can you just elaborate\u2026","Tom Linebarger","No, no. In fact, the quality issues, I mean, Rich is in these things in detail, so he can comment. But we feel very good about where we are which is why we're sort of constantly projecting warranty coming down the second half but \u2013 Rich, you may want to say few words about that.","Rich Freeland","Yeah, just to recall, we took the rate up in Q2 last year based on the costs for repair being higher than we have forecasted. So, we are tracking each of those improvements to put in place. I've personally looked at them. And then with telematics, we can actually see, are the fixes working as we plan.","So, what we really just need now is the miles to demonstrate the improvements and we're on track with that. So, we're projecting the rates begin to come down second half of the year. We've had no new issues during that time. And in addition, just triangulating talking to customers and say, are you seeing the same thing. I personally talk to dozens of them over the last several months and customers are seeing the same thing.","Jamie Cook","All right. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Rob Wertheimer of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Rob Wertheimer","Hi. I wonder if I can just go back to power gen for a minute. I mean, you answered it generally, but I'm curious about general in specific. I mean, are you seeing any major project activity? There's couple in big countries like Brazil and South Africa, you mentioned Brazil which have maybe strains on goods for various regions. Is there a chance that you see a big backlog of orders building in support of the electric goods and situations like that? And the more specific one, if I'm reading my numbers right; power gen was up like five in 3Q, up one and then up \u2013 I don't have it here, six or something. And stationary power within engine is up like 14, 18, and 31. I just want to understand the reason for the bifurcation between those two. Thanks.","Tom Linebarger","Rob, I'll just talk about the broad project markets. There's not a concentrated project demand now. As you said, it does happen and it happens pretty frequently where there'll be some place where there's grid support needed, and we did have a little bit of that in Brazil last year because the water \u2013 we had water shortages. And again, it could happen again in Brazil. Their grid is very tight. They depend a lot on hydro, and with the \u2013 if there's weak rains, they need more grid support.","Going the other way is their power demand is down because the economy is weak. So their reserve margin is a little bit higher than it was even last year. And so, again, it doesn't mean it wouldn't happen, but it's not as likely as it was last year. And it turned out to be some demand, but not as much as we would have hoped last year.","So there are projects. Telecom is still a pretty active segment. Data centers are still pretty active, but not like they were. I mean, just generally speaking, the global economy is not as strong, and so all this project demand, it exists, but the level is just lower.","Pat Ward","And I think just in terms of some of the details you're getting into, Rob, yes, the Engine business revenues for stationary power were up a lot. First of all, Q1 was a relatively weak comp last year. The revenues have been influenced by a little bit of a pick-up with high horsepower units. So the revenues indicate a much bigger pickup in the market than the actual unit growth. So I don't think \u2013 that's not a sign of something, so much growth rate pickup, just a little bit of improvement at the bottom on the larger gen sets.","Rob Wertheimer","Perfect. Thanks. Bye.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich","Good morning.","Tom Linebarger","Hi, Jerry.","Pat Ward","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could talk about the off-highway pure games opportunity from \u2013 now that Tier 4 Final is being implemented, and maybe throw in how the Hedgehog program is going as well? Based on your comments, Tom, it sounds like you're pretty optimistic on applications in pressure pumping. Where do you think your market share can move to, can you just give us the broader landscape?","Rich Freeland","Let me start, Jerry. This is Rich. Just, I'll start on the Hedgehog. So, we actually are, we're really pleased with where we are on Hedgehog, both in \u2013 we have customers secured, we have products in the field now, in power gen market. We have secured business and will begin shipping products, second half of this year. In the rail side, we've secured customers and customer in commercial marine.","We're feeling pretty optimistic on that again. And again, having the tier, we will have a Tier 4 solution in rail, that's provided that opportunity for us. So, part of our overall strategy is introduce the emissions technologies. And on-highway, we're using those same technologies and bringing these to the off-highway markets. So the Tier 4, we do be believe is an opportunity for share and currently for more content as we had after treatment and other components to the product.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. And the markets, in terms of doing the share, it's \u2013 as you'd know Jerry, its pretty complex picture across all of those segments, all of those regions. But we do believe there's pretty significant share gain opportunity both in terms of this larger engine which we don't even go in today. So, that's just all share gain. Plus, as you know, the components side, where we're getting more content is a pretty clear share gain.","On the oil and gas side, we're still a pretty small player in the overall scheme of things and it'll be several years with this new larger engine before I think we're a meaningful share of the overall oil and gas market. We have a long way to go there and so we're sort of still at the small end of it, finding things to do.","We're just pretty excited about some big customers like Halliburton telling us \u2013 hey, your product is technically leading enough and you guys have the customer support we need that will run that depend on you for this fracking installation. That's a pretty good sign that we're in the markets for real. We're still nothing like the size of some of our bigger competitors, but that's a pretty good recognition of where we come in just a few years.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you. And then, on currency, in components, really strong margins this quarter even though the headwind was greater than in 4Q. Can you just talk about what's worked out well? And then in distribution, do you folks need price increases to push the margin structure and effectively make up for the currency rates, or are there any other opportunities to improve margin distribution?","Tom Linebarger","Pat will give you some more details on the currency and the margin. I just want to say from Components, as we talked about last quarter, we had a dip and we knew we were coming back. I mean, the Components business is just performing incredibly well and we knew we bounced back and this reflects that.","In terms of some of the improvements, they continue to make though, they're still managing costs incredibly well and driving material cost down. And this is one of the areas where we said we were going to focus on material cost and weak market. That's an area where we know we can make progress and it really had a big benefit here. But that group, not only are we getting good content on the sales side, as we talked about earlier, but we're keeping cost under control and performing and executing well on those cost reductions. They're doing a terrific job, and I think that's why you're seeing the results you're seeing. Pat, you may want to add on that\u2026","Pat Ward","Yeah. On the number side, for Components, we took a 3% headwind on revenue. It wasn't such a big deal at the bottom line. It's like $7 million negative at the bottom line. So, if you were to back that, I had a dilutive impact of 0.1 on return on sales. So, we'll probably see that pick up a little bit even through the rest of the year in terms of the headwind which is part of the reason why we gave this is a little bit low in Q1 results, but as Tom said, it was a really, really good first quarter for Cummins. And we're really pleased with that.","The second part of your question around why we're doing our own pricing because this is really on a market-by-market basis. So in some parts of the world, in some parts of Asia, we have these prices to try and offset the problems and headwinds. It's much more difficult in Europe when you're up against European competitors to have built an advantage with the cost structure. So, where we can increase prices, we're doing that and we're really doing it on a market-by-market basis.","Jerry Revich","Just overall for the company, the net earnings from currency wasn't significant this quarter?","Pat Ward","No for the whole country, it's like $10 million, wasn't a big deal.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Timothy Thein of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Tim Thein","Great. Thank you and good morning. Just a follow-up on distribution, there's obviously a lot of noise in these numbers given what you've mentioned with FX but also the amortization. Do you maybe have some kind of, I don't know, just an update in terms of kind of a same-store sales type of metric? I'm especially interested in North America, just given all the movement in terms of the buying of the equity stakes, just how the underlying business in North America which is now pushing 60% of that segment, can you just update us on that, please?","Pat Ward","Yeah. So, I think last year, North America overall, if you know the ownership structure, we'd probably grew it about 9% in North America. This year, it's looking a little slow, it got a little slow with the oil and gas business. But still clearly single digit \u2013 north of mid single-digit growth with the strong parts business continuing. I think on just the revenue growth, if you look at the same-store performance, we're delivering consistently over several quarters, 100 basis points or more in segment margin improvement from strong execution on those incremental sales. So, that's really good. To your point, it is maxed somewhat by the currency in particular. But overall, we're pleased with that performance.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. And, Tim, you're right. There's a lot of noise. But here's \u2013 the simple way to think about it is we have a business where currency is pushing down sales and margins. We've got amortization, which is just a non-cash charge which is pushing down margins, and then we have operating performance pushing forward on margins.","And what we said is that we had about 100-basis-point improvement from just organic performance, just execution on same-store sales. We had about a 1% negative on amortization or just the overall kind of a dilution effect, amortization and dilution effect, and then we had negative currency. So, we feel like the business is performing well. We're putting them in. We're getting the revenue and dollar growth. We're getting the operational improvements.","And we just got some headwind. And the headwind on currency all sits in the distribution business almost. A little bit in components, but mostly in distribution. It's just the way we do our intercompany pricing and that kind of thing. So, it's just creating more noise. Overall, the company is doing fine with currency. I mean, it's a headwind on revenue. It's not a gigantic headwind on margin. It's just it all sits in the distribution business.","So, again, it's going to take a little while for, I think, everyone to kind of peel back these numbers, but the distribution business is doing incredibly well, and we're adding dollar margins to the company better than we expected even and integrating \u2013 we'll have 10 businesses integrated by the end of this year that'll be performing incredibly well.","Tim Thein","Okay. Got it. And just, I guess, somewhat related, can you provide a little bit of an update in terms of just parts sales, what the guidance assumes within engine? I see I'm guessing it's kind of a function of small numbers. But the industrial segment, I guess you're guiding to parts growth there. Maybe just a little bit of color in terms of what's contributing to that.","Pat Ward","Sure. Yes. Overall, we're still projecting growth this year. So, kind of 5% to 7%. It's come from a little bit of pricing. North America in particular, with the heavy-duty truck, medium-duty truck is driving that. And then we've held pretty steady, to date, on our high horsepower. So even though some of those markets are down, to date, we've held just about flat to up a point or two there. So, overall, that adds to kind of 5% to 7%. We're down in areas where the markets are way down. For example, Brazil is a down market right now.","Tim Thein","Great. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.","Pat Ward","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning. In terms of new products, which do you expect to have the biggest impact on revenues and profit this year, and was Q1 consistent with what you'd expect the rest of the year to be?","Tom Linebarger","I mean, just in terms of one single product, there's a lot of them acting different markets. But one single product, definitely the ISG, and then the ISF after that in China. Those are the places where we're seeing brand-new products launched, going from no sales to good sales. The ISG is the 10th and 12th leader in China that we're selling to Foton. And then the ISF is the light-duty engine we're selling from our Foton joint venture both in China and outside of China. So, those are the ones that I think that are having the most revenue growth just on their own, stand-alone basis.","Pat Ward","I guess I'll just add to that. What's included to that is the after-treatment that goes with those products.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah.","Pat Ward","And we're up to 20% share in after-treatment in China, for example. So we've designed new aftermarket products there that have added to it. We got the 5-liter V8, but it's not a big number yet this year. We've introduced it. It was built for sale very late in the year. We talked about the Hedgehog which is again not big numbers yet this year but gaining tractions and then our low kVA business.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah.","Pat Ward","So we feel good about on track with each of the products where we said we would be.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Great. And then on the China heavy-duty JV earnings, how quickly do you think you can get that running to kind of $10 million, $12 million a quarter profit from essentially to kind of breakeven levels now?","Pat Ward","Yeah. I mean it'll be profitable. As we said, next quarter, we're there. When we get to $10 million to $12 million, we don't have a forecast we can give you on that yet, but we are moving towards profitability. We will get a good profit stream out of that product. It's just we don't have that \u2013 the date for that number yet.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Yeah. Good morning. Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Good morning.","Pat Ward","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","I just had a couple of questions. Just on Components, I mean, your biggest customers saw a nice bump in parts margin by selling more company-branded parts. That was one of the reasons. And I was wondering, could you \u2013 how was market share trending in Components over the last 6 to 12 months? Do you feel like you're at any risk of losing share in Components as Packard build more of its engines internally?","Tom Linebarger","Well, two comments. First, just with your opening comment, we may be confusing two things. One is the Components business is a new equipment sale and a parts business. I think you know that. So we are \u2013 we sell our components as our brand always and then of course we also have an aftermarket business associated with those. I think that's \u2013 but just to make sure.","So with regard to our components business, as other companies\u2019 make their own engines, that \u2013 if we lose our engine sale, we gain most of the time in the components side because most of them use some of our components. Packard is the one example you mentioned, so the MX engine uses several important components from Cummins.","And we think that's one of the ways that we want to support these OEMs. And so we definitely want them to buy engines if they need engines and we also want to help them with their engines and we've got a bunch of component technologies that can help them make their engine successful and we're willing to go both \u2013 do both things with customers which I think makes us a better partner than if we were only willing to do one. So in the MX, where every time an MX is sold, we feel good. We have good business with them on components.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thanks a lot. And then just maybe shifting to the Off-Highway market specifically construction and in North America, CAT seem to benefit from big dealer and stock event that seems likely to unwind later in the year. Do you see the same thing at all? Are you worried about destocking in construction in North American and do you find that your North American Off-Highway customers are leaning heavier for price concessions because I'm hearing a lot \u2013 a little bit more about increase price competition downstream in North American earth-moving equipment market.","Pat Ward","What I would say, North America represents probably the most stable to positive global market equipment sales for construction equipment. Its low-single digit, we think. Our issue is really that OEMs ordered a lot of engine last year. They use their engines credits to build products ahead of the Tier 4 final regulations. So, I think the market is stable to improving very modestly, but our businesses and new engine sales are impacted by that transition.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. And we don't do any dealer stocking in this area. So, it doesn't mean that our end customers don't, but we're not doing any of that. I think that's probably obviously it works. So, we don't have any dealer stocking kind of issues.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Pat Ward","With your question on pricing, just to close on that, generally, as a Tier 1 supplier, we have long-term agreements with each of these. So, it's kind of the retail pricing pressure in the components business. We don't feel that.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you.","Pat Ward","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alexander Potter","Hi, guys.","Tom Linebarger","Hi.","Pat Ward","Hi. How are you doing, Alex?","Alexander Potter","I'm doing okay. I guess a follow-up to that question, if you were to look at North America, kind of all of your off-highway businesses put together. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts, a lot of different segments. There's oil and gas in there, but there's construction, there's mining, everything. If you were to put that all together, would you expect that to be up in 2015 or flat or down? I guess, what are you seeing in that regard?","Tom Linebarger","Down slightly overall. Oil and gas will be down 20% from Q1 levels. It will be down a little for the full year. Mining will be down a little bit for the year. Construction for us will be down. But it doesn't leave many of the significant pieces. Probably commercial marine will be about flat. So, in aggregate, a little down part \u2013 will be part to offset lower equipment sales. But low-single digit down, I would say, Alex.","Alexander Potter","Okay. Fair enough. And then the 100,000 units you were alluding to at the Foton joint venture, that's just for light-duty, I gather, but is that just for domestic sales in China, or does that include exports as well in that total number?","Tom Linebarger","That's just domestic. We're trying to call out what we're doing in China versus the market will be for the 130,000-plus. Now, some of those other markets like Brazil and which were down a little this year, but still overall for the volume.","Alexander Potter","That's market volume, yeah.","Tom Linebarger","Yes.","Alexander Potter","So 100,000 to China, and then another 30,000, 40,000 elsewhere is what the kind of base numbers are.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah.","Alexander Potter","Okay. Very good. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Tom Linebarger","All right.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks for sneaking me in. Good morning, everybody.","Tom Linebarger","Hi, Andy. You're welcome.","Andy Casey","Just a question on pricing, but looking at regionally specific stuff within the U.S. through your distribution lens, are you seeing any incremental pricing in some of these annual contracts in the energy market \u2013 price down, I mean?","Tom Linebarger","In the Energy and Power Gen market, you mean?","Andy Casey","Yes.","Tom Linebarger","Okay. Oil and gas, okay. Oil and gas. That's not the structure of our contracts. I mean, I'm not saying that some of our customers aren't seeing that, Andy. Maybe, Rich, you have a closer view. But right now, we're not getting much visibility to that. What we're seeing \u2013 our structure of our products is that we're selling engines in, and the equipment sale then gets made, and then somebody else is running the energy contract.","It's obvious, though, that the market is under severe pressure, as Rich was describing. And so I would be shocked if there aren't negotiations on operating prices and things like that. But for us, our engine pricing is holding up fine. The equipment pricing is holding up fine. It's just volumes. It's just dropping like its down now.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you, Tom. And then looking at the North American truck market a little bit, you've got this kind of nuance with the orders. I'm just wondering, are your customers asking Cummins to increase production rates for the second half, or is it just kind of stable when you get a little bit higher mix?","Rich Freeland","We have our customers have to come to us, and again, we're seeing it in Q2 to increase the rates to increase our share with them.","Tom Linebarger","Second half of the year is out ahead of where our order board is, Andy. But second quarter, as Rich said, is what we can see, and that's where we can see the increased orders and ask \u2013 and request for us to build more. They're building more, of course. They're increasing their production rates, and then they're asking for more engines from us.","Rich Freeland","You won't see it in a month, so much for going with that product.","Andy Casey","Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.","Tom Linebarger","Yeah. All right.","Pat Ward","Thank you.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, everybody. Appreciate your questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Smith, Vice President of Financial Operations. Sir, you may begin.","Mark Andrew Smith - Vice President, Operations Finance","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins's results for the second quarter of 2016. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions at the end of our prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in our slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's presentation are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I'll start out with a summary of our second quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.","Revenues for the second quarter were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter EBIT was $591 million, or 13.1% of sales compared to $721 million or 14.4% in the same quarter last year.","We made strong progress in our cost reduction initiatives in the second quarter as benefits from restructuring actions, material cost reduction initiatives and improvements in product quality helped to mitigate the impact of weak demand in a number of important markets.","Our decremental EBIT margin was 27% for the second quarter and 23% for the first half of 2016 compared to our full year guidance of 25%.","Engine business revenues decreased by 14% year over year, primarily due to lower demand in heavy and medium duty truck markets in North America. EBIT of 10.3% of sales declined from 12% a year ago, as strong operational performance and benefits from restructuring, material cost reduction initiatives and a 90 basis point improvement in warranty costs were offset by the impact of lower volume.","Second quarter results include a $39 million increase in our provision for a product campaign that we initially recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. As we previously discussed, this provision is for a quality issue related to a third party after-treatment system that's impacting the performance of some of our engines in vehicles produced by one of our OEM customers.","The increase in our provision reflects a more conservative approach to protecting vehicle owners with a higher proportion of vehicles now planned to have full replacement of after-treatment system hardware than we had originally anticipated, resulting in a higher estimated cost for the campaign. Discussions over how the cost of this campaign should be shared with our OEM customer are ongoing.","Revenues in our Components segment decreased 8% from a year ago with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 17% due to a stronger demand in the truck market. EBIT of $190 million or 14.9% of sales declined from $223 million or 16% as the impact of lower volumes offset the benefit of material and other cost reductions. Earlier today we announced the closure a filtration manufacturing facility in Turkey as we continue to implement plans to improve our cost structure.","Distribution revenues increased 3% compared to the second quarter of 2015. The positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015 more than offset the negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets. EBIT for the quarter of 5.6% declined from 7.6% a year ago, due mainly to the negative impact of currency and weaker organic sales. Last quarter we announced our plans acquire the last remaining distributor joint venture in North America and we currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year.","Revenues for the Power Systems business declined by 16% year over year, with lower sales in most regions due to weaker demand in power generation, commercial marine and oil and gas markets. EBIT declined from 11.6% to 9.8% a year ago as the impact of lower sales more than offset an 18% reduction in operating expenses. EBIT did improve from 5.7% in the first quarter, due to good operating leverage on incremental sales and strong cost control. We continue to make progress with our plans to close three Power Systems manufacturing operations in India, Mexico and the UK. Our actions in India and Mexico will be completed in the second half of 2016.","In the UK we are on track to commence assembly of high horsepower generator sets at our Daventry Engine Plant in the fourth quarter of this year, a key milestone in the first phase of our closure plan for our assembly operations in Kent. There will be both expenses and savings in the second half of 2016 associated with these actions that will improve our cost structure when complete.","Now, I will comment on some of our key markets starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 13% in the second quarter, due to weaker demand in on-highway markets especially heavy duty truck. We shipped 16,000 engines to the North American heavy duty truck market in the second quarter, a decrease of 43% from a year ago.","We have lowered our projection for full year industry production to 200,000 units at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 210,000 units, as weak industry orders and high dealer inventories are likely to cause OEMs to lower their build rates in the second half of the year. Our market share through the end of June was 28.9%, and we expect our full year market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, unchanged from our projection three months ago.","In the medium duty truck market we delivered almost 21,000 engines in the second quarter, down 20% from last year as our customers produced at a lower rate compared to the overall industry. Our market share through the end of May was almost 75%, slightly ahead of our full year forecast of 74%, which is unchanged from last quarter. We have lowered our forecast for full year industry production to 117,000 units, down 6% compared to both 2015 and our prior guidance for 2016, as the growth in new orders has leveled off in recent months and OEMs are trimming build rates.","Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck customers increased by 18% in the second quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 4% to more than 33,000 units. Sales also increased to Nissan, following the launch of our five liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2016, again unchanged from our prior forecast.","Our Engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 30%, compared to the second quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand from rental companies for new equipment has declined due to weakness in the oil and gas market. Power Systems revenues declined 9% in North America in the second quarter due primarily to lower engine orders from oil and gas customers, which more than offset 4% growth in Power Generation.","Our international revenues declined by 4% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and the Middle East. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $940 million, an increase of 3%, with growth in on-highway revenues partially offset by the depreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for power generation equipment and industrial engines.","Industry demand for heavy and medium duty trucks in China increased by 21% in the second quarter. Our market share in the second quarter was just under 15%, level with last year. Although demand from Foton for our heavy duty ISG engine increased year-over-year, growth in shipments to our other primary partner, Dongfeng did not keep pace with the market.","One truck OEM in particular is being very aggressive on pricing this year and has increased its share at the expense of several OEMs including Dongfeng. We now forecast full year industry sales to grow by 9% for the year, up from our prior forecast of a decline of 4%, as industry sales were well ahead of our expectations in the first half of the year. Visibility to demand in the second half is limited and we remain cautious until we see broader improvement in macroeconomic indicators.","Shipments of our light duty engines in China grew 14% in the second quarter, compared to a 6% decline for the overall market as we increased penetration at Photon, displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market was almost 7%, up more than 100 basis points year-over-year. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, unchanged from three months ago.","Industry sales of excavators in China decreased by 11% in the second quarter, as sales moderated from inflated first quarter levels following the transition to Tier 3 emission standards that came into force in April. The overall numbers of excavators sold remains very low with no obvious catalyst for significant growth in this near term.","Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 25% in the second quarter reflecting weak demand in mining, marine and power generation markets. Full year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to grow 3% for the year, up from our prior forecast of flat, due to stronger demand in the heavy and medium duty truck market.","Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $423 million, up 9% year-over-year, primarily due to strong demand in the truck market, which more than offset the impact of a weaker rupee. Industry demand in the truck market increased 22% as the economy continued to improve. Our market share in the second quarter was 44%, up from 42% a year ago, and our penetration with Tata increased to 78% from 73% a year ago. We now expect industry truck production to increase 15% for the full year, up from our prior forecast of 10% growth.","Power Systems revenues in India declined by 6% in the second quarter with a weak rupee offsetting volume growth. We currently project full year revenues across all segments and including joint ventures to increase 5% in India, up from our prior forecast of up 1%, due to a stronger truck demand.","Second quarter revenues in Brazil were $80 million, down 27% from the second quarter last year, as the economy remains in recession and the real depreciated 14% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 12% year-over-year, while our engine shipments declined 30%. Industry production for heavy commercial vehicles greater than 15 tons increased in the quarter while medium and light vehicles, in which we have a higher market share, declined significantly. We project full year industry truck production to decline by 20%, unchanged from three months ago. Revenues for our Power Systems business in Brazil declined by 45%, due to the continuing economic challenges in the region.","Our sales in the Middle East also declined by more than 30% in the second quarter, primarily impacting our Power Systems business and reflecting a slowdown in infrastructure investments in the region.","Clearly, we are facing challenging market conditions; however, in the face of a 43% decline in shipments to North American heavy duty truck market and very weak conditions in most of our end markets, strong operational performance and execution of our cost reduction initiatives enable us to deliver EBIT above 13% of sales in the second quarter.","Looking forward, we now expect company revenues to decrease between 8% and 10% for the year, lower than our prior guidance of 5% to 9% due to a lower outlook for truck production in North America and weaker demand in power generation and off-highway markets. Revenues in the third and the fourth quarters of this year are projected to be lower than second quarter levels and we continue to identify opportunities to further improve our productivity and lower our cost structure. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, unchanged from our prior forecast, reflecting full year decremental EBIT margin of 25%.","In the first half of this year, we returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and our Board of Directors recently increased quarterly dividend by more than 5%, all consistent with our plans to return 75% of operating cash to shareholders.","Thank you for your interest today and now I'll turn it over to Pat who will cover our second quarter results and full year guidance in more detail.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Tom and good morning, everyone. I would like to make clear to everyone that the results I'm about to share reflect the recently reorganized business segments. A copy of the restated segment financial results for prior periods referred to in my comments can be found in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website.","For the second quarter, revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our second quarter revenues declined 13% from last year, due primarily to lower demand in North American on-highway truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets.","International sales declined by 4% from a year ago due to weak demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment. While revenues grew in India and in China, this was more than offset by weaker demand in Latin America and in the Middle East.","Gross margins were 26.4% of sales, a decline of 20 basis points from last year. The negative impact of lower volumes and unfavorable product mix were offset by material cost savings, benefits from restructuring actions and lower warranty expense.","Selling, admin and research and development expenses of $679 million or 15% of sales, decreased by $24 million from a year ago but increased as a percent of sales by 100 basis points as sales declined. Joint venture income of $88 million decreased by $6 million compared to last year, primarily due to the acquisition of North American distributors, previously held as unconsolidated joint ventures.","Other income and expenses, including interest income, netted to an expense of $50 million in the quarter, including the increase in the provision for a quality issue relating to a third party after-treatment system that Tom referred to early.","Earnings before interest and tax were $591 million or 13.1% of sales for the quarter, which equates to a 27% decremental margin when compared to our record $721 million or 14.4% of sales that we reported last year.","For the first six months of the year, decremental EBIT margins are 23%, slightly better than our target of 25%. Net earnings for the quarter were $406 million or $2.40 per diluted share, compared with $2.62 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.7%, lower than a year ago, due to the change in the geographic mix of earnings.","I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the second quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $3 billion, a decrease of 14% from last year. On-highway revenues declined by 15%, due to a reduction in heavy and medium duty truck industry production in North America, partially offset by stronger sales to bus and pickup truck customers. Off-highway revenues declined by 9%, primarily due to a decline in the construction and the marine markets.","Segment EBIT was $206 million or 10.3% of sales compared to 12% last year. Material cost savings, lower warranty expense and the benefits from previous restructuring actions offset the negative impact of lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. Included in the results for the second quarter in the Engine segment was a $39 million charge to increase our estimate for the loss contingency recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding this additional provision, segment EBIT would have improved over last year despite the 14% drop in sales.","For the full year 2016, we expect Engine segment revenues to decline by 9% to 12%, primarily due to weaker truck demand in the truck markets in North America. 2016 EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 11%, compared to 9.9% for the full year 2015, excluding restructuring and impairment charges. The expected year-over-year improvement in EBIT percent is primarily due to lower warranty cost, benefits from the restructuring actions and material cost reduction initiatives.","For the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, which increased 3% compared to last year. Prior year acquisitions contributed 8% to the sales growth, partially offset by a 3% decline in organic sales, and a 2% negative impact from currency. Engine and service revenues declined in the quarter as demand for new engines and rebuilds remains weak in off-highway markets, especially in oil and gas and marine markets.","EBIT margins for the quarter decreased from 7.6% to 5.6%, due primarily to the unfavorable impact of currency and lower organic sales.","On our prior earnings call we shared our plans to acquire the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor. We currently expect to complete the acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2016.","We are updating our full year revenue guidance now to be between down 1% and up 1%, incorporating the new acquisitions and reflecting continued weakness in off-highway markets, especially in North America and weaker power generation sales in the Middle East. We expect full year EBIT margins to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% of sales.","The Components segment recorded revenues of $1.3 billion, which declined 8% from a year ago. A 17% increase in revenue from China along with increased revenue from Europe, helped to partially offset a 17% sales decline in North America.","Segment EBIT was $190 million or 14.9% of sales, compared to 16% of sales a year ago. Strong operating performance, material cost reductions and the benefits from restructuring actions helped to partially offset the impact from weaker sales in North America, lower pricing and the negative impact of currency. We currently expect full year revenue in 2016 to decline by 6% to 9%. EBIT guidance for the full year is unchanged from before, and is expected to be in the range of 12.75% to 13.75% of sales.","In the Power Systems segment, second quarter revenues were $921 million, down 16% from last year. Sales declined 20% in international markets, primarily due to lower demand for power generation equipment in Asia, in the Middle East and in Latin America. Sales in North America declined 9% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower oil and gas demand. EBIT margins were 9.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 11.6% last year, primarily due to the much lower demand across most of our markets.","We currently expect full year revenues for the Power Systems segment to decline between 12% and 14%, with EBIT in the range of 7% to 8% of sales. Forecasted year-over-year volume declines, the negative impacts from a competitive pricing environment in international markets and additional expenses related to new cost reduction actions in 2016 will more than offset the benefits of restructuring and material cost reductions.","We're now projecting total company revenues to be down between 8% and 10% in 2016, which is lower than our prior guidance of down 5% to 9%, due to a weaker outlook in North America and a softer demand in Power Generation markets. Declining production in the North American truck markets and weak demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue for the full year.","We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% of sales, unchanged from our prior guidance. Cost reduction initiatives across the company will mitigate the impact of weaker revenues. Joint venture income is still expected to be flat compared to 2015, and we now expect our effective tax rate to be 27% for the year.","Turning to cash flow, cash generated from operating activities was $471 million in the second quarter, better than the same quarter last year by $75 million, primarily due to lower working capital. For the first six months of the year, cash from operations is $734 million, compared to $569 million at the same point last year. We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales.","Capital expenditures were $189 million for first six months of the year, and they are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million for the full year. And year-to-date, we've returned more than $1 billion to shareholders which includes the repurchase 6.7 million shares, and as Tom said recently, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend of 5% to $1.025 share, consistent with our plans to return 75% of full year operating cash flow to shareholders in this year.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Andrew Smith - Vice President, Operations Finance","Okay, thank you, Pat, and now we are ready to move to the Q&A part of the call. If you could limit your questions to an initial question, one follow-up, and then get back in queue, please. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Jerry.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Can you talk about India, your IV regulations. You stand to have a pretty good market share just based on your own engines, for the SCR systems, do you have other opportunities to sell the SCRs systems to other market participants? Do you have any contracts locked in, can you just flesh out the opportunity for us?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Jerry, this is Rich. The first most visible opportunity as the emissions come in will be in the components area on fuel systems. So we will introduce our own fuel system as we move to the BS IV standard in April next year. That's a new opportunity for us. So most of the growth we'll see will be on the component side with our own engines to start with. Again, our goal is \u2013 we feel pretty confident as we have seen in other markets that one, we'll add more content with components but also grow share as the standards get tougher as we start with a good platform there.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we do, Jerry, have opportunities to sell our emissions control systems to other participants. As you know, the market \u2013 Tata has a very strong market share. So compared to other markets we participate in that incremental opportunity is less because it's just fewer participants with significant share.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then secondly, in Power Systems, so big changes to the manufacturing footprint this year, cycle time reductions and out of the UK consolidation. What sort of cost reduction run rate should we be thinking about exiting 2016 compared to where we are at this quarter once all the costs that you alluded to, Tom, with the transition are done with?","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're still figuring that out ourselves, Jerry, from a fourth quarter point of view. As I mentioned, as we've worked through the plans, we are now confident that we're going to have the high horsepower assembly for gensets out which was the biggest portion of the work. But we still have some other smaller lines in there to move, plus we've got to figure out all the actions we need to take with regard to supply chain logistics. So we just haven't zeroed in on the number about where we are going to be at the end of the year. Maybe as we get closer, we do the third quarter earnings we'll be able to give you a better view of that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","I think in general, Jerry, through the end of the year, the benefits and the costs will be pretty close through this year and most of the benefits will then begin to go net positive in next year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. Two questions, I will just ask them both at once. Does the shift in capacity at Power Systems say anything about your long-term view on those markets? We had thought some of them would be stronger years ago. Just curious if you've moderated the long-term outlook or structurally reduced capacity? And second, can you talk a little bit about what drove the resegmenting? Thank you.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, maybe I will start with the long-term view, Rob. As we discussed, before, our view of power generation business continues to be bullish long term, but what we've noticed is three things. First, that we have reset our overall view about growth in emerging markets to \u2013 moderated those over prior views. I think that's not a surprise. Everyone has probably done that. And then secondly, the time it's going to take to recover, looks like it's going to be longer and that's, year-by-year, we've been pushing that out, unfortunately which is one of the reasons we are in a bit of a catch-up mode in power generation but we basically said we need to act now, because the recovery of the markets doesn't seem imminent.","And I think the third thing that we talked about before is that one of the things that our company feels strongly about is when we have downturns, we want to use those as opportunities to improve the efficiency and productivity of our operations. So we think by combining our generator set assembly, for example, with our high horsepower engines, that we will be able to restore the same capacity, if not more, but reduce costs and reduce inefficiencies related to the supply chain. So we're going to put the entire capacity of that assembly line in the Daventry plant. We're going to save shipping. We're going to save test time. We're going to save logistics coming into the plant. So there's a whole bunch of opportunities and we just couldn't make those changes when the market was strong. You can't reduce capacity for long enough to actually consolidate plants. So, again, this is not the only one like that, but many of the operations changes that we're taking now are opportunities that we can take advantage of because markets are slower, so we can manage the inventory and things and the demand much better. And then our hope is as markets improve, we're then able to supply even greater capacity but at much lower cost and at better efficiency. That's what we are aiming for through this effort.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","And I would just add that demand for the new 95-liter engine is actually ahead of plan this year. It's a bright spot in very tough markets.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's perfect. Could you remind me, Mark, what is that \u2013 is that on sale in \u2013 how many end markets is that on sale in?","Mark Andrew Smith - Vice President, Operations Finance","Three right now. So power generation is the largest, rail and marine.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the segmenting \u2013 you asked about the combining of segments, that really reflects the fact that as I was talking there about the opportunities for efficiency between the high horsepower engine division, and the generator set division, where 50% or more of the engines are consumed. So the same kind of idea I talked with the Daventry plant, we are trying to get that same opportunity, engineering processes and new product processes as well as manufacturing and supply chain. So our idea was now that business is lower, we have the opportunity to make some of those changes and combinations that maybe would have been harder to make and we also, in the meantime, can reduce overhead between those two divisions at a time when that's sorely needed given where the markets are today.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Makes sense. Thank you.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Mark Andrew Smith - Vice President, Operations Finance","Hello, David?","Operator","Pardon me. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hi, guys.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","I was wondering, you bumped up that loss contingency again this quarter. The supplier issue that you have alluded to again here over the last couple of quarters. Just wondering how, if it's possible to sort of frame up how big the problem potentially could be or if this is sort of the last time that you see this resurfacing and impacting quarterly results?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Hey, Alex, this is Rich. Let me try to do that. So it's a unique situation that we have here, where we have our engine with a different after-treatment system. In fact, we don't do that anywhere else except for in this one market. So that's the uniqueness of it. We took the charge in Q4 as you recall, and estimated at that time, and we kind of voluntarily went to the market, both for the customers to get ahead of this, and we thought we could fix it with more of a software fix. Now we've concluded that a hardware fix will be more effective and the right way to go, and so that's what we've protected for. So this is kind of the high end of what we would expect to see here. You also note that Tom commented we have not concluded our discussions with the partner, given this is a complicated system, we're selling of which we're one piece of it. So there will be some cost sharing done in this. Those discussions are still ongoing.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","To your point, we always try to give you an estimate that represents what we think the exposure is in in full. So we definitely do not want to have situations where we have to come back and increase or change the exposure. So we're trying to be accurate and conservative. And as Rich said in this case, the technical fix needed to change. And by the way, we have complete agreement with our customer about what the right activities are to protect the end customer. So that's good, we are working on that. We've agreed that we know the hardware replacement is the right thing to do, that's \u2013 we're on with that. And so we feel comfortable that the actions we're taking are the right ones and that we've provided for them correctly. There's no way I can say there's no chance we'll ever increase, but we are trying to give you an estimate that says this is the full exposure, and as Rich said, our hope is, based on negotiations with the customer, we'll be able to reduce it","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Sure. Okay, fair enough. The second one is on the profitability of the Engine joint venture. So if I'm looking at things correctly here, I know there's been some resegmenting and I don't know how that maybe impact how the segment disclosure comes out. But the number that we're looking at, it looks like the margins of those joint ventures have been doing pretty well recently and I'm wondering if that's just a function of increased volume or any other factors that you would call out and then whether these relatively high margins can be sustained? Is there any reason that they would move up or down or sideways from here? Thanks.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","I think the joint venture earnings didn't grow, Alex. I think you look in the Engine business, they just represented a higher proportion of sales because the sales have dropped. So, in fact, earnings are pretty level in most parts of the world. There's currencies impacting the underlying improvement of earnings in China, for example. So there isn't a significant change in the underlying profitability of the businesses going forward","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Understood. Thanks, guys.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jamie. Good morning.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess my question, Tom or Pat, you guys can handle this. As I look at Cummins earnings in 2017 given the severity of the downturn in most all markets you participate in, your earnings power has been much higher than previous cycles. At the same time, I look to 2017 and I look at where our decrementals are holding, and I guess what I'm concerned about is as we look to 2017 and assuming we don't get a market recovery, is that you've pulled all the levers that you could to hold profitability and 2017 is going to be much tougher. So while I know you don't want to talk about guidance or end market, can you talk about the things in 2017 that you can control to hold the profitability, whether it's incremental restructuring benefits we'll get in 2017, whether it's the North American distributor acquisition, or just your view share on repurchase? Thank you.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, hi, Jamie. Thanks for that. So I'll start off and then Tom or Rich can jump in behind me. I think you know us well enough that we're always looking out for ways to improve our cost structure, and we've made some good progress this year, I think, being able to offset a significant volume decline by driving material cost savings of around, I think we're looking at 1.4%, 1.5% for the full year, and we're taking warranty down. And warranty I believe for the first half of this year as a percent of sales might be the lowest in the last decade. So we are making some good progress there.","So, that's going to continue, I think, regardless of what's happening with the markets next year. Clearly we would like to see some recovery, and those markets have been weaker for a while now. But if they don't recover, we'll continue to pursue cost improvement in those areas in particular, material cost and warranty, even though it's still just over 2% of sales, you can do the math and figure out that's $350 million to us. So there's still a lot of money for us to go after there.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would also say, Jamie, that we've got some, there's headwinds of sales, as you mentioned, but there's also some tailwinds. As we've talked about, we've got synergies that we're driving into our Distribution business that have mostly been negative to date as we've absorbed these and now we're heading in with opportunities for positive synergies. We've got some of our restructuring activities that we talked about with the large engines where we've moved from where mostly we're taking the cost actions now and the benefits will come later. Thirdly, we've got the opportunity for the 95, where when we launch engines are more expensive and as we build volume, they'll get better. So there's tailwinds as well as headwinds. And I would just reemphasize what Pat said, is that every single quarter, every single year, we are looking for new opportunities to drive cost reduction and improvement. And again, we haven't run out of ideas yet, and hopefully as long as this management team is here, we will not run out of ideas or probably it's time for a new management team. Because that's what we think our job is.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The one thing you didn't address was, because obviously this is the other topical thing, is you bought a lot of stock back this year, more so in the first quarter versus the second quarter, but the other side of it was your appetite to do M&A. So are we closer on the M&A front? Or if we're in this type of environment, and the M&A doesn't present itself, should we assume that you'll be as aggressive on share repurchase as we look at 2017 versus 2016 to offset potentially some top line dilution?","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, as we talked about in the investor meeting and I'll just repeat here, a couple harder things is it's hard to talk about anything until there's something, and it's hard to say if you are closer until you have a thing to talk about. That said, the work continues and I feel very positive about the work we are doing and feel like there's opportunities for us. And also, we said we are going to be very tight on our view about capital returns, and so if the things don't present themselves in the way that we think we can earn superior returns to shareholders, we will not pursue unattractive acquisitions and we'll just continue to increase returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So, how those work quarter to quarter and year to year depend on what we see in front of us, but right now our view is if we cannot find attractive acquisitions, yes, we'd continue to have high levels of share repurchases, but we feel optimistic that there's opportunities out there for us.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we'll just continue to update you guys on where we sit on them.","Mark Andrew Smith - Vice President, Operations Finance","Yeah.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you. I'll get back in queue.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Joe.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Joe.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","You talked about the first half of the year decremental. I think if you exclude the contingency charge that was about 19% and looking at what's implied for the back half of the year, it looks like that steps up to more like your long-term target around 25%, 26%. Could you just talk about some of the drivers of that shift from first half to second half, the volume impact, any mix considerations or other items you're looking at for the steeper decremental in the back half?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","I'll start this one again, Joe. I think as we're looking into the second half of the year, we obviously see continued pressure on the top line. If you look at the implied sales for the second half of the year, they are going to be lower than the first half of the year. And they are going to be lower than some of those areas where we do have pretty good margins today.","In addition to that, we are going to see, continue to see material cost savings, but not at the rate that we have been booking through the first half of year. They will come down in the second half of the year. And the third element I would throw in there, too, we increase people's salaries in the middle of the year. So there's another cost increase component of this that's also going to play to some extent, not a huge extent, on the decremental margins in the second half compared to the first half.","I'm very pleased with what we've done in the first half of the year at 23%, even with the one-offs that we've talked about, and I'm feeling pretty confident we can at least deliver the 25% that we committed to at the start of the year.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then you kept the guidance for the market share on North America Class A at the range of 27% to 30%. The year-over-year decline that we've seen is primarily driven by lower volumes with Daimler, which you talked about a little bit last quarter. But just as we think about navigating through some of the under production right now in North America Class A, you move into next year and maybe things get aligned with end market demand. Do you think that the most likely scenario is that 2016 is a low point, and do you anticipate that your share moves up after we move beyond some of the under production considerations this year?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, this is Rich. I think what you've seen over this year is a lot of movement in our share with OEs as the volumes change and that drove some different activities. As you'll notice in recent months, that's pretty much settled out now. Where our share is with each customer, and so our approach now is how do we help the customers that are using our engines gain share? And so we're actually quite excited about the changes we've got in 2017 with the improved fuel economy, again, that you're going to see. We're going to have the best service intervals in the industry and the best connectivity. And so we're going to help those customers grow. So I think we do view this as kind of the settling point.","And then also just remind you, the end of next year, in small numbers we'll begin introducing our X12 product. Okay? So our 12-liter product aimed at the low end to the medium bore market, where we haven't really had an offering there. So, again, I think we've settled out for where we are now and kind of start the slow slog of improving share from this point.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mike J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. I just wanted to ask you about your outlook for your medium duty market share. I know you said 74% this year, but just wanted to see if you had any thoughts longer term considering Daimler introducing the DD5 and the DD8 and considering what Ford is doing?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","So, again, we won't give our guidance for 2017 on that. But for this year we'll stay in the same range and we'll see potentially some small reductions in 2017 as Daimler will introduce the MDEG engine late this year and will be seating that into 2017. So there's a little negative pressure there. There also is \u2013 we intend to grow our share at Navistar and so those two will be competing with each other. And then at some point we'll give guidance what the net of all of that is. But don't look for big changes in share through the next \u2013 through 2017.","Mike J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citi. Your line is now open.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. The first question just on high horsepower in light of Mark's comments earlier in terms of the progress at the facility in Seymour. Are you still expecting \u2013 I know you've tweaked the overall guidance number down here today, but are we still assuming a full year decline of \u2013 I think you were at 5% or 6% for the full year. Are we still sticking with that?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","It's more like 7% to 8%, Tim, in overall high-power engines.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","7%, 8%. Okay, got it. And then just second on the JV income forecast's maintained, you did you take up your overall forecast for both China and India and I know there is a lot of moving pieces in there, but just curious, what's kind of the limiting the flow through there in terms of the little better end markets and it doesn't seem to be changing the full-year outlook for earnings, is that a function of customer mix or maybe just a comment on that.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","I think we are just running a little behind flat for the first half of the year. So I think the guidance has come up and so we'll stay close to flat. There are some moving pieces in some of the smaller JVs that don't get the headlines. It's just really noise around the numbers.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Tim, in India, we are seeing good progress in the truck market and that's benefiting our joint venture straight through. The challenge we've had is the Indian rupee just keeps falling against the dollar. So every incremental dollar we make we give X percent back in currency losses but still, I mean, the joint venture is benefiting from a stronger market. That's straightforward. In China, because we have this situation where we are keeping good share. We are doing well with our customers, but our customer Dongfeng is not holding share in the market relative to another competitor, that's kind of offsetting some of our \u2013 the benefit of the market and that's what we are highlighting there.","So, as Mark said, that's just some of the dynamics in the market. We'd of course love our customer Dongfeng to win and our intent is to help them find ways to help them win. But right now, that's what happened in the first half. It just offset part of what we saw as a strong market in China. We don't think that's a long-term trend. We think that will come back over time, but it's just in the first half, and we just don't know what's going to happen in the second half.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay thank you.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Having the additional distributor acquisition in the fourth quarter which will tweak down the joint venture line only.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well a little bit.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","These are small movements.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Hi, good morning. A clarification.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David. You made it on.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Yeah, thank you. The second half of the year, the incremental margin, and I'm thinking of it year-over-year incremental, did I hear correctly, that you're saying the second half decremental is larger than the first half. The math I'm running is different than that, I just want to clarify that. I have second half incremental more like 14% after the first half of the year was 23% or if you want to adjust for the loss, it's like 19%.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","I think if you take to the midpoint of the guidance and assume everything falls that way, you are probably closer to your number than anything else, David. Yes.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Okay, so the decremental is lower in the second half of the year, year-over-year, than the first half? Just to...","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","If you go to the midpoint of the guidance, yeah.","Mark Andrew Smith - Vice President, Operations Finance","It's exactly there.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Okay, and specific to that, I guess, within the Engine business, and using the restates, of course, it seems like you have sales declining $400 million or so year-over-year in Engines. But the profits actually go up $20 million, $30 million. And I maybe want to get back to your comment about the warranty or what would be driving that kind of performance, sales down $320 million to be exact but your EBIT actually goes up, it's actually $34 million to be exact. What is such a big swing year-over-year on the Engine profitability?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Dave. I'll take the first shot at this, so you hit it, the three things. The one is the material cost, we've continued to drive down on that, and that was a little bit heavy weighted to the front end of the year. The other big success is in warranty and Pat said it, the rate of the first half of the year is the lowest we have been in 10 years. We talked the second quarter last year where we took a bump up and said we're going to put plans together and we'd invest a little bit more second half of the year, but those actions would drive warranty down. That's what you are seeing right now.","The third piece is around just our restructuring actions that we took across the company, where we took across the company and tried to get ahead of this back late last year saying we're nervous about the truck market going into 2016. And our whole approach is to react fast when we see that. And so that was the $160 million cost reduction of which given this is our biggest business, much of this hit the Engine business. So those are the three biggest drivers. In addition -","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","The one I'd add to that, it's more significant is the ones that Rich just talked about, if you go back and look at the 8-K that we filed last week, we did explain that in 2016, we'd take another look at how we're allocating some of the corporate costs across the four business segments we've lowered some of the costs that were being allocated to the Engine segment and recognized the Distribution and Components, and they've incurred more corporate support and as result more corporate overhead too. That, by far, is not anywhere near as significant as a material cost of warranty that Rich was talking to, but that would be the fourth leg of the...","David Raso - Evercore ISI","True, true. But year-over-year if it's already restated to last week, that is an apples-to-apples comp now, though, right? You're handling the second half of this year the same as the restated second last year, though, correct?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","No, that's not correct, David. We did not restate 2015 numbers because we believed the way we were allocating corporate overhead in 2015 was appropriate. We did restate the first quarter of 2016.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Okay. So obviously, you officially restated the numbers, but you didn't restate that methodology change?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Correct. Just on that part. And I would just remind you, David, and everyone else that in fact even in the second quarter when heavy duty truck volumes were down 43%, the engine business did, in fact, improve its gross margin in the second quarter. So the improvement underlying is real and pretty positive in tough markets.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","So, I guess last question then. If just hypothetically if engine sales were flat next year, let's say some off highway up, heavy down, however you want to say it, the run rate that you are exiting 2016, would that be, in your mind, a recipe for margins up on flat sales? I'm just making sure how confident you are. Because obviously the material cost, there's some, obviously, debate on how far that carries.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, that's a nice try but you're not going to tempt me into giving 2017 guidance.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","All right.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","As Tom indicated, we'll talk more about this when we get to the end of Q3 and into Q4.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the second quarter of 2015.

Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement on the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our Web site for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available at our Web site, www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. I will start with a summary of our second quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Scott will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the rest of the year. Revenues for the second quarter were $5 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Second quarter EBIT was $721 million, or 14.4% of sales, compared to $657 million or 13.6% in the same quarter last year. This represents an incremental EBIT margin of 36%.","Key to these strong results was an improvement in gross margin of 170 basis points year-over-year. Good performance from our manufacturing and supply chain organizations and solid execution on material cost reduction initiatives improved gross margin. Moreover the company was able to expand gross margin while launching new products and adjusting to weak demand in number of important markets.","Engine business revenues increased by 2% year-over-year with strength in North American truck and bus markets offsetting lower demand for trucks in Brazil and in global off-highway markets. EBIT of 12.2% of sales improved from 11.3% a year ago, due to strong operational performance, lower material costs and higher joint venture earnings in China.","Revenues in our Component segment increased 9% year-over-year with strong demand in North America and sales of new products in China more than offsetting weakness in Brazil and Europe. Revenues in China grew 29% despite a 28% decline in the truck market in the second quarter. As our investments in new NS core compliant products yielded strong results. EBIT of $223 million or 16% of sales was a record both in dollars and margin percent, reflecting strong performance in all four components businesses.","Distribution revenues increased 21% compared to the second quarter of 2014 with the acquisitions adding 6% and currency negatively impacting sales by 6%. EBIT for the quarter was 7.6% down from 10.2% a year ago. EBIT percent decline due to currency primarily appreciation to U.S. dollar against the Australian and Canadian dollars and the dilutive effect of acquiring businesses previously held as joint-ventures.","Excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions operating margins in existing businesses improved year-over-year. More over EBIT percent improved 160 basis points from first quarter levels due to strong incremental margins on organic sales growth. We remain on track to complete three further distribution acquisitions in North America in the third quarter. Our forecast for the positive impacted acquisition is unchanged from three months ago. We expect to add approximately $600 million in company revenues this year. In addition to more than $460 million adding 2014. Exceeding the $1 billion in revenues we projected for 2015 at our 2013 Analyst Day. We currently expect to add $0.20 to earnings per share this year on top of the $0.43 added in 2014 for a total of $0.63 also ahead of our 2013 projections of $0.50 a share.","In the Power Generation business, revenues increased just 1% year-over-year, this low growth reflects a slow pace of global infrastructure investment. EBIT decline from 8.2% last year to 7.6%. The negative impact of currency primarily the appreciation of the U.S. against the Euro and lower pricing in the alternator business offset an 80 basis points improvement from cost reduction action. EBIT did improve 40 basis points from this quarter level. We completed the exit of our German alternator operations in the second quarter as planned and this will yield additional cost savings in the second half of the year. However with weak demand projecting for the remainder of the year a competitive market and continuing challenges from currency, EBIT for the prior generation business for the full year is expected to be in the range of 7% to 8% up from 2014 but below our original projections of 8% to 9% for this year.","Now I'll comment on some of our markets starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 12% in the second quarter, due primarily constraint in on highway markets and distribution acquisitions completed in 2014. Shipments to the North American heavy duty truck market exceeded 28,000 units in the second quarter an increase of 18% from the second quarter last year. Our market share year-to-date is approximately 34.5% up from 33% in the first quarter. Based on current projections from our OEM customers, we expect our full year market share to remain in a range of 34% to 35% below our original projection of 36%. We expect full year market size to increase by 8% unchanged from our previous guidance.","In the medium duty truck market we delivered 26,000 engines in the second quarter, up 18% from last year. We currently project that the market will grow by 4% for the year 3% stronger than our previous forecast. We are also raising our market share forecast with our full year market share now expected to be 76% up from 72% last year and higher than our previous forecast of 74%.","Shipments to Chrysler increased by 5% in the second quarter and we forecast full year shipments increase 2% compared to 2014 up from our previous forecast of flat. Our engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 7%, compared to the second quarter last year. Our revenues will be lower in each quarter of this year compared to last year as OEM demand for engines was elevated in 2014 ahead of the tier 4 file emissions regulation, which went into effect on January 1st of this year.","Prior generation revenues declined by 12% in North America in the second quarter due to lower sales of datacenter and Renault customers. Our global datacenter customers are expanding in Europe and Asia Pacific but the rate of investment in North America has definitely slowed. After several quarters of growth rental customer reduced their purchases as they focused on increasing utilization of their existing equipment with some reports of lower rental activity in oil and gas markets.","Cummins International revenues declined by 6% year-over-year mainly due to the negative impact of appreciating U.S. dollar and weakness in all end markets in Brazil. Second quarter revenues in China including joint-ventures were $916 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. The growth was driven primarily by stronger sales in new engines and components in our highway markets which more than offset very weak market conditions. Industry demands were heavy and medium duty trucks in China declined by 28% in the second quarter and is down by 30% year-to-date as the industrial economy continues to soften.","We have lowered our full year forecast for the truck market to decline 30%, it's down from our previous forecast of down 15% as confidence in the economy has weakened and freight is fairly growing. The good news in this challenging environment is that our market share has increased and the Chinese government continues to plan for the adoption of more stringent emissions regulations which will be positive for our business longer term. Our engine market share is 15.5% year-to-date up from 10% a year ago as shipments of our new ISG heavy-duty engines to Foton increase.","We have also increased share in a medium-duty market with Dongfeng motors. We currently project our full year market share will exceed 17%. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 21% in the second quarter in a market that declined 5% as we gain penetration of Foton and some additional customers displacing local competitor engines. Our market share increased to 6% from 4% a year ago. Our power generation revenues declined by 2% year-over-year in a weak market due to lower infrastructure investment and a low rate of growth and electricity consumption consistent with the weaker economy.","Demand for construction equipment remains suppressed in China due to the slowdown in real-estate development and infrastructure spending. Industry demand for excavators in China declined 34% in the second quarter and is down 42% year-to-date with no visible sign of near-term improvement. Our construction revenues declined by 25% in the second quarter so the impact is small due to low level of business at this point. Full year revenues in China across all segments including joint ventures are now expected to grow 6% for the year down from our previous projection of 15% growth due to very weak demand in most of end of markets. We continue to gain market share and grow our joint venture earnings in challenging conditions and with more emission changes ahead we're well positioned to outperform our end markets and build a sustainable leadership position in the largest truck market in the world.","Second quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $309 million, up 6% year-over-year due to growth in our truck and power generation businesses. Industry demand in the truck market increased 20% compared to the second quarter a year ago as the economy continues to show signs of improvement. We now expect industry truck production to increase 22% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 15% growth. Currently the truck industry is planning for introduction of broad stage for emission standards in the north of India in October this year and countrywide adoption is expected in April 2017 which should present opportunities for further growth for Cummins.","Power generation revenues in India increased 8% in the second quarter as orders improved following two years of weak demand. We are maintaining our full year forecast for growth of 5% for this year. We remain optimistic that government plans for further investment infrastructure should stimulate stronger demand going forward. In India we project total revenues including joint ventures to increase 12% up from our previous forecast of 8% due primarily to stronger truck demand.","Second quarter revenues in Brazil were $110 million, down 43% from the second quarter last year due to the severe slowdown in the economy and near 40% depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production declined by 40% year-over-year and our shipments declined 38%. We have lowered our full year projection for industry production and now expect to decline of as much as 50% worse than our previous guidance of down 27% due to deteriorating business and consumer confidence. We expect our engine shipments to decline by 45%.","Revenues in power generation and distribution in Brazil have held up much better than in the truck business but conditions are very tough across all end markets. In summary we currently expect company revenues to increase between 2% and 4% for the full year unchanged from our previous forecast. We are also maintaining our forecast for EBIT to be in the range of 13.5% to 14%, in this challenging we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter, we gain market share it's an important market to the successful launch of new products and we increased cash return to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases.","Thank you for your interest today, and now, I'll turn it over to Pat, who will cover our second quarter results and full-year guidance in more detail.","Pat Ward","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were $5 billion, an increase of 4% from a year ago. Organic revenue growth was 5%. The distributor acquisitions completed last year by 3% of revenues while currency movements reduced our sales by 4%. Sales in North America represent 60% of our second quarter revenues were up 12% from the year ago due primarily the stronger demand in on-highway markets and from distributor acquisitions.","International sales decreased by 6% compared to the prior year as a result of negative foreign currency movements against U.S. dollar, weak demand in global off highway markets and extremely weak truck production in Brazil.","Gross margins were 26.6% of sales, up 170 basis points from a year ago, strong operating leverage on higher volumes and lower material costs were the primary drivers of the strong performance more than offsetting a negative impact from currency.","Selling, admin and research and development costs of $703 million of 14% of sales increased $11 million from a year ago and was 30 basis points lower as a percent of sales due to good cost control on the impact of currency movements. ","Joint venture income of $94 million decreased by $11 million compared to last year. The acquisition last year of North American distributors for the previously held joint ventures reduced the joint venture income more than offsetting earnings growth in China.","Earnings before interest and tax were $721 million or 14.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $657 million or 13.6% of sales last year. The incremental EBIT margin was 36%, reflecting strong operating performance. Earnings per share were $2.62, an increase of 8% from the $2.43 reported in the same quarter of 2014. The tax rate was 29.5% for the quarter.","Now, let's move on the operating segments and further discuss second quarter performance and the outlook for the full year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 2% over last year.","On-highway revenues were up 8% driven by strong demand in North American truck and bus markets, partially offset by weaker demand in global industrial markets compared to a year ago. Segment EBIT was $341 million or 12.3% of sales, up from 11.3% last year. Reduced selling, admin and research expenses along with increased joint venture income provided the majority of the margin improvements.","For the full year we continue to forecast the revenue for the Engine segment will be flat to up 2% primarily driven by North American on-highway demand. Compared to three months ago we now expect weaker truck production in Brazil and China as Tom just described. We're maintaining our EBIT projections for the full year at 11% to 12% of sales which compares to 11.2% reported last year.","For the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the prior year. Acquisitions in 2014 added 26% to segment revenues year-over-year. Organic growth was more than offset by foreign currency movements that negatively impacted sales by 6%. EBIT margins for the quarter declined from 10.2% last year to 7.6% due to the diluted impact on its EBIT percentage and acquisitions of businesses previously held joint ventures and due to negative impact of currency movements. Strong operating performance and existing businesses added 60 basis points to EBIT margins.","For the full year distribution revenue is now forecasted to grow by 20% to 24%, below our previous guidance of 23% to 27% growth. Due to our more negative impact from currency not anticipated at the start of the year. We are maintaining an EBIT margin for same guidance in the range of 7% to 8% sales.","The Component segment delivered record sales of $1.4 billion compared to the second quarter last year, the higher revenues were primarily driven by increased truck production in North America and in Europe, an increased sales in China of the new National Standard 4 compliant products all of which offset the negative impacts of currency and weak truck production in Brazil and in China.","Segment EBIT was a record $223 million or 16% of sales, up 150 basis points from last year, as a result of excellent operational performance across all four businesses. Strong operating leverage on higher sales and good execution on material cost reduction initiatives help drive the EBIT margin improvement.","We still expect full year revenue growth of between 4% and 8% in 2015. And we are raising our EBIT projections for the full year to 14.5% to 15.5% of sales reflecting a strong performance. And this compares a full year 2014 margin of 13.4%.","In the Power Generation segment, second quarter sales were $747 million, up less than 1% reflecting continued weakness in a number of important markets. Year-over-year international sales increased offsetting lower sales on North America and a 4% reduction in revenues resulting from currency movements. In international market's stronger demand in the Middle East and in India more than offset lower revenue from Russia and from Latin America.","EBIT margins were 7.6% in the quarter, down from 8.3% last year. The negative impact of currency primarily depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar and lower pricing in the alternator business more than offset the benefit of cost reduction actions.","For the full year our guidance range for power gen segment, revenue remains unchanged with revenues expected to be flat to down 4%. Although revenues are up 3% year-to-date weak recent order trends indicate that revenues in the second half of the year will be lower than second half of 2014. EBIT is expected to be in a range of 7% to 8% of sales, going from our prior range of 8% to 9% reflecting a continued headwind from currency and a more competitive pricing environment in some international markets.","Well, guidance for total Cummins revenues to be up 2% to 4% in 2015 remains unchanged. Strong North American on-highway demand increased revenue from distributor acquisitions and growth from new products were more than offset the negative impact of currency and weakness in global off-highway markets.","Joint venture income is now expected to decline 15% from 2014 compared to our previous guidance of down 10%. The driver of the lower earnings is our acquisition of this 30,000 North ","America previously held these joint ventures. Joint venture earnings will grow in China this year as a result of market share gains and new product sales but not at the same rate, we anticipated at the start of the year. Due to our weaker economy was just negatively impacted demand in our end markets. We continue to project EBIT margins for the company would be in the range of 13.5% to 14% of sales and the projected full year tax rate of 29.5% excluding discrete items remains unchanged.","Finally cash flow generated from operations to the first half of the year was $569 million. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to be in the range of 10% to 15% of sales for the full year, but stronger cash flow generation in the second half of the year than the first as is typical in our business. Capital expenditure of will be between from $700 million and $800 million for the year.","Earlier this month we announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend and we have now raised our quarter dividend by 457% since the beginning 2010. The company returns $794 million of cash to shareholders in the first half of the year through dividends and share repurchase, consistent with applying to its own 50% of operating cash flow. Year-to-date the cash balance is declining by $541 million due to the investment backing to the business and from higher returns of the shareholders to increase dividends payments and share repurchases. Finally I wanted to advice we have move the date of our Analyst Day to November the 10th in New York and invitations to the event will be sent this week.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Pat. We are now ready for question-and-answer session. If you can please limit yourself to one question and one related follow up and then get back in the queue. Thank you. Stephanie we are ready to proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Ted Grace","I was just wondering if you can talk a little more granularly about what you are seeing in China, I know you talked about gaining share, I know you talked the market being tougher than expected but just maybe if you could give us your most current read and kind of where you think the market is and kind of what the back half looks like and really what that implies about the exit rates and how we should think about '16 in Middle East you haven\u2019t given guidance on '16?","Rich Freeland","Yes, Ted. This is Rich. Let me start out here and Tom can jump on to that. Obviously we don\u2019t know as this has moved along but we've taken it down and there are some there is a little some growing confidence but the adjustment we made down 30% is solid for the rest of the year. Again we're on [montage] to increase share despite what happens there and so you've seen we've grown from 5 up to 15.5 and we plan in the year 17% in the heavy duty side. And so the product we get out there looks really good, we believe we're changing the market because we've got this low cost products, so we're competing with the China competitors but step function improvements general economy, reliability but putting telematics on it. So while there continues to be uncertainty in the market what our big picture what we're demonstrating showing us as we're growing share. Same thing on the light duty on the ISF, so with the market down 5 our ISF volumes will be up 21%. The potential macro market which was more your question, you see the uncertainty there the freight numbers are actually up a little bit so the freight numbers aren\u2019t down to the level that demonstrate a 30%, so our view is there is still some kind of shake out would be going on here were a bit optimistic with the positive sign we see as in the freight numbers.","Tom Linebarger","I guess. I would just add few two things Ted. First that as I mentioned emission standards if anything are tightening they've got a date now Euro 5 implementation, they've got cities like Beijing, Shanghai talking about implementing Euro 6. There is a lot of support from local and federal governments about pushing ahead with emissions standards can all that just drive people towards better technology, more focused on fuel efficiency and the quality of emissions equipments which if we think is good for us so just builds on the points that Rich was making that we've lowered our cost in are offering products that are competitive to local markets folks that we're able to apply technologies in a way that some of them are having a tougher time. So we feel very good about market share and I guess the second thing I would add it's obvious I think that the Chinese economy is going through a change and their governments are very serious about making this change.","So, I don\u2019t I'm not optimistic that we are going to see a big pump up in any of our end markets in a hurry because I think that Chinese government is going to try to keep going on this change of their focused in the government not so much on infrastructure and not so much on build and export a little bit more on consumer and a little bit more disciplined in the provinces, how they are going to succeed and what rate I don\u2019t know but I also think there is some stabilization going on in the markets. So they're pretty low now and they definitely seem to be bottoming up and stabilizing as Rich was indicating, so we don\u2019t see a further fall and we've indicated but we also don\u2019t see necessarily a major turnaround in the near-term.","Ted Grace","And so Tom to that point on taking share and the advantages Cummins has, I mean when we think about kind of the path looking up three, five years. Are there any structural considerations we should think about as maybe inhibiting you from getting to North America like market share, I mean is that a realistic goal that the way you should think about the potential or any handling there?","Tom Linebarger","As we discussed our goal for 2018 that we set out was to get the 17% market share and of course we expect to achieve that this year, so that feels pretty good especially in the backdrop of some of the markets we're facing. But we also said we'd like to get ourselves up to a 25% share and that was kind of our -- if you want our stretch goal and we're still to have in mind. I do think the Chinese government pays attention to the role that foreign companies play in industries relative to the domestic companies in part we've addressed that by joint venturing the most of our major engine operations there are on joint ventures and we therefore are supporting local competitors and the industry in general and that's the posture we take.","So I think that helps to sum on that but there is no question that the government pays attention to that. I really don\u2019t know what that means with regard to market share, but I think it means you have to pay attention to where you are and make sure the government sees you as a positive force for the industry and not something else.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","I guess just two questions, one, I think within the power gen business you alluded a couple of times to slightly more competitive behavior. I was just wondering if you could give a little more color as this has been ongoing if this short of a big change this quarter and I think you also mentioned oil and gas slowing due to rental or something like that, so any color you could provide there on the power gen business?","And then I guess my second question, Tom, it's just a bigger picture question obviously what's weighing on Cummins stock while you're very diversified as concerned U.S. truck as it peak in '15, Volvo came out on the last during this call and said they think '15 is peak-ish and '16 is likely down although not materially, can you talk about sort of your view in how you're managing your business in that environment?","Tom Linebarger","So on power gen a couple of things to give color on that I started on but I can give more. The competitive market a couple of things that are going on, I mentioned alternators, in the alternators business our business sales are a lot in Europe and Middle East and companies that export from there to other parts of the world. And we're competing with many companies that are based in Euro and so the price competition I talked about or the competitiveness is partly a function of the fact that the euro is still weak that some of the competitors especially given how low the demand has been have begun to take some of the cost advantages in term enterprise. It's not consistent it's not global, but it's happening.","The second thing is in the alternator business is the copper prices have dropped a lot and of course alternators are made of a lot of copper and so some of our competitors that have done the same thing, turned some of the copper price the cost decreases into price decreases. In our case we hedge a lot of that copper, so we're protected when it goes up and we're unfortunately protected when it goes down a little bit which means our cost decreases don\u2019t fall exactly in line with the market. Certainly some of that price competitiveness has hurt both our margins and our demand at the alternator business and there is a little bit of in the gen set business. As I said it's really not global it's not consistent and it really has got going pretty recently. We just haven't seen it very much and I would still say that it's not consistent.","The thing I mentioned about oil and gas markets, we've had pretty good results selling gen sets to rental businesses and that's been going pretty well, it's been one of the parts of the U.S. market that's where my comments are coming from that's been going pretty well. And it's just recently turned down a little bit and some of our customers have said that oil and gas demand is a little lower, it's the first time we heard it. It's not surprising given what's going on in the market but first time we heard it and we don't know the rental business, rental guys are going to stop for awhile or what's going to happen, it's just that we heard this quarter. So as you know car generation business generally speaking is pretty low everywhere, so these are -- you're getting the highlights of which may not even made the news when our business was much larger, but it's pretty small amounts or small variations and these markets are having pretty negative impact. Can let me just let Rich talk a little bit about the truck markets just because he's been talking to customers more recently?","Rich Freeland","Jamie, still continuous to be lots of positives in place and backlog still to 150,000 units, that's up from 120,000 a year ago, and it benefits the retail sales in fact they were up in Q2. And as I talked to fleet, I don't, I am not sensing a big change in sentiment. Folks are still generally positive and one kind of common comment we get is, the new trucks are significantly better in fuel economy and some of the safety systems we've put on board and so folks are -- want to continue on their place of replacing older fleet. These truck prices are pretty strong. Lower oil prices can tend to be net positive, so there is lots of kind of positive things. Where the nervous comes from there is now we've had after I think 14 months in a row where production was less than orders and the backlog was increasing, we've now had four straight months of production being higher than orders.","And so while backlog is in a very healthy level -- almost 160,000 units, it's down for, it was approaching 190,000 units four months ago. So, it's kind of balancing these two things as our anticipation is we'll see orders -- the seasonal orders kind of come in Q4, Q1, if that doesn't happen obviously production will have to come down and better match what the orders are. But it doesn't feel like -- we all track these cycles. It doesn't feel like some of these past cycles where when production was greater than backlog. We had a bunch of fundamentals of the market that looked pretty bad. And so you saw these -- some of the major drops. The fundamental market looks pretty good. There hasn't been the big run up that we've had in other cycles. So I think the jury is still out as well as the market fundamentals turn in orders kind of in Q4, Q1. So that's the nervousness we're sensing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Pat I wondered if you could just say more about the capital deployment priorities. Longer term you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you drew down on the cash balance so far as this year. Any update to how you are thinking about capital deployment and slower growth macro environment? Any update there would be helpful.","Pat Ward","Yes, so, we'll talk a little bit more on long-term capital deployment funds, we get to our Analyst Day in November. But now you should know as soon as major change in what we said before we want to reinvest back into the business where we see really good -- opportunity for profitable growth and we're trying to do that as best as you can in this environment. And we're also very conscious about delivery on our commitments to the total 50% of cash distributable on those, which we did last year, and we're on track to do again this year. So at this point in time, we know there's nothing we need to add, to what we said before on how we deploy our capital.","Jerry Revich","And then on new product side, Tom can you please give us an update of how you're thinking about the Class 4 to Class 5 opportunity in the U.S., there have been a couple of product announcements. And I am just wondering if you just give us an update for the Cummins opportunity longer term and any update on how the high horsepower, hedgehog program is tracking?","Tom Linebarger","So, on the Class 4 to Class 5 as you know, we were kind of -- we're more in the six, seven market and that's where we compete in North America. So, some of the recent announcements on folks entering the four and five are less of a direct impact on us. I guess just maybe another comment just looks in the mid range market -- it continues pretty strong in North America and in fact we're taking our share guidance up. We started the year and said potentially going down with the announcement of Ford introducing their own engine. And what we've found in that market quite frankly is we have got a traffic engine that's low cost, leading fuel economy and folks that used our engines have gained share and those who've moved away have lost share and that's proved out in this case also.","On the -- before we leave that Richie, the two areas that you know about, V8 which will be launching with Nissan eminently. So, they'll plan to start selling those in the fourth quarter or at least produce them in the fourth quarter. So that will get us into -- that's not really a Class 4 or Class 5, that's a summer vehicle, but size of engine's probably in that and of course we are offering in the few other vehicles that you know are these buses and things like that which might be classed in that range and our hope is to gain some position there and we've got some star customers.","The other area that we are definitely expanding and as you know is with the 38 engine, just not in U.S. today. And we'd love the chance to do at this just right now, it doesn't -- it's not the customer for -- and it doesn\u2019t make sense today. But we are expanding with that engine around many markets in the world in that same segment. So we're definitely in it, as Rich said we're pretty small in it and in U.S. and over time we hope to change that and we're putting a bunch of markers in place that we can.","Rich Freeland","Jerry maybe, I'll touch on the 9.5 liter. So, I guess I'll start out saying we're on track with what we've been saying for some time on the 9.5 liters. So, we've -- we're going in the production on the power gen business, we'll go into production on Q4 in the rail business. We've secured orders in the commercial marine business that we'll begin shipping next year. So, we're ramping up production, we'll be producing up to four week by Q1 of next year. And the products doing really well, and in fact much of the production, we're ramping up to -- we've in fact secured orders for already for that ramp up for next year. So, generally on schedule, remember we're -- with this new product, it gives us access to about a $5 billion market globally, that we've not had access to in the past. So, just getting started and the product doing well out of the shoe, securing customers was really important -- so, well it's not big numbers right now, it leaves us on track to what we want to do in the Hedgehog or in that 9.5 liter product line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Tim Thein","And maybe Rich just continuing on that thought. If you look at your the high horsepower volumes you are kind of running basically flat year-to-date through the first half in light of the step down in some of the industrial markets how should we think about just coming to the back half in terms of the quarterly pace of high horse power volumes.","Rich Freeland","Yes I don\u2019t much positive to say there but frankly as we took our guidance down on mining and we're not projecting recovery through the balance of the year there the oil and gas which started pretty good at the end of the year and you know that well and so again no step up in oil and gas. Our commercial marine we think would be flat for the year but we've and there is little bit of headwinds there, it's about 30% of our commercial marine business is tied to oil and gas and on the crew boats due to the offshore work, so we're getting a little bit of headwinds there. The hedgehog or the 9.5 liter is new business that we didn\u2019t have before and we talked about power gen markets which remained pretty flat. So as we looked we've kind of settled down this number that has began nothing really positive from the second half of the year on the high horsepower range.","Tom Linebarger","I would just say incremental changes is the summary Tim versus even at the start of the year incrementally little bit negative I would say to most of them but not dramatic changes to our overall guidance.","Tim Thein","And then switching gears to components, just any implied step down in margins in the back half? What are some of the headwinds that we should we rethinking about there and I guess is somewhat related and I know you have some hedges in place but what if any impact should we expect to get just in light of it the recent sharp declines in some of the PGM markets?","Tom Linebarger","We are not choosing hedging -- are you? I think we see components and normally third quarter of the year we see a softness in the non somewhat OEM like things, so that's going to deepen to the second half guidance. As of now I think we're looking for components to finish what that you had a put a strongly most there is an uptick in some of destructions of elements spending related to new products compared to the first three quarters of the year and they are on track to deliver a refuge of both top line and bottom line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Tom I mean I realize you are not guiding for 2016 yet but wondering if you can just comment more broadly on just on what you think Cummins' ability to grow earnings over just more of the medium-term if indeed in North American heavy duty truck market is peaking and we remain in kind of this lousy emerging market environment?","Tom Linebarger","Yes. Obviously that is something we've been thinking a fair bit about what given what we're seeing as far as opportunities for near-term improvement. Again like we've seen this year there is we are in a lot of markets and a lot of places around the world so inevitably something is doing little bit better which helps us, but as you said generically there is a lot of weak markets and there is not an obvious turnaround in very many of them, India as obviously is the notable exception and the U.S. markets isn't too bad generally. But in that environment our expectation is that we will continue to launch products and enhance our products through telematics and other value added that helps us gain share and sort have a different trajectory than the market on its own and we can't do that in every place and every market around the world but our general view is we're looking for opportunities like we've had in China this year, we think we'll be able to do some of that in India as broad stage 4 comes in and we will continue to look for opportunities to kind of different curve than the markets cutting.","The second thing which you've heard from last many times is that we'll be figuring out ways to earn higher margins on the same sales, so driving cost out of our business through material costs has been a huge driver for us for improvement this year, supply chain improvements will complete our programs this year that we set out 2011 Analyst Day to try to drive 1% gross margins and supply chain I think we'll be able to report in our November Analyst Day that we'll be able to do that, so again will be continuing to drive costs out of our business everywhere we can while still delivering better value and better technology in our product that's a kind of our stick now and again that doesn\u2019t add up to whole bunch of revenue growth if markets don\u2019t improve but again we'll get -- we think we continue to drive some earnings growth. So again that's a pretty bad scenario for the market but we need to be prepared for that. We don\u2019t know if that will be the case but we need to be prepared for this.","Ross Gilardi","And then maybe just my follow on just on similar question just on components but specifically I guess you're implying a softer second half but you did see acceleration of the top line margins continue to improve off a pretty high base. Can that business continue to grow on a multiyear basis and could you comment on how would China reties in the components and in the contribution from China?","Tom Linebarger","Our view is the components businesses benefitted from trends related to emission standard and fuel efficiency adding to engine technology overlap decades. That -- those when we said about to launch the components business and launch our emission standards business and hence our filtration business, this was the trend we were banking on, I am sure enough that\u2019s what plan out. So as you asked about China, lot of our growth in the components business is in the last couple of quarters and I believe we've got some good growth in China, we've got great growth in North America. Truck market has been strong. We have a lot of emissions and other components content on our engines here even in Brazil which has been really rough market, if it weren't for Euro 5 coming in there and then asking us out to apply emissions equipment it would be much worse for us.","So the components business has been one of the key areas for us to buck this trend where we can have a different trend than just the general market does. And so our ability to keep growing in there will depend on our ability to capitalize on spends related to emission fuel economy and other technology trends in our end markets, truck markets and off-highway markets. And so we\u2019re looking to go in that market both on our exiting platforms and our new platforms. As you know a couple of years ago we added, we've acquired a doser business which is a key part of the emissions equipment and that has a pretty high growth rate. And so we'll be continuing to evaluate other trends and other ways to add platforms in our components business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","Just almost everything I was going to ask has been asked, but just can we drill down a little bit into the distribution business and just over the next couple of years whatever timeframe you want to give us, what's left to do on restructuring and what kind of margins do you think this business should normalize at after you've been able to run it for a couple of years?","Tom Linebarger","Maybe I can comment a little bit on this strategy side and then Rich and Pat cab add a little bit on some of the underlying financial trends and things like that. At the strategy end as we talked about in our 2013 Analyst Day, we've got a couple of things to do in the distribution business to start with North America. We've, now by the end of this year, we have made the vast majority of the acquisitions. There will be two small businesses left that we'll acquire over the next couple of the years. And that means that we will have by the end of this year and to be fair maybe middle of next year we will have done the vast majority of integration.","We've got integration left to do on HR systems and things like that which take a little bit longer time and that's why I think it will take middle by next to do all those things. But we'll then have back office integrate, we'll have all the businesses in and that will be great. I mean that's pretty good for us to do. We haven't lost key people, we haven't lost key customers and instead what we've seen is a lot of efficiencies already and very excited and loyal workforce which doesn't happen that often. So we feel pretty great about that from an acquisition point of view. Also we've had great accrual of earnings against relative to the costs of acquiring. The next step though, which is really the, even larger opportunity for the company is now to look at this geographically based distribution system and say, how can we serve our customers more effectively.","So we have a bunch of end customers that are still kind of geographically based, you can think of truck fleets that are running across the U.S. and things like that. They're doing things a lot of stuffs. They need a lot of places that they want to be serviced. We also have some ones that are pretty focused in their geographies, things like mines and marine customers, while we don't really need to have locations in every single state that service that. We also have parts, depots and warehouses in nearly every single branch, so a lot of different opportunities for us and filled efficiencies in our distribution system which we think can drive up average margin. So just on a strategic level that's the opportunity and that we still have ahead of us and I think we'll continue to improve margin. Rich or Pat, I don't if you want to add anything to that.","Rich Freeland","Not a lot to add on that. I think again what we've consciously put the focus on making the acquisitions and generally leaving distributors as they were, so not chasing a lot of synergies in step one. And as Tom said, we're generally through that and we do things the synergies are significant and Tom outlined several of them and you can expect redundant ADCs, call centers, our whole purchasing which as you've seen we're pretty good at as a company. We will be able to centralize the purchasing and take advantage of that, so we've yet to quantify that. The numbers will be significant kind of our next step and we've consciously delayed from that other than the back office. I think the further -- so we'll complete most of that, next year we have one more to do North America and then I'd say that we have some more to do strategically outside the U.S. from a material dollar standpoint not so significant more getting at what Tom talked about taking care of customers and serving customers better across geographies.","Pat Ward","And the only think I'd add onto what Tom and Rich have added there. The organic performance from a same-store sales perspective has been really good. I think we're up 60 basis points compared to second quarter last year, so really pleased with that. Unfortunately the whole currency headwind is masking all that, and we've talked about 6% revenue headwind in the second quarter. I think for the full year is probably close to $250 million of our currency headwind on top line and not far away from the $100 million on the bottom line. So, if you set that currency segments, doing really well from an organic same-store performance. And Tom, if you could -- some of the acquisition numbers that are ahead of what we thought it would be, when we launch this two years ago, so the segment has to perform very well.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Question for Tom and Pat, I mean when I think about the stock, is less than 13 times this year's earnings, is less than eight times this year's EBITDA. You hear the questions around can you grow earnings next year. I mean, you have this analyst meeting every two years. Four years ago at the meeting, you had EM strong, two years ago you lost some but you had North America strong. This meeting is a little more of a debate of what do we really have the next couple of years and we can have market outgrowth, but people are concerned about the growth beyond this year, you see in a multiple. This is going to the ninth year out of 10 that you're net cash. So, you discussed this before but given you don't have one of the two major blocks, you had the last two meetings. What is keeping you from cashing what I would refer to as a rainy day track, I mean your net cash, you can write a cheque for $3 billion, buyback 13% of the company and still have net debt EBITDA out one-time, so I'm just trying to understand the philosophy of how you're managing the balance sheet, especially given some of the growth drivers that we've had in the past, maybe aren't quite as dynamic looking out going to this analyst meeting?","Tom Linebarger","Let me just say two things in that David. First is, what you are asking will be the primary topic at the Investor's Conference. I mean I am conscious about not jumping ahead from just FD point of view and all that kind of saying -- and I feel strongly that we have to address the point that you're talking about. It's not lost on us at all -- that we were expecting organically this is not really happening in last several years given the market outlook. We've had some very good wins as we talked about in China and as you called it outgrowth where we outperformed the market and we think there's more but given we'll kind of run up -- down escalate from a market growth point of view.","Our growth rates are not double-digit as we had hoped and therefore we don\u2019t need the same amount of capital that's funded and we need to figure out a way to drive more shareholder value than we're doing. We agree with that and so the question is what's the right formula to drive even higher growth for -- or higher returns, so that's exactly what we'll be addressing and we'll be addressing it full and to our best ability because we agree with that. Right now though, I think we kind as Pat said we're on the same strategy until we change the strategy and so we're appearing on it as we are and again trying to make sure that our businesses is the best performing business in our industry and that we manage our cash well conservatively, effectively et cetera, but there is no question that the things on your mind are on our mind, in a big way.","David Raso","And Tom, with the analyst meeting pushed back it's probably even more helpful. You can at least just give us, just some philosophical parameters on how you think of running a business like this when it comes to financial leverage? Because we could say well, we'll address in November, but your stocks on the trade for the next three or four months, thinking about this. So, if you can just give us some idea just philosophically would one-time leverage be something that you're uncomfortable with, I mean people are going to run their numbers, no matter what you say about waiting for November. So can you just help us a little bit on how you think about of these, nine out of 10 years being net cash, definitely has at least folks like me wondering. How do you think about the leverage that's appropriate for this business model?","Tom Linebarger","As you said, there's stock where we are trading a number of months, between now and then, and frankly it's been trading on this issue for some time and so we are -- I am conscious to that and it concerns me. Having said that, I think talking philosophically about it is the same as talking about it. So, that seems like it's not a smart thing to do. We've talked about leverage before though David, and we have said that we are comfortable with much higher leverage ratio than we have now. And that we don't need to be A or A+, we are okay being investment grade through the cycle and carrying leverage appropriate for that. So, that is in our thinking and will be in our thinking when we talk about it. I'm sorry that I can't be more -- disclose it at this point, just feel like given that only enough, limited number of our investors are on this call and it's not what the call was about that I should wait until the Investor Conference.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open.","David Leiker","I just wanted to circle back on China a little bit and talk about what your pipeline looks there and in terms of launching new engines, new products, new vehicles, new customers. Can you give us a little bit of perspective about where you are in that launch sequence and what we might be able to expect?","Rich Freeland","From the new -- David from a new engine standpoint, I'd say we're just starting -- we're in the infancy of the new products, so kind of clean sheet of paper on 2A, 3A, the 10 and 12 leader, a new product that we've introduced in the real order market which is down to 9.3 liter and so I think that the next big thing is the emissions are going to continue to change and so Tom mentioned and as far as -- as early as 2016 and the east continue to grow so really investing in our components technology to be able to meet emissions and I think what we found is there is a learning curve on this starting out ahead we thought North America but picking the right technology so these are only going to get tougher so I think a lot that we are going to be doing is doubling down on the investments we've made in those areas as the emissions continue to improve.","And it's a big opportunity really a big opportunity you had asked earlier on components also but as the emissions continue to grow and change you had seen it already but were not done with that so that's playing out in China. And as you move from Euro 4 to Euro 6 I mean you might think a lot of it five points is same as not that bigger change but that's exactly what happen between in U.S. between 2002 and 2010 and of course the engine has changed dramatically over that time none of those were platform changes same block, same head, just the lot of system changes and as big winners and losers across those years in the U.S. and the same transition is now going to happen in China.","They are now they are going to finalize the Euro 60 pretty soon and it's not going to be 2025 it's going to be around 2020 maybe earlier depending on kind of how they get around I mean there is some people talks around 2018 that's really fast and that's a big change in technology. So I mean the drive from where we are to Euro 6 will be a major-major technical development for China for Cummins of course and for a lot of others and as Rich said that as we are shaking out for a lot of people and that should help us. So that I guess the only our thing I had mentioned about China as we are also brining new large engine technologies into the market.","We have a very -- we don't talk about them much but we have a very good market share and large engines there 19 liter and above and we'll be brining in some updated technologies and through our joint-venture there too which again will be represented new launches to the market so there is pretty big pipeline there and I think there will be a still quite of bit of change ahead and which should position Cummins further ahead I guess.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you very much everybody I will be available for calls later. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and everyone have a great day."],"6376":["Cummins Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. James Hopkins, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hopkins, you may now begin.","James Hopkins","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2019. Participating with me today are Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Smith; President and Chief Operating Officer, Tony Satterthwaite; and retiring Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference.","Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures.","Our press release, with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation, are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","With that out of the way, we'll begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Thomas Linebarger","Thanks, James. Good morning. I just want to start one correction of James remarks. Retiring Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland, has said he will not be available for questions after the call, unless it's about how cute his grandchildren are or about golf.","I'll start with a summary of our third quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2019. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full-year.","Revenues for the third quarter of 2019 were $5.8 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA was $958 million or 16.6% compared to $983 million or 16.5% a year-ago. Positive pricing, lower variable compensation, material cost reduction activities and lower warranty expense partially offset the impact of lower volumes and increased investments in research and engineering.","Engine business revenues declined 11% in the third quarter compared to a year-ago. Revenues in North America decreased by 6% as we began to see the impact of OEMs preparing for lower production of heavy-duty trucks in North America, as well as declines in shipments to construction markets. International revenues declined by 25% primarily as a result of lower demand in China light-duty truck and construction markets.","EBITDA margin for the quarter was 14.1% compared to 14.9% for the same period in 2018, and included a $33 million charge related to ending production of our 5-liter ISV engine for the U.S. pickup market. Improved pricing and lower material costs partially offset the impact of lower volumes, reduced joint venture income and the $33 million charge.","Sales for our Distribution segment grew by 4% year-over-year driven by higher demand for power generation equipment in North America. Third quarter EBITDA was a record $186 million or 9.3% of sales compared to 8% in the third quarter of 2018. EBITDA margins benefited from higher volumes, positive pricing and lower variable compensation costs.","Third quarter revenues for the Component segment declined by 6%, sales in North America increased 2% driven by higher demand in the U.S. pickup market, while revenues in the international markets declined by 18% as a result of lower truck demand in Europe, India and China. EBITDA for the third quarter was $286 million or 17.3% compared to 16.4% in the same quarter a year-ago.","The increase in EBITDA percent was primarily due to lower warranty costs and the benefit of material cost reduction programs, which offset increased investment and the development of new products to meet advancing emission standards in China and India as well as the impact of lower volumes.","Power Systems sales in third quarter increased by 2%. Demand in industrial markets increased 3% with lower sales to oil and gas markets offset by increased sales to marine, rail and mining customers. Power Generation sales increased 8% in North America, driven by continued strength in data center markets, offset by a 4% decline in international markets, mainly in Europe and the Middle East.","While sales increased compared to a weak third quarter last year, sales declined 6% sequentially with lower demand in power generation, oil and gas and mining markets. EBITDA in the third quarter was 14% compared to 14.7% a year-ago. The decrease in EBITDA percent was largely due to the impact of higher material costs, including tariffs, and lower sales of industrial engines.","In the Electrified Power business, EBITDA was a loss of $36 million in the third quarter and in line with our expectations. We completed the acquisition of Hydrogenics, a leading producer of fuel cells and electrolyzers for the production of hydrogen, on September 9. Our third quarter results included $2 million EBITDA loss related to Hydrogenics.","Now I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the third quarter of 2019 starting with North America, and then I'll cover some of our largest international markets. Our third quarter revenues in North America were flat at $3.6 billion. Increased sales of power generation equipment, especially the data center customers were offset by lower shipments of heavy-duty truck and construction engines.","Industry production of heavy-duty trucks increased 3% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to a year-ago and decreased 4% compared to the second quarter of this year with low truck orders, a declining industry backlog and historically high levels of new truck inventory driving lower industry production.","While industry truck production increased compared to last year, our shipments declined as OEMs prepared to ramp down production in Q4. Our market share through September was 32%. Production of medium-duty trucks increased 4% in the third quarter. A growing U.S. economy, coupled with high levels of consumer spending, low unemployment and low interest rates continues to drive demand for medium-duty trucks.","Our market share in the medium-duty truck market was 78% through September compared to 81% a year-ago. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased for the third consecutive quarter to over 41,000 units supported by strong demand for the Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks.","Engine demand for construction equipment in North America decreased 30% in the third quarter. While non-residential construction spending remains high, we are seeing industry participants take steps to reduce their equipment inventory, which currently stands at a historically high levels.","Revenues for power generation grew by 8% due to higher demand in data center markets partially offset by lower sales to recreational vehicle OEMs. Demand for engines in oil and gas markets declined by 86% due to continued low purchases of new fracking equipment.","Our international revenues decreased by 8% in the third quarter of 2019 compared to a year-ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 2% over the prior year. Lower demand in construction and light commercial vehicle markets was partially offset by increased demand in medium- and heavy-duty truck markets.","Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased 1% compared to a year-ago and was positively impacted by a prebuy of natural gas engines, ahead of the move to NS VI standards. We estimate the impact of this prebuy to be approximately 27,000 units this quarter, increasing market size by 10%. This increase, in addition to the 20,000 unit prebuy that occurred in the second quarter.","Our market share improved to 16.1% this quarter from 15.6% a year-ago as we increased our share at Foton and saw a shift towards over-the-road trucks versus construction-related dump trucks. Industry sales of light-duty trucks declined by 3% in the third quarter and 15%, sequentially.","Our engine market share was 7.4%, 0.2 percentage points higher than a year-ago. We continue to be impacted by increased enforcement of loading regulations where truck models that has historically been registered as light-duty trucks are now to be classified as medium-duty trucks, which limits access to urban areas and requires additional licensing for drivers. OEMs did begin to launch new light-duty vehicles in the third quarter, resulting in higher industry productions than we had originally forecasted.","Third quarter demand for excavators in China increased 16% from a year ago. Our market share also increased from 15% to 15.4% driven by the strong performance of our local partners. While industry sales and our market share increase compared to a year-ago, our sales for the quarter including joint ventures declined 29% due to OEMs and dealers reducing inventory built primarily in the second half of last year.","Demand for power generation equipment was flat in the third quarter with lower demand for standby power, partially offset by growth in demand for data center markets.","Third quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $344 million, a reduction of 29% in the third quarter a year-ago with lower demand in all of our major end markets.","Industry truck sales decreased 52% year-over-year and even larger decline than we'd expected, driven by continued lack of credit availability. Credit availability also started to impact other markets during the third quarter with construction revenues down 75% as companies struggle to finance construction projects, placing pressure on equipment purchases.","Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on individual regions in end markets. We now expect company revenues to be down 2% for the year compared with our prior guidance of flat. We are lowering our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America. Hopefully, we\u2019re off mute now. Okay. More concerning, the industry backlog declined 31% or 61,000 units [technical difficulty] to 133,000 units from its peak of over 300,000 units a year-ago.","Inventory remains elevated at 81,000 units and third quarter orders of 34,000 units were the lowest since 2009. Industry production decreased monthly as we [technical difficultly] third quarter and we expect monthly declines to continue through the end of the year. We expect our market share for the year to be at the low end of our forecast range of 32% to 34%. Market share is being negatively impacted by lower shipments to OEM's ahead of truck production cuts.","Demand in our parts and remanufacturing business remain stable in the third quarter. As we continue to see the impact of increased capacity of fleets and lower freight demand resulting in lower utilization of available equipment in the industry. We continue to expect parts demand to be relatively weak through the end of this year as dealers reduced parts inventory and anticipation of lower market activity.","In the medium-duty truck market, we're lowering our forecast for industry production to 138,000 units are up 5% compared to our prior guidance of 140,000 units are up 6% year-over-year. While retail sales of medium-duty trucks remained strong, up 13% year-to-date, industry truck production has now been above order intake for seven months, lowering the industry backlog to levels that will result in lower build rates.","We continue to expect our market share to be in the range of 74% to 76% unchanged from our prior guidance. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for 2019, compared to a very strong 2018 and unchanged from our expectations three months ago. Shipments of construction engines are now expected to decline 5% compared to our prior expectations of 10% growth as OEMs and dealers reduce inventories from historically high levels.","In China, we now expect domestic revenues including joint ventures to be down 1% in 2019 and improvement compared to our prior guidance of down 2%. We are increasing our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand to 1.23 million units or down 7% compared to our prior guidance of down 10% due to the additional prebuy of natural gas trucks that occurred in the third quarter.","In the light-duty truck market, we now expect a 7% reduction in demand compared to our prior guidance of down 12%. This improvement is driven by OEMs launching new truck models in light of the more stringent enforcement of overloading regulations that began in the second quarter.","We expect our market share and the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be in the range of 13% to 14% and in light-duty we expect our market share to be 8% to 9%, both in line with our prior guidance. We now expect industry sales of excavators in China to increase 8% from the record levels achieved in 2018, compared to our prior guidance of flat. While industry sales are expected to increase this year, we are expecting lower levels of industry production in the second half of 2019, compared to 2018 as the industry prepares for lower demand in the spring 2020 selling season.","In India, we now expect total revenue including joint ventures to be down 20% [technical difficultly] compared to our prior guidance of down 5%. We anticipate \u2013 industry demand for trucks to be 30% lower than the record levels experienced in 2018 compared to our prior guidance of down 17%.","We now expect construction demand to decline 40%, compared to our prior outlook of 5% to 10% growth with a lack of financing for construction projects lowering demand for new equipment. Demand for power generation equipment is now expected to be flat compared to 5% to 10% growth.","In Brazil, we are now projecting truck production to be flat in [technical difficultly] down from our forecast of 2% growth three months ago. While domestic demand in Brazil continues to increase from levels experience in [technical difficultly] truck production in Brazil for export markets is expected to decline 50% compared to 2018 \u2013 primarily due to weak demand for trucks in Argentina. We continue to project total revenues for Brazil to be down 10% this year.","We now expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to be down 10% this year, compared with our prior guidance of down 5%. Demand for new oil and gas engines is now expected to decline 50%, compared with our prior guidance of just down 40%.","We now anticipate sales in North America will decline by 85%, compared to our 75% expectations three months ago with lower demand for new equipment in the Permian Basin as well as reduced demand for engine rebuilds. The deterioration in our outlook for North America is partially offset by growing sales [technical difficultly] which have represented 61% of our oil and gas engine sales to-date.","Demand from mining engines has moderated [technical difficultly] three months as commodity [technical difficultly] and capital budgets have been cut. We now expect mining engine sales down 7% lower than the prior guidance of down 5%. Demand for power generation equipment increased 2% compared to the low levels experience in the third quarter of last year and declined 3% sequentially [technical difficultly] primarily due to lower demand in India.","We now expect full-year revenues to be down 2% compared to our primarily due to lower demand in India. For the full-year growth in data centers is being offset by lower sales of [technical difficultly] lower demand in backup power applications in China and India, and a drop in large prime power applications in Europe.","In summary, we are now expecting revenues to be down 2%, for the year lower than our prior guidance of flat. This revenue decline is driven by lower demand and domestic international truck markets, weakness in Indian end markets and lower demand in several off-highway markets.","Lower sales reduced joint venture income in India and the acquisition of Hydrogenics will impact our EBITDA for the year, which we now projected at 15.9% to 16.3% of sales, down from our prior guidance of 16.25% to 16.75% of sales.","Strong execution across all of our businesses resulted in record revenues being translated into record EBITDA and operating cash flow in the first nine months of this year. Our strong and consistent cash flow generation continues to support our plans, return cash to shareholders and we returned $910 million of cash in third quarter [technical difficultly] 2.9% of outstanding shares.","While we were pleased with our operating performance in third quarter, we've been working to prepare the company for what lies ahead in the fourth quarter and in [technical difficultly]. As we have discussed before, several of our end markets have been above replacement level for some time and we are now expecting cyclically reduced demand.","Our third quarter revenues declined 7% sequentially and our guidance projects that they would decline another 8% in the fourth quarter. This steep level of decline resulted in a number of actions to align costs with production levels including a recently announced voluntary retirement package in United States, which we [technical difficultly] reduced headcount by 400 to 450 people. We are in the process of making additional structural changes in several areas of the business and we'll continue to drive actions to improve costs.","As always, we will capitalize on the downturn period to improve our company and merge as a stronger and more profitable Cummins. We will also maintain our investments in the key [technical difficulty] and product development programs that will ensure leadership and sustainable growth in the future.","During the third quarter, we announced new [technical difficulty] powertrains and launched an updated ISX15 engine for the North American heavy-duty truck market. These actions demonstrate our commitment to lead both in alternative powertrain technologies and continue to lead in traditional powertrains.","We closed on our acquisition of Hydrogenics, one of the world's premier fuel cell and hydrogen production technology providers in September. Their expertise and innovative approach will strengthen fuel cell capability. This is another step forward as we continue to invest in a broad range of clean, fuel efficient and high-performing products and technologies that will deliver value to customers.","[Technical difficulty] who designed manufacturer fuel cell range extenders and announced the partnership with Hyundai to jointly evaluate opportunities to develop and commercialize electric and fuel cell powertrains. While we increase investments on alternative powertrains, we continue to enhance our diesel and natural gas products delivering more fuel efficiency, power and lower emission.","At the North American Commercial Vehicle show in Atlanta, we are currently showing our new ISX15 Efficiency Series. [Technical difficulty] an endurance transmission will provide up to 5% improvement in fuel efficiency for [technical difficulty] meeting 2021 greenhouse gas standards one-year early.","Now let me turn it over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial performance in the [technical difficulty] for the full-year. Third quarter revenues were $5.8 billion, a decrease of 3% from a year-ago. Sales in North America were flat and international revenues [technical difficulty] 8%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%.","Earnings before interest and tax depreciation and amortization were $958 million or 16.6% for the quarter, compared to $993 million or 16.5% of sales a year-ago. EBITDA decreased by $25 million driven by the negative impact of [technical difficulty] reduced joint venture income and [technical difficulty] partially offset by material cost reduction activities, lower warranty and decreased variable compensation expenses.","Gross margin of $1.5 billion or 25.9% decreased by $57 million or 20 basis points. Benefits from favorable pricing actions, material cost reductions, lower warranty and variable compensation expenses mitigated the negative impact of lower volumes [technical difficulty] charges incurred to cease production of certain unprofitable product lines and higher tariffs.","Our selling, administrative and research costs of $842 million, increased by $9 million year-over-year, driven primarily by new product development in the Engine, Components, and Electrified Power segments, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.","Joint venture income declined by $22 million due to weaker demand for light-duty trucks in China and lower truck production in India. Other income of $61 million increased by $34 million, driven primarily by $35 million of gains related to closing out certain derivative contracts associated with the Company's foreign exchange hedging program.","Net earnings for the quarter was $622 million or $3.97 per diluted share compared to $692 million or $4.28 from a year-ago. Third quarter results were positively impacted by $23 million or $0.14 per diluted share and discrete tax items and the after-tax gains of $28 million or $0.18 from closing out the foreign exchange hedging contracts I referred to earlier.","During the quarter, we also incurred after-tax expenses of $35 million or $0.23 per share related to actions taken to cease development and production of certain products. These actions will benefit future financial performance. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.4%. Excluding discrete tax items, the tax rate was 21.5% in the third quarter and in line with our full-year forecast.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was a record in flow of $1.1 billion. That's $208 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, we've generated a record $2.3 billion of cash from operating activities, up $955 million from the same period last year, driven by higher earnings and a much slower pace of working capital expansion.","I will now comment on our revised guidance for 2019. For the Engine segment, we expect full-year revenues to be down between 5% and 6% compared to our previous guidance of flat at the mid-point. The reduction in sales is driven by declines in heavy-duty engine shipments in North America, weaker demand for construction equipment in North America or India, and the lower outlook for medium-duty truck engines in North America, Europe and Brazil.","We revised our forecast for EBITDA margins for the engine business to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.8%, down from our prior guidance of 15% to 15.5%, driven primarily by the impact of lower volumes, weaker joint venture incomes and the costs incurred in the third quarter associated with ending production of one engine platform.","For the Distribution segment, we now expect revenues to be up 2% to 3% compared to our previous guidance of 1% to 5%, due to lower sales of construction engines in North America and lower engine rebuild volumes with oil and gas and mining customers.","We are raising our outlook for EBITDA margins by 35 basis points to be in the range of 8.4% to 8.8% as continuous solid operating performance and lower variable compensation expense more than offset \u2013 the slightly lower outlook for sales.","For 2019, we now expect components revenues to be down between 4% and 5% compared to our prior projection of flat at the mid-point and this decline is \u2013 being driven by reduced truck demand in North America, India, Europe, and Brazil.","As a result of the lower sales outlook, we've revised our focus for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.6% to 16.1%, down from our prior guidance of 15.75% to 16.25%.","Power Systems revenues are forecast to be down 3% to 4% lower than our previous guidance of flat at the midpoint, due to lower demand for power generation equipment in international markets and weaker demand for engine rebuilds and new engine shipments in mining and oil and gas markets. We're also revising our forecast for EBITDA margins to be in the range of 12.5% to 13% down from our prior forecast 13.25% to 14%.","In the Electrified Power segment, we now expect a net expense of $145 million at the high-end of our previous guidance range due to the completion of the acquisition of Hydrogenics. The net impacted the changes to Individual segment projections is that we now forecast total company revenues to be down 2% and company EBITDA margins to be between 15.9% and 16.3. This compares to our prior guidance of flat sales and the EBITDA in the range of 16.25% to 16.75%.","Full-year operating cash flow is projected to be a record $3 billion due to the strong full-year earnings and lower working capital. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $153 million, bringing our year-to-date total investment to $395 million. We expect our full-year capital investments will be in the range of $700 million unchanged from our prior guidance.","In the third quarter, we returned a record $910 million to shareholders. We repurchased 4.6 million shares after a total of $706 million. And for the first nine months, we have returned $1.4 billion through dividends and share repurchase activity. We still plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","To summarize, we delivered a solid set of results in the third quarter, including record quarterly operating cash flow and in response to a slowing global economy driving weaker demand in a number of our end markets. We have taken a number of actions to reduce costs and address some underperforming parts of our business.","Consistent with prior downturns, we will continue to identify additional opportunities to drive efficiency and cost reduction whilst maintaining investment in the products and services that will deliver a stronger future.","Finally, I want to remind everyone of our upcoming Analyst Day on November 21 of the New York Stock Exchange. I look forward to seeing you all there. Webcast of our presentation will also be available on our Investor Relations section our website. Thank you for your interest today, your patience with a difficult phone call.","Now let me turn it back over to Tom before we move to Q&A.","Thomas Linebarger","Mark, with all the challenges we have in fuel cells and electrification, I did not expect to be flooded by a phone. There you have it. Just to conclude our prepared remarks. As you will remember, we announced on April 29 and then discussed in our first and second quarter earning calls that we are initiated an internal review of our emission certification and compliance processes for our pickup truck applications as a result of conversations with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board.","Our review continues and we are proactively working with EPA and CARB as well as with the Department of Justice and SEC to address their questions and information requests. During conversations with regulators, they raise concerns that certain aspect of our emission system on the model year 2019 Ram engine may reduce the effectiveness of our emission control systems and thereby act as defeat devices. Based on these discussions, we've developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 Ram 2,500 and 3,500 trucks that has been included on all engines shipped since September.","During our discussions, the agencies have asked us to look at other model years and other engines that the primary focus of our review has been the model year 2019 Ram. Consistent with the values and the history of our Company, which include a strong commitment to compliance, we will work with regulators and other agencies to address the issues identified in our internal review and develop future technologies that will advance our industry.","We are already making changes to our process and organization structure as a result of our review. However, it's too soon to know what the response of our regulators or agencies will be to our review or to determine any potential financial consequences.","Now let me turn it back to James for Q&A.","James Hopkins","Great. Thank you, Tom. Out of considerations to everybody on the call to ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up, and if you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue.","With that operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research.","Joseph O'Dea","Hi, good morning.","Thomas Linebarger","Hi, Joe.","Joseph O'Dea","Tom, I'm just curious about kind of what your assessment is of what's currently underway in terms of what we're seeing on slowing demand. I think there are pockets of these end markets that you've been talking about things slowing for at least a couple of quarters now, but whether or not you're seeing this more as we're coming off of a level of very strong demand or whether there's something else at play in terms of kind of how you're thinking about things slowing down here?","Thomas Linebarger","Yes. I want Tony to talk more specifically about what happening in the truck market. It'd be a good chance for him to \u2013 he's been very close to it and a good chance for him to talk about that. I would just say that broadly speaking, we've seen a number of our markets been at cyclical peaks over the last couple of years, which has been terrific for the company. We've generated strong earnings and cash flows as a result, but indeed some of those markets are beginning to turn down and we've been seeing signs of that. Typical signs that we're used to reading things like slowing orders, inventory build, et cetera.","And now what we're seeing is those things starting to come to fruition. Maybe what's surprising to me is it's broader than I thought. Like we are seeing challenges in India, challenges in China, challenges in \u2013 even in Europe is slowing. We saw North America coming, that was all part of what we expected, but some of the challenges in some of the other markets, how quickly we've seen in the large engine markets sort of peak out and begin to turn the other way has been a little surprising.","So maybe that's what's new, not the \u2013 not necessarily that things would turn down, but just how broadly and how quickly they have. And Tony, why don't you just talk about what you're seeing in North America?","Tony Satterthwaite","Yes. I would just add \u2013 thanks, Tom. Joe, I would just add, we are definitely seeing \u2013 freight growth has slowed. We are seeing orders slow and production has got to come down to meet \u2013 to match the backlog and meet those orders. And so we are seeing things slow. I agree with Tom. The surprise has been how quickly things have gone bad internationally and that was probably not expected at the beginning of the year.","I do believe in North America it is a cyclical downturn. I don't quite know what you mean by anything else other than that, but that's basically what we're seeing. Construction has also slowed down in the U.S., as Tom mentioned in his remarks, which I think is another sign that perhaps it is a broader slowdown than just freight and truck markets. But we've been seeing this coming all year and it\u2019s here.","Mark Smith","I guess the other thing I'd add to that, Joe, really, in North America, the pickup truck market is the only one that's been holding out steady and strong through the year.","Joseph O'Dea","That's helpful. And then just a cost related question, maybe in the context of what's implied on 4Q EBITDA margins. Can you give any sense of what the impact would be from related cost actions that you're taking right now? So what kind of margin lift you would anticipate if you got the full benefit in the quarter with some of the cost actions underway?","Mark Smith","I think you should think about the actions that we're taking is really setting up 2020. The biggest impact will be 2020, by the time we fully executed those actions. And again, we'll give a framework for 2020 at our Analyst Day. We're not going to give specific guidance today, Joe, but our guidance is the results without the cost of those actions. We will call out the customer benefits at the appropriate point in time.","What's really driving our margins from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which I think is underlying your question. Number one, it's the significant decline in revenues. That's by far the biggest single impact. Number two, whilst we haven't changed our full-year outlook for warranty or product coverage as a percent of sales is a little bit lower than trend rate in Q3, they\u2019re a little bit higher than the Q3 run rate and Q4 are unchanged for the year.","And then the third factor is really that our variable compensation plan is working as designed. So our outlook is lower than our projected payouts, short-term compensation is going down through the third quarter and will move back to more of a normal run rate in the fourth quarter. And really those are the three main factors. So the key now is really talking about the cost reduction initiatives going forward. And again, we'll provide a framework.","Tony will add some comments right now.","Tony Satterthwaite","Yes. I would just add. We\u2019ve been ready for this all year. We are committed to flexing our costs down with demand. We're committed to managing the cycle. We've been tight on discretionary spending and hiring all year and we actually really started to take things out in the third quarter. We've been analyzing underperforming businesses and as Mark said, we decided to close one in the third quarter, we've launched a voluntary retirement program here in the U.S., and so these are all actions we're taking, the majority of which will bear fruit in 2020, but we are moving now to take out cost as demand drops. ","Joseph O'Dea","I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas Linebarger","Hi, Jerry.","Mark Smith","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you can talk about what level of restructuring is embedded in guidance, Mark, just to follow-up on the last question. So in the past, you folks have been able to put up 20% decrementals as you've got production now embedded in guidance, looks like you have restructuring. It sounds like price cost is positive, so can you just help us disaggregate it a bit more? And I appreciate there's a wide range of restructuring actions that can be taken, but what level of core decremental margins are you folks expecting?","Mark Smith","Well, we're going to give that core margin kind of framework Jerry in a couple of weeks when we're reviewing with all your peers in New York, so I'll defer that piece. But other than to say that the guidance really does not anticipate. There will be some cost in the fourth quarter associated with further cost reduction activities that Tony has talked about, but most of those benefits and even the benefits of exiting production and some of the products we've exited here, they're going to flow into next year.","So we're incurring cost now, but actually even if we ignore the costs we're going to have a year-over-year improvement for those. But again, we'll come back and kind of bundle the overall picture together for you going forward. But as Tony said, we're committed to managing costs, managing well through the down cycle.","Thomas Linebarger","And I guess, Jerry, just to talk about decremental margins because we will get into the framework. But as you expect, the decremental margins in the fourth quarter are not where we want them to be. And that's just reflects the typical situation when the market starts falling quickly and we're still spending money on future investments. It doesn't work out in quarter one.","And so that's one of the reasons Tony is really focused \u2013 he and his staff on how to take actions right away, so that we're \u2013 as we go into 2020, we bring those decrementals around to what our goals are and you know those as well. So we will be \u2013 as Mark said, we will be showing you the targets we have for the core business, why we're confident that we can hit them and then what are some of the other things in and around that, what are some of our new investments, et cetera, that we\u2019re having to stretch to meet, how that all going to fit together.","But needless to say, Q4 is not representing what our goal for our decremental margins is going to be. And that's just because the market is falling fast now and we're still doing the actions that were taken. So it's sort of hard to read core decremental margins from the quarter where all the revenues fall off.","Jerry Revich","Sure. I appreciate that. In terms of the light-duty diesel platform for you folks with exiting the 5-liter production here in the U.S., can you give us an update there, you folks finding that there are opportunities to source similar products from elsewhere, maybe the Isuzu joint venture or otherwise because you folks had been looking for light-duty diesel to be potential option value for you folks over the next couple of years. So can you just update us on the decision tree to discontinue production here in the U.S.?","Thomas Linebarger","Yes. I think it's \u2013 from a strategic point of view, we still think the light-duty diesel business is a good business for Cummins. And as you said, we are talking to Isuzu about how to cooperate fully across that market. It's a market that requires relatively high volume and scale to be successful. And so that's one of the reasons that we think the opportunities between Cummins and Isuzu are significant.","I think one of the things that we recognized with the Nissan-related business, the ISV, is we just didn't reach the scale we needed to reach. And that was a function of the customers and the segments that we\u2019re after. The scale wasn't there. But the scale across the light-duty segment for Cummins is significant. As you know, we have very large scale across our 3.8, 2.8, 4.5 and 6, 6.7-liter engines.","We have a global scale, which is unmatched in the industry and that\u2019s of course helping us get good profits, good returns off that engine. And we do expect by the way, electrification in the lower power segments to go faster and that in the higher power segments.","Having said that, we think the transition is going to be relatively slow and we think the opportunity to consolidate and earn returns over many, many years to come is there for Cummins and ideally there for the Cummins, Isuzu partnership. So we are investing there and trying to see what we can do to consolidate in the industry in the light-duty segment. It\u2019s just that, with the one \u2013 the ISV, we\u2019re after a certain segment in the U.S., it just didn't appear to offer scale for the engine.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Linebarger","You bet, Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew Casey","Good morning and congratulations.","Thomas Linebarger","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Casey","Just a couple of clarifications and then a question on China. In the quarter, you'd talked about $35 million charges for the cessation of development and product exit, $33 million of that showed up in engines. Was the remaining two also in engines? Or was that somewhere else?","Mark Smith","Components.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you, Mark. And then on China \u2013 I\u2019ll come back offline for the other one. On China, you talked about the lack of credit availability, do you see that changing in the near future or in 2020?","Mark Smith","The credit availability issue is really in India. And just to kind of maybe provide a little more background, the credit market is supplied by non-bank credit institutions. Sometimes \u2013 in the country, they call it the shadow banking system, but it's these private credit institutions. And they had a couple of bankruptcies in there, in that segment and the market is largely closed, and to the extent it's opened up, prices are very high. So that's what's going up on India.","So we do expect it to find its way through as things do in India. We do expect that to mitigate. We just don't think it's mitigating really fast. It's going to take some time because the financial problem, financial crisis not an economic one. So it is a significant issue in the country and there are other economic challenges in India.","So we do expect that things are definitely worse than we expected at this time. And we expect some of those things to linger. The opportunity for us remember though, is BS VI is coming. So \u2013 and we are fully prepared for BS VI. Our technology, we believe is leading in the market.","We think we have not only a technology, but we also have a cost and scale leadership as well as a service network, which we think is better than competitors. So we do hope to see that this BS VI gives us an opportunity to increase share and increase profitability in India. We just think next couple quarters are going to be rough. That's just the way I'd summarize it.","Andrew Casey","Okay. I'll leave it there, and thanks for the correction.","Mark Smith","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning and congratulation, Rich. I hope you have a fantastic retirement and thanks for all your help throughout the years. I guess sort of first question, I appreciate the color you guys gave on sort of what impacts the margins going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.","But I think everyone was also trying to get their arms around just the magnitude of the revenue step-down in the fourth quarter. So I know you talked the markets globally being weaker, but how much of that is just demand versus you guys also making adjustments relative to what your customers are doing sort of on the production cuts size to rightsize inventory?","And then I guess my second question, Tom, as you look to 2020, can you sort of talk about cost conversations you're having with customers? Are they sort of reevaluating where their investments are going and how that could potentially be an opportunity for Cummins? And if so, should we think about that is a 2020 opportunity? Thank you.","Thomas Linebarger","Great, Jamie. So let me let Tony to talk a little bit about what's happening in North America. And I think it's applicable in some other markets, too, about inventory and inventory corrections.","Tony Satterthwaite","Hi, Jamie. This is Tony. We have OEM supply chain where we don't hold a lot of inventory for our OEM customers. We pretty much deliver to their schedule. As they adjust their schedules, they move their inventory around a bit or just their production flow.","And we think that's part of the challenge we're seeing in the market today. Those adjustments are making it difficult to kind of pin down exactly what our numbers are going to be versus the market. But we are seeing a little bit of that. I would say none of our OEM customers have significant engine inventory, but there is inventory of trucks in the fields that we see peaked here at the end of September. And so that's just another signal I think that we're going to see demand coming down.","The vast majority of the revenue drop into the fourth quarter is from the North American truck side though rather than all the other markets. They are down bit, but it's really North America that's down the most.","Thomas Linebarger","And we do expect market share \u2013 our market share to be impacted Jamie to some degree in the fourth quarter as well. I mean it happens every downturn. What happens is that the OEMs basically keep building to fill orders and they slowdown shipments of our engines and they use up their engines more than our engines.","We see it, that market share move just as we see it move our way when things start to get busy or in fall. These quarter-to-quarter variations smooth out pretty quickly and we still expect to be in our normal range 32% to 34% or there thereabouts. But in the short-term, we expect we'll see some short-term market share numbers, which are lower just because \u2013 this is just what happens every time. So we expect it at this time too.","I think with regard to your question about conversations with OEMs. There is no question that every OEM I talked to is wondering where they want to put their investments. Their decisions are still in front of them for many of them, but they are wondering because they're looking at autonomous vehicle investments.","They're looking at, of course, a whole new set of truck ranges, very competitive markets. They're looking at where they want to go internationally and what that takes and what joint ventures and partnerships and they want to do. They're thinking about telematics and other information technology investments. They're thinking about electrification, fuel cells, other CO2 related investments, especially for the European truck makers of CO2 regs are really, really tough.","So they just look staring down the barrel of a set of investments that look 2x or 3x their average R&D spend and asking themselves what they want to do. They're mostly making money selling diesel engines today. So the difficulty is, do I keep selling and investing the things that I'm making money today or do I prepare myself for the future where money is going to be made tomorrow?","Those are hard set of discussions and we are in discussions with them all the time trying to demonstrate to them that we can help partner with them, take some of those diesel investments off the table. We also of course have electrified powertrains and now fuel cell powertrains to offer them to.","But all of this is to say we can take some of those investments and still partner with you, so you can do the rest and succeed in competition. And those conversations are hot and happening all the time. Where they'll come out? We'll see. But there's no question, you can hear in my voice that I think it's an opportunity for us to expand our relationships with OEMs and increase our opportunities to sell more of both traditional powertrains and alternative powertrains.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.","Ross Gilardi","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Thomas Linebarger","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Tom, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on how some of your more stable businesses like after market components, distribution and power gen would perform in a downturn. I mean do you think they move sideways or do they actually go down on the aftermarket side or are you seeing much deferred maintenance at this point that's impacting that business?","Tony Satterthwaite","Yes. Ross, this is Tony. We expect distribution and our aftermarket business to mostly move sideways in a downturn. It's not perfect, but it does not go through the same cyclical ups and downs as our first-fit business. And we've been growing the aftermarket significantly over the last couple of years.","We're seeing a little \u2013 as Tom and Mark said, a little slowdown this year, a little moderation of the growth, but we have strong confidence in the aftermarket, both distribution and the parts businesses are going to look really \u2013 perform really well on the downturn.","Thomas Linebarger","And part of that Tony is due to the growing population of Cummins engine out in the field and in a number of end markets, that means we've got to build in pipeline of aftermarket opportunity over time.","Mark Smith","Yes. So I think you have that right. We've got some \u2013 we think are going to remain relatively sideways while the others go down. The other thing going on, which you probably saw in the numbers is in the distribution business, especially in North America, there's been still quite a bit of improvement driven from our initial acquisition of all of our North American distributors.","We spent the first four years making sure we consolidated, got the right managers in the right place, made sure we held on to customers and let them know that we're a good distribution business and care for customers.","And now what we're beginning to do is figure out how to operate those businesses more or like a North American distribution business rather than a bunch of different branches. And so we're beginning to see some improvement in profitability. We'll see where that goes from here, but there's a lot of good plans in that distribution business.","So my own view is I'd like to see it do better than sideways because I think there are opportunities for it to do better than sideways during the downturn. But I think Tony has called the aftermarket point just right. We always see a little bit of noise where utilization goes down here or there. We don\u2019t go down a little bit, but we're talking about 5% drops as opposed to 30% or 40% drops.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thank you. And then just a related follow-up. I mean your biggest customers still seeing in mid single-digit growth for Parts and your Components business is down 6%. I know they're not apples-to-apples and it sounds like most of the weaknesses is international as opposed to North America. But are you losing share in any of your key markets for components and is the model changing at all, particularly with respect to that customer? They're focusing very, very heavily on their distribution business and seem to be stocking more parts from others as well, so just thoughts there?","Mark Smith","The best proxy for our overall Parts business is really the Distribution business. The Components business is probably 70% for us fit, Ross. So turbochargers what was going on the new equipment, obviously that's down quite heavily in some of the markets right now. Our underlying Parts business, we're confident in that. That's not the real issue here.","Thomas Linebarger","Yes. And by the way, we believe that with OEMs like our customers, them doing well in parts is not a detriment to comments because remember there's a whole group of parts players, secondhand parts players and rebuild parts builders and even people that are bringing in different makes of parts.","And so what we are wanting to do is make sure our end customers get real quality parts and they get a good service experience. And if they do that Cummins and our customers grow their market share and we earn good parts revenue. So we earn good parts of margin selling through our OEM channels just as we do sell in through our own channel.","So from our point of view, just gaining share in the market through our customers and through us all looks like a win to us in terms of both revenue growth and profit growth. So for us, them \u2013 our customers gaining share is not a bad thing, but a good thing.","Ross Gilardi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Joel Tiss with BMO.","Joel Tiss","Hey, guys. How is it going? ","Thomas Linebarger","Hi, Joel.","Joel Tiss","I just wondered if you can talk a little bit about power gen. The revenues were up a little bit. You guys have been working on that business for four years or five years to lower the cost. And just any color on why the margins are under pressure there?","Thomas Linebarger","Joel, I'd love to throw that one to Tony, but probably isn't very yet. I'll give them a quarter or two. But no, you hit it on the head. I mean we're not where we want to be on the power gen business. The good news, of course, overwhelmingly been data centers. The data center business has continued to grow. We keep expecting it maybe to be built out, but it just turns out not to be. We're continuing to see more data center business. And of course, we've now got the Asian section of data center business also growing, which is, which gives kind of a second kick to the data center business.","The basic standby business has not been good for some time. It's not that there isn't any, there is. It's a big business and it doesn't \u2013 it's a lot of business for our distribution system, but it hasn't been growing. It hasn't really recovered in any significant way. And we saw a little bit of recovery earlier this year and thought, well finally, and then it kind of tailed off. And then of course we had \u2013 we've had a couple of really bad areas like the Middle East has been really bad for a while, but I've just kind of pulled the life out of whatever growth we did see.","So we're not exactly sure what that means about the market. We have a lot of market data about it and trying to understand what the future trend is. I mean, we understand what the past is really well, what the future trend looks like. It's hard to see, but it looks like, broadly speaking that energy demand while still increasing is increasing at a rate that's slower than energy capacity build. And that's mostly because while there's been growth since the downturn in 2008 and 2009, its growth has been relatively modest and infrastructure has kept up as compared to the high growth we saw especially in developing countries in the decade before.","That said, we got a lot more work to do. It's still a profitable business for us and good returns, especially when you consider the fact we've got a distribution part to it, plus we've got all the industrial business engines that come from it, but we want it to be more profitable and we're disappointed with where we are. There's just nothing else to say about that.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And then so Tony doesn't feel left out. Can you give us your kind of best shot at, if you think the underlying demand for transportation is enough to absorb all the excess capacity that's in the channel now, by the time we exit 2021?","Tony Satterthwaite","That's a tough question. I probably was better prepared to answer the power gen, and this was given I ran that business quite a few years. That's a great question. And I don't think I have a good answer to be honest. I don't really have a strong view of that yet. So maybe in a very unfair thing, I'll see if Rich wants to have a shot.","Joel Tiss","Yes, that\u2019s one of his babies.","Thomas Linebarger","He's going to bring out the pictures of his grandkids first, but then he'll answer the\u2026","Richard Freeland","Just play back one more time, Joel.","Joel Tiss","The growth in transportation demand, the way you guys see it is enough that by the end of 2021, it can absorb all the excess capacity that we're seeing in the channel right now.","Richard Freeland","Okay. Yes, I mean I think so and what you have Joel, you know, when lead times get long, the order boards actually get over inflated because people are wanting to get, build slots and all that. And right now I think actually it's underrepresented what the demand is because I think \u2013 I mean what the future demand is. So like I talked to fleets, they're not putting orders in right now because they're saying lead time is low, I can put it in later, I can delay that. But eventually the trucks run and they need to be replaced. And so I just think we're going to have our normal shake out over a few quarters and then kind of get the backlog cleared out and the orders will begin to come back in.","Thomas Linebarger","And maybe just a little historical protective, Joel because it's always hard when you're here at the floor to figure out when does it all get right. But historically, you'd say what \u2013 I mean, you'd say in four quarters the market will be back. Again, there maybe something unique about this, but it isn't obvious that there is something unique.","So we'd expect by the end of the year that we would indeed have absorbed whatever there is. There's one other trend underlying. You've probably seen this, but people like the new engines and trucks, they're seeing much better performance reliability out of new engines and trucks.","So I think anything that's older than 2017 you're going to see no matter how, whatever we are in the cycle, people are going to want to switch out those trucks and engines just because they're getting such lower operating costs out of the newer engines and trucks. That'll be a little bit of a boost, I think as we start to get out to the back half of the year.","James Hopkins","Okay. I think we've got time for one more last question.","Operator","Okay. Our next question will come from David Raso with Evercore ISI.","David Raso","All right. Thank you.","Thomas Linebarger","You slipped in David. Way to go.","David Raso","I have a question about the JV income, really a clarification, but then I want to talk to the markets real quickly. I apologize with the phone cutting out, maybe I missed it. The JV incomes implied bouncing back in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Is that related to some of the emerging markets and how you're handling the upcoming emission standards? I'm just curious why it bounces back from $68 million to implied $79 million in the fourth quarter?","James Hopkins","Yes. Hey, Ross, this is James. So there's a couple of little things go on from the third to the fourth quarter, so most of the markets are relatively stable as we go from Q3 to Q4. China gets a little bit better than some of the on highway markets, like commercial vehicles starts popping up just a little bit as well. And so you've got a couple of positive things going in the right direction there. But it's a relatively modest on both from Q3 to Q4 in the grand scheme of things.","David Raso","But I was trying to think about is what you're implying about 2020 to have that bounce back because in the quarter the royalty and interest income really dropped down as just wasn't sure what was going on there. So we'll talk offline.","What I wanted to ask about particular though, outside of North America truck and obviously Tom, you have great insight from your customers and markets, what they're telling you, different players do different things and getting ahead of the curve behind the curve outside of North America truck.","Can you just take me around the horn quickly on which markets do you think what you're hearing from your customers? They're actually getting ahead of the curve on taking production down to almost leading things out by the end of the year, which ones are so clearly behind the curve and which ones look about just right. Just we'll get some level set on various geographies and end markets going into\u2026?","James Hopkins","Yes. Let's start with China. So clearly in China, the construction guys overbuilt, in the second half of 2018 thinking they're going to have a great 2019. They overbuilt and they're clearly behind the curve, right. You saw that \u2013 you heard the numbers, like the markets up and we're down a pile and that's just because they're just selling dealer inventory and their own manufactured inventory, so that that's for sure.","It won't take very many quarters before they're caught up, but they're in not at that stronger market, so it's stronger than we thought it would be today, but it's not so strong. So we're hopeful they'll catch up in a few quarters. But again, it just really depends on end markets.","I think truck markets a little bit better than we thought. I think people are pretty much caught up. Nobody's really far ahead. The only thing as you heard was there some prebuy done, which means they'll have some inventory, but it's mostly in gas. It's pretty small markets I'd say.","China, we got the construction markets to catch up and they're behind and the truck market's kind of on. In India, it's just \u2013 we just got the rug pulled out. The whole finance thing means it's all underwrite. There's nobody carrying a bunch of inventory or anything. There are some, but that's not the big problem. The big problem is the demands all completely flatness back. So there's really, I mean who's behind the head is kind of the side story.","In Europe by the way is straight on. So Europe has got no big challenges in inventory a little bit here and there, but generally speaking, Europe has kind of moved from pretty good, okay, they're not \u2013 it's not a disaster. It's just, okay. And I see pretty quickly everybody's adjusting hourly rates in Europe. I was just talking to a bunch of the OEMs they're all adjusting down. Everybody's making the adjustments. There'll be down to the right numbers in a quarter or two. So I'd say that's right.","On the mining side, they adjusted super quickly. I mean, in my opinion too quickly maybe, but mining is not a disaster or anything. It just rose up and it kind of leveled out pretty quickly and they're not overbuying and for obvious reasons they already did and it's bad. So mining is one where I don't think we have a lot of \u2013 they're on plan. In fact, maybe keeping costs lower than they would have in the past segments.","And then Latin America, I guess broadly speaking, things aren't very strong. We thought Brazil would be better than it is. And the big issue has been export markets. The domestic demand is about where we thought, it's up a few percent in GDP. I mean, and then underlying demands up. But the export market, because Argentina is a big wreck.","And frankly all around, Latin America what you're having is used to be Brazil was the problem. Now you got every other economy is a problem. And so there is a little inventory there, but the numbers have been so low that it's nothing to worry about. So I guess the only place I'm really worried about is China construction with regard to inventory and we're already reporting those numbers thereof.","And in North America, Tony talked about this, but there'll be a couple of quarters where our market share will fall while they use their own engines and get all those, get their truck production down and get everything leveled out. But then it will be right back to normal.","Mark Smith","And then just a smaller market, but marine feels like it's on a bit of an opportunity\u2026","David Raso","Is there a pick up in marine or is it production just getting back in line with a flat business?","Mark Smith","Yes. I think demand is picking up.","Thomas Linebarger","Demand is picking up a little. Again, it's in a weak set of markets. It's just that it started, came off the bottom basically.","David Raso","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, David.","Mark Smith","Thank you, David.","Thomas Linebarger","Thank you. Bye-bye.","Tony Satterthwaite","So thank you, everybody.","Mark Smith","Yes. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded.","And now I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program Mark Smith, VP of Finance Operations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Jonathan. Good morning everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2017. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger, our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland, we will all be available for your questions at the end of our prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in our forward-looking disclosure statement in our slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we\u2019ll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading Investors and Media.","Now, I'll turn it over to Tom.","Tom Linebarger","Thank you, Mark, riveting as always. Good morning everybody. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2017. Pat will then take you through more details about our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Revenues for the third quarter of 2017 were $5.3 billion, an increase of 26% compared to the third quarter of 2016. EBIT $640 million or 12.1% compared to $398 million or 9.5% a year ago. EBIT increased primarily due to stronger volumes and the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, but fell below our expectations as a result of an increase in quality cost.","Engine business sales in the third quarter increased by 26% compared to a year ago due to higher demand from truck customers in North America and stronger sales to global construction. EBIT for the quarter was 9.8%, up from 4.8% in the same-period last year. EBIT percent increased due to strong operating leverage and higher sales and the benefit of material cost initiatives. Engine business incurred elevated costs for the product campaigns in the third quarter as it did in the third quarter last year.","Sales for the distribution segment increased 17% year-over-year including 6% growth resulting from an acquisition completed last year. Organic sales increased as a result of higher demand for new engine, parts and engine rebuild from off-highway customers. Third quarter EBITDA was 5.2% compared to 6.4% in the third quarter of 2016. EBIT percent declined as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by an increase in variable compensation costs, resulting from stronger overall company performance. Third quarter revenues for the component segment increased by 34% to $1.5 billion. International sales increased 45% due to strong truck demand in China and the growth of new products developed to meet the recently implemented Bharat Stage IV Emission Regulations in India.","In North America, revenues increased 26% as a result of stronger truck demand and increase market share. Our new Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technology joint venture became fully operational on August 1 and contribute 6% to segment revenue in the third quarter - segment revenue growth. We are already experiencing strong customer pull for next generation products being designed and manufactured by the joint venture, which is encouraging. Segment EBIT for the third quarter increased to 14.2% from 12.9% in the same quarter a year ago as a result of stronger volumes and material cost reduction programs.","Power system sales increased by 23% in the third quarter primarily driven by an increase in engine parts - engine and parts sales to mining and oil and gas customers. EBIT in the third quarter was 7.7% compared to 6.9% a year ago. EBIT percent improved as the positive impact of stronger volumes and joint venture earnings more than offset the negative impact of rising commodity costs and higher variable compensation costs. We continue to drive further improvements in operating performance in the power systems business. In the fourth quarter, we will complete our previously announced plans to consolidate generator set assembly from our Kent, UK facility into our Daventry engine plant and other generator set plants.","Recently, we announced additional actions to rationalize the manufacturing footprint in our alternator business, which will result in a reduction in manufacturing capacity at our Stamford UK site. When complete the combination of these two initiatives will yield more than 100 basis points of margin improvement for the power systems segment even at current revenue levels. Now, I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the third quarter of 2017 starting with North America and then I will discuss some of our largest international markets.","Our revenues in North America improved 25% in third quarter with the addition of Eaton Cummins Transmission Technologies joint venture and a distributor acquisition contributing 5% growth. Organic sales increase primarily due to higher truck demand, increased sales of construction equipment and an improvement in orders from oil and gas and mining customers. Our shipments of engines to North American heavy-duty truck customers increased 39% in the third quarter and our year-to-date market share stands at 32.5%, up 2% over last year.","In the medium-duty truck market, our unit sales increased 41%. Our market share in the medium-duty truck market is 78% year-to-date, a 4% improvement from last year. Engine shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 19% reflecting strong consumer demand and a weaker quarter last year when our largest OEM customer took an extended shutdown. Sales of engines for construction equipment in North America grew 39% in the third quarter compared to a weak market last year. Sales to high horsepower markets in North America increased almost 200% from extremely low levels a year ago driven by higher sales to oil and gas, and mining customers.","Revenue for power generation increased 6% due to higher demand in the recreational vehicle market and stronger sales to prime power customers. Our international revenues for the third quarter increased by 28% compared to a year ago driven by strong market growth in China and new products in India. Third quarter revenues in China including joking ventures were $1.2 billion, an increase of 46% due to stronger on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China increased by 69% compared to a year ago, while our engine shipments increased 39%. Increased enforcement of overloading regulations and improved growth in the economy contributed due to the strong truck demand.","Our volumes grew at a lower rate than the overall market as Dongfeng one of our partner OEM experienced a decline in its truck market share. Year-to-date our engine market share is 14%, down from 15% in 2016. Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 23% above the overall market growth rate of 13% as Foton continues to displace local competitor engines from its vehicle lineup with engines produced by our joint venture. Our share of the light-duty market is now 8% year-to-date, up from 7% a year ago.","Chinese industry demand for excavators in the third quarter increased 99% from a year ago due to an improvement in property construction and infrastructure investment. Our shipments of construction engines more than doubled as we picked up share in excavators and wheel loaders in the expanding market. Revenues for our power systems business in China increased 38% due to increased demand for power generation equipment from data center and telecom customers, and growth in industrial engine shipments to mining and rail markets.","Third quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $374 million, a 28% increase from the third quarter a year ago, driven by growth in sales of new products developed by our components business to meet the recently introduced Bharat Stage IV Emission Regulations for trucks. Industry truck production increased 17% year-over-year reflecting a growing economy and the implementation of overloading regulations. Year-to-date, our engine market share is 38%, down from 40% a year ago.","We did see an acceleration in our market share in September though, reflecting a very positive customer feedback we've received on the performance of our BS4-compliant engine compared to local competitors. Revenues for our power systems business decreased 8% driven by a temporary slowdown in orders due to the implementation of the new Goods and Service Tax System called GST. In Brazil, our revenues increased by 32% compared to very weak levels in 2016 primarily due to an increase in truck production to meet export demand.","Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2017 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2017 to be up 14% to 15% higher than our prior guidance of up 9% to 11% due to stronger demand in number of regions and markets. We've raised our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 218,000 units, up 8% from 2016 and above our prior forecast of 205,000 units. We have updated our market share projection to be in the range of 30% to 33%.","In the medium-duty truck market, we have raised our outlook for the market size to 118,000 units, an increase of 9% to 2016 and above our previous forecast of 115,000 units. We now expect our full-year market share to be in the range of 74% to 76%, up one market share point from our previous guidance range. Engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be flat for the full year, down from our prior forecast of 5% growth as our largest OEM customer plans to take an extended shutdown in December to prepare for a new model change.","In China, we expect domestic revenues including joint ventures to be up between 35% and 40% compared to our previous projection of 26% growth in 2017, with demand running ahead of our previous forecast in most end markets. We've raised our outlook for medium and heavy truck demand to 1.37 million units, a 42% increase from 2016 and higher than our previous guidance of 1.23 million units. In the light-duty truck market, we now expect growth of 8% in 2017, up from our previous guidance of a 3% increase.","We currently project our market share in the medium and heavy duty truck market to be 14%, down from 15% in 2016. In the light-duty market we expect our share to exceed 8%, up from 7% in 2016. Our construction revenues in China are now expected to more than double for 2017. In India, we expect total revenues including joint ventures to be up 14% year-over-year. Truck demand has rebounded much faster than expected barring the implementation of Bharat Stage IV Emission Regulations and as a result we are raising our guidance for full-year productions to 346,000 units, an improvement of 12% from our prior forecast and flat to last year.","We currently project our full-year market share to be 40% compared to 41% a year ago. As the government continues to advance improvements in infrastructure, we also expect growth in rail, construction and power generation next year. In Brazil, we expect truck production to increase 26% in 2017 from extremely low levels - in 2017 from extremely low levels last year representing the first annual increase in production since 2013. We currently project global high horsepower engine shipments to increase more than 30%, unchanged from our previous forecast. Improving demand from global mining customers and higher sales of engines for oil and gas applications in North America are driving the growth.","In summary, we've raised our full-year outlook for sales to increase 14% to 15%, above the prior forecast of sales growth between 9% and 11%. We raised our forecast for EBIT to be in the range of 11 - we've devised our forecast for EBIT to be in the range of 11.8% to 12.2%, which is actually unchanged from the prior projection except for the inclusion of the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture.","We are experiencing strong momentum in a number of important markets and we are executing well with the successful launch of new products delivering growth and higher market share. We\u2019ve also continued to advance our strategy to be the leading provider of electrified powertrains. Recently we reached an agreement to purchase the assets of Brammo Inc, a company that has expertise in design and development of battery packs, a critical capability in the development of electrified powertrains. Cummins will gain access to new markets and generate revenues from Brammo's existing industrial customer base, while continuing to advance the optimization of battery packs, learning from the real world operation of a technology and demand in custom applications.","During the third quarter, we recorded a charge of $29 million for the expected cost of field actions to address the emissions performance of certain pre-2013 model year engine systems in North America. These field actions are necessary to address the unexpected degradation in performance of a component of the aftertreatment system in certain circumstances and applications. Furthermore, we are evaluating other engine systems in model years 2010 through 2015 in North America that could potentially be subject to similar degradation issues. As this evaluation is still ongoing, we are currently unable to estimate the outcome of these matters. It's important to note that our engines have passed multiple emissions tests over a number of years and that the issue of degradation aftertreatment performance does not apply to our current products which are performing well and gaining market share.","Completing this evaluation and addressing any issues that may arise is our highest priority. We will provide updates as quickly as possible, but given the variety of applications and operating conditions under which the engine systems are operating, it may take until the middle of 2018 to finalize the analysis and any associate actions that may arise. We are collaborating closely with both the EPA and CARB and do not expect any fines or penalties related to this matter.","Although there's a lot to be positive about in our business today, we're disappointed with the unexpected quality issues and associated cost that we've experienced in recent quarters. After Pat has provided a more detailed update on our financial performance, which is going to outline for you a number of steps that the company is taking to drive sustainable improvement in costs associated with product quality going forward.","Now let me turn it over the Pat.","Pat Ward","Thank you Tom, and good morning everyone. I will start with a review of the company's third quarter financial results before discussing the performance of the operative segments in more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Third quarter revenues were $5.3 billion, an increase of 26% from a year ago and a record for the company. Sales increased in each of our four operating segments primarily driven by stronger demand in global on-highway, construction, mining, and oil and gas markets.","Sales in North America which represented 59% of our third quarter revenues, improved by 25% from a year ago due to increased sales of engines and components in the higher levels of heavy and medium-duty truck production and an increase in demand for industrial engines. International sales improved by 28% from a year ago due to increased demand in China, India, Europe and South America which offset weaker demand in the Middle East.","Gross margins were 25.3% of sales, which declined from 25.8% a year ago, primarily due to higher warranty and variable compensation expense, which offset the benefits from the stronger volumes and material cost reduction initiatives. Warranty cost increased from 2% of sales up to 3.9% in the third quarter. Selling, admin, and research and development cost of $837 million or 15.8% [ph] of sales decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points. The increase of $167 million year-over-year was mainly due to higher variable compensation expense and investments for new products. Joint venture income of $95 million increased by $21 million compared to last year primarily due to increased demand in China for both on and off highway equipment.","Other income and expense improved by $29 million mainly due to a gain recognized in the third quarter of this year for the sale of power generation rental assets. And as mentioned earlier, results in the third quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by a loss contingency. Earnings before interest and tax were $640 million or 12.1% of sales for the quarter compared to $398 million or 9.5% of sales last year. EBITDA as a percent of sales improved primarily due to the absence of the previously discussed loss contingency while the positive impact of higher sales, lower material cost and stronger joint venture income was partially offset by the increase in warranty and variable compensation expense. Net earnings for the quarter were $453 million of $2.71 per diluted share compared to $289 million or $1.73 last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.5%.","Moving onto the operating segments let me summarize their performance in the quarter and then I will review the company\u2019s revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some cash flow highlights. In the engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 26% from last year. On-highway sales grew by 25% as a result of increased truck production in North America, while strong demand for engines - for construction equipment in China and North America led to 30% increase in off-highway revenues.","Segment EBIT in the third quarter was $229 million or 9.8% of sales. This compares to $89 million or 4.8% a year ago which included $99 million charge for the loss contingency. Benefits from the higher volumes, stronger joint venture earnings in China and the absence of the loss contingency more than offset higher warranty costs on variable compensation expense. We now expect full-year revenues to be up 12% to 14% compared to previous guidance of up 10% to 12% due to sustained demand in North America truck and international construction markets and we're now forecasting full-year EBIT margins to be in range of 10.5% to 11% of sales.","For the distribution segment, third quarter revenues were a record $1.8 billion, which increased 17% compared to last year. Organic sales for the quarter increased 11% while revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 added a further 6%. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $91 million or 5.2% of sales compared to $96 million or 6.4% a year ago. Increased variable compensation cost resulting from the stronger overall company performance offset the benefits of higher sales and gains from a divestiture of assets related to power generation rental equipment.","For 2017, distribution revenue is now projected to increase 11% to 13% compared to our previous guidance of up 9% to 11% due to strong off-highway demand for engines, parts and rebuilds. We are now forecasting EBIT margins to be between 5.25% and 5.75% of sales for the full year. For the components segment, revenues were $1.5 billion in the third quarter, a 34% increase from the year ago and a quarterly record. Excluding the revenues in the Eaton Cummins joint venture, the components segment still delivered record revenues for the quarter, which were 28% higher than last year.","International revenues increased by 45% primarily due to 52% increase in sales in China and from continued growth in sales of aftertreatment systems in India to meet the new on-highway emissions standard that was introduced in April. Sales in North America increased 26% as a result of the higher heavy-duty and medium-duty truck production. Segment EBITDA was $217 million or 14.2% of sales compared to $148 million or 12.9% of sales a year ago driven primarily by the increased volumes and the benefits from material cost reductions, which more than offset higher variable compensation and warranty expense.","For 2017, we now expect revenue to increase 20% to 22% compared to prior guidance of up 13% to 15%. Stronger than expected truck demand in China and in North America along with the inclusion of the estimated sales of $150 million for the Eaton Cummins joint venture are the main contributors to the increase in our sales forecast. EBIT is projected to be in a range of 13% to 13.5% of sales for the full-year. In the power systems segment, third quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 23% from a year ago.","Mining revenues increased 56% and oil and gas revenues by almost 500% from extremely low levels a year ago, while power generation sales increased by 7%. Segment EBIT was $81 million or 7.7% of sales in the quarter, up from $59 million or 6.9% last year. Benefits from the growth and industrial engine shipments and part sales were partially offset by higher variable compensation costs resulting from the overall company's performance and an increase in commodity costs.","For 2017, we now expect power system segment revenues to increase 11% to 13% versus prior guidance of up 8% to 10%. The stronger demand in industrial markets, particularly in mining, and oil and gas markets driving the improvement. EBIT margins are now expected to be between 6.5% and 7% of sales for the full year. And for the company, we are raising our outlook for revenues to be up 14% to 15% from the previous guidance of up 9% to 11%. This increase is driven by higher levels of truck production in North America, increased demand for rebuild and new engine sales for the oil and gas, and mining customers in North America and strong demand in construction and truck market in China.","We do not anticipate foreign currency to have a significant effect on the revenue for the full year due to the recent appreciation of foreign currencies against the US dollar. And this guidance also includes sales of approximately $150 million from the new Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture. Income from unconsolidated joint ventures is now expected to increase by 25% in 2017 as a result of the higher than expected levels of demand in China for both on and off highway equipment which is continued into the second half of the year and this compares to previous guidance of 12% increase. We expect company EBIT margins to be between 11.8% and 12.2% of sales which includes the impact of Eaton Cummins joint venture and compares to 11.4% reported last year. And the tax rate for the full year is expected to be 26%.","Turning to cash flow, cash generated from operating activities for the third quarter was $645 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $1.5 billion, a 12% increased from the same nine month period last year. We anticipate operating cash flow in 2017 to be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $100 million bringing the year-to-date total to $282 million and we still expect that investments will be in range of $500 million to $530 million for the full year.","And consistent with our plans to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year, we have returned $913 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments in the first nine months of the year. And in the third quarter, we increased the dividend by over 5% and repurchased 1.7 million shares. As Tom said, although we are disappointed with the increase in warranty costs we are encouraged with the progress made so far this year in our overall performance with sales up 15% on a year-to-date basis, EBIT up $350 million or 24% higher and earnings per share up 27%.","Market is sort of turning as you can see from the results so far and from the increase in guidance across all four segments and we are well prepared to meet customer demand as market conditions continue to improve. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that we will be holding an Analyst Day on November 16 in Indianapolis, Indiana, a webcast of our presentation will be available in the Investor Section of our website.","Now let me turn over to Rich.","Rich Freeland","Thank you, Pat and good morning everyone. As mentioned, we have had quality charges in recent quarters that have been unacceptable. And while our overall quality as seen by our customer remains excellent and we're gaining share in many markets, we have had specific issues that have impacted financial results and our customers and we are committed to eliminating these issues. To this end, we're reviewing all aspects of product quality to identify where improvements can be made. This work is underway including and listing outside specialists where appropriate to review specific aspects of our operating systems.","Areas of this work include an overall assessment of our product development process focused on preventing problems, a focus on supplier quality and supplier accountability as most of our recent issues have been in this area and the increased use of telematics and analytics to find and fix issues quicker. We are implementing real changes in moving quickly with these corrective actions.","These initiatives have the highest attention of our leadership team and improvements will be monitored by our board. It is important to note that we've made clear and significant improvement in our warranty cost over time. For example, warranty costs on our 2017 heavy-duty engines are down more than 40% from four years ago. Our products are performing well, gaining share, but we can and will do better in this area. In summary, we know the issues, we know how to fix them and we have strong corrective actions underway to drive sustainable improvement.","Now I'll turn it back to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks Rich and now we're ready to turn it over to the Q&A section of the call. Please limit your call to one question and a related follow-up and then get back in queue. And then I'll be available after the call for any follow-up questions. Thank you very much please proceed.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs, your question please.","Jerry Revich","I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about the adjustment to power systems EBIT and distribution EBIT, so reduction to absolute level of EBIT even as sales are up. How much should we think about those costs as being transitory versus sustained price cost as we all try to get calibrated on what operating leverage looks like in \u201818?","Mark Smith","Hey Jerry, this is Mark, so I think we've got a clear line of sight in margin improvement in power systems and distribution. I think in power systems we\u2019ve had basically two significant operating challenges this year. One has been as described as disappointing performance on one large power project, which is going to run out through the end of this year. That's impacted profitability. And then we've had some pressure on commodity costs, particularly copper costs within our alternative business and we are taking pricing actions to recover, but those -- we\u2019ve been kind of chasing those costs. In addition, we've got the execution of our previously announced restructuring actions to move our Kent genset assembly operations into our Daventry engine plant. That's almost complete and so we're on track to get savings next year. And then just this quarter, we've announced further actions to rationalize the footprint within our alternator business to downsize our Stamford, UK facility. ","Just those two restructuring actions alone are going to add over 100 basis points of margin, Jerry at the current level and then probably we\u2019ll get another 75 basis points from the other -- from the other project performance year over year. Again, volumes can move around, but we've got clear plans for improvement plus the copper pricing. So I think we\u2019re confident we're going to get margin improvement.","Tom Linebarger","I think on the distribution, if I could just add on that, distribution, as we mentioned in the remarks that it\u2019s, as a divisional matter, still smaller than the other divisions and takes a little harder hit when we have variable compensation costs going up, which is just a matter again of timing, where we are now starting the upcycle, and so our variable compensation costs went up. Next year over this year, that won't be such a factor and again also as we've acquired the distributors, we've done a lot of consolidation and we've 8 32:31 bringing those businesses in. I think a lot of the benefits are ahead of us. So in both cases, we feel strongly that as the cycle continues to go, because we are at mid cycle, not the top, so we still have a lot of room to go. As the cycle continues to rise, both those businesses will see improvement in margin on an ongoing basis, both on the market plus all the improvements work that we've done inside the divisions.","Jerry Revich","And then separately on the joint venture, can you talk about your expectations of the cadence of new product rollouts, nice to see the product rolled out at PACCAR, can you talk about if you expect that number of additional roll outs over the next 12 months and as you see the rollouts in your models, what timeframe does this business become a positive earnings contributor?","Rich Freeland","This is Rich. Yeah. So the customer poll on the next gen heavy duty transmissions is strong. So we're rolling out with PACCAR right now this month and we\u2019ll add additional OEMs early in 2018 and so -- and we're counting on getting really good fuel economy improvement from that. So the results look really encouraging. We're talking up to 7% additional. And then we'll also -- longer term, we're looking to more of the international market. So that's not in the short-term projections, but there's interest in particular in China, lots of interest in this, there is discussions about [indiscernible] probably slower in India, but like we said, it will be a couple of years of rollout, kind of moving expenses as we absorb amortization and pretty heavy development costs in the early -- in the first couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Two questions. Both probably to you Tom. I guess my first question, what I'm hearing from investors is, as we look to 2018, US truck production should be up double digit, but moderates after that, so that cycles over and then China is probably like the headwind. And given some of the issues that you're having, the concern is sort of you missed the cycle much potential incremental headwinds to margins again this year, given the concerns on the quality and the warranty issues. So can you sort of help me out there where there is potential positive opportunities in 2018 to make up for what we're seeing?","And then my second question is, the other question I get from investors is just given, I mean I know you've been spending a lot of your time looking externally on acquisitions or developing the strategy for EV or more broadly, but the concern is that some of -- because we're so focused externally that perhaps this is part of the reason why we're seeing some of these issues consistently across the business.","Tom Linebarger","So first, let me just start with the point about where we are in the cycle. As I mentioned, we are clearly not at the top of the cycle, so we are mid cycle at best and again, it's a range depending on which market you're looking at, but we see 2018 as a significant opportunity for the company to expand and our markets further, power systems markets, we see a lot more upside, including in truck markets, some markets like China feel pretty, like, they might be getting near the top, but other markets, North America, India, et cetera, we still think there's much more room to grow and of course Brazil, which is a big market for us has barely come off the bottom. ","So we do see upside across our markets and as I mentioned in my remarks, as we've added these new components to meet some of these emissions cycles, we're seeing now -- we're starting to get the benefit, both in terms of market share, because the products are performing better, but also then in terms of content. So all of those look like upsides to us. Mark went through some of the benefits we've seen on the cost side, which we think are going to add margin, even at current revenues, so then as the revenues go further, we see a lot of opportunity again to expand margins. So from our point of view, we think we're nowhere near past the cycle and I think the evidence would suggest that's true based on kind of where we are in our market recoveries. ","And again, we are working hard to make sure that the cost reductions we started in the downturn, we continue now as markets improve in that way, we continue to expand margins. Also as Rich said, on the quality side, our products are performing well in the field, so our market share remains strong, which means that we continue to see volume growth, both from market and from market share. And as we improve our -- the financial cost of our quality, we think that represents further upside for the company\u2019s performance. And I want to be really clear about this. ","I'm incredibly confident in the team's ability to lead improvement and quality. We have incredible experience and knowledge in our business leadership. We have done this before. We know what to do when it's time to focus on quality. And as Rich said, we have a very focused program to do so. I am completely confident in that. There is no lack of focus in this business on how to improve quality. ","So I am very confident that we will get those improvements and that we\u2019ll see the results from it and again Rich and the team, I have my complete confidence and I am -- I support them on that work. I guess the only other thing to say is, there are some headwinds this year that we don't expect to repeat next year, for example, the variable comp numbers I mentioned to Jerry's question. So again, we are very optimistic about performance next year. We're excited about the position we have in our markets as a result of a lot of investment we've made in new products and in building customer loyalty over the last several years.","Jamie Cook","And I guess, just let me be unfair Tom, but just my second question was just because we're focusing a lot externally on potential M&A strategies, is that impacting results.","Tom Linebarger","And again I -- maybe just two more words on that. We have separated our work, so there is a group that I lead, strategy and business development that looks externally for acquisitions. It's a big group for us in that it's a relatively small group compared to the 55,000 people, it's a couple handfuls of people that are focused outside. All the rest of people are focused inside. So, there's no distraction from our business -- running our business successfully. There's no way to do that. Our business is incredibly competitive, our customers are very demanding, we have to keep complete focus on winning every day in our business and that's what we're doing. So yes, we have -- for Cummins, we have a significantly enhanced effort to look externally and we think we have some really significant opportunities to expand and grow the company based on the capabilities we've built over the years. We are very focused on that, but it is a handful of people -- a couple of handfuls of people not distracting the rest of the business at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher","Wondering if you could just talk about what the net impact of the commodity input costs was in the quarter on a year-over-year basis and if steel prices and I guess Mark you mentioned copper, if they stay where they are today, how long it's going to take to sort of flat line the impact there on a year-over-year basis?","Mark Smith","Yes. So just to be clear, Steven, I was talking specifically about the power systems business. For the company overall, we've been -- largely been able to offset commodity pricing, because no doubt there has been a good pressure, so we\u2019ll get about 60 basis points of net improvement in material costs this year, even though there's been overall inflation, but on the copper side and commodities within the power systems business, we\u2019re talking about a net $20 million exposure this year. Whereas coppers continue to accelerate in the second half of the year, even though we've seen underlying improvement in that business.","Tom Linebarger","And Mark, I think it's probably obvious, but just in case people aren\u2019t clear, the way that we offset those commodity costs, when it inflates, is that our purchasing and engineering group worked to find ways to reduce costs of other commodities or other products that we purchase through cost reduction work, engineering work, et cetera to find ways to lower costs. So we've been able to drive cost down that more than offset that inflation and then of course on the engine side, we benefit from inflation in commodities because mining of course has picked up as a result of inflation and commodity costs. So as a net matter, Cummins does better when commodities are stronger, we just have to work really hard on our supply side to offset the increase in commodity costs, in our purchased material.","Mark Smith","And Steven just to give you the fourth quarter numbers, so metal markets were up 50 basis points year over year, but to Tom's point, we offset that total material costs, excluding metal, came down by 100 basis points, a net 50 basis points positive in the fourth quarter.","Steven Fisher","And can you just give us a little more detail on the carbon, the EPA testing program in terms of the size of the population of engines that still need to be tested and what are these unresolved variables that you still have out there?","Rich Freeland","This is Rich. Just so you know where we are right now, so in Q3, some pre-2013 engines failed in used tests, those are the ones we're taking action on. Okay. And so because there are some similarities in that system and some of our other 2010 to 2015 systems, we're going to do a look with the EPA at that population. And so while there are similar characteristics, there are certainly not identical characteristics and there's lots of variation in the engines, in the vehicles, in operating conditions and so we're working with the EPA right now and it's just -- it's very early. So we're just starting that work. So we're not at a point where we -- we will over the coming months understand what that population and if there's additional actions to be taken, but we're just not at that point to say what it is yet.","Tom Linebarger","And all the actions that we know we need to take are in our costs already for Q3. So everything we know, we've already accrued for, the rest of this stuff, we're only in investigation phase and it\u2019s early.","Steven Fisher","And is this beyond Class 8 on highway?","Tom Linebarger","We really don't know all the populations that are affected, but it's on highway is the focus.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Chris Lazarenko","This is Chris Lazarenko on for Andy Casey. Just a quick clarification on the warranty expense. Within the quarter, is that total 63 inclusive of the 29 million related to EPA CARB or is that incremental? So a total of 92 million.","Mark Smith","Total of 92, when the 29 was distributed between components and engines.","Chris Lazarenko","And if I take the onetime charges year-to-date, the 15 million from Q1, 57 million from Q2 and the 92 million, do you expect to see some tailwinds in 2018 or is there increased new product costs to partially offset?","Mark Smith","No increased new product costs going forward, Chris. And just to give an example, the way we're thinking about this, the gross margin from a year ago was down two points because of the warranty issues. Okay. And that's been total that we have. So we're going after this really hard to get back to that level, which is where we've been for the last five years, five, six years, back down in the 2% range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.","Rob Wertheimer","So I guess understanding all you've said about the focus on quality and getting it fixed and you've already recorded all that you obviously have identified, are you able to give any kind of a sense as to whether the 29 million is 10% of the -- obviously maybe it's certain applications, so that it's not fair to extrapolate like I'm about to do, but I mean is it 10% of the engines you sold, it is it more or less and then could this potentially affect component systems that you sold to other manufacturers and is the 29 million right now just your own engines?","Tom Linebarger","Okay. So the 29 million is just our own engines. Okay. And Rob, I think it will be very dangerous to extrapolate. It's just too early. We don't know. And so again all we've done is where we\u2019ve actually identified the issue, we\u2019ve taken that charge and we're just starting the investigation.","Rob Wertheimer","And then could you just kind of delineate the 29 million charge you\u2019ve mentioned, what was the cause of the $63 million charge that was separate in engines in the quarter and then are either directly related to the 2Q issues or are they all just sort of separate issues that have popped up?","Rich Freeland","Good to clarify that. So the 29 is the emission issue we're talking about. We had another charge around a proactive safety campaign that we're going after in another population. So that's the 63 million. So much like we had in Q2 in power systems where we identified some issues internally, where there actually hadn't been issues yet with customers, we've gone proactively out to campaign and get those -- to get those engines. So that was the 63 million.","Mark Smith","And those are unrelated issues.","Rob Wertheimer","Perfect. Unrelated. And then that 63 obviously, you did the whole population, so we assume that issue is closed and that\u2019s the 29 that may or may not develop into the more?","Mark Smith","Exactly. Right. Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies.","Steve Volkmann","Just another quick follow-up. Rich, I think you just said that you're sort of targeting over the long term to kind of get warranty back to about 2% of sales and I think somebody said, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was like 3.9 or something this quarter and I'm just curious, let's put all this CARB stuff sort of separate and aside since we don't really know what that looks like, but how do we think about the trajectory of the warranty to sales ratio kind of over the next year or two.","Rich Freeland","Yes. So I think the trajectory looks pretty good on that. I mean I intend to get back in that level over the next several quarters with the actions we've taken, what we've seen. So again we've got the emission thing separate that we're going to deal with, but I'm actually very confident on that. And just, we've been there for -- we've been there for five years and so we've had two or three issues pop up, we know what they are, we put very robust, corrective actions in place and so I have confidence we'll get back to where we are. And in fact, what we're trying to do is use this as kind of a call, and say how do we take this to a new level going forward, down below the 2% where we've been.","Tom Linebarger","And Steve, we do expect improvement in this warranty in Q4.","Steve Volkmann","And then maybe kind of a philosophical question, maybe this is for Tom, but historically for many decades, I think the idea was that Cummins should probably not be involved in making end products because you don't want to compete with certain of your customers, but the world seems to be changing and I'm wondering if you have a view on whether it might make sense to actually vertically integrate into end products and kind of any of the end markets that you touch, if that's philosophically something you'd be willing to do or is that still seems like a bad idea.","Tom Linebarger","Steve is the philosopher in chief. I want to be clear about this. As we think through our strategy, all things are on the table. We never really block ourselves off from anything in particular and we regularly revisit questions like this, like are we -- should we expand our definition of what the power system is to include the piece of equipment, not just things around and we frequently reach this point where I think we do well, because we support equipment makers in their work to serve their customers. And as soon as we step over the line into the other side, our relationship with them changes once and forever. ","So a decision like that is a one-time decision, a good perfect example that we went from making engines for generator sets to making generator sets and then every single large generator set manufacturer decided we would not be a good strategic supplier anymore. It took them all some time to change us out, but they eventually did. And then we competed with them on a generator set basis, which turned out to be successful in time. But it's a one-time decision. So we are very clear that that is a thing that when you make it, you make it once. And right now, we don't see any reason to change it in trucks or construction equipment or any of our major markets. We think we're best served by partnering with OEM partners to help them be successful again. So philosophically, it's not off limits, it just turns out to be not a good decision.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI.","David Raso","First question is on cost. I'm just trying to think through some moving parts here. The R&D costs went up 22% sequentially. Can you help us understand are any of these unique costs that you've mentioned in that line item on the P&L or is that truly a increase in R&D that\u2019s significantly, how should we think about then R&D going forward?","Mark Smith","Good question. During the course of any given year, we receive significant funding, whether that's from government agencies, customers for specific programs and it just so happens that the timing of those recoveries is lumpy. You should expect to see the engineering costs moderate from that Q. That's not a permanent elevated level. I mean, there are clearly some areas of the business where we're investing more in engineering, but that's not a run rate.","David Raso","So the 4% of revenues and I assume we\u2019ll dive into this a little bit in Columbus at the meeting, but structurally the R&D moving forward, obviously, it spooked me a little bit to see that bigger revenue growth, but R&D that high and you're saying again, it was more on the engineering side and that will moderate?","Mark Smith","Yeah. I think again, within the engine business, particularly there was a spike related to that and then of course over the course of this full year, variable compensation higher. And last year this time, we were actually reducing our variable compensation as markets comp turned down. So you're seeing kind of a delta there as well, which will play into the overall numbers. But we\u2019ve said over the long run, 4% has been a reasonable target for engineering. We just don't expect to see significant jumps like that in any given quarter.","Pat Ward","And David, we will talk more about that at the Investor Conference, especially about how it relates to the continued investment in our current business and what our expectation should be for the investment required for that and then what about some of these new areas like electrified power trains, what should investors reasonably expect Cummins to invest in that, how will the return go on that, we are going to talk about that in some detail. We've heard a lot of investors ask about that and I think they're good questions. It's a new area, so we actually had to do quite a bit of work to get a sensible answer to it, but we will talk about that in a fair bit of detail in the Investor Day.","David Raso","And not to put words in your mouth for Columbus, obviously I\u2019ll be there. It\u2019s -- again your commentary doesn't sound like there's a notable step function coming in R&D.","Pat Ward","Exactly. There's a notable increase in investment which we've already started making which you\u2019ve seen in electrification, but as Mark said, we think we are in a good trajectory with our current business to keep R&D as a percent of sales in the same sort of area and we're not changing it for our base business and the question is what do we need to add for these new areas and how do we expect to earn a return on that, that's what we're going to address and by the way, I'm glad you're coming, I look forward to seeing you.","David Raso","On the warranty expense, you mentioned fourth quarter lower than the third quarter. So we had 3.7 last quarter, we\u2019re hoping that would come down to 3.2, we came in at 3.9, so that clipped about 17 cents on the quarter right there. The fourth quarter, can you give us some handicap on that? I'm just trying to think of the year-over-year \u201918 versus \u201917, but what's the base for \u201917, like what is the fourth quarter?","Pat Ward","David, that is in our guidance, fourth quarter will be around 2.5% of sales.","David Raso","If it's already down at 2.5, but you did mention this analysis with the EPA doesn't really get resolved there, at least last two -- mid of 2018, how should we extrapolate that fourth quarter warranty expense going down that much to think about \u201918?","Pat Ward","The thing that we're really doing here again is, and as mentioned in my remarks, Dave, we\u2019re just disappointed with these one-off issues that are showing up and the thing that we feel good about is that Rich and the team have been proactive on all these quality issues to make sure that customers do not experience problems. That's I think why our products are doing well in the field, why we're gaining market share. So our proactive approach I think and the fact that we're finding the issues and resolving them quickly is helping and that's a good thing. ","The bad thing is, financially, they\u2019ve offered us surprises in each year scores. You mentioned the numbers, you were expecting quite a bit lower warranty and instead we ended up with higher warranty. That was a surprise based on primarily this safety campaign that Rich talked about. So, that's the disappointing part and if it was just one quarter, you would say, well, it\u2019s just one quarter, but it's been several. So that's what we're trying to deal with. What we're trying to deal with quality system review is why do we keep getting these one-off issues and yes, we're doing the right thing by taking care of customers, but what we really need to do is eliminate them as an issue. ","And so that's what we're trying to address the really complicated system we sell. We need some more proactive and new tools to figure out how to avoid those issues. So that's what we're trying to do. The base level of warranty has already been operating in that low area. So really just by avoiding these one-off issues, we get right back down to those numbers in that 2% range that Rich was talking about. So it's not hard for us to imagine as being there the issue to address these one-offs.","David Raso","I mean the wild cards are what they are, but if you're at 2.5 for the fourth quarter and we agree there are some wildcards to whatever the EPA conversation goes to, the work you're doing with them and that's a pretty big population, I mean 2010 through 2015. But every 150s of warranty expense at current sales is almost $1 of earnings. So I'm just trying to understand if there's no more wildcards, we\u2019re ready at 2.5 in the fourth quarter, you're saying we're running at 2.5, running out and hopefully as Rich said, hopefully we're toward 2 at some point in \u201918, just no wildcards, that's the run rate base case.","Mark Smith","Yeah. Well 2s, so I'll give you 2018 guidance at the end of the year.","David Raso","Yeah. It\u2019s just the 2.5 pretty low and you\u2019re not assuming any more wild cards, but we're engaged conversation with the EPA and I just want to understand, is the three months from now and the 2.5 turns and the 3.5 in the fourth quarter, these wild cards aren't really that wild. I'm just trying to understand.","Mark Smith","I think that\u2019s really the point is that, so far, we've been able to forecast what our base warranty is pretty well and then we got off these one-off issues. The emissions work that Rich was talking about, we just don't know where that's going to go. So what we're talking about, we're talking about the fact that our base level warranty, we are confident of where it is and what we're trying to do is reduce the impact of these one-off issues, this emission study, we do not know whether that will result in these -- more of these one-off costs or not. It is just too early to tell, but we know we're taking a look and we\u2019ll let you know as soon as we know.","Operator","Our final question then for the day comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Vertical Research Partners.","Joe O'Dea","Can you give us any sense of just how to think about variable comp and the headwinds you're facing this year as you've had guide revised higher and sort of the flow through of that higher variable comp and just how to think about the impact of when that level sets to a baseline.","Mark Smith","So variable comp in the third quarter, Joe, just to give you a baseline, was $145 million higher than the third quarter of last year and for the full year, we expect it to be around $300 million higher than what it was for 2016. I think Tom mentioned earlier on, last year, we underperformed, so variable comp was more. So what we've expected to be, we\u2019re over performing relative to plan. So I think there\u2019s clearly at least 100 basis points of opportunity as we move into 2018 and we normalize variable comp back to planned levels.","Joe O'Dea","And then the other question is just on the engine segment, when you think about a lot of these would appear to be kind of one-off or timing cost burdens you got, it sounds like higher R&D in the quarter, warranty obviously, the emissions system, higher incentive comp. I mean if you start to back some of that stuff out, it looks like you might have been at an all-time record engine segment margin. And so maybe just to kind of validate that kind of observation and then talk a little bit about what you're seeing underneath the surface a little bit, how much the price might be in there, the mix advantages or some of the high horsepower comes back, but just to understand some of that underlying margin strength?","Mark Smith","You're absolutely right, not to diminish some of those one-offs, Joe, but clearly the underlying manufacturing operating performance is strong. Very little of it's got to do with price. It's operating improvement, net material cost servings, productivity gains and then of course joint venture earnings in China where we're doing pretty well also contributed a strong performance in that segment. So definitely, the business is operating well. The bit that we need to correct there is that the high horsepower engines are no longer in the end user segment. They\u2019re in the power systems segment and of course we\u2019re seeing a nice demand growth there and we\u2019d expect that certainly in earnings to continue. Nothing to do with high horsepower in the engine business.","Mark Smith","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."],"6307":["Cummins, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, Mark Smith, Vice President, Financial Operations. You may begin.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2018. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We'll all be available for your questions at the end of our prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in our slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly report on 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financials. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and today's materials are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Tom.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2018. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year.","Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.6 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the first quarter of 2017. EBITDA was $700 million or 12.6% compared to $705 million or 15.4% a year ago.","During the first quarter, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of $187 million for the expected costs of a product campaign. The charge was shared between the Engine and Components segments. This voluntary campaign is part of a proactive plan to address the performance of an aftertreatment component in certain on-highway products produced between 2010 and 2015 in North America.","We disclosed in our third quarter 2017 earnings release that we identified an issue caused by the degradation of performance of this aftertreatment component and that further analysis was required to understand the extent of the problem and the appropriate remedy. The product campaign recorded in the first quarter represents the next step in our process to proactively address this aftertreatment degradation issue.","We are working collaboratively with the regulatory agencies and we will need to get agreement from the agencies to finalize our action plans and only then we will know the full cost and timing to resolve the problem.","The charge of $187 million reflects our best estimate of the cost of implementing our proposed plan. We have also estimated range of additional costs should the regulatory agencies ask us to replace more aftertreatment hardware than our proposed plan which we believe to be between $0 or $400 million in the worst case. It's important to note that this issue does not affect our current products, which are performing very well, and our market share remains strong.","Excluding the charge for the campaign, EBITDA for the first quarter was $887 million, or 15.9%, reflecting an incremental margin of 19%. The strong operating performance in our manufacturing plants, positive pricing and the benefits of material cost reduction initiatives all contributed to the improved performance.","Engine business revenues improved by 21% in the first quarter compared to a year ago. Increased production and strong market share in North America truck markets and strong demand from global construction customers, especially in China and North America, drove most of the growth.","EBITDA for the quarter was 11.7% compared to 13.5% for the same period in 2017, due to $93 million of costs recorded in the quarter for the product campaign. Excluding the campaign, EBITDA was 15.5% reflecting an incremental margin of 25% year-over-year. Improved pricing, strong performance from our manufacturing plants, and lower operating expenses as a percent of sales, drove the margin expansion.","Sales for the Distribution segment grew by 13% year-over-year driven by higher demand for new engines, parts and service in off-highway markets. First quarter EBITDA was 6.6% compared to 7.9% in the first quarter of 2017. EBITDA percent declined due to lower earnings in Africa and the Middle East as a result of weak demand and currency volatility and a lower mix of parts sales in North America.","We do expect EBITDA to improve in dollars and as a percent of sales in the second quarter as a result of stronger parts sales, targeted price increases and cost control measures.","First quarter revenues for the Components segment rose by 30%. Sales in North America increased 35% and revenues in international markets grew by 25% as a result of rising market demand, strong market share, and the success of new products aimed at lowering emissions. Sales of the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission business contributed 9% to segment growth.","EBITDA for the first quarter was 12.9% compared to 16.1% in the same quarter a year ago and declined due to a charge of $94 million related to the product campaign. Excluding the campaign charge, EBITDA was 18.3%, reflecting an incremental margin of 26%. The improved margins resulted from strong operational performance and the benefits of material cost reduction programs.","Power Systems sales in the first quarter grew 22% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in engine and parts sales to mining and oil and gas customers. Sales of power generation products improved year-over-year for the third straight year \u2013 third straight quarter.","EBITDA in the first quarter was 13.2% compared to 9.6% a year ago, resulting in an incremental margin of 30%. The benefits of stronger volumes, cost reduction programs, better execution on power generation projects and stronger joint venture earnings in China all contributed to the margin expansion.","In the first quarter, we reported results of our electrified powertrain business for the first time. EBITDA was a loss of $10 million for the first quarter and losses will increase in subsequent quarters this year as we accelerate our investments in new product programs.","Now, I will comment on the performance in some of our key markets for the first quarter of 2018, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America grew 22% in the first quarter, primarily due to higher levels of truck production, growth in sales of construction equipment, and increased demand for engines from mining, oil and gas and power generation customers.","Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks grew 44% in the first quarter of 2018, while sales of our heavy-duty engines increased 48%. Our market share through February was 34%, up 2% from last year. Production of medium-duty trucks improved 9% in the first quarter, while our engine shipments grew 26%. Our market share in the medium-duty truck market was 82% through February, up from 75% a year ago. Total shipments in our North American pickup truck customers decreased 22% compared to a year ago, due to a short-term adjustment in production by one of our OEM customers.","Engine sales for construction equipment in North America increased 47% in the first quarter, reflecting increased customer confidence. Sales from engine shipments to high-horsepower markets in North America rose 79% compared to a year ago, driven by higher demand from oil and gas and mining customers. Revenues for power generation grew by 6% due to higher demand in the data center and recreational vehicle markets.","Our international revenues increased by 20% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 3% due to lower sales in on-highway markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 9% compared to a year ago. Our OEM partners under-produced relative to the market in the first quarter and our share dipped to 12% from 14%. We expect the first quarter to mark the low point for our market share with improvement expected in subsequent quarters. Industry sales of light-duty truck grew by 7% in the first quarter and our engine market share was 7%.","Demand for excavators in the third quarter increased 48% from a year ago in China. Our market share increased by 3% to 13% driven by strong performance by our customers, including LiuGong and Hyundai (09:32). Revenues for our Power Systems business in China increased 57% due to growth in engine shipments to mining customers and higher demand for power generation equipment for data centers.","First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $581 million, an increase of 43% from the first quarter a year ago due to growth in on- and off-highway markets and strong sales of new products in our Components business. Industry truck production increased 18% year-over-year, driven by growing industrial activity and government investments to develop infrastructure.","Our market share in the quarter was 42%, up 300 basis points compared to the same period last year, largely due to strong market acceptance of our engine system technology for the Bharat Stage IV emissions regulations introduced last year. Our penetration at Tata rose to 90% in the quarter with both Tata and Cummins benefiting from strong product performance relative to the competition. Power generation revenues also grew 6%.","In Brazil, all revenues increased by 46%, primarily due to a moderately recovering economy, resulting in improved demand for trucks and compared to a weak 2017.","Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2018 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are now forecasting total company revenues for 2018 to be up 10% to 14%, increasing our prior guidance of up 4% to 8%, reflecting a stronger outlook for truck production in North America, India and Brazil and increased demand from mining and oil and gas customers.","We've raised our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 286,000 units, up 29% compared to 2017 and above our prior guidance of 266,000 units. We expect our market share to be between 31% and 34%, unchanged from our view last quarter.","In the medium-duty truck market, we are maintaining our forecast for industry production to reach 124,000 units, up 5% year-over-year and we expect our market share to be in the range of 72% to 75%, also unchanged. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat for the full year compared to a very strong 2017.","In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be down 2% compared to our previous guidance of being down 5% in 2018. We have raised our outlook for medium- and heavy-duty truck market demand slightly to 1.2 million units from 1.15 million units, representing a 10% decline from 2017.","In the light-duty truck market, we expect demand to be flat in 2018, in line with our previous guidance. We expect our market share in the medium- and heavy-duty truck market to be 14%. In the light-duty, we expect our share to be 8%, both up from first quarter levels.","In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to be at least 20% year-over-year relative to our previous guidance of up 15%, due to stronger truck demand. In Brazil, we now forecast truck production to increase 9% in 2018, up from our previous forecast of no growth. We expect our global high-horsepower engine shipments to increase 30%, up from our previous forecast of 10% growth, reflecting strong demand from mining and oil and gas customers and rising demand for power generation equipment.","In summary, we've more than doubled our sales growth outlook for the year to 10% to 14%. And excluding the charge for the product campaign, we revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 16.2% to 16.6%, reflecting a full year incremental EBITDA margin of 28%. Demand in several of our core markets is improving, our products are performing well and we are excited about the investments we are making for the future.","During the quarter, we returned $341 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.","Now, let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the company's first quarter financial results before discussing the performance of the operating segments in more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of the year.","First quarter revenues were $5.6 billion, an increase of 21% from a year ago, and a quarterly record for the company. Sales increased in each of our operating segments primarily driven by stronger demand in global on-highway, construction, mining and oil and gas markets.","Sales in North America, which represented 58% of our first quarter revenues, improved by 22% from a year ago, due to increased sales of engines and components to meet higher levels of heavy- and medium-duty truck production and an increase in demand for industrial engines.","International sales improved by 20% from a year ago, primarily due to stronger demand in on-highway and industrial markets as well as benefiting from a weaker U.S. dollar. Gross margins were 21.5% of sales, down from 24.7% a year ago, primarily due to the product campaign charge that Tom referred to. The campaign charge negatively impacted our gross margin by 330 basis points. This offset the benefits realized from stronger volumes, favorable pricing, material cost reductions and our lower base warranty rate.","Selling, admin and research and development costs of $787 million or 14.1% of sales decreased as a percent of sales by 130 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2017. Joint venture income of $115 million increased by $7 million compared to last year.","EBITDA was $700 million or 12.6% of sales for the quarter compared to $705 million or 15.4% of sales a year ago. EBITDA as a percent of sales declined primarily due to the campaign charge, which more than offset the positive impact of higher sales, favorable pricing and cost improvements referred to earlier. Excluding the charge, EBITDA was $887 million or 15.9% of sales in the quarter.","Net earnings for the quarter were $325 million or $1.96 per diluted share, compared to $396 million or $2.36 from a year ago. In addition to the product campaign charge which lowered earnings per share by $0.87, first quarter earnings were negatively impacted by $78 million in discrete tax items or $0.45 per diluted share, most of which related to the tax reform bill passed back in December of 2017. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.9%. Excluding discrete tax items, the effective tax rate was 23%, in line with our full year guidance and down from 26.1% last year.","Now moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize our performance in the quarter and then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some cash flow highlights. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 21% from last year due to the 20% increase in on-highway sales as well as from stronger demand for engines for construction equipment in China and in North America, which led to a 23% growth in off-highway revenues in the quarter.","Segment EBITDA in the first quarter was $286 million or 11.7% of sales. This compares to $273 million or 13.5% a year ago. The campaign charge and investments in new products more than offset the benefits from higher volumes and lower base warranty expense. Excluding the campaign charge, EBITDA margins for Engine segment was 15.5% of sales.","We now expect full year revenues to be up 10% to 14% compared to our previous guidance of up 4% to 8%, due to an improved outlook in most of our markets. Our forecast for EBITDA margins for the segment is in the range of 13.5% to 14% of sales, which does include the campaign charge booked in the first quarter and that compares to 14% to 14.5% previously.","For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, an increase of 13% compared to last year. The growth in sales was primarily driven by stronger demand for both new engines and parts and service in North America, Europe and in China. The EBITDA margin for the quarter was $123 million or 6.6% of sales compared to 7.9% a year ago. The EBITDA percent declined due to lower earnings in Africa and in the Middle East as a result of weak demand and currency volatility and a lower mix of parts sales in North America.","For the full year, Distribution revenue is projected to increase 6% to 10% compared to our previous guidance of up 2% to 6%, due to stronger off-highway demand for engines, parts and rebuilds. As Tom mentioned, we do expect profitability to improve in the second quarter and are forecasting full year EBITDA margins to be in the range of 7.75% to 8.25% of sales, unchanged from our previous guidance.","For the Components segment, revenues were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, a 30% increase from a year ago and a quarterly record. Excluding revenues from Eaton Cummins joint venture, sales were 22% higher than a year ago. Sales in North America increased by 35% due to higher heavy- and medium-duty truck production. International sales increased 25%, primarily due to growth in sales of aftertreatment sales in India.","Segment EBITDA was $227 million or 12.9% of sales compared to $216 million or 16.1% last year. The benefits of higher sales, favorable material costs and strong operational performance were offset by the product campaign charge. Excluding the charge, EBITDA margins were 18.3% of sales in the quarter. For 2018, we now expect revenue to increase 18% to 22% compared to our prior guidance of up 8% to 12%.","Strong demand in the North American truck market and in Europe are the key drivers behind the improved outlook. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 15.25% to 15.75% of sales which again includes the campaign charge booked in the first quarter and that compares to 15% to 15.5% in our previous forecast.","In the Power Systems segment, first quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, an increase of 22% from a year ago. Industrial sales grew by 51% driven by stronger mining and oil and gas demand. Power generation sales also increased by 9%. EBITDA margins were $142 million or 13.2% of sales in the quarter, up from $85 million or 9.6% last year, driven by the positive impact of stronger volumes, favorable material costs and higher joint venture earnings.","For 2018, we now expect Power Systems segment revenues to increase 7% to 11% versus our prior guidance of up 4% to 8% as a result of stronger demand across industrial and power generation markets. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 13% and 13.5% of sales compared to our previous guidance of 12.25% to 12.75%.","In the newly established Electrified Power segment, EBITDA losses were $10 million in line with our forecast. For the full year, we expect a net expense of between $60 million and $80 million in line with our previous guidance, as we are in a period of investment in new products.","And for the company, we are raising our outlook as Tom said for revenues to be up 10% to 14% versus our previous guidance of up 4% to 8%. This increase is driven by higher levels of truck production in North America, increased demand for both engines, new engines and engine rebuilds for oil and gas and mining customers; and the appreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency tailwinds are expected to increase our revenues by approximately $300 million this year.","Income from our joint ventures is now expected to decrease by 10% in 2018 compared to our previous guidance of down 15%. The improvements in guidance reflects stronger market demand in China and India than we had previously forecast. We expect EBITDA margins to be in the range of 15.4% to 15.8% for 2018, down from our previous forecast of 15.8% to 16.2%. Excluding the impact of the first quarter charge for the product campaign, full year EBITDA is expected to be in a range of 16.2% to 16.6%, reflecting a 28% incremental margin at the midpoint.","Finally, turning to cash flow. Cash used in operating activities for the first quarter was $117 million due in part to higher working capital requirements associated with higher revenues as well as a payout of 2017 variable compensation. We anticipate operating cash flow in 2018 will be within our long-term guidance of 10% to 15% of sales.","Capital expenditures during the quarter were $72 million and we continue to expect our investments will be in the range of $730 million to $760 million for the full year. For the first quarter, we returned $341 million to shareholders through dividends and from the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares. For 2018, we continue to plan to return at least 50% of our operating cash flow to our shareholders, which is in line with our previous guidance.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Pat. We're ready to turn to the Q&A section of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I'm wondering if you could talk about the size of the field population that's impacted by the field campaign, the cost per repair. And obviously, you've been leveraging the technology platform across markets and emission standards. Can you talk about if there's any other potential applications that could be impacted by the field campaigns that you're doing now? Can you just frame that for us?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Hey, Jerry, this is Rich. Let me \u2013 couple of things here. You've got a few questions in there. So first, the piece we're looking at is a component on the aftertreatment system that we used only in North America. It was for engines 2010 through 2015, predominantly 2010 through 2012, okay, as we phased that product out beginning in 2013.","What we've done is we've looked at the entire population over that, so it's a fixed amount of what the population is. And what we proposed here to the agencies and what we've recorded in $187 million is a combination of, in some cases, no action that these products are going to be fine; in some cases, a software fix; and, in some cases, a hardware fix, okay. So, that's what the charge is related to.","Of course, we'll have to get approval from the agencies on this. The discussions are collaborative and good with the agencies. It does not affect any other products anywhere else in North America or any other part of the world. This is a very specific component that was used that is under evaluation right now.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, separately, yeah, it sounds like within Power Systems, you're seeing an inflection in orders, within power generation for the first time, probably five or so years. Can you just give us some context on which applications for power gen that you're seeing the most momentum, which markets? And can you just give us a sense for how much visibility you have based on the order cadence so far this year?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Hey, Jerry, it's Mark. So we've seen an improvement in most parts of the world, except the Middle East which remains patchy. I would say the common theme across the regions is strong demand from data centers and then it varies by segment. But generally, a steady increase across those markets, and that's the third straight quarter of year-over-year increase. So, not \u2013 you know, it's not extraordinary acceleration, but it feels like we've got some momentum. Typically, we have an order board that runs multiple quarters, but, obviously, high confidence in the next 90 days.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And, Mark, just a clarification, it sounds like that order board has built in terms of the visibility, is that...","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Yes.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","...am I parsing the comments correctly?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","You are. Yes.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody. I'd like to return to Jerry's question. I'm trying to assess the customer dissatisfaction risk related to the field campaign. Could you help us with the failure mode? Is it purely emissions falling out of compliance? Or are there any, what I'll call, operational performance degradation, like, seem to occur in the light vehicle campaign a few years ago?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay, yes. So as far as performance either what the customer feels on productivity of the vehicle or fuel economy, there's no impact there. So it's purely an emissions issue, kind of late life emissions beyond even the warranty of the product that as the product degrade. So the impact on customers will be, like I said, in some cases, nothing. In some cases, we'll bring it in and do a calibration. In some cases, we'll bring it in and change the hardware out, and it'll be a voluntary recall.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Rich. And then within \u2013 we're all trying to figure out if the charge may get closer to $400 million and I'm sure you're not going to talk about that, given the discussions with the regulatory agencies. But, could you talk about the failure rate that you're observing in the field? I mean, is this pretty widespread, or is it at this point concentrated?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. I mean, what we know is what we're saying right now is the population that we've got today. So anything else, I'd be really speculating on. What I will say is we're driven to resolve this thing over the next two quarters and so we'll work with agencies and we'll get a final answer to this and kind of get this thing behind us.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","I think, Andy, just from my point of view too \u2013 this is Tom talking by the way \u2013 we wanted to make sure that the investors could at least put a box around what we think the total size could be. We have taken \u2013 as we have to, we had taken the accrual for what we think is the best estimate for what it will cost us across all this work. But because the agencies have the right to ask us to do other things, we have to be and we will have to respond to that. We want to make sure that investors could \u2013 after some quarters of uncertainty which is not terrific, we want to make sure these people could put a box around it.","Again, we are very \u2013 we think our plan is a good one. That's why we're proposing it and we intend to take care of customers as well as take care of the environment. That's kind of our commitment to both. So, we're acting proactively on that both. Again, just to try to make sure everyone had a box to put it in, and again we are working really aggressively and we expect to be through these discussions relatively quickly in the six months or less. So hopefully, we'll have it \u2013 we'll have all of it behind us.","But again, it's not \u2013 we are now at a spot where we are confident we can address this problem proactively, it will have minimal impact on customers and our products are performing well in the field. It's not going to impact the company's future or our ability to carry out our strategy plans, so, that's \u2013 we're feeling good about that.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then just to dot the I, does the $400 million include the $29 million from Q3?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","No, the $400 million is not trying to sum up everything in the past, it's trying to say here is the maximum exposure that we could see in a worst case for what our actions going forward.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","In addition to what we booked.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yes.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, it's in addition to the $187 million.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","So the $187 million is what we've already booked and the old ones we've already booked. And we're saying this is the maximum future exposure in addition to what we booked in this quarter and previous quarters.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I've got a few questions. Hello. Tom, the product campaign cost, how do you guys think about this in the context of how it impacts incentive compensation for you guys? Are you guys excluding this? Do we include this?","And then my second question, a lot of other industrial companies have talked about supplier constraints, higher freight constraints, labor constraints. Can you talk about to what degree this is impacting your customers or yourself? And how much that's constraining demand if at all? And how that sort of impacts your thoughts on 2019 as the market is concerned about sort of achieving the peak in 2018? Thanks.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie. I'll let Rich take the second one. I'll take the first one. So this charge along with all similar charges related to quality of our products, we take directly against our variable comp. So our view is our management and our people are responsible for producing quality products. When we have to take a charge against our quality, we take the hit in our bonus and other plans. So we will take this \u2013 this accrual we took this quarter and previous ones all account against us in both our one-year compensation plans as well as our three-year compensation plans.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","And Jamie, this is Rich. Then, on the constraints, we're certainly seeing all the constraints that you read about and everyone else sees. But what we are \u2013 I think we're positioned right now, we talked about over sometime our supply base is pretty flexible. And we're actually seeing, we're seeing some evidence of it today that if things have ramped up, we are ramping up a little better than other folks. It's actually an opportunity to pick up share. So, we're seeing some small bits of this. We are paying some incremental premium freight; those type of things, like everyone else is paying there. But so far so good. So nothing has caused us to increase lead times, put product on allocation, et cetera.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then to what degree, does that impact your sales (34:06) in 2019? Just as the markets concerned about, the markets are too good, we're getting overheated. Where does this impact to some degree (34:14) the cycle?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","To be determined. I'd say the nice thing that we are seeing is we get the ramp up and we're seeing the back orders go up, we look particularly in North America. The underlying fundamentals are pretty good though, as to what freight \u2013 how freight is doing, what rates are doing, which we're all seeing, and we're seeing in some of those, but the underlying fundamentals look pretty good right now kind of supporting that increase in demand.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thanks. Maybe a follow-up to that. I mean, I think certainly price cost trade-off has been kind of a key theme of earnings for the industrials so far this quarter. And if we just strip out the warranty charge, it looks like you may be expecting slightly lower incremental margins than before. Can you talk about how you are managing your cost input inflation?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Noah, this is Tom. It's a great question. As you said, price cost is really the struggle for industrial companies, but I think we're in really good position on that. We are now as we showed in this forecast, we're expecting quite significant improvement in incremental margins. So, again, we think we're doing well there. We mentioned as we came into this year that we're going to have \u2013 we have benefits on warranty. The warranty rates this year relative to last year are improving. We've got strong incremental margins in our plants in both the Power Systems business and the Engine business. And you saw a very strong in the Components already.","So we feel like we're not only doing well in incremental margins, but they're getting better as the year goes on both because we're able to get some pricing and we're moving costs down. So that \u2013 so we're feeling pretty good about that.","Again, one way you might want to think about our incremental margins is to again even taking out the product campaign, if you also look at the costs associated with the Eaton Cummins joint venture and the new electrification view which are sort of long-term investments, if you take those out, you get a like-for-like comparison on an incremental margins across the years. And I think, again, you'll find not only was Q1 good, but the rest of the year looks very strong relative to Q1.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And actually anticipating my next question. If you could touch on some of those newer growth initiatives, it looks like you've increased your Eaton JV contribution expectations for the year. Our checks are saying AMT adoption is going quite well. Looks like you lowered electric revenue contribution a little bit for the year, again up a very small base, but could you give us a little bit of color on how you see both of those initiatives proceeding?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Sure. I'll comment a little bit on electrification and let maybe Rich talk about Eaton Cummins and AMT. So on electrification, as you said, we did touchdown revenue a little bit. That just reflects basically the rate of new product introduction acceptance as very low level. Our programs are still going well. We're just very early days. And really the big launch has come sort at the end of next year. We'll see some \u2013 that's where our new electrified powertrain gets launched in the buses. And so \u2013 but we're feeling really good about where we stand. We've got small products going into forklifts.","We've got these bigger powertrains going into buses. We're clearly \u2013 we're talking to nearly every customer out there about Electrified Power in some way. So our position from a few years ago where we have a lot of work in the lab and a lot of really good ideas to where we've got a pretty significant position now on the market in terms of what we're planning to offer and we're working with I think has been a really good change and really good transition.","Now, of course, we've got to launch the products and see success in them. So, that's our big focus over the next two years or 1 1\/2 years. So Rich, let me \u2013 this is to you.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. So on the Eaton joint venture, just a couple of numbers. So the AMT you asked about the transition, we're up to 73% now. So, that's coming along as we thought potentially little higher. Our market share is where we thought it would be.","So the Cummins\/Eaton joint venture market share is good. The transition has gone quite well. So the cultures anytime you're merging two things together, there's some risk. You just come together really well. The culture has been good, the team work is good and so really so far so good. The sales forecast, so last year $163 million will be over $450 million this year in revenues out of the joint venture.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. First, on the mining side, I think last quarter you were looking for up about 10%, that's moved higher, but any context around how much higher you think mining is at this point? And then if you could talk specifically to equipment side of things versus parts side of things, and regionally where you're seeing some of the activity pick up?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. I'll take a first shot at this Mark, and make sure you get the numbers right. I think, right now, we're projecting 30% up on mining for revenues. So, improved from where we were last quarter. We pay attention to what utilization is, so what is \u2013 how is equipment really being utilized and we're seeing that continue to increase, which helps drive parts demand and rebuild activity, primarily the activity, the biggest increases are in North America and China, which wouldn't surprise you on that.","Mark, anything you would add to that?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","No, just Q1 probably was the easiest comp of the year. We were up about 48%, (40:22) good, and we're seeing good growth in new engines and parts, that strengthened a little bit since the start of the year.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then some interesting news yesterday with the launch of a new transmission into frac rigs and just kind of a timeline for how long it'll take for you to get enough experience on the ground with that transmission for the expectation that you get some decent customer adoption? And then just a clarification on whether that's just a pair with Cummins' engines or whether that could be paired with competitor engines as well?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","I think that's principally to be paired with Cummins engines at this point in time, yeah.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And I guess maybe just one more then. You're talking about market share and seeing opportunities for gains and maybe being a little bit more agile in terms of response to supply chain tightness. You're not really calling for increases in market share in medium-duty. It doesn't look like increasing market share in engines in North America heavy-duty. So should we just think about that may be now favors the high end of the range or a little bit of conservatism there?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","I think primarily in the high end of the range, we bounced back pretty well. In fact, we've seen some share gains in surface mining whether it's only attributable to the ramp up. Again, we're keeping our lead times low in all of our high-horsepower markets. We're down in the eight-week range, which is good, which is better than the competition at this time.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Thanks. Good morning. Wondering if you could talk about how the warranty issue might affect your thinking or execution of anything strategic that you've been thinking about. It seems like it will be a cash out the door issue at some point. But maybe it doesn't dramatically alter your balance sheet on what you might do, but just curious how you're thinking about that?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Steve. Yeah, it hasn't really changed our strategic thinking. As you say, the cash flow and balance sheet is manageable. That's a little bit why we wanted to make sure we put a box around even the worst case. And again, we have a clear view about what we want to do, but we want to make sure everyone saw the worst case, it goes out over two or three years.","We feel very, very good about where our strategic position is. But again, the way that we've been thinking about this, we talked about in previous quarters that the complexity of the systems that we're offering is pretty high and the quality tools that we're using have \u2013 needed to get more sophisticated as a result.","So we've been making significant investments using analytics and other things to get a better system view of the quality of our products which we think is reflected in the products we're launching today and we'll continue to enhance those quality tools as we go forward.","And again from the strategy point of view, it's difficult. We feel frustrated and disappointed, obviously, with the cost of this quality campaign. But again, we are pushing on the cutting edge of offering systems that meet emissions \u2013 very, very stringent emissions targets, have very, very good \u2013 strong fuel economy and high levels of performance at the very edge of technology. And I think part of what we're trying to do is make sure that we stay at the edge there while improving our quality costs. And that's the tough deal, I mean, that's not going to be easy and that's why a lot of people aren't going to make the journey.","And we think by getting better in those capabilities, we can stay in it and make good returns for our shareholders by getting better at the sort of executions, small details of being there at that edge of technology. So, that's the way we're thinking about it strategically. And the harder the challenge, the less people want to do it. And so from a strategy point of view, that's a good thing as long as we can make \u2013 continue to improve how our system quality goes out the door and how customers experience our products.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","And, Steve, and we expect \u2013 I think I said this in my remarks, but we expect another very, very strong year in terms of the free cash flow we generate through our operations. So as Tom said, this will have no impact at all on what we're going to do from a strategic perspective.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Okay. So just to follow up on the M&A angle here. How are you finding the competition for deals at the moment and how does it vary depending on size of the deals that you maybe looking at?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. As you guess, there is still competition for M&A today. There's some players in the market, valuations are still relatively high. Money, while getting a little bit more expensive, it's still pretty cheap. So there's no question that the cost of acquisitions still, especially if we were going to maintain the ROIC discipline that we intend to, that's going to play into it. We're going to have to be thoughtful about how that goes and that remains a challenge.","But again, we continue to think about our strategy first. Where do we think Cummins can bring our capabilities into a new market and adjacent market and using capabilities we already have and leveraging them so that we can \u2013 whatever we acquire or joint venture with, we can add value to it, so that we can pay for the acquisition price as well as trying to get an attractive one.","And that of course limits the field, right? That means there's only so many things that are going to work and we are making sure that we maintain patience with that. We are looking a lot of things, though. There are things to look at that are pretty interesting. And so, we're just trying to put those together. I feel better about it now than I have in the past. I mean, it was \u2013 the prices, while still high, are not nearly as bad as when we started looking at them. So I'm optimistic that they're beginning to come into the range where we think we could make it work.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Great. Thanks, guys.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, guys. I had a couple of questions I guess on the lighter-duty side of the on-highway business. First of all, in Europe, I'm wondering the extent to which you think you can pick up any business from OEMs that you maybe historically had struggled to do business with because of Dieselgate or any of the other stigma associated with diesel engines in general.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks for that question, Alex. So I would say that, we do believe that kind of to fall into Steve's question that indeed many of our customers are looking forward at the market and saying where do they want to place their investments strategically? Do they want \u2013 they've got a lot of challenges in front of them, autonomous vehicles, electrified vehicles, all of the investments they need to make for just the truck \u2013 making the truck work, telematics, you name it.","And then, now with the challenges for diesels in some of the European cities, they are asking themselves how much investment do I want to make? In the light-duty side, it's the most challenged. It's one that have the most likely substitution from electrified powertrains. So again, each investment they make there, they're wondering how many more diesels they're going to sell. So if we have a product that's relevant to what they are trying to do, they're much more likely to buy from us than do it themselves these days than they were, say, 10 years ago.","So we believe that this is a trend that will continue where OEMs will continue to wonder how many more investments, how many more platforms in the light-duty space and even in the medium-duty space, do I really want to make given I could buy this from Cummins, and I would, therefore, not have to make that investment and I can focus on my vehicle instead. So again, we'll see how it goes, but we are talking to a lot of people about that and more people than we are talking to for sure five or 10 years ago.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. I guess one maybe follow-up on that. You mentioned medium-duty. That market I know is \u2013 clearly, the cyclicality is less violent than it is in Class 8, but that market just seems to continually march higher and higher and higher. I'm wondering the extent to which you think there's been a structural change to the way that type of functions to the extent you can even call it a cycle. Or if you think it's a secular story there as a result of last mile and some of the changes that are occurring to the way the freight markets function in general? Thanks.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. Alex, so I'm not sure we know the answer to that. But it does appear, it has been less cyclical, it has been steadily growing, okay? And so our view is all the underlying cases I wouldn't want to speak \u2013 I wouldn't be able to speak to. But I do think it feels pretty sustained and it's tied to more than just the on-highways, it's tied to the construction market, infrastructure being invested in around the world. And so it does seem to have a more staying power and we're kind of reflecting that now, plus cyclicality more staying power. Has there been a fundamental step up I guess is still to be determined.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Thanks. Your discussion on the EPA\/CARB issue is fairly clear and thanks for bounding the lower end as well. Could you just give a more general overview of how you approach quality as the issues popped up over the last year and you mentioned a renewed focus? Have you changed monitoring or proactive looking at stuff? And do you feel that there's a less of a chance of future issues popping up as a result of what you're seeing? And how is your quality trending in general? Thanks.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Thanks for the question. As you could imagine, while this is \u2013 there's a specific cause here. We're using this as a call to action. So how do we make some incremental improvements on where we are now or even step function improvements where we are? So we are investing heavier in analytics, in modeling, in looking at all of our processes to drive improvement. We've been in the kind of the low-2% range for some time, okay. With warranty periods being extended, more expectations, we've maintained kind of that 2% to 2.5%.","And so, we're doing a couple of things. One is, we're putting actions in place to how this would never ever, ever happen again, okay, the modeling. And so, we've got those in place, but we're also saying, let's bring an outside look in and say use this as a call to action to how do we drive this down over the next five years to a much lower number. And I think you know our track record and when we put our resources and put our efforts towards achieving (52:01) our track record and delivering, that's pretty darn good. And so, this one's getting a lot of attention as you can imagine, even though the one case is somewhat isolated.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","And then just as a follow-up to that Rob, you recall last year (52:16), were around 3.1%, 3.2% of sales and we (52:21) drive that lower. We did see that in Q1, Q1 is right around 2.4% and we're still pretty consistent with the previous guidance and the full year forecast of 2.4% for the full year. So to Rich's point, we are making progress with the base one there.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Great. Thanks to both of you.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is (52:49) on for Ann. All my questions have been answered. Thanks.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO. Your line is now open.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. How is it going?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Joel.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just can you give a little more granularity on China? It seems like most people were expecting it to be down this year and it's surprised to the upside in the first half and I think people are a little cautious about how the second half is going to flow and you guys have a great lot of feet on the ground there.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. Joel, I think, we would agree with that caution. I think, we just look at the truck equipment purchases versus what we perceive trucking to be \u2013 growth rates to be doing and freight rates and everything. It just doesn't seem like the same rate of growth from the previous year can hold. So, that's why we sort of forecasted it tipping over and heading down.","A couple of things that have driven a little stronger truck performance in the first quarter was more construction, which, of course, we saw in the excavator numbers. So dumper sales increased a lot, which is again one of the reasons that our OEMs kind of under-produced relative to the market. That's not their big segment, the dumper market. Those tend to be bigger displacement engines and older technology. But nonetheless, those sales were really quite good in the first quarter, the dumper sales, so again, which is towards construction market.","So I think what we're seeing in China is, yes, there is the equipment being purchased for just on-highway trucking is likely to level out or head down. At least that's our expectation, we'll see what happens, but that's our expectation, but this construction market is definitely buoying the market. It's better than we expected and it's great news. I mean, we're seeing much \u2013 a lot of good demand for construction engines as well and these off-highway kind of dumper sort of truck engines.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Just to put a number on that. So, on the off-highway, we're projecting an 8% increase. We're now saying 20% to 25%, which is what we said first quarter because that felt more sustained and less cyclical than what was going on in the truck market. And both of those seem to be playing out a little bit.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And maybe second, just maybe a little bit of a delicate question. But in terms of the rail business, obviously, the industry consolidation, it's not really happening or maybe it is a little bit. But I just wondered if you could talk about how you feel that like you are positioned in that market. And do you feel like you have the product lineup and kind of your toe in the water there enough to continue to gain share and really compete effectively in that market? Thank you. I'm done after that.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Joel, thanks for that question. Not delicate, it's fine. We're pretty small in the rail market overall. If you just kind of think about rail globally, we're pretty small player and we have participated essentially in the diesel part of the rail rather than the diesel electric side, which was driving from much larger engines and again that trend has continued.","So we have had a segment that we participate in. Now the introduction of the Hedgehog engines got us into more of that. But still we're really just getting into it. And I think what's helped us get a little bit of a toehold there has been the fact that we were ready with our tier four engines before other people and I think our solution is better.","It's a better long-term total cost of ownership and so we have a bit of an advantage. We don't have the same advantage of being a large player already in the market. Everybody knows our product, and, therefore, a long history.","So I still think \u2013 while we're excited about it because it's incrementally larger for us, it's still a small piece of the market. And I think if we don't add more products to our portfolio, that's kind of where we'll play sort of on the edge of the market, trying to grow our position with the business we have, but not a big player in the overall scheme of things globally.","Joel G. Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mark Smith for any closing remarks.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, this is Tom Linebarger. Thanks for that. I just want to make a couple concluding remarks, especially given the fact that we did finally be able to put a box around that product campaign. And obviously, we're really disappointed about the financial exposure and we know that it's not the first one we've done the last two years, it's been a series of them. And again, as you'd guessed that, we feel disappointed and personally accountable for that. And we are, as we talked about in the call, working really hard to make sure that we do not see a repeat of that, and, of course, that's what we think the core of our business is.","The good news looking forward though is we do have a box around this. We do have a proposed plan. We will get the full plan resolved in the next six months or something like that. And it's not going to impact either the long-term performance of the company or our strategy so \u2013 and it's not impacting customers today. Customers today are experiencing great quality, good performing engines, and continue to see Cummins as the technology of choice. We've raised our outlook for this year. Again, it'll be a second terrific year for the company.","Our sales growth forecast is now doubled. Our incremental margins are strong. Our businesses are performing well. We had -three of our four had terrific incremental margins in Q1. The DBU, while not as good, will see much improved margins in the next three quarters. So we feel like we are in a really good position to generate strong cash flows and strong earnings this year and our strategy's right on track.","So I just want to make sure that everyone knew that about where we feel about where the company is as we feel like we're moving right towards strength here and we're very optimistic about this year. And we're going to get this emissions issue behind us and customers are still going to see Cummins as the technology of choice. Thanks very much.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, everybody. We'll be available for questions later.

Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Smith, Vice President, Finance Operations. Please go ahead.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the fourth quarter of 2016. Joining me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland.","Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecast expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the SEC, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy the financial statements and today's presentation are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading Investors and Media.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Mark, for that inspiring introduction. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results, and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2017. Pat will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.","Our references to EBIT and EBIT percent exclude restructuring and impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. EBIT was $526 million, or 11.7%, compared to $531 million or 11.1% a year ago. EBIT increased as a percentage of sales as the benefits of our cost reduction actions and the absence of the loss contingency charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 more than offset the impact of weaker volumes.","For the full year, Cummins' sales were $17.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Our EBIT margin was 11.4%, down from 12.5% in 2015. Our decremental EBIT margin for the year was 24%, consistent with our plan even after absorbing $138 million additional accrual to the loss contingency. This solid performance reflects strong execution of our restructuring plans, material cost reduction programs and quality improvements that helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes in very weak markets.","Engine business sales declined by 10% in 2016 due to weaker production of medium and heavy-duty trucks and softer demand for construction equipment in North America. EBIT was 8.8%, compared to 9.9% in 2015 due to the impact of weaker revenues and the increased accrual for the loss contingency in 2016.","Sales for our Distribution segment declined by 1% as weaker sales to off-highway markets and the negative impact of a stronger US dollar offset growth from acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of our last remaining distributor joint venture in North America, bringing the total number of acquisitions to 13 since we announced our plans in September 2013. Full year EBIT was 6.3%, compared to 7% in 2015 due to weaker organic sales and the negative impact of currency.","Full year revenues for the Components segment decreased by 6%, as weaker truck demand in North America more than offset strong growth in China. EBIT was 13.3%, compared to 14.5% in 2015, mainly due to the impact of lower sales. EBIT in the fourth quarter was 11.9% as we incurred additional costs associated with the launch of our new Single Module aftertreatment system in North America. We do expect to continue to incur additional costs through the first half of 2017 as we've resolved startup issues in our production supply chain for this important new product.","Power Systems sales declined by 14% in 2016, with weak demand in most major geographies and end markets. EBIT was 7.5%, compared to 8.9% in 2015 as the impact of lower sales more than offset a 17% reduction in operating expenses achieved through restructuring and other cost reduction activities. We continue to make good progress with our plans to exit our UK generator set manufacturing plant in Kent, with high horsepower generator set assembly now transferred to our Daventry engine plant. By the end of 2017, we will complete the transfer of the remaining wide variety of small generators currently produced in Kent to existing locations in China and India. These actions will position the business for further cost reduction in 2018.","Now I will comment on some of our key markets in 2016, starting with North America, and then I will comment on some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America declined 12% in 2016, primarily due to lower Engine and Component sales to North American heavy and medium-duty truck markets. Industry production of North American heavy duty trucks declined to 201,000 units, a decrease of 31% from 2015 levels.","Our market share clearly improved in the second half of 2016, and exceeded 31% for the full year, but was down from 33% in 2015. 2016 marked the 10th straight year that customers have selected Cummins as the leading engine supplier to the heavy-duty truck market. The market size for medium-duty trucks was 108,000 units in 2016, a decline of 13% from 2015. We remain the clear leading engine manufacturer in the medium-duty truck market, with full year market share of 75%, down slightly from 78% a year ago.","2016 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in North America, and we shipped 131,000 engines to Chrysler slightly ahead of 2015 volumes and sold 19,000 units to Nissan in our first year full year of production. Engine sales to construction customers in North America declined 15% in 2016, as the market faced an overhang of equipment inventory and it drove OEMs to cut production. Engine shipments to high horsepower markets in North America declined by 14% year-over-year, reflecting weaker demand in all end markets. Revenues for power generation decreased by 4%, driven by lower sales to rental companies as they cut back their capital expenditures.","Our international revenues declined 2% in 2016. Our full year revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $3.5 billion, an increase of 6% as some end markets rebounded from weak levels in 2015. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 28% for the full year, as the OEMs increased production, partially driven by new regulations in combatting vehicle overloading. Our market share in 2016 was 15%, down from 16% in 2015, as our partner Dongfeng lost share in the face of very competitive pricing in the industry. Sales of our ISG heavy-duty engine grew in line with the market. Shipments of our light duty engines to China increased by 14%, while the overall market declined 1% as Foton continued to increase the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engines, displacing local competitor engines. Our full year share in light-duty truck market exceeded 7% in 2016, up 90 basis points.","Earnings at our Foton Cummins joint ventures declined in 2016 while volumes increased. During the fourth quarter, we initiated actions to improve the performance and reliability of our ISG engines in some duty cycles. We incurred costs in the joint venture to make product changes and support customers. We expect the product improvements to be complete by the third quarter of this year, and expect to incur additional costs associated with these actions until the actions are complete, albeit at a lower level than experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Despite these issues, we remain very confident that the ISG is a game-changing engine for the Chinese truck market, and customer demand for this engine remains strong.","Demand for construction equipment in China improved, with sales of excavators rising 19% in 2016. This marks the first annual increase in demand for excavators since 2011, but demand remains well below historical levels. Our construction engine volumes increased by 40%, as excavator demand increased and we picked up share in wheel loaders. Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 17% due to continued weakness in power generation, marine and mining markets.","Full year revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a 7% increase over 2015. Industry truck production increased 8% to 346,000 units, and our market share remained at 41% for 2016, with nearly 80% of Tata Motors' trucks powered by our joint venture engines. Revenues for power generation increased by 2%. In Brazil, our revenues decreased 19%, driven mainly by an 18% reduction in truck production in a very challenging economy.","Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2017 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2017 to be flat to down 5% from 2016. We expect market conditions to continue to be challenging in 2017, especially in the first quarter. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 178,000 units in 2017, an 11% decrease year-over-year.","We expect our market share to be between 29% and 32%. In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 108,000 units, flat compared to 2016. We project our market you share to the in the range of 73% to 75%. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be flat compared to a strong 2016.","In China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to be up 3% in 2017. We currently project flat demand in light, medium and heavy-duty truck markets. We expect our market share in the medium and heavy-duty truck market to be at least 15%, flat with 2016. And light-duty, we expect our share to grow to 8%, up from 7%. We currently project 5% growth in off-highway markets in China.","In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to decline 5%, mainly due to weaker truck demand driven by the transition to Bharat Stage IV emission standards starting in April. Bharat Stage IV is the first major country-wide emissions change in the Indian truck market involving the introduction of aftertreatment systems. And as a result, it's hard to predict the impact on truck demand post-implementation.","Truck dealers do appear to be well stocked with new trucks, and we anticipate that any end user pre-buy activity will likely be met with current truck inventories and without a significant increase in production in the first quarter. We do expect demand to drop off after the implementation of the new regulations, and we have factored in a decline in industry production of between 10% and 20% for the full year into our forecast.","We currently expect growth of 5% in off-highway markets in India. Demand in off-highway markets was growing at a faster rate in the first half of 2016, but the pace of economic growth has slowed following the introduction of the government's demonetization policy. We're optimistic that the government's focus on improving infrastructure will support growth in both our on and off-highway businesses in the coming years.","In Brazil, we expect truck production to be flat in 2017. Demand is at very low levels, and while we are optimistic that the next move in production will be up, there's no clear catalyst for sustained improvement in the near term.","We expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to be flat in 2017. We expect a modest improvement in new engine orders from mining customers, while demand in marine markets remains very weak. Orders for new engines for oil and gas applications in North America also remain very low, although demand for rebuilds of existing engines has increased.","In summary, we expect full year sales to be flat to down 5%, due mainly to weaker truck production in North America. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11% to 11.5% of sales, with performance expected to be weakest in the first quarter. Through our cost reduction initiatives and focus on operational improvements, we have effectively managed through a multiyear decline in some of our largest markets and delivered EBIT margins well above prior troughs. We have continued to invest in new products in our distribution network that position us to drive profitable growth when end markets do improve.","Demand in most of our key markets remained below replacement levels. Having said that, for the first time in a number of years, there are some early signs that point towards improvement in 2018. In addition to our strong focus on operational improvements, we have also continued to return cash to shareholders. We returned 75% of operational cash flow to shareholders in 2016, and we'll return at least 50% in 2017 through dividends and share repurchases.","Finally, we continue to make progress in advancing our strategy as we outlined in the last Analyst Day. And although I have nothing to announce today, we're optimistic that we will continue to make progress in executing our plans. Now let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a view of the full year 2016 financial results before moving on to our fourth quarter performance. All comparisons to the full year and the fourth quarter of 2015 for the company and for each of the operating segments will exclude the charges for impairment and restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Full year revenues for the company were $17.5 billion, a decrease of 8% compared to the prior year. And as Tom just described, declines in commercial truck production in North America and the lowest level of demand for high horsepower industrial engines and power generation equipment in more than a decade led to the overall revenue decrease. Negative currency movements against the U.S. dollar reduced our sales by approximately 2%.","North American revenues declined 12% in 2016 and represented 58% of our total revenues, down from 61% in 2015. International revenues declined by 2% compared to the previous year, mainly due to foreign currency movements. Excluding the impact of the currency movements, international revenues grew almost 2%, with growth in China and in India being offset by weaker demand in Latin America, the Middle East, and in Africa.","Gross margins were 25.4% of sales, and were 50 basis points lower than last year. Material cost reductions and the benefits from restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2015 offset most of the negative impact from lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix. Selling, admin and research and development costs were up 50 basis points as a percent of sales, but decreased by $145 million in the year due to savings from previous restructuring actions which were partially offset by added expense from the distributor acquisitions.","Joint venture income decreased by $14 million compared to last year due to the acquisition of the North American distributors and more earnings from our joint ventures in China. Other income and expense improved by $50 million, primarily due to the change in the cash surrender value on corp. owned life insurance plans, gains recorded on a divestiture of a Power Systems joint venture, and an increase in royalty income.","In total, earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, was 11.4% of sales in 2016, down from 12.5% of sales that we reported in the previous year. The decremental EBIT margin was 24% for the full year. EBIT for 2016 and 2015 included charges for the loss contingency of $138 million and $60 million, respectively, as we previously reported.","Net income was $1.4 billion, or $8.23 per share. This compares to $1.6 billion, or $8.93 per share, in the previous year. The operating tax rate for the full year was 24.6% compared to 27.4% in 2015, due to changes in geographic mix of earnings.","Now let me comment specifically on the fourth quarter and provide some more details on our performance. Fourth quarter revenues were $4.5 billion, a decrease of 6% from a year ago. Sales in North America, which represented 56% of our fourth quarter revenues, declined 13% from a year ago as a result of lower commercial truck production in North America and weaker demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment. International sales improved by 6% compared to 2015 due to stronger demand in China and in Mexico, which more than offset the weaker conditions in the Middle East and in Africa.","Gross margins were 24.9% of sales, a decline of 50 basis points from a year ago. Warranty was an 80 basis point headwind, due to the very low expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. The negative impact from the lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix were partially offset by material cost savings and the benefits from previous restructuring actions.","Selling, admin and research and development costs of $677 million, or 15%, of sales increased as a percent of sales by 60 basis points, but decreased $8 million from a year ago. The benefits of previous restructuring actions offset the added expenses from the distributor acquisition.","Joint venture income of $67 million was $8 million lower compared to a year ago. Earnings declined due to costs incurred associated with quality improvements in our Foton Cummins joint venture in China, largely offset by earnings growth in a number of our other international joint ventures.","Earnings before interest and tax were $526 million, or 11.7% of sales, for the quarter, compared to $531 million, or 11.1%, a year ago. Our EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2015 included a $60 million charge for the loss contingency. Net earnings for the quarter were $378 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, compared to $2.02 from a year ago. And the effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%.","Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the quarter and for the full year of 2016, and then provide a forecast for 2017. I will then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year.","In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 6% from last year. On-highway revenues declined by 9% overall, with lower heavy and medium-duty truck engine sales in North America being partially offset by increased sales in bus and pickup markets. Off-highway revenues increased 8%, primarily due to higher construction sales in all regions except in Latin America. Segment EBIT in the quarter was $194 million, or 9.9% of sales, an increase compared to the 7.6% that we reported a year ago. EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2015 did include the $60 million charge for the loss contingency. In addition, benefits from restructuring and material cost reduction helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes in the quarter.","For the full year, revenues decreased by 10% from a year ago and earnings before interest and taxes declined from 9.9% to 8.8% of sales.","For the Engine segment in 2017, we expect our revenues to be down by 3% to 6% due to weaker demand in North America, and EBIT margins to be in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% of sales.","For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.7 billion, which decreased 2% compared to last year. The decrease was the result of a 6% decline in organic sales and a 1% unfavorable impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, which were partially offset by a 5% increase in revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter. The EBIT margin for the fourth quarter was $122 million, or 7.3% of sales, an increase from 6.5% a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by a one-time gain of $50 million for the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor.","For 2016, full year sales for the segment declined by 1%, with a 5% organic sales decline and a 2% unfavorable impact from currency being offset by 6% growth from the acquisitions. EBIT as a percent of sales declined from 7% to 6.3%.","For 2017, revenue is projected to be flat to up 4%, with increased revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 expected to add approximately $200 million or approximately 3% to the top line, which will be partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. And we expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6% to 6.75% of sales.","For the Components segment, revenues were $1.2 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5% from a year ago. Sales in North America declined 16% due to lower industry truck production, while international sales increased by 13%, primarily due to a 66% increase in our sales in China. Segment EBIT was $140 million, or 11.9% of sales, compared to $175 million, or 14.2% of sales a year ago. In addition to the impact of the lower volumes, warranty costs were higher against a very tough comparison a year ago, and we also experienced higher than expected startup costs associated with the transition to our new Single Module aftertreatment system, which are likely to persist through the first half of 2017.","For the full year, revenues were 6% lower than in 2015. Sales in North America were down 14%, partially offset by very strong growth in China. EBIT as a percent of sales decreased from 14.5% in 2015 to 13.3% of sales in 2016. For 2017, we expect revenue to decline by 2% to 6%, as a result of weaker demand in North America, and EBIT is projected to be in the range of 11% to 12% of sales.","In the Power Systems segment, fourth quarter revenues were $932 million, down 5% from a year ago. Sales of power generation equipment declined 7% compared to a year ago, while industrial engines revenues were down 4%, primarily due to weaker marine and mining engine sales compared to last year. EBIT margins were 7.3% in the quarter, up from the 6% we reported last year. Lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix, and the project cost overrun in the UK were more than offset by the benefits from cost reductions, favorable currency impacts and the gains recorded on the sale of some assets.","For the full year, Power Systems revenue declined 14% from 2015, and EBIT margins declined from 8.9% to 7.5% of sales. The focus on cost reduction was key to holding decremental margins in segment to 18% despite the significant drop in revenue. For 2017, we expect Power Systems segment revenues to be flat to down 4%. EBIT margins are expected to be between 7% and 8% of sales, which is relatively similar to 2016, given no significant improvement in our end markets. And as Tom discussed, we are on track to completely exit of manufacturing from our site in Kent in the United Kingdom, which will yield net savings in 2018.","Turning to cash flow, cash generated from operations for the full year was just over $1.9 billion. We anticipate operating cash flow for 2017 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. We lowered our capital expenditures by more than $200 million to $531 million in 2016, and expect that our 2017 investments will be in the range of $500 million to $530 million. Last year, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, or 75% of operating cash flow. We repurchased 7.3 million shares, and we increased our dividend by 5%. For 2017, we plan to return at least 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders, in line with our long-term commitment.","As Tom described, the majority of our businesses have experienced multiyear declines in demand. We are forecasting company revenues to be flat to down 5% this year, primarily driven by the lower demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market and modest declines in power generation and off-highway markets. Foreign currency headwinds are expected to reduce our revenues by approximately $200 million. We expect EBIT margins to be between 11% and 11.5% of sales this year. We do face lower volumes again in 2017, which will negatively impact our margins, especially in the first half of the year.","We remain focused on cost reduction, with improvements in material cost, plant productivity and the quality of our current products helping to offset the impact of the lower volumes, cost inflation on some commodities and increased variable compensation, merit, and pension expense. We do expect EBIT margins in the first quarter will be at a low point for the year and below fourth quarter 2016 levels on lower sales.","Income from our joint ventures is expected to decline by approximately 8% in 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of the last remaining North America joint venture distributor. We expect our effective tax rate to be 26% this year. As we outlined in our Analyst Day back in November of 2015, we expected a period of weaker demand ahead of us. We have managed effectively through this decline in sales so far and have taken the actions necessary to improve our cost structure while continuing to invest in new products and services that will help drive profitable growth when the markets improve and continue to return value to our shareholders.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Pat. And we're now ready to move to the Q&A section.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. First, maybe, Tom, for you. I'm just curious, maybe with respect to kind of the tone of your conversations here with North American customers and distributors, just given what's transpired here over the last, say, 90 days or so, just curious, with respect to their overall tone regarding underlying investment, just kind of a broader question, just curious, are you going to address maybe if there's been any meaningful change in terms of their attitudes.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Tim. Good morning. Let me just say at a high level, as I mentioned in my remarks, our markets are at historically low levels. We're way below replacement in nearly all of our major markets. And you heard our forecast for the numbers for North American truck, it's really weak, and that's clearly a big headwind going into 2017. And we've been sprinting for quite a few years now to keep costs under control, in fact, improve productivity and cost in all of our facilities and still be able to invest to make sure that we can grow faster than the market when things improve. So we feel like 2017 is one of those years.","On the other hand, as you also heard me say, it looks like the next move in many of those markets is likely to be up, which I don't think we've been able to say until now. And again, we're planning conservatively. This year we are assuming that we're going to get very little benefit from any of that. We are planning our costs accordingly, et cetera, but there are some good signs.","I think Rich is a little closer to what OEMs are saying in North America, so I'll probably ask Rich to talk a little bit about the truck market, specifically, and then what other signs that you're seeing, Rich?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, thanks, Tom. Yeah, we're hearing, as I talk to fleets, more and more people talking about getting back to replacement levels, where they kind of sat out a year as their mileage was lower. And so that tends to be a common theme. Not in every fleet, but often. The freight data looks good, or at least improving a bit. Dealer inventory looks at a pretty good level. In fact there's room to grow the dealer inventory, which we haven't been able to say. And I think the big overhang is just used truck values are still a bit of an issue.","But generally, pretty positive on the next move up. We've had three months in a row where the production has been less than order, so the backlog is growing. Again \u2013 or the future order board is growing for OEMs, and we're already starting to see that those order boards are getting filled out, people are increasing orders.","I think maybe in some of the off-highway, it'll go quickly, but oil and gas, we actually are starting, not engine orders, we're seeing a lot of activity in the parts side, with rebuilds coming back in. And I think we mentioned in the comments the mining business. Again, I think the next move will be up there. Again, a little bit started with parts, which is normal for us, starting to see some improvement there.","So generally, I guess, positive. The couple we talked about, maybe down would be India truck market, and the marine business does not look like \u2013 that's one we'd say we don't see that recovery coming yet.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","So hopefully that helps, Tim.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","(33:08).","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","A couple of good quarters low (33:10).","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, understood. Okay, and just back on Rich's comments on off-highway parts. Maybe a little bit more color on Distribution. It sounds like within that flat to up 4%, up 3% contribution from the last acquisition. So just maybe a little bit more color in terms of I would've thought the outlook there would've been a little bit more positive, so maybe just some more color on specific drivers within Distribution.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Hey, Tim, it's Mark. We are expecting some growth in parts. The one market where we're seeing continued weakness globally is really power generation. So that's what's kind of tempering the outlook in the near term.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","So power generation sales is generally through the Distribution business, and I think we're looking at that being down again this year, I think 3% to 4%, something like that.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, appreciate it.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. I guess two questions. One on the guidance and then the second more strategic one. If you look at your Engine sales and the margins and the implied decrementals, the decrementals seem normal. But then if you back out the charges that we had in 2016, the implied decrementals I think are in the mid to high 30%s, which seems like it should be better than that. So I'm just wondering if I'm missing something, if you could explain that.","And then my second question, Tom, relates more to you. If you look at the past three quarters, the repos really falling off. We're not really doing much. So can you give us an update on sort of where we are? Are we closer to doing a deal? And I guess, as I also think about how you're thinking about the company going forward, I always thought maybe you'd potentially just acquire a business, but I never really thought about whether they're parts of the business that don't make sense for Cummins to be in anymore. And if so, why would that be? Is it because you want to do a larger deal for cash because certain businesses aren't generating the proper returns? So I guess those two and if you could help enlighten. (35:23)","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Okay, Jamie, I'll take the first one and then Tom can take the second one. So on decrementals, let me kind of give you a high level bridge for the company, and it really applies to the Engine segment as much as the company. So if you start from the 11.4% of EBIT that we reported in 2016, we do have headwinds coming through in the form of the lower volume, the unfavorable mix, and some of those launch costs we were talking about with our new products. That's about 70 basis points of a headwind between those three. We do have higher inflation costs in terms of people costs in 2017, and they're coming through in the form of higher pension expense, given the lower discount rates, higher variable compensation in 2016, and then merit increases. So in people cost inflation, that's about 120 basis points year over year.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","And then we had some one-time gains in 2016 of about 30 (36:23) basis points, and they came through in the form of some of that fair market value gains in Distribution and again on the sale of the power generation assets in the fourth quarter. Offsetting most of that are cost reductions really coming through material cost. We're looking at 80 basis points this year. That's down from 150 basis points last year, really given the swing in metal markets. We had 50 basis points of improvement last year in metal markets, 20 basis points negative this year. So net, 80 basis points on cost reduction. The loss contingency that you pointed out is worth 80 basis points. And then pricing, there was frankly some modest pricing improvements, they would around 30 basis points. So when you net all that together, that leaves us somewhere in the midpoint between 11% and 11.5% of sales.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's helpful, thanks.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","On the...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then just on...","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, go ahead, please.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sorry, Tom. On the M&A front, potential for divestitures?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, so let me first just talk about the repurchase of shares. We have continued with our plans on repurchase of shares. As you know, we set a goal at the beginning of the year. We drive that program to achieve that goal. We have guidelines that we run with the board about price ranges that we'll be acquiring in, and we try to make sure that we stay within that and we run programs through the year. So when you see differences in repurchased shares by quarter, that's more to do with just when we're taking the actions and more the mechanics of it than it is to do with where we've lost interest (38:01) We're still hitting our targets for the year of how much we want to repurchase. And so that \u2013 that we didn't change our strategy at all on that. That's continuing.","And then secondly, with regard to the acquisition front, as I mentioned, we are actively working on those strategy areas that we talked about in the investor conference, and I'm feeling like we're making good progress. And as I've said before, the problem with describing progress in this publicly is until I have something to announce, I can't announce anything, which is very frustrating to you and other investors, I know, and frustrating to me, too. But again, all I can do is share my sentiment, I think, at this point, which is I feel like we're making good progress, which means that I think we'll be able to add to our growth platforms within our very tight constraints about making sure they're strategically good, and also helps investors with returns over the medium and long run, if not the short run as well.","And then last thing, you asked about divestitures. And as we described in the investor conference, we review our portfolio of businesses every year. And oftentimes, that review doesn't yield very much, and sometimes it makes us think more, but always what we're looking at is what are the businesses that we have, and we have a three-part criteria. One is that are they a strategic fit? Meaning, are we able to create more value with that business because we're the owner, because of the things that it links with and the competencies that we share across the business. Two, is it meeting our return guidelines, or do we know through management action how to get it to that place? And three, is there some way that we can potentially add to our growth platforms or otherwise by reconstituting that business in some way?","So we're pretty active at reviewing that portfolio, and we do it every single year. So we did it again this year, and we're always active on that. And very much like the acquisition front, of course, until we are actually doing anything, there's actually nothing I can say publicly. It's bad for our employees. It's bad for everything else. So we aren't going to say anything until we do something. But again, I just want you to know as someone who writes about us, and I want our investors to know that we always think we should evaluate our portfolio to make sure, as a management team, that we are actively managing the businesses that we're in as well as managing each one we have for success.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","All righty. Interesting. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","I'm just going to respond to your first question there, Jamie (40:34). My calculations show us in the low 20s decrementals on the Engine business. We'll maybe follow up on that later, but those are pretty normal levels, I think.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Morning, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a couple of kind of cleanup questions, I guess. On the contingency charges, you had some in a few historical quarters. Are we clear of those, or is there some risk those could come back in 2017?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, Andy. Yeah, we believe we're clear of those. So the process is we booked what we think was the estimated charge, and there's been no change in that.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rich. And then on the Beijing Foton JV, you talked about the costs incurred to improve sort of productivity and other stuff. How are those going to \u2013 first, could you quantify those in the fourth quarter? Because there was a pretty sharp falloff. I just want to make sure there wasn't anything else going on. And then how should we expect that JV contribution to kind of play out through 2017? Does it start out weak and then get back to where it should be through the year?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay, let me take that, and Mark, if you need to correct any of my numbers, just jump in. But yes, so on the ISG, we did take a charge in Q4, and to quantify it, it is roughly $25 million. And so just reminding folks where we are on this product, we remain very excited about it. In fact, our share at Foton now is over 75%, but frankly, have run into issues in certain duty cycles as we've added more applications in certain regions, were either fuel quality or service practices or things we've learned. And so we wished that wouldn't have happened, but hasn't changed our fundamental view. And so I think there will be a charge in Q1, but to a lesser degree. Think of kind of half that and all of that eliminated as we go into kind of Q2 and Q3 on the ISG.","And so our strategy hasn't changed. Just like we did on the 28, 38 (43:01), we went in China with a brand new product for the market, compete there and then take the product globally. So we've done that on the 28 and 38 (43:11). We're producing 150,000. Quite frankly, we went through a little bit of an issue on introductions as we entered new markets on the 28 and 38 (43:19) inside China. But we're now selling 50,000 of those outside of China, even at Euro 5 and Euro 6 levels are our strategies (43:28). We'll do the same thing on ISG, hasn't changed our approach.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","And I would just add, we've assumed flat markets in heavy, medium and light-duty in our guidance. Even in that environment, we'd expected earnings growth in light-duty with the projected share gains. But as Rich said, improving earnings as the year unfolds.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay, great. And then lastly, a similar question that I think Tim asked with respect to North America, could you kind of discuss what you're seeing in China at this point? You clearly indicated construction equipment's coming back, truck had a fairly good second half to the year last year from market bases, yet you're talking about, as you just said, Mark, kind of flat markets for truck in China. What's kind of going on over there?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, so we're projecting flat, although I would say our sentiment, even as weeks go by, gets a little more positive more than negative, Andy, on this. There's been \u2013 the new weight restrictions that have been put in place are helping, and so they're being enforced. So I think there are some signs of positiveness, but we just haven't put work, and we're (44:52) staying fairly conservative on our forecast just on what the sustainability of that is and still some questions. So I know there are some ranges. There's people who are more positive than us in the truck market right now. We're going to plan around flat from a capacity standpoint, of course, we can flex up and meet it if it's better than that.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","And the construction market, Andy, is improving, but just remember where we're starting from is a far, far cry from where we've been to in good markets there before. So yeah, we're pleased to see them move up, but it's got a long way to go. And I think it's going to be pretty gradual in its improvement, too. It's just the overall \u2013 there's a lot of overhang of equipment still. There's still a lot of dealer inventory. There's a ways for the industry to go, but again, we're happy to see the improvement up.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, there's not a lot of momentum in the high horsepower side, I would say. (45:43)","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm wondering if you could talk about your updated timing of the 12-liter engine production ramp in U.S. truck. It sounds like the quality issues in China are unrelated based on the description that you laid out, Rich, but maybe you can update us on the timeframe. And also, do you have new platform opportunities with Volvo now that they're exiting their 16-liter engine in the U.S.?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Jerry. Yeah, so first, they clearly are unrelated to quality issues or going out and taking care of customers. Again, kind of related to specific either regions or duty cycles in China. Nothing's changed on our schedule. So we'll begin some \u2013 you'll see some trucks here late in the year. It'll be not material in 2017, but we do have agreements with multiple OEMs to begin offering it, and remain very excited about it.","From the question on heavy-duty on Volvo, we're exclusive on 15-liter with two customers, with Navistar and PACCAR. And so I am pleased to say we'll now be exclusive on a third, with Volvo, with their announcement of discontinuing the 16-liter.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And Rich, sorry, just the number of platforms that you'll be available on, can you give us just a rough flavor?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","At least two.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Okay. And then, Tom, back on the M&A discussion, you folks have been really focused on driving structurally higher returns on capital over the course of your time leading the company, and I'm just wondering, are you signaling a longer term focus on returns on capital with potential to absorb lower returns near term as you build meaningful growth platform via acquisitions? Or maybe you could just talk about if you folks are changing the framework in terms of the timeframe in which you're targeting the types of return on capital that you folks have generated internally.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","I'm definitely not trying to signal or change anything. We've always had a medium to long-term view on return to capital. That's never changed. As you know, we operate a cyclical company and things do go up and do go down, even in our own returns on capital. We have long return cycles in our business as a matter of course, which of course is frustrating and difficult to manage, frankly, but it is just the case that we have that. So I'm definitely not trying to signal anything.","As we talked about when we talked about potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other partnerships, is that we have high return guidelines. We believe that we've served investors well when we retain that attitude that we need to earn good returns on capital with new things we do, just like we do with existing things we do, and that taking long ventures into things that don't generate a return would not be good for shareholders, and we're not going to do it.","You also know that if we're going to make investments in inorganic, that we have to put together a plan that we think works for shareholders, or it doesn't make sense. And what that means as far as short term and medium term and long term depends, we'll see when we get there. But I just need you and everyone else to know that we are not backing off anything with regard to our view about generating strong returns for shareholders, and we won't as long as I'm here, I could tell you that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning. Specifically on power gen and looking for another down year in 2017, could you talk about just how depressed that business is? I think we're now looking at five-plus years of declines, so what the declines look like from peak.","And then beyond the general macro, what signs you're looking at for conditions to start to turn there, whether it's by end markets or geographies, but where we can start to look for some hope in power gen given the multiyear declines that we've seen there.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, I can start just from a high level. I would say that as you quite rightly said, it's been a long term \u2013 we've had five years in a row really of very weak markets driven by low capital investment and especially in developing markets where we have strong positions, but also non-res capital spending. So those two trends have been strong negatives for the business for some time. And with regard to how depressed it is, we're pretty depressed about it. I'll let Mark give you like how much percent it's down, but we certainly have a lot of capacity, which is why we took the action we did last year, again, to restructure our capacity and try to reduce costs in a way that allowed us to ramp back up when things turn up again.","We still remain highly confident in the business' underlying economics as those economic drivers return. For one thing, we see that the demand for electricity in most markets, certainly in developing countries, increasing in terms of the amount of the economy that depends on more reliable power. We also see investments in more reliable power declining as economies decline. So we still believe that in most of those economies, they'll be relying on some form of grid support, either through standby generation, on other more sophisticated needs for data centers, et cetera, or just in terms of straight backup power in some regions where they have much, much less reliable power. So we believe that those fundamental things are in place. But it has been a long, tough decline, and we've worked actively to try to reduce the impact of those declines, but it's been a tough run.","Mark, do you want to comment at all about percentages?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, I think you're talking about over 30% down from five years ago. And again, that's on a business that isn't dependent on one part of the economy or on one particular upcycle or downcycle. I think as Tom said, in some cases, it's not always a lack of demand. Like in Latin America, there's a lot of demand. You've just got, in that case, a lot of customer liquidity issues that are holding back the movement of projects this year. And starting early last year where the Middle East was doing quite well and then that started to roll up (52:44). So it's just been a combination of circumstances. I would say Europe, stable; North America, stable but down a little bit. But it's really the emerging markets, as Tom said, over the last three to four years.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks for those details. And then on the tax rate and looking for I think 26% in 2017, should we think about that as being more representative of a tax rate on a go-forward basis? Is there anything unique in 2017? But just you go back a year ago, I think you were looking for something more in kind of the high 20%s range. Just want to think about this on a kind of the longer term outlook and what the right tax rate is.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Well, the only thing that's different \u2013 there's two things that are different in 2017 compared to what we said 12 months ago. One, we have a lower share of our profits coming out of the U.S., which, as you know, carries a higher tax rate today. And secondly, there has been some changes over the last few months in the UK, and some legislation there that does impact our business. So that's the real reason for the delta between the 24.6% that we reported for 2016 and the 26% for 2017. The biggest factor's going to be the geographic mix of earnings over the long term.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Hi, thank you. My question's about the Component guidance. It appears to be implying a decremental margin of 55% on a 4% revenue decline. I just wanted to get more color on why do you think the decrementals will be that poor.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Okay.","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Hey, David, this is Rich. I'll take that. Really, fundamentally, two things. One is volume's down, again, in North America is what we're projecting; and then two, was mentioned, some startup costs associated with our new Single Module aftertreatment in our aftertreatment business. And so just to remind you, we're making a really big change there, and this is not a small change in our aftertreatment. One, it's at half the size, half the weight, taking the maintenance intervals up by a factor of two. So it's a brand new product and we've had some startup kinds of expedited costs and all that that we had in Q4, and I mentioned those will continue into Q1. So those are the two things that are really dragging that down for 2017.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","How much of those investments? Because even if I hit you with a 30% decremental, it adds almost $0.20 to your guidance for the year, so I'm just trying to think about how big those costs are, just so I can get better feel for how reasonable the guidance is.","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Well, the aftertreatment piece, the startup, we're talking in the $20 million to $30 million range for the year. And then you know what our incremental margins are, you've seen before as volumes come back. So if volumes come back to the more normal levels, when and if that happens, then you'll see that turnaround.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","The other thing I would throw in there, David, too, if you go back to my answer to Jamie Cook earlier on, we are seeing some inflation in the metal markets, which is impacting the segment, and we are seeing some impact on compensation inflation, too. So those two or three headwinds that's impacting us in 2017 and we'll figure our way through it and then we get back to normal margins.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","But you should see improvement in the second half versus the first half.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Yeah, and not to nickel and dime you, but even with that cost on the startup, you're still implying decrementals over 40%? I'm just trying to make sure. I mean, is the inflation problems particular to Components and not in other segments? (56:38)","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","No, it's not. So again, thinking through your view of our guidance, again, as I've said kind of as an overview, we're taking a pretty conservative view of bad markets. And so I think the biggest opportunity we have in the Components business is that North American markets strengthen more and faster than what we have in our guidance. And you probably have a reasonable view about your opinion on that. So that would be one thing that you could take a look at if you wanted to.","But again, our view is that we're going to continue to manage conservatively. We're going to continue to find ways to take costs out. So again, as you know, we are not satisfied with decremental margins at that level. We're not pleased with that. We are working hard to figure out how to make that less of an impact, but we're giving you the forecast based on what we think we understand how to do right now, we'll continue to work on decremental margins in that business. It's a very profitable and good business for Cummins and we're going to continue to make it so.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","And last quick question on the M&A conversation. How do you think about, strategically, off-highway versus on-highway? Just all of the secular issues that we're aware of on-highway, as well as some of the benefits you've built up with your distribution acquisitions. Just how should we think about those two markets and how they impact your strategy.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, so on-highway, as you said, is a bigger volume. So it tends to drive a lot of the technology. And there is, of course, we have a very strong position on on-highway, and the fact that we lead in emissions and other technologies has helped us build a strong position there. On the other hand, as you quite rightly said, in off-highway, there's less vertical integration, and also, our distribution is well positioned globally to serve a bunch of markets that other people can't serve.","So both have important roles in our strategy. And frankly, we think one of the advantages of Cummins is we're able to put the two together in a way that drives synergies that most others can't. So as I think about it strategically, and I think about things we might do more of, I'm thinking about both those areas and how we can continue to use the synergy between the two to drive more returns to shareholders than others can.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","I appreciate it. Thanks, Tom.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","All right. Thank you. I think we're at the top of the hour. Thanks, everyone, for your questions, and Adam and I will be available for follow-up later.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Smith, the Vice President of Finance Operations. Sir, you may begin","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We'll all be available for your questions at the end of the prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of the risks and uncertainties.","More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factor section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's presentation material are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","Now, I'll turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Mr. Smith. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full-year results and finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2018. Pat will then take you through more details of both our fourth quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year.","Included in our fourth quarter results were charges related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Pat will cover in full in his remarks. My comments today will exclude the $39 million of tax-related charges, which impacted the fourth quarter earnings of our unconsolidated joint ventures.","Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.5 billion, an increase of 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. EBIT was $659 million or 12.0%, compared to 526 million or 11.7% a year ago. For the full-year, Cummins' sales were $20.4 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Our EBIT margin was 12.2%, up from 11.4% in 2016.","Engine business sales increased by 15% in 2017, due to stronger truck production in North America and global growth in demand for construction equipment. Engine business EBIT was 11% compared to 8.8% in 2016 due to the impact of stronger revenues and the realized benefits of cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by higher quality costs and variable compensation.","Sales for our Distribution segment increased by 14% due to higher demand in off-highway markets in North America and Asia. Full-year EBIT was 5.5% compared to 6.3% in 2016 as higher variable compensation costs resulting from stronger overall company performance more than offset the benefit of higher sales.","Full-year revenues for the Components segment increased by 22% due to stronger truck demand in North America and China as well as the sale of new products to meet the Bharat Stage IV emissions regulation in India that were introduced in April.","Our new Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission joint venture, which went into operation August 1 contributed 3% to full-year growth. EBIT was 13% compared to 13.3% in 2016.","Excluding the results of the Eaton Cummins joint venture, EBIT was 13.8%, up 50 basis points year-over-year as the benefits of higher volumes and cost reduction initiatives more than offset higher variable compensation costs.","Power Systems sales increased by 15% in 2017 with stronger demand for engines, for mining, in oil and gas customers and increased power generation sales in Europe.","EBIT was 7.2% compared to 7.5% in 2016 as the benefit of higher volumes and cost reduction programs were more than offset by higher warranty costs and losses associated with a large power project in the U.K.","Fourth quarter EBIT was 8.6% representing clear improvement from a year ago and we expect margins to improve further in 2018 as you will see from our guidance.","Now, I will comment on some of our key markets in 2017 starting with North America, and then I will comment on some of our largest international markets.","Our revenues in North America increased 15% in 2017, primarily due to stronger production and market share gains in truck markets and higher sales to oil and gas, construction, and mining customers.","Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks increased to 221,000 units, up 10% from 2016 levels. Our market share was 33%, also up from 2016. The market size for medium-duty trucks was 118,000 units in 2017, an increase of 9% from 2016.","The market size for medium-duty trucks was 118,000 units in 2017, an increase of 9% from 2016. Our full-year market share of 78% increased from 75% a year ago. 2017 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in North America with our engine shipments reaching 153,000 units, up 2%.","Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased 27% in 2017 due to improving customer confidence compared to a weak 2016. Engine shipments to high-horsepower markets in North America increased by 138% year-over-year, reflecting a rebound in oil and gas and mining markets.","Revenue for power generation increased by 3% due to stronger sales to consumer markets. Our international revenues increased by 19% in 2017. Our full-year revenues in China, including joint ventures were a record $4.9 billion, an increase of 40% reflecting stronger demand in truck and construction markets.","Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased 40% for the full-year, partially driven by the enforcement of regulations in the combating vehicle overloading which accelerated truck replacement.","Our market share in 2017 was 14%, down from 15% in 2016 as one of our OEM partners, Dongfeng Motors, experienced a decline in its truck market share.","Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 24%, twice the rate of the market growth as Foton continued to increase the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engines, displacing local competitor engines.","Our full-year share in the light-duty truck market was 8% in 2017, up 80 basis points over the prior year. Demand for construction equipment improved in 2017 due to increased infrastructure investment and property construction. Industry sales of excavators rose 100% year-over-year.","Cummins construction engine volumes increased by 175% as we gain share with key customers. Revenues for our Power Systems business in China increased by 13% due to growth in power generation and mining markets. Full-year revenues in India, including joint ventures were $1.8 billion, a 12% increase over 2016.","Industry truck production decreased 5% to 327,000 units, driven by implementation of the Bharat Stage IV emissions regulations in India. Our market share increased by 100 basis points to 42%, with more than 90% of Tata Motors trucks, powered by our joint venture engines, reflecting strong market acceptance of our new products.","Sales for our Components business more than tripled due to the introduction of new products to help our customers meet the emissions regulations. Revenues for power generation increased by 5% and construction sales grew by 17% due to ongoing infrastructure development in the country.","In Brazil, our revenue increased by 26% compared to a very weak 2016. The growth was due, in large part, to a 37% increase in truck production to meet export demand.","Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2018 and then comment on the individual regions and end-markets. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2018 to be up 4% to 8%. Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 266,000 units in 2018, a 20% increase year-over-year. We expect our market share to be between 31% and 34%.","In the medium-duty truck market, we expect the market size to be 124,000 units, up 5% compared to 2017. We project our market share to be in the range of 72% to 75%.","Our Engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be flat compared to a very strong 2017. And in China, we expect domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to decrease by 5% in 2018.","We currently project a 15% decline in heavy and medium-duty truck production and a flat light-duty truck market. We expect our market share in the medium, heavy-duty market to be 14%, level with 2017. And in light-duty, we expect our share to grow to 9%.","We currently project 8% growth in off-highway markets in China. In India, we expect total revenues, excluding joint ventures, to increase by 15% to 20%, mainly due to stronger truck demand, a full-year of new component product sales to meet Bharat Stage IV emissions standards and continued strength in off-highway markets.","In Brazil, we expect truck production to be flat in 2018, with some uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery and election scheduled for October. We expect our global high-horsepower engine shipments to be up 5% to 10% in 2018 due to further improvement in orders from mining customers.","In summary, we expect full-year sales to be between 4% and 8% up over 2017. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of 15.8% to 16.2% of sales, up from 15% in 2017. The improvement in EBITDA margins reflects approximately 45% incremental margins at the midpoint of our guidance, and we exclude the impact of our investment in our Electrification business and our start-up losses in our Eaton Cummins joint venture.","Improving market demand, continued execution of cost reduction initiatives and lower variable compensation costs will drive the improvement in margins. We plan to again return at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2018 through both dividends and share repurchases.","We continue to make progress in the execution of our strategy and we recently announced the acquisition of Johnson Matthey's automotive battery systems business based in the UK, a subsidiary of Johnson Matthey that specializes in high-voltage automotive grade battery systems for electric and hybrid electric vehicles.","The addition of Johnson Matthey Battery Systems technical expertise and customer base in markets that are more rapidly adopting electrification further strengthens our position, both as an electrified powertrain provider and as an energy storage supplier.","As we discussed in our Analyst Day last November, we plan to invest approximately $500 million over the next three years as part of our strategy to develop an electrified powertrain product line, along with key component technologies and service and support offerings.","Starting in the first quarter, we will report the results of our Electrification business separately, so that investors can see the level of investment and understand the pace of development in different commercial vehicle markets over time","Now, let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of our fourth quarter results, before I move on to our full-year 2017 performance. Fourth quarter revenues were $5.5 billion, an increase of 22% from a year ago and a quarterly record for the company.","Sales in North America increased by 22% from last year, as a result of higher commercial truck production and improved demand for industrial engines and power generation equipment. International sales also improved by 22% from a year ago due to stronger demand in China, India and in Europe.","Gross margins were 25.1% of sales, an increase of 20 basis points from last year. The positive impact from higher volumes and material cost savings more than offset higher variable compensation expense and the dilutive impact on the gross margin percent from the Eaton Cummins joint venture.","Selling, admin and research and development costs of $840 million or 15.3% of sales, increased as a percent of sales by 30 basis points due to an increase in investments for developing new products, higher variable compensation expense and the inclusion of the Eaton Cummins joint venture in 2017.","Joint venture income of $56 million includes a $39 million tax charge related to the tax reform bill passed in December. Excluding that tax adjustment, joint venture income was $95 million, a $28 million or 42% increase from last year.","Earnings before interest and tax were $620 million or 11.3% of sales for the quarter, and again if you adjust for the $39 million tax adjustment to joint venture income, earnings before interest and tax were $659 million or 12% of sales compared to $526 million or 11.7% last year.","Our fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by one-time charges related to the tax reform bill passed in December. These include the $39 million reduction in joint venture income I already mentioned; a $43 million credit to non-controlling interests; and a $781 million in additional tax expense.","All in, the total impact of this tax legislation was a charge of $777 million, which is a combination of the write-down of our net deferred tax assets, reflecting the reduction in the U.S. tax rate from 35% to 21% and the cost associated with a mandatory deal repatriation of overseas earnings, including the associated withholding tax that will be paid as we move cash out of certain jurisdictions and countries. These charges represents our best estimates at this point in time that could change as additional guidance is issued with assumptions supporting our estimates are defined.","Page 11 of the Form 8-K illustrates the impact of the tax legislation on our fourth quarter results. As a result of the $777 million impact to net income from the impact of the tax reform, we reported a net loss for the quarter of $274 million or $1.65 per diluted share. Excluding the tax adjustment, net earnings for the quarter were $503 million or $3.03 per diluted share compared to $378 million or $2.25 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter, excluding the tax reform charges was 19.5%, down from 22% last year.","Now, let me comment on our full-year results and provide some more details on our performance. Revenues for the company were a record $20.4 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the prior year. As Tom just described, the growth in international truck production in North America and China, strong demand in our global construction markets and improved demand in mining and oil and gas markets led to the overall revenue increase.","North American revenues increased by 15% in 2017 and represented 58% of our total revenues. International revenues increased by 19% compared to 2016. Gross margins of 24.9% were 50 basis points lower than last year. Higher warranty and variable compensation expense, along with dilutive impact on the gross margin percent from the Eaton Cummins joint venture offset the benefits from the stronger volumes and material cost reduction initiatives.","Selling, admin and research and development costs increased by $460 million or 10 basis points due to higher compensation costs, increased investment in new products and technologies and the inclusion of Eaton Cummins joint venture in our results. Joint venture income increased by $56 million compared to last year, net of the $39 million tax charge related to the tax reform bill passed in December. If we exclude that tax charge, our joint venture income increased by $95 million compared to 2016 primarily due to higher contributions from our China joint ventures amidst strong demand in on-highway markets.","Other income and expense improved by $213 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to the loss contingency charge that we reported back in 2016 and gain on asset sales and fair value gains on company-owned life insurance plans in 2017.","In total, earnings before interest and tax was $2.45 billion or 12% of sales, and adjusting for the $39 million tax adjustment to joint venture income, EBIT was $2.5 billion or 12.2% of sales compared to $2 billion or 11.4% a year ago.","Our reported net earnings were $999 million or $5.97 per share. Excluding the full impact of the tax charge, 2017 net earnings were just under $1.8 billion compared to $1.4 billion last year, and diluted earnings per share was a record $10.62, up from $8.23 a share last year.","The operating tax rate for the full-year was 58% or 24.5% if we exclude the tax charge, compared to 24.6% a year ago. Page 12 of the form 8-K illustrates the impact of the tax legislation on our full-year results.","Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the fourth quarter and the full-year and then provide some more details in our forecast for 2018. I will then review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year and conclude with some details on cash flow. My comments in the segments will exclude the $39 million of tax charges that did impact the joint venture earnings and details by segment can be found in the notes on pages 7 and 8 of our Form 8-K.","In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 16% from last year. On-highway revenues grew by 14%, driven by higher heavy- and medium-duty truck engines sales. Off-highway revenues increased by 27%, primarily due to higher construction sales in North America and in China. Segment EBIT in the fourth quarter was $247 million or 10.8% of sales compared to $194 million or 9.9% of sales a year ago. Stronger volumes and increased joint venture income more than offset cost increases from variable compensation and research and development spending.","For the full-year, revenues increased by 15% from a year ago, and earnings before interest and taxes were $982 million or 11% of sales, up from $686 million or 8.8% last year. For 2018, we expect revenues to be up by 4% to 8% due to stronger demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market and continuing strength in global construction markets.","EBITDA margins are projected to be in the range of 14% to 14.5% compared to 13% in 2017. For the Distribution segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.9 billion, increasing 16% compared to last year. The increase in sales was primarily driven by improved demand for both new engines and parts and service in North America. EBIT for the fourth quarter was $101 million or 5.2% of sales; compared to last year, fourth quarter EBIT margins decreased by 2.1%. The decrease in EBIT margin was primarily driven by higher variable compensation expense incurred as a result of the company's overall performance and the one-time gain of $15 million last year for the acquisition of the last remaining unconsolidated North American distributor.","For 2017, sales for the segment grew by 14%. Organic sales for the year increased by 11% for a revenue from acquisitions increased sales by 3%. EBIT as a percent of sales declined from 6.3% down to 5.5%, driven by higher variable compensation cost, again resulting from the stronger overall company performance.","For 2018, Distribution revenue is projected to increase 2% to 6%, driven by improving demand in many of our key markets. We expect EBITDA margins to be in the range of 7.75% to 8.25% of sales compared to 7.1% in 2017.","For the Components segment, revenues were $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 32% from a year ago and a quarterly record. Sales in North America increased 35% due to higher commercial truck production and the inclusion of revenues from Eaton Cummins joint venture.","International sales increased by 30%, primarily due to the higher content in India, with the introduction of the Bharat Stage IV emissions standard in 2017 and from increased commercial truck production in China.","Segment EBIT was $180 million or 11.6% of sales compared to $140 million or 11.9% of sales last year. Higher variable compensation costs and costs related to the Eaton Cummins joint venture offset the benefits from increased volumes and material cost reductions. Excluding the impact of the Eaton Cummins joint venture, segment EBIT percent improved by 120 basis points.","For 2017, our Components segment delivered record revenue, up 22% compared to the previous year, driven by higher demand in North America, China and India in addition to the inclusion of revenues received from the Eaton Cummins joint venture. EBIT as a percent of sales decreased from 13.3% down to 13%. Excluding the Eaton Cummins joint venture, Components revenue grew by 18%, and EBIT as a percent of sales was 13.8%, an increase of 50 basis points from last year.","For 2018, we expect revenue to increase by 8% to 12%, driven by the continued strength in truck production in North America and the full-year of operations for the Eaton Cummins joint venture, partially offset by U.S. sales and China. EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 15% to 15.5% of sales compared to 15.8% in 2017.","And on the Power Systems segment, fourth quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, up 18% from a year ago. Industrial sales grew by 51%, primarily due to stronger mining and oil and gas demand while power generation sales increased by 6% compared to last year.","EBIT margins were 8.6% of sales in the quarter, up from 7.3% last year. Higher volumes and material cost reductions more than offset higher variable compensation and restructuring costs related to the closure of our STAMFORD manufacturing plant in the UK.","For the full-year, Power Systems revenues increased by 15% from 2016, primarily driven by growth in the mining and oil and gas markets. EBIT increased to $294 million or 7.2% of sales compared to $263 million or 7.5% last year. Higher volumes and material cost reductions were offset by higher variable compensation expense and the absence of a $17 million gain last year relating to the divestiture of a Power Systems joint venture.","For 2018, we expect Power Systems revenues to increase 4% to 8%, driven by the continuing strength of the mining market and improved demand for power generation equipment at data centers. EBITDA margins are expected to be between 12.25% and 12.75%, up from 10.1% last year.","For 2018, we're forecasting total company revenues to be up 4% to 8%, primarily driven by the increased demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market, a full-year of operations for the Eaton Cummins joint venture and increased demand in mining and power generation markets. We expect EBITDA margins to be between 15.8% and 16.2%, up from 15% last year. Higher volumes will positively impact margins in addition to lower warranty and lower variable compensation costs.","We remain focused on cost reduction with improvements in material cost, plant productivity and the quality of products helping to offset investments in new products, merit increases and restructuring costs relating to the downsizing of our STAMFORD automated manufacturing operation in the UK.","Income from our joint ventures is expected to decline by approximately 15%, driven by weaker market demand in China. And we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 23% this year, excluding any discrete items or adjustments to provisional estimates.","Finally, turning to cash flow, cash generated from operations for the full-year was a record $2.3 billion. We anticipate operating cash flow in 2018 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales.","Capital expenditures for the full-year of $506 million and we're forecasting our 2018 investments will be in the range of $730 million to $760 million as we continue to invest in new product lines.","In 2017, we returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders or 51% of operating cash flow. We repurchased 2.9 million shares and increased our dividend by 5%. Our capital allocation plans are consistent with what we told you at our Analyst Day back in November. We will maintain a strong financial position to sustain us across cycles and variation in our business levels.","We will focus on growth, targeting high-return investments, both organic and inorganic. And we continue to plan to return at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Our strategy to create shareholder value remains centered on improving our return on capital. That starts with performance improvement. We will expand our EBITDA margins on our base business and increase the amount of cash that we generate from our operations.","Secondly, will continue to be disciplined in our investments, so we're focused on the opportunities that offer high returns, both organic and through acquisitions and partnerships, and we will continue to invest in new technologies to make sure that we are well-positioned for the opportunities ahead.","And finally, we will deliver strong returns to our shareholders with top quartile performance and returns on capital that we invest in the business as well as through dividends and stock buybacks.","We are pleased with the record sales, record earnings per share and record operating cash flow in 2017. Our returns on capital were also top quartile. (29:51) That being said, there were clearly areas where we could have done better, and you can see from our guidance that we expect clear improvement in operating margins in 2018.","Now, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Pat. We're now ready to move to the Q&A session of the call. Could you please restrict your question to one question and one related follow-up and then get back in queue. Thank you very much. Now, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Tim Thein, if your line is on mute, please unmute it.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, I'm sorry about that. Sorry, folks. I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the Power Systems sales guidance for 2018. Maybe you could just expand a little bit, obviously, power gen returned to growth first time, I think, in a number of years. So maybe just segmenting power gen as well as some of the key drivers for the industrial market here in 2018, just coming at that 4% to 8% expected sales growth.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, Tim, this is Rich. So it's coming in a few areas. Mining, we anticipate to continue being strong, up 10%, again here in 2018. Overall, power gen \u2013 so it's been depressed for some time, up 5% to 10% and part of that is in data centers. In fact, we will double the number of Hedgehog engines we sell this year in 2018 compared to 2017, but just a bit of improvement in several markets. North America is up a bit for the first time; China is up; India is up. This forecast assumes oil and gas is flat from a pretty big increase in 2017 and marine remains flat in this forecast.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","The only thing I'd add, Tim, is we had one large power contract in the UK in 2017 that's complete, and that's kind of a 3% headwind to revenues as we start the year.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, but presumably, tailwind to the EBIT line, Mark?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Absolutely.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe for Rich, while you're on, just on the North American Class 8 market share forecast. There's in 2018, a view that some of the large fleets come back to the market in a bigger way and I guess that's consistent with what we've heard from some of the larger carriers here in recent days, talking about bringing their fleet ages down. And obviously that's, historically, been a segment of the market that you've done better with, so maybe just a quick sentence or two in terms of I don't know if I heard what you're assuming in terms of market share in Class 8 for North America?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Sure. So let me just touch briefly on the market, and then I'll get to market share. So, as Tom said, we're projecting up 20% in the North American truck market. And orders are off to a really good start if you saw the January orders. And so the backlog, end of the year, the 134,000, it'll grow through the first quarter. So I think we're going to see production rates building through the first quarter, maybe starting out a little lower, but we should see some good momentum through the year is what we're seeing.","And on the market share, we're forecasting relatively flat. And we're building the plan around a flat share. We made good progress in 2017. We gained share. The product's doing really well as we've talked to all the major fleets that we have business with; we're either remaining flat or growing with them. So I feel pretty good about the share piece again from a projection standpoint, this plan assumes flat.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. I guess, two questions. One, Rich, back on the North American heavy-duty truck markets as 2018 continues to surprise on the upside, can you talk about your view on 2019, whether that takes away from 2019 or should we get start to get concerned that 2018 is the peak?","And then my second question relates to the Power Systems margin guidance that you gave. I guess, can you talk about how much benefit we're getting from restructuring, what you assume sort of price cost, just the drivers to get your margin guidance? Thank you.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay, I'll start first on North America truck. Well, the crystal ball is not that quite clear out to 2019. But if you just step back at 2017, we're really at kind of a replacement level. And so with this increase in 2019 that we're projecting, we're going to be building at a rate greater than replacement. Historically, these upturns have run kind of in the 2-year range.","So it's a little too early to call it yet. It probably depends on how quickly 2018 comes up, but all the indicators, underlying principles, as you know, are pretty good. I've spent the last few weeks talking to many of the fleets, and I do think the January orders were a little bit front-loaded. So I wouldn't anticipate that continuing at the rate we saw in January as many of the big fleets got their orders in. But it feels pretty strong right now, kind of \u2013 and I think, potentially, building momentum through 2018.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","I think on the Power Systems margin side, Jamie, a couple of factors. One, we're still going to have net costs in 2018 as we complete the rightsizing of our alternate and manufacturing facility in the UK, so that margin improvement is still with $29 million and our incremental $25 million of costs in the performance there included in the segment margins.","The big piece is really going to be with half of the improvement in margins is going to be volume and cost reduction \u2013 material cost reduction. The quarter is going to be the absence of the UK power project, and end of the half is really going to be leveraged on the operating costs.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I'm sorry, just one other follow-up then I'll get back in queue. Just on \u2013 you're evaluating the engines from 2010 to 2015, potential degradation issues can you just talk about it? Are we still expecting any update there? Are we still expecting some sort of update by mid-2018? Thanks and I'll get back.","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks. Jamie, this is Rich again. Yeah, so no new update there. We're continuing like we talked last quarter to do the analysis with the agencies. That work is collaborative and so our mix kind of round of discussions with them is later this quarter.","So my anticipation goal is that we'll share data and we're really targeting to get this behind us by mid-year, but no new update, kind of off-schedule of what we told you last quarter on the analysis.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Rob.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","My question is really just on the Eaton JV, can you give us any kind of an update on profitability, on spending level, on how the product launches are going? How is it going versus your expectation once you're investing in and how you expect to get a return on it \u2013 when you guys expect to get a return on it rather?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Rob, I can just give you the view of where it is versus expected. I'll have Mark fill in to some of the numbers. But from an expectation level, we expect it to be investing at the end of last year and this year in new products, heavier than we were seeing growth in volume and revenue. So we were expecting to have a loss for the second half of last year and for this year, and we expect to be in profitability next year.","In terms of volume and take-up of the product, it's right on plan, doing terrifically well and we're getting good acceptance from the market. Our development plans are right on plan.","So while not every investment we make goes exactly like expected, this one is going like we expected which is terrific and I think it speaks well to the fact that both Eaton and ourselves have very complementary cultures and very complementary approaches to products and so we feel like we're right on plan. Mark, I don't know if you want to highlight any of the numbers?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. So the full-year sales for the joint venture, which of course, was only 5 months but $163 million in 2017 and EBITDA loss of $7 million, and then in 2018 at the midpoint of our guidance, we've got about $430 million of sales and an EBITDA loss of $32 million, again with the engineering ramp-up and the launch of the new products, and as Tom said, then we start to have the positive incrementals going into 2019.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","That's perfect. Thank you. And Tom, if I may, is that investment that's ongoing for engineering the products so that their kind of out there in the market that we know about and be designed in or is there a substantial investment for a whole next-generation that we haven't seen yet?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","It's basically both. I mean, the issue is we have indeed engineered the basic platform. But now we have to engineer all the releases that are needed to get them into all the customers that we want to get them into, so that turns out that's not a small effort, right? So you get the basic design of what you're trying to put together and then you have to do all of the application engineering and product releases that get you all across the product lines. And that's really what drives the volume, not just the one main product that goes in the one Class 8 truck. So that's really what's going on. We're building out the product line. We are also investing in some new products, the next-generation products that have not been released yet. So both are going on, but I'd say the big work this year is to get the new, enduring product line and get it out to all the various customers that will benefit from using it.","Rob Wertheimer - Melius Research LLC","Thank you so much.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Tom, I was just looking to get your kind of your latest view on the balance sheet and M&A. Obviously it's kind of a dynamic as we go forward. But just your general view on buying conventional assets that are tied to the internal combustion engine and are accretive today versus buying intellectual property. And you bought Brammo, you bought the Johnson Matthey asset. Obviously, you're investing in the Eaton joint venture and are very optimistic there. We've also seen a big spike in goodwill and intangibles on your balance sheet, so how are you thinking about that now? And I've got a follow-up as well.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Great. Ross, it's a terrific question. Thanks for that. Obviously, that is \u2013 that exact question of where do we see the technology is evolving, where are we building up capabilities that we need in the future and where we're adding growth and earnings, that's kind of \u2013 those are at the heart of how we're figuring out how to invest with discipline and to drive value for shareholders. So there is not one simple answer to your question. But suffice it to say, that we've identified the four areas that we think we can leverage our capabilities to make one plus one equals three, because making acquisitions, to buy earnings, to just add to the total does not create value for shareholders. It has to be that by us coming together with that company, we're able to find synergies, more growth, more something that would justify any kind of premium we would pay.","So what you've seen us do so far is we've identified in the automotive space, significant changes in technology and we've made it clear that we want to be the provider of a range of technologies that meets the needs of our customers. So we've made the acquisitions we need to make there. And since we're pretty strong in internal combustion engines in that area, what we've needed to add is capabilities and electrified powertrains and other things. So we're not really looking at expanding our internal combustion engine in that space.","If you look in some of the other spaces where we're talking about going up into larger engines than we have today, then we might invest in assets that include internal combustion engines because there we think the internal combustion engine has a much longer life, has fewer substitutes over time, so it will depend on which area we're in. I think \u2013 I hope what you also see is that we're not in a hurry to spend money. We're basically seeing this as an opportunity to build value and growth for shareholders. And when we find something that we think we can add value and growth, we're going to do it; and if we don't, we're going to return money to shareholders. We're going to continue to use that discipline so that acquisitions we have been making or joint ventures have been relatively small, and they've been a perfect fit strategy-wise, so we're continuing in that vein. If we were able to get a larger acquisition that met the same criteria, we do it; if we don't, we'll be happy with that and we'll continue to look at relatively incremental additions to capabilities and growth.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just to expand what you just said there, Tom, I think your comment on if you're to sustain \u2013 focus more on the internal combustion engine and you focus more on larger engines, fair to assume that you'd probably be more off-highway focused if you were to acquire kind of in the conventional technology? And then can you guys just elaborate on what exactly is in this Electrification segment that you've broken out? Is that just Brammo, these Johnson Matthey assets?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. So I'll give you a couple of comments on both. The answer to your first question is yes, most engines larger than 16 liters are off-highway. That's true. And again, in terms of where substitution rates are happening more quickly in Electrification, as you know, most are on-highway, not only though. There are some very interesting markets from an Electrification point of view off-highway Q, but most of the action is happening now in urban transportation on-highway.","So \u2013 and then with regard to Electrification, we have basically three things going in there. One is the battery acquisitions that you mentioned, the Brammo work, the new Johnson Matthey Battery Systems division that we just acquired. In addition to that, we have internal programs where we are developing electrified powertrains. Cummins developed and designed and manufactured electronic powertrains for application first in buses \u2013 in urban buses, which you heard we announced that we would be in production in urban buses, first offerings at the end of 2019 and in full production in 2020. So we are full on in development phase for those products.","And then we have groups that are looking at longer-term, where the rest of the application is going to, doing R&D and also market development work for the applications beyond buses. So internal people plus the two divisions we acquired, but the threads inside the group are what do we need to be in production right away, that's a very focused group of people and then what are we looking at longer run.","Ross Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, good morning. One data point, if you can just provide us quickly, the D&A by segment for 2018, you're at $670 million total for the company, but you're only at $580 million last year.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","I just want to make sure we have the moving parts here, would you mind for the segments?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","The two biggest moving parts are the full-year impact of the Eaton Cummins joint venture, David, which will be in the Components segment and then the other big piece will be accelerated depreciation on the assets as part of the restructuring of the Power Systems business in the UK. And those two will account for at least two-thirds of the increase in the D&A and the balance will be more routine, capitalized software amortization and depreciation of regular fixed assets across the segments.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. I'm just trying to back into, obviously, still thinking out of the EBIT if you don't mind, the incremental EBIT margins are about 25% in the guidance. Within that, component (sic) [Components] is one, but then if I pull out the Eaton JV from 2017 and 2018, it still feels like the incremental is very low in that segment. And, obviously, Electrification is now separate. So I'm just trying to understand that that business, am I reading it properly the incrementals are very low on Component (sic) [Components] in the guide?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","They certainly improved, as Tom mentioned and Pat in his comments, year-over-year, excluding the joint venture, and we still expect to have underlying EBIT margin improved. I don't have the exact math in front of me ex that item. (48:02)","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","David, from memory, we can check these numbers and come back to you afterwards, but I think if you exclude the Eaton Cummins joint venture, the Components EBITDA last year was just around 16.3% or 16.4% and our guidance for the base business of Components is 16.5% to 17% this year. So we'll come back and confirm those numbers.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, if we could. The numbers aren't quite adding up. And back to the balance sheet, in Indianapolis, you sounded a little more willing to use your balance sheet than I've heard this decade. And you talked about 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA and you're guiding EBITDA this year $3.5 billion, right? So obviously, that would be a $7 billion net debt target. Net debt right now is only $400 million to $500 million, so can you help us understand, say, a larger deal does not come along? Tom, you had mentioned return some to shareholders.","Can we imagine a year from now, no deals come up that large size, and we're talking $6.5 billion-plus, over 20% of your market cap, how should we think about your willingness to wait for a deal to come to fruition or then decide, hey, at some point this year, we'll return a significant amount to shareholders? And I'm not talking about the 50% of operating cash flow. This is solely a balance sheet story.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","David, it's a super question. I mean, it's really important to shareholders, this question. And of course, it's a judgment call, right? There is not a straightforward way to answer that. Here is the way that I've been thinking about it, though, and I framed it up in the investor meeting, is that my goal, as the leader of this company, is to make sure that we continue to create the most value for shareholders. And I'm trying to figure out which one adds more value.","And as long as I believe that we can use cash generated by our business to either invest in organically, invest in partnerships or in acquisitions, and that can create value for shareholders, not just make us bigger but actually create value, then I want to pursue those efforts.","But not indefinitely and not just on some chasing windmills adventure. So the idea is that when I begin to see the opportunity for us to make major investments, either, by the way, with one larger acquisition or with a series of smaller and medium acquisitions, which, frankly, is slightly more attractive to me in terms of risk mitigation and that kind of thing, when I see those opportunities, I'm going to continue to pursue them.","And when I don't see many opportunities in front of us, I'm going to increase the amount of money we return to shareholders. So I don't think there's a magic date this year. I don't think there's a magic date ever, but I do think that it's incumbent upon me to not just continue to go on forever, but to have a view about when these opportunities look less attractive or that I view that there's fewer and to increase the return to shareholders at that point.","So we are watching that really closely and thinking about that a lot. Right now, I believe there are still a number of opportunities that we are looking at both small, medium and larger acquisitions, partnerships, et cetera. But, again, we are evaluating that each quarter, not a year, but each quarter to see if that remains true.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","No, I appreciate that. I'm not trying to hold you to a strict deadline, but it would just seem like a year from now, we're sitting here by then with net cash, the tax policy change has made M&A, in a way, even easier. I'm just making sure though if something doesn't happen in 12 months, are we looking at off-highway markets that might have a couple of year run in them, but on-highway, maybe domestic getting a little harder to see growth and we're still just sitting there with a great balance sheet, but we're not using it, what's really the value creation, right? So...","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. I definitely appreciate the thought.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","I'll follow-up with the incrementals. David, I think there's something wrong with the numbers maybe.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","All right.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","(51:58) but I think we're above 30% incrementals on the base here.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Ex the JV, right?","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Tom, can you talk about where we are in the Electrification investment cycle? So, really appreciate the disclosures on $60 million to $80 million in investment in 2018. How should we think about the investment curve into 2019? Does that need to head higher? Can you just calibrate us the same way you did on the Eaton joint venture, on when does an investment peak, effectively?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. So right now, as we talked about, Jerry, we're thinking about \u2013 again, we are estimating. There's a lot of work to figure out here, but we're estimating about $500 million over three years. So, obviously, $60 million to $80 million, we'll have to ramp a little further to make $500 million over three years. But, again, we've got them split into those buckets where we're going to have to make investments to launch our current products. So we understand that investment schedule really, really well. And yet that will continue to ramp until the launch. And then we also understand the investment we're making in terms of new market development and some of the ranges beyond the bus market and other urban transportation markets.","The part that's a little less certain is where do we want to invest organically, where do we want to acquire or partner to add capabilities? Because you may remember from the investor conference, the capability we're trying to build up is to make sure that we have electrified powertrains as well as diesel and natural gas powertrains for the range of potential users plus we have component technologies that allow us to differentiate our overall system and to help our customers develop their systems plus service and support capabilities in our Distribution network so that we can build a profitable return model in each of those technologies as well as create advantage for our customers. That's the investments we're trying to make.","So there is going to be some combination of organic partnerships and joint ventures. And as you guess, some of those will be lumpier and a little bit harder to predict. But, nonetheless, $500 million is our estimate. We feel like it's pretty well grounded but there'll be some variation around it and the ramp-up is less clear in some of those lumpier investments.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","And just to add one point there, Jerry, the $500 million is the cash number over the three years as we said at Analyst Day, so you're not going to see a tripling of the annual expense. There may be some increase next year, but the cash outlay could include some inorganic is still the same, $500 million over three years, about 40% operating expenses over the three years.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And Rich, on the North America truck market, can you just provide us on the platform release schedule? How is the 12-liter looking? And Volvo, you folks have won increased specification last year, what's the timing of that ramp? Can you just flush that out for us?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay, yes. So the X12, which again is pretty geared to the vocational market and regional whole market, we're going to be late 2018 before we come to market and working our schedules with OEs. That's about a year behind what we said before. We're still excited about it. With the 15 liters, it was really only have completed half of that market. And so this will give us a shot, kind of at the low end of the 13-liter side and it's a big weight advantage. And so we got a lot of customers calling for it. We've got to work out the schedules and deals with OEs but it's got an 800-pound advantage, and so \u2013 where that's important and we remain optimistic and excited about that, but about a year behind what we've told you before. So not being really material until 2019, just beginning to ramp up. And did you have a second question?","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, Rich, the 15-liter on Volvo be given the platform release?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. So, no \u2013 so we're engineered in. I'd say the take has been slow to-date and so I'm excited we got another offering \u2013 it will be exclusive in there, but the uptake is going to take a little bit of time, I think.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Jerry from that point, on the Volvo side, this is an opportunity for both Volvo and Cummins I think to grow share. But, just honestly, the fact is that Volvo worked for many years to make sure they were a sole powertrain provider, and so they're not only as the offering side, but there's the whole adjustment of our two organizations to get in the business of selling their trucks with our powertrain, and that's been pushing and pulling new operation.","Sometimes, we're going good, and other times, we're not going good, but our two organizations really are relearning how to do that well, and I think that's creating some of the weakness, moving slower than both of us would like. But there is commitment and I think both of us feel like this is an opportunity for both the companies to increase their market participation.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And just a clarification if I may on the X12, Rich, what's driving the year later schedule? Is that a function of how good the market is so it's tougher to get engineering resources or product performance? Can you just comment on that?","Richard Joseph Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","I think it's \u2013 quite all of those things factored in. There's not a single piece that I think, if doing the engineering work and building it into schedule is still there, plus we did a little extra work on the engines. So it was a bit of our delay and a bit of working out the schedules with DOE. (57:52)","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Can you \u2013 I don't think you covered this, but can you provide a little bit more detail on product coverage costs as a percent of sales in Q4? And then, separately, what level of coverage costs is embedded in the 2018 guide?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Yes. So Q4 came back down into a more normalized level, and the 2.3% is where we finished up in the quarter. So full-year 2017, it was 3.1%. Within the guidance for 2018, we are assuming 2.4%.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks Pat. And for this yet to be determined whether you're going to take incremental warranty mid-year or what that obviously has yet to be determined, but where is that work being done?

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Vice President of Financial Operations, Mr. Mark Smith. Please go ahead, sir.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2017. Joining me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Rich Freeland. We'll all be available for your questions at the end of the prepared remarks.","Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the SEC, particularly in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual and Quarterly Reports.","During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at cummins.com under the heading Investors and Media.","Now, I'll hand it over to Tom. Thank you.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Vice President Smith. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide you with summary of our first quarter results as well as some comments on our outlook for 2017. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.","But before I provide my comments on the quarter, I'd like to talk about our recently announced agreement with Eaton, to form a joint venture to design, develop, and manufacture automated transmissions. We are really excited about this joint venture with Eaton, and we have provided some additional slides on our website, which lay out why this joint venture presents a significant opportunity for Cummins. The strategic rationale for the joint venture is simple. Since fuel is one of the largest cost drivers for our customers, fuel efficiency will be a primary differentiator of commercial powertrains across our global markets.","Cummins and Eaton had been partners for decades and today offer the leading combination of engine and transmission performance in the North American heavy-duty truck market. We believe that the next-generation of transmissions designed, developed and manufactured by the joint venture combined with Cummins' capability and system integration can yield significant improvements in fuel efficiency for Cummins and our OEM customers and partners.","Cummins will invest $600 million for a 50% share of this joint venture. And in return, we'll be able to develop integrated powertrains that offer a significant performance advantage, add to our portfolio of technology offerings to our customers and benefit from the value created by the joint venture as it leads the secular shift to more automated transmissions. Eaton will contribute the current design for the next-generation heavy-duty automated to manual transmission, its current automated manual transmission for medium-duty markets called the precision, direct (03:39) manufacturing assets, as well as intellectual property and people associated with the development, testing and assembly of automated transmissions.","The joint venture has a clear path to profitable growth, and will benefit from accelerating transition to automated transmissions from fully manual transmissions in global markets. We expect that the next generation of products with advanced performance will gain market share, and the joint venture will leverage Cummins' strong position to grow in international markets where the penetration of automated transmissions is currently very low. The joint venture will also capture aftermarket revenues. We project that the joint venture can more than triple its current sales of approximately $300 million over the next five years. Cummins will consolidate the results of the joint venture within the Components segment, and we expect that the joint venture will be operational in the third quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals.","Now let me turn to our first quarter financial results. Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the first quarter of 2016 and stronger than we anticipated three months ago. EBIT was $566 million or 12.3% compared to $484 million or 11.3% a year ago. All four operating segments increased sales, EBIT dollars and EBIT percent. Our incremental EBIT margin was 28%. Engine business revenues increased by 2% in the first quarter due to strong sales to construction customers, especially in China. EBIT for the first quarter was 11.3% compared to 10% for the same period in 2016, with the increase due to profitable growth in our off-highway business and strong performance in our on-highway joint ventures in China.","Sales for the Distribution segment increased by 12% with organic sales growth of 6%, driven by stronger demand for engine rebuilds, parts and new engines in off-highway markets. We acquired the last remaining joint venture distributor in North America in the fourth quarter last year, and this acquisition contributed 6% to growth. First quarter EBIT was 6.1% compared to 5.9% in the first quarter of 2016 and improved as a result of the higher organic sales.","First quarter revenues for the Components segment increased by 9%, primarily driven by strong growth in sales to Chinese truck OEMs. EBIT for the first quarter was 13.3% compared to 13.2% in the same quarter a year ago and much improved from the fourth quarter last year when we incurred additional launch costs associated with our new Single Module aftertreatment system in North America. We made clear progress in reducing the cost of the Single Module and improving supply chain performance in the first quarter and we expect to see further improvement in the second quarter.","Power Systems sales increased by 9% in the first quarter, primarily driven by an increase in new engine and aftermarket sales to mining and oil and gas customers. EBIT in the first quarter was 6.5% compared to 5.7% a year ago due to the benefit of higher sales and lower operating costs. During the quarter, we had disappointing performance on a large power project in the UK, and excluding the impact of this single project, first quarter incremental EBIT margin was 40%. We expect profitability to improve for the rest of the year and again in 2018 as we get the full benefits from the restructuring of our UK generator set assembly operations, which continues to progress on schedule.","Now, I will comment on our performance in some of our key markets for the first quarter of 2017, starting with North America, and then also discuss some of our largest international markets. Our revenues in North America increased 1% in the first quarter with higher sales from the distributor acquisition more than offsetting lower Engine and Components sales to the North American heavy and medium-duty truck markets. Industry production of North American heavy-duty trucks declined by 20% in the first quarter of 2017 while our sales of heavy-duty engines declined only 12% as our market share for the quarter improved to 32.7% from 29% a year ago.","Production of medium-duty trucks declined 6% in the first quarter, while our engine shipments declined 9% with our market share of 72%, down from 76% a year ago. Our shipments of engines to pickup truck customers in North America declined by 1%, but we remain on course for a strong year in this segment. Engine sales to the construction market in North America increased 10% in the first quarter, reflecting increased customer confidence after a challenging couple of years in which the market had to absorb an excess supply of used equipment, resulting from the slowdown in oil and gas markets.","Shipments to high horsepower markets in North America increased by 42% compared to very weak levels last year due to the higher sales to oil and gas and rail customers. Revenues for power generation declined by 1% with growth in consumer markets offset by lower sales to data center customers.","Our international revenues increased by 17% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a year ago. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.1 billion, an increase of 49% due to growth in our on-highway and construction businesses. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China increased by 73% for the first quarter, driven by a higher pace of infrastructure investment and truck replacement in response to overloading regulations introduced last year.","Our market share for the first quarter was 14%, down from 15% last year. Sales of our ISG heavy-duty engine to Foton grew in line with the market, but growth in Dongfeng's truck sales were not as strong as the industry as a whole. Last quarter, we discussed actions that we were taking to improve performance of the ISG engine in some applications, and we have made good progress in executing on our plans to support customers who were able to reduce the cost of these actions below our initial expectations.","Shipments of our light-duty engines in China increased by 22%, well ahead of the overall market growth of 12% as Foton continued to increase the proportion of its trucks powered by our joint venture engines, displacing local competitor engines. Our market share during the quarter was 7.6%, up a further 60 basis points from a year ago. Demand for construction equipment doubled from a year ago in China in response to stronger infrastructure investment. Our construction engine volumes increased by over 300% as OEMs ramped up their production of excavators. Revenues for our Power Systems business in China declined by 3% due to continued weakness in power generation, marine and mining markets.","First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $408 million, a 5% increase from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production declined 3% compared to a strong quarter a year ago while our market share increased 1% to 39%. Revenues for power generation equipment increased by 9%. We also grew sales in marine and rail markets as a result of growing infrastructure investment. In Brazil, our revenues increased by 13%, all driven by appreciation of the real as end markets remained very weak.","Now let me provide an overall outlook for 2017 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. We are now forecasting total company revenues for 2017 to increase 4% to 7%, higher than our prior guidance of flat to down 5% with a modest increase in our projections for a number of regions and end markets.","Industry production for heavy-duty trucks in North America is projected to be 195,000 units, up from our prior forecast of 178,000 units in 2017, but still down 3% from last year and below replacement demand. We expect our full year market share to be between 29% and 32%, unchanged from our previous projection. In the medium-duty truck market, we have raised our outlook for the market size to be 112,000 units, up 4% to 2016 and up from our prior guidance. We project our market share to be in the range of 73% to 75%, consistent with our view of three months ago. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to increase 1% for the full year.","In China, we expect full year domestic revenues, including joint ventures, to grow 11% compared to our previous guidance of up 3%. We have raised our outlook for demand for medium- and heavy-duty truck markets to exceed 1 million units, a 7% increase from our previous guidance. Our forecast anticipates that demand for trucks will slow from first quarter levels due to normal seasonality and a slowing of truck replacement. We expect the light-duty truck market to grow 3% in 2017 compared to our previous guidance of flat. Our market share in the medium- and heavy-duty truck markets is expected to be 15%, flat with 2016. And in light duty, we expect to see our share exceed 8%, up from 7% last year. We currently project 10% to 15% growth in off-highway markets in China compared to our previous guidance of up just 5%, primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment.","In India, we expect total revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat compared to our previous projection of a 5% decline, due mainly to a stronger rupee. We currently project 5% growth in off-highway markets, offset by an expected 10% to 15% decline in truck demand.","In Brazil, we expect truck production to be flat in 2017, unchanged from our previous projection with no clear signs of improvement in the near-term. We expect our global high horsepower engine shipments to grow 10% to 15% compared to our previous guidance of no growth in 2017. Demand has picked up in mining and oil and gas markets compared to extremely weak levels last year.","In summary, we expect full year sales to increase 4% to 7% compared to our prior forecast of flat to down 5%. We are experiencing an increase in some commodity costs, which we are working hard to mitigate. Rising commodity costs should be supportive of growing demand for capital goods, but in the near-term, will likely reduce our net material cost savings in the second half of the year compared to our original expectations. Our forecast for EBIT is now in the range of 11.75% to 12.5%, above our previous guidance of 11% to 11.5% of sales. During the quarter, we returned $222 million in cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plans to return at least 50% of our operating cash flow this year. We're off to a solid start, and I look forward to updating you again next quarter.","Now, let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a review of the company's first quarter financial results before discussing the performance of each of the four operating segments in more detail. I will then provide an update on our outlook for the rest of the year.","First quarter revenues were $4.6 billion, an increase of 7% from a year ago after six consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines, the longest period of year-over-year revenue declines since 2002. Sales in North America, which represented 57% of our first quarter revenues, increased 1% from a year ago, primarily due to increased revenue in the Distribution segment, which more than offset lower Engine and Component revenues due to a decline in heavy- and medium-duty truck production compared to the previous year. International sales improved by 17% from a year ago, primarily due to increased sales in China and in Europe, which offset weakness in the Middle East.","Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, unchanged from last year. The benefits from increased volumes were offset by warranty expense, which was a 50-basis-point headwind, as we increased accrual rates with new engine introductions and recorded an unfavorable change in estimates on older engines. Selling, admin and research and development costs of $695 million or 15.1% of sales decreased as a percent of sales by 20 basis points but increased by $39 million from a year ago mainly due to higher compensation expense.","Joint venture income of $108 million increased by $36 million compared to a year ago as a result of strong market demand in China for both on- and off-highway equipment. Earnings before interest and tax improved to $566 million or 12.3% of sales in the quarter compared to 11.3% a year ago, and this reflects a 28% incremental EBIT margin. Net earnings for the quarter were $396 million or $2.36 per diluted share compared to $1.87 from a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.1%, in line with the full year guidance of 26%.","Moving on to the operating segments, let me summarize their performance in the quarter, and then I will review the company's revenue and profitability expectations for the full year and conclude with some comments on cash flow for the quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 2% from last year. International revenues were up 11%, primarily due to growth in off-highway markets in China. Revenues in North America declined by 1% due to lower on-highway revenues as a result of the lower production of heavy-duty trucks.","Segment EBIT in the first quarter was $229 million or 11.3% of sales. This compares to 10% of sales from a year ago. The margin improvement was driven by higher joint venture income, favorable pricing and material cost savings, which were partially offset by higher warranty costs and an increase in current product support expense to support recently launched products. For the Engine segment in 2017, we now expect revenues to be up 2% to 6% compared to our previous guidance of down 3% to 6% due to an improved outlook in most of our markets. Our forecast for EBIT margins is to be in the range of 10.25% to 11.25% of sales compared to 9.5% to 10.5% previously.","For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.6 billion, which increased 12% compared to last year. Organic sales for the quarter increased by 6%, and revenue from the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 added an additional 6%. The EBIT margin for the quarter was $100 million or 6.1% of sales compared to 5.9% a year ago. An improvement to margins from an increase in sales during the quarter was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs from integration of previous acquisitions.","For 2017, Distribution revenue is now projected to increase 4% to 8% compared to our previous guidance of flat to up 4% with the increase driven by improvements in off-highway markets and higher parts sales. We still expect EBIT margins to be in the range of 6% to 6.75% of sales as higher variable compensation and benefits offset improvements to operating margins.","For the Components segment, revenues were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, a 9% increase from a year ago. International revenues grew 25% primarily due to a 60% increase in sales in China, which more than offset a 2% decrease in North American revenues due to the lower heavy- and medium-duty international truck production. Segment EBIT was $179 million, or 13.3% of sales compared to 13.2% of sales a year ago. As mentioned in our previous call, we did incur additional expenses to support the launch of our Single Module aftertreatment system, but we were able to mitigate part of the cost we previously forecast, while still meeting our delivery commitments in the quarter.","For 2017, we now expect revenues to be up 6% to 10% compared to our prior guidance of a 2% to 6% decline. The change in guidance reflects stronger-than-anticipated demand in the China truck market and improved outlook for the North American heavy- and medium-duty truck market. EBIT is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5% of sales compared to 11% to 12% in our previous forecast.","In the Power Systems segment, first quarter revenues were $882 million, an increase of 9% from a year ago. The increase in revenues for the segment was driven primarily by a 28% increase in industrial markets, led by mining and oil and gas with growth in new engine and rebuild revenues. Global power generation markets remained weak despite a small revenue gain in the quarter. EBIT margins were 6.5% of sales in the quarter, up from 5.7% last year due to the increase in industrial engine shipments.","For 2017, we expect Power Systems segment revenues to be up 1% to 5% versus a previous guidance of flat to down 4% due to increased customer demand from mining and oil and gas engines in addition to higher parts sales. EBIT margins are still expected to be between 7% and 8% of sales with this segment experiencing a more significant increase in commodity costs than we anticipated at the start of the year.","For the company, we are raising our outlook for revenues to be up 4% to 7% versus our previous guidance of flat to down 5%. The increase is primarily due to improving off-highway market demand, stronger-than-anticipated growth in China and a more resilient North American truck market. Foreign currency headwinds are expected to reduce revenues by approximately $180 million, slightly lower than the $200 million impact in our previous forecast.","The guidance provided today does not include the impacts from the announcement of the Eaton-Cummins joint venture. We will provide the forecast upon regulatory approval of the deal. Income from our joint ventures is now expected to be relatively flat to last year. Our strong results in China will offset the impact of the acquisition of the last remaining North American distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016. We now expect EBIT margins to be between 11.75% and 12.5% for 2017, up from our previous forecast of between 11% and 11.5%. The increase in profitability reflects increased outlook for both the global off-highway markets and the North American truck market.","Finally, turning to cash flow, cash generated from operating activities for the first quarter was $379 million, which was a 42% increase from a year ago. We anticipate operating cash flow in 2017 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales. Capital expenditure during the quarter was $81 million, and we still expect our investments to be in the range of $500 million to $530 million this year. And as Tom said, in the first quarter, we returned $322 million to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. And for 2017, we plan to return at least 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders, in line with our long-term commitment.","Now, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Pat. And we're now ready to move to the Q&A section of the call. Please try and limit your call to one question and a related follow-up and then get back in the queue if there's time. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Morning, Steve.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of the visibility you have on oil and gas and mining rebuilds for the rest of the year. Clearly, (25:20) in the quarter, and an ideal scenario would be that you get these power and off-highway going at the same time as that you have on-highway. Could that be a scenario that we see later in the year?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Hey, Steven, this is Rich. Yeah, we're off to a good start on the oil and gas rebuilds. In fact, there are some relatively low numbers that it's up 300% right now, and it's pretty broad based. So we're seeing that kind of across geographies \u2013 although primarily North America, but across geographies in North America.","What we also saw in Q1 is some new orders for new frac rigs, and so that is a little less broad based. We've seen that with one or two customers. And that's the one kind of yet to be determined is kind of the rate of new versus putting idled equipment back to work. But I think the rebuild piece will continue through the year.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","And that's what you have baked in your 10% to 15% for high horsepower for the rest of the year?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Well, that's for engine shipment, Steve, not rebuilds. But the overall \u2013 it's embedded in the Power Systems guidance here.","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","(26:36).","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just, Tom, last quarter, you stated a lot of dealer inventory in construction in China. So, I guess, how surprised are you that the China construction was so strong? Was this further building of inventories or is it all getting deployed on projects? And then what does that imply for your second half expectations?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","It looks to be not an inventory build. It appears to be the \u2013 while the inventory is a little higher than what we thought, this seems to be, again, a little more broad based on the construction side. We were surprised by it, okay? It was not in our forecast. But there seems to be a little more sentiment, maybe not data, that says that this could continue on the construction side, in the excavator side, in particular.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Steve, utilization rates are definitely up, and so that's a good sign. That means people are using the equipment there in addition to buying some new. So that's a good sign. I think it's worth us being cautious just to see where dealer inventory levels are and to understand all that. But we definitely saw sales grew higher and we saw utilization rates higher, both of which are a good sign. The question is how lasting is it and how healthy are the dealers and how is the inventory looking? We've still got some more work to do to understand that, because, frankly, we were surprised by the uptick.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. I guess a couple questions. One relates to your full year guidance. When you guys guided last quarter, you said the first quarter should be the lightest for a number of different reasons. Yet if we look at your margins for the quarter, they came in at like 12.3%, which is the midpoint of your full year guide. So something doesn't seem right. Maybe we're conservative, maybe the cost on ISG and the single modular treatment system was lower in the first quarter than we thought. So, if you could just sort of walk me through the guidance and whether there's potential for upside.","And then, I guess, my second question, Tom, specifically on the Eaton-Cummins joint venture, just a little more color, I guess, I'm looking at it. You're paying $600 million for potentially $900 million or more revenues five years out, which just seems, I don't know, light or expensive to me. So are there incremental positives that perhaps the market is under appreciating? And I don't know what's your...","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jamie, this is Pat. Let me \u2013 Sorry, let me...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sorry, I don't know what your assumptions are behind that. So sorry, go ahead.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Sorry, I interrupted you there. Let me take the first question, and then Tom can take that second question. I didn't mean to interrupt it. So on full year guidance, the first quarter included very strong earnings from China and our China JVs in particular. Traditionally, we tend to see a mix of 60% of China earnings in the first half of the year, 40% in back half of the year. We are a little bit hesitant to assume that the strong demand that we're seeing through the first quarter and we probably expect to see in the second quarter will continue into the second half of the year. It's close to a year now since overloading regulations come into play. That's clearly been a factor in driving that.","So we are assuming second half earnings will drop in China from first half and that's probably the number one reason why we are \u2013 maybe our guidance shows a little bit weaker in the second half of the year. But the other fact that is material cost, which drove 80 basis points of margin improvement in the first half of the year as we see rising commodity prices through the year. For the full year, we expect that to be nearly in line with the 30 basis point improvement. So other than that, everything else should continue much the same as what we've seen so far.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Jamie, thanks for your question on the Eaton JV. So here's the \u2013 and again in simple terms, we're convinced that leading powertrains will be integrated. That will be industry-wide, that will be whether you have a diesel engine driving at a fuel cell or a battery. We think integrated powertrains will win and that's basically performance, quality, all the elements that we think make a difference.","And as you know, as a company, we are continuing to invest in the components that we think are essential to driving performance in fuel efficiency and emissions for powertrains because we think that's what made us successful in differentiating in the market of integrateds with powertrain focus. So we think we have to have an integrated powertrain. So, as we discussed in New York a couple of years ago, that we've been focused on figuring out ways to do that, and we look at every single option available to us and explore every option in detail.","And we felt like, given the consolidation of the industry, it's already highly consolidated and it's going to consolidate further. Both strategically and technically, we needed to figure out a move into powertrains and our view is that this by far the most attractive entry point that we could find. And we look at everything. And so we feel very good about this. Good because we think we're getting leading technology that's implementable right now, that we are partnering with a customer \u2013 I mean a partner that we feel we have a strong \u2013 we share cultural values; we operated successfully in the past; we know each other well so we can ramp up very quickly.","And lastly, we see opportunities for growth outside of the base plan internationally as those markets begin to ramp up into automated transmission. And then we think by providing a better powertrain, our view is we can grow engine share. And, of course, that's the big variable in the mix. There is a variable that's hard to calculate in here is what happens to our engine share with and without this joint venture, and we are 100% convinced that when you start looking at that, this deal looks not only attractive to Cummins but essential to our strategy.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Is there any way you could provide a range of how \u2013 the range of where market share should go? Like just variability around that so that joint venture could make more sense. Can 30% go to 40% in heavy-duty? Or is it China? I am just trying to think about how to justify the investment?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","I think we will as the joint venture begin to talk about what our growth plans are, et cetera. We need to complete the transaction. As you know, there's a series of regulatory approvals in front of us. And before those are completed, we just need to say the main things and then do our legal work. When that's done, I believe, we'll be able to say a lot more about what we plan to do together. And, again, I'm a 100% convinced that the shareholders of Cummins will believe that this was a essential move and a good move for the company. And I believe the shareholders of Eaton will agree with that. So I feel, again, very excited about this joint venture.","And again, just from a financial point of view, it doesn't take a lot of math to figure out how this could be attractive for Cummins. Again, you basically have to understand that or agree with the basic premise that this is essential to being successful in powertrain. But once you do that, I think it works \u2013 it's pretty straightforward.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's fair. Thank you. I will get back in queue.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. It's still me.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hello, Ann.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Ann. We just (34:42) you...","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Could you do us a favor and just comment a little bit more on pricing versus input costs? Could you quantify the impact of higher input costs and when you would expect to be able to offset the higher input costs?","And then as a follow-up, I get a lot of questions recently on penetration of electric vehicles and autonomous driving et cetera, et cetera. Could you just maybe comment on Cummins' perception of the penetration of electric vehicles particularly in long hauls? Thank you.","Mark Andrew Smith - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, good morning, Ann. This is Mark. So on pricing we've probably been closer to net neutral for the year on pricing across our various segments. Where we're having the biggest challenge is, as Pat mentioned, the costs are rising particularly in the Power Systems business, and as you know, we're experiencing still weak global demand in power generation. So, when you've got persistent weak demand, you've got that balancing act to choose how much you want to press the price lever. So we'll continue to evaluate what options we've got there. And as we said, hopefully that's going to be supportive of growing capital goods demand going forward. But definitely, less of a net favorable in the second half than the first half.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","And, Ann, this is Tom. Thanks for your question on the technology area. So not surprising, I guess, in our strategy work, we've done several years of work now developing both projections and analyses of substitute technologies that might play a role in our end markets. And we are convinced that electrification, specifically, will substitute in some of our applications over a period of time. And again, our projections for that depend in large degree, as you guess, on how battery and power electronics cost come down and performance goes up, especially the energy side, how much I can store? And then also, the cost of fuel and other kinds of environmental-related costs, but assuming most of our scenarios come up with electrification playing a significant role in cities, especially stop-and-go applications, bus, maybe refuse, pickup and delivery trucks, we think it'll play a significant role, and especially after it makes a major substitution in cars since that will drop cost and increase volume. And we intend, by the way, to compete in that business and win.","So we've already launched an electrification business development area in our company. It's people dedicated to not only launching fully electrified powertrains, but are currently selling those powertrains to some customers. So we intend to compete with and these are our markets; buses, refuse vehicles, we are the leader in those markets and we intend to be the leader in those markets when they're electrified. And we already have pilot products running with fully electrified powertrains designed and built by Cummins.","So we will compete in those markets, and we believe we'll win. And so the fully integrated powertrains, as I was mentioning to Jamie, we think are Cummins future, be they diesel driven, battery driven or other. We also think, by the way, fuel cells could potentially play a role in longer haul. One of the challenges for battery driven longer-haul trucks, which is I think might be obvious in your question, is that you use most of the weight that you would otherwise carry goods for batteries. And so right now, it doesn't look like that's a winner based on the technologies that are available now or in the foreseeable future. Whereas fuel cells, I think, do a better job of \u2013 they are still heavier than diesel because the fuel is necessary but closer, and some of the same advantages as other electrified powertrains. But there's a long way of development to go on fuel cells. They're not nearly as close from a cost, performance and quality point of view as batteries are.","So both of those technologies, by the way, I mentioned electrified powertrains and fuel cells, are feasible and could play a role. But both are relatively modest sellers today even in the car side. So it'll be a number of years. We know from the natural gas front that even when things are very attractive, it takes a long time to substitute in mature markets. And right now, neither of those technologies is attractive. So there's work to do to make them more attractive, and then there's work to make them work in commercial operations in a sensible way that will work for commercial operators who, as you know, are very sensitive to capital returns. So I think they'll definitely play a role. It's going to be sometime before the markets are large enough to make a big dent, but we intend to lead in both. And we are putting together the technologies and the customers to be able to do that.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. I'll get back in line in the interest of time. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Tom, for your significant joint ventures in the past, you folks have been able to deliver mid-teen margins by leveraging SG&A. And I'm wondering in the Eaton-Cummins joint venture, do you folks expect a similar profile once that business ramps, or is there anything structurally different on the joint venture either in pass-through cost or R&D intensity that we should keep in mind as we move towards hopefully the five-year revenue targets that you laid out?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Absolutely the same approach, Jerry. As you said, this one because we have a lot of upfront development to get the products to market. It will be heavier on R&D expense in the early years, but as the revenues ramp up, we expect to be at very similar margins. And again that's a little bit why we feel confident with this. It looks like a lot of things we've done before with a partner that we really like working with and know very well. So we have every expectation we'll be able to operate at similar margins or JVs we've operated before.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And Tom, how back-end loaded is the ramp? Do we have to look for a significant new product introduction cycle, so we see a bigger contribution in terms of the growth rate 2020, 2021, or can we see it kick-in potentially sooner?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","There's at least 18 to 24 months of developments dominating the expense ratios in the joint ventures. So that is a while. I mean, from that point of view, we have a lot of work in front of us to do. Again, a lot of the work has been done on the base transmission, but there's a lot of work to do for integrating with customers. And I think that's again likely to take us 18 to 24 months, and then we'll start to see the ramp up more significantly.","So, again, we'll be able to say more about that as the joint venture closes and then we can talk a little bit more about who our customers are and all those sorts of things. But I think just generally speaking, it's a first couple years look more like development, and there will be sales, of course, but there's going to be pretty heavy development costs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, Rich, China Foton comments that you folks had warranty issues that you're working through last quarter. Can you give us an update on how the business performed this quarter? Were there any warranty or product introduction-related costs and the outlook for those costs over the next couple of quarters?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Jerry. Just to remind you, we talked about we had some specific issues in some different regions or different markets or duty cycles we're working through and incurred some costs. And the good news is we've worked through those faster and actually been able to reduce the cost of doing that. Because as I talked last quarter, I said we've been living with this through the first half of the year. And so we're really pleased that we got through it well, took care of customers and generally, by the end of Q1, have any unusual costs behind us.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks guys.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Morning, Ross.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Morning.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was just wondering if you could talk about capital allocation from here. I mean, you made an investment that you think is very attractive, but you haven't added the leverage that you initially identified you'd be willing to consider. So should we be anticipating other acquisitions from here? Are those leverage targets that you talked about a year, year-and-a-half ago still kind of in the game plan, or is it just that valuations across a lot of the areas of interest have become too expensive, and we should sort of expect Cummins to go back to returning more cash?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Ross. So the answer is, we are still pursuing our strategic areas that we talked about a year-and-a-half ago. I think maybe as you saw in the Eaton joint venture and our powertrain expansion, we think to do a good deal takes more time than to do a lousy deal, or at least that's what we're seeing in the market.","To your point, valuations are pretty high in some places. So, in typical fashion, to do the things that we think add strategic growth and profitable growth to Cummins and good capital returns just turns out are taking us some effort to work through. And, I guess, that's probably to be expected.","But we intend to continue to pursue those areas. And, yes, the leverage targets we laid out to you are still what we think make sense for the company. We haven't changed that at all. And we have a number of things that we're pursuing right now that we hope to be able to turn into attractive projects for the company.","But as you suggested by your question, we looked through a lot of things that turned out to be less attractive, frankly, from a return point of view and, therefore, passed them by. So I think we are active still. I'm confident that we're going to find other good things that will add to the growth and profitability and return profile of the company. But it's taken some effort and some work to grind through those, and we're still active in them though.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just as a follow-up to that, I mean, there were some news reports a couple of months ago about the potential sale of, I believe, your filtration business. And I don't know if you can comment on that. But if you can't, just wondering, is there any reason to anticipate that Cummins would ever consider a sizable divestiture, if you don't actually have a larger target on the horizon given the strength of your balance sheet today?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. That's a great question, Ross. And the filtration business is not for sale as we said then. So I'll just repeat that. The second thing is that we would not link our sale of a division with the need to acquire another division \u2013 another business.","And the reason is, as you remember from the strategy discussion a year-and-a-half ago, we have enough debt capacity and capital raising ability to acquire a company that we would be interested in, at least the ones that we're considering, we have enough with our existing balance sheet and cash. So we don't see that as necessary.","We would consider selling parts of Cummins in the same way as we always have, which is, if we believe that a division is no longer strategically essential to the company in a sense that it's not making the whole greater than the sum, which has been kind of the way we've thought about our business for a long time. If it's not doing that, then if we think the shareholders would benefit from the price that we can get versus what we can generate internally, we'd sell it.","And we do a review of our big divisions across the company every single year with that exactly in mind. So we believe that we owe the shareholders that work to say, is the current portfolio of Cummins best owned by Cummins and by the shareholders or should we sell something to realize value and then put it to work in a new and better way?","So, we go through our divisions and look at those. And so we always do that, and if one of them ended up in that box that said it's as not as strategic and we think we can get a better valuation, at the very least we would go test to see if we can get that valuation. And if we could, we would sell it. And if we couldn't, we would not. So that's something we do as a matter of strategic practice.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Morning, Nicole.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So my first question is around mining. So I thought it was good that you guys went through what's going on within oil and gas for rebuild versus OE. But we've heard from some of the mining OEMs that OE activity is actually picking up a bit. So I'm just curious if you're seeing something similar.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, Nicole, we are. So, again, like in oil and gas, we're seeing it first on parts, which we started to see, in fact, last year and that's continued. So our parts sales are up double-digits in the high horsepower space, mostly driven by mining and oil and gas. And so from the Engine side or the OEM side, we're now projecting up 10% to 20%.","So we are seeing some of that kind of come through and a little less of the idled equipment to deal with that we have in the oil and gas business. So early days, commodity prices are up, and so there's certainly more activity and more discussion, and we're starting to see it in some orders.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks. That's really helpful. And I guess my second question is just around China. So last quarter you guys talked about a competitive pricing environment within China truck. I'm just curious if that's continued into the first quarter or if you've seen that ease?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","I don't think it's impacting our results right now. So probably there hasn't been significant change at this point in time.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah, most of that was related to market share acquisition by one OEM or the other (49:22) that launched some new models and we're trying to acquire. And with the new regulations that are requiring on overloading, that are requiring some fleets to actually purchase new trucks, our expectation is that pricing competition will ease.","But, frankly, we were even surprised by the size of the growth in the truck market in the first quarter as we were with the excavators. So we have some work to do to understand how well that's going to hold up and how pricing markets are just reflecting back on the first quarter. But, right now, we expect the pricing to ease under the circumstances.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I'm going to pass it on.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. And Tom, I apologize, I'm a little bit slow this morning. But I want to make sure I understand, with this Cummins-Eaton joint venture, what does this allow you to do that you weren't doing before? Because I think you already had a pretty close relationship with them previously, and I'm curious why you felt the need to sort of allocate all this capital to this?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, Steve. From our point of view, like with most of our Components businesses, we always have the choice of purchasing outside or bringing something inside. And we typically bring it inside if two conditions are right.","One is that we believe that because of our knowledge of engines and systems, we think we can make a better product for ourselves and for others. And we believe that's true now. We believe that in integrated powertrains that we can impact the design of the transmission in a positive way by what we bring to the table in terms of engines.","Now, we can, of course, do that through partnerships. It's just not as efficient and not as effective to do. So when we think we can make a big positive impact technically, then we want to bring them in.","Second thing is that we believe in this case that together we can offer an integrated powertrain with features that are harder to negotiate on when it's commercial negotiation. We're adding software features, control features, which frankly are difficult to price across markets. And we want to make sure that we can do that and win market share in the market and come up with an effective package that includes those features. And it was just hard to do so with a commercial arrangement only.","I think, on the same front, we want to invest in those technologies and features. But we want to make sure that our partners felt that investing was going to earn a return for them, and it wasn't as clear over the long run that they felt that way. So to make sure we could add the technology we want, develop the features, price for the features, et cetera, and to make sure that we can offer a better powertrain, we felt the need to bring them in.","And, again, as I mentioned to Jamie, we spent a long time understanding this, looking at different ways to do it, everything from developing our own solutions to acquisitions and joint ventures in different parts of the world with different partners. And we decided in the end that this was by far the best choice. And I think, from Eaton's point of view, they see it in much the same way.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Good. Yeah, that definitely helps. And then secondarily, I'm just curious, you talked a little bit about electric drivetrains and fuel cells and so forth and interesting to hear that you're already sort of testing this stuff.","But I'm wondering if you feel like you have internally that kind of core competency that you need there or is this a situation where, ultimately, you're going to have to either acquire or joint venture or something in order to be able to do what you need to do with those alternative type drivetrains?","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's much like the situation we just spoke about. Our view is that that we have the capability to integrate today just as we had the capability to integrate a powertrain before. But we will likely want to acquire some subsystems of electrified powertrain to make sure that we not only can do it, but we can do it better than everybody else.","So I think it's right what you said that the capabilities that we need to outperform everybody else, we will have to acquire or develop those capabilities in-house for some of the subsystems, things like battery control, packaging, power electronics, especially for the size of the commercial vehicles, these are things where there are suppliers today in the market, but those technologies will develop the fastest.","And our ability to have the best ones of those subsystem technologies and integrating the best will certainly require us to invest more in those areas. Whether that means acquiring a company or joint venturing again or otherwise hiring and developing our own will remain to be seen. But we are active in all those spaces to figure out exactly that.","I mean, again, there's time in front of us, so we can produce one now and a good one, but we want be the winner, as I mentioned, which means we're going to have to be expert in some of those subsystem technologies just as we are with diesel, just as we are with natural gas.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for the discussion on the sort of forward thinking strategy. It's very interesting. Tom, if you were rumored to be spending two-thirds of your time on acquisitions over the past year or two, do you anticipate that to be just as intense now or does the Eaton JV fill a big enough hole that there's just a little bit less?","And, secondarily, and you've touched on this, but I mean, do you see more opportunity or more need in acquiring things related to hydrogen or related to electric or related to whatever versus maybe the upside of acquiring pools of revenue where you can operate the businesses differently or better? Thanks.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Thanks, Rob. I thought where you were going with that is, since you spent two-thirds of your time and all you've got is one joint venture to show for it, that you weren't sure the time was well spent. But I'll just assume you didn't mean that. So, yeah, there is no change in my focus in terms of time.","So this joint venture with Eaton is a really important strategic move, as I mentioned. We feel very good about it. It only addresses a portion of the strategy areas that we discussed, and so we have a lot more work to go. So I have not slowed down at all. And the answer to your question about which of those is more interesting to us is both.","So the way that I guess I think about it is that we have things that we need to do to acquire capabilities in order to stay the course. In order to be the leading company in what we do now, we have to continue to develop technologies and, in some cases, joint venture and acquire technologies in some of these new technology areas and things like that, as we were just talking to Steve and earlier with Jamie.","But we also need to look at opportunities to leverage our capabilities that we have now and potentially expand into new revenue pools. Both of those things are essential for our growth and development as a company. So we're thinking of growth and capability building both as part of our strategic effort, and I think the Eaton joint venture demonstrates some of both. And you'll see us continue to look at both as essential to the company's future.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Good morning, Andy. I wondered if you were going to make it in.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in there. Just a couple of follow-ups. The JV stuff has been asked and answered several different ways. But in the near term, it looks like your Power Systems outlook is not anticipating much over the next three quarters, and part of that might be this uncertainty that you described with respect to China. But I'm wondering why not more of a follow through given your comments on oil and gas and mining?","Rich Freeland - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, Andy, it's Rich. Well, again, I think what we have seen is, in that Power System area, our parts sales are going to be up 16% this year. So we're seeing this kind of broad-based activity, which activity is a precursor hopefully to new equipment going in. And so, until we see it, I guess, we're not putting that in the forecast.","And like I talked on oil and gas, we've even had some indications that this was kind of a onetime blip until some equipment gets rebuilt and refurbished. So we're just paying attention. I think there needs to be some prolonged commodity prices staying higher for a bit longer so that people are going to make the capital investment.","And so when we see that, we'll put it in the forecast. And, lastly, you know we're prepared for it. So we've got capacity in place. And one of the things we always try to do is being the best at responding when it comes back. And even if we get surprised and it comes back quickly, which it does sometimes, we'll be ready for that.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","The other challenge is, Andy, at these lower levels, even though mining and oil and gas are improving, still two-thirds of the revenue are tied to power gen, which at least for now will remain fairly (59:15) muted. So that and the commodity cost \u2013 these are the factors we are concerned with (59:20) in the outlook for this year.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then another detailed question on warranty, the 50-basis-point headwind that you called out in the quarter and maybe you've discussed this, but I missed it. How much of that was the adjustment, meaning the one-time, and how much is kind of go forward for the rest of the year?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Well, the one-time adjustment, Andy, was probably close to two-thirds of that, maybe a little bit more. So that's one time, not going to repeat through the rest of the year. We did anticipate higher expense in the first quarter as we launched the new engines, and we do increase our rates when we launch our engines. I think you'll see warranty come down in the second quarter to more normalized levels, so to speak.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Cummins, Inc.","Thank you.","Norman Thomas Linebarger - Cummins, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, everyone.

Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for that warm introduction, Mark. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter results and provide an update on our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the full year. Revenues for the first quarter were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to the first quarter of 2015. First quarter EBIT was $484 million or 11.3% of sales compared to $562 million or 11.9% in the same quarter last year. Our decremental EBIT margin was 19% as the benefits of restructuring actions, improved quality, lower material costs, all helped mitigate the impact of lower sales.","Engine business revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year due to lower demand in North American heavy-duty truck market and weaker sales to global off-highway and Power Generation markets. Shipments of high horsepower engines declined by 20% and reached the second lowest quarterly total in the past 12 years. EBIT of 8.6% of sales declined from 9.7% a year ago as strong operational performance from our manufacturing plants and benefits from restructuring material cost reduction initiatives and improved quality were offset by the impact of lower volumes.","Revenues in our Components segment decreased 5% from a year ago with lower demand in North America more than offsetting growth in China. Sales in China increased by 27%, outpacing our end markets as we continue to capitalize on tighter emissions regulations and capture increased content and market share. EBIT of $173 million or 14% of sales declined from $195 million or 15%, due to the impact of lower volumes and currency. Distribution revenues decreased by 1% compared to the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact of currency and weaker sales to off-highway markets more than offset the positive impact of acquisitions made in the second half of 2015. EBIT for the quarter of 6.5% improved from 6% a year ago, with operational improvements more than offsetting the negative impact of currency.","In the Power Generation business, revenues declined by 19% year-over-year, with weaker sales in most markets, especially Asia and Latin America. EBIT declined from 7.2% to 5.6% as the impact of lower sales more than offset a 17% reduction in operating expenses. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter for revenues in the Power Generation business and we do expect sales and margins to improve in subsequent quarters due to improving order intake in Europe and North America. Over the past three months, we've announced plans to further rationalize our manufacturing footprint including the closure of an alternator facility in Mexico, a generator assembly plant in India, and the exit of generator assembly operations in Kent, England. These actions will start to generate savings in the second half of 2016 with additional savings in 2017 and 2018 and should help us stay ahead of any further risk of declining volumes.","Now, I will comment on some of our key markets, starting with North America. Our revenues in North America declined by 10% in the first quarter, due to weaker demand in on-highway markets especially heavy-duty trucks. Shipments to the North American heavy-duty truck market exceeded 16,000 units in the first quarter, a decrease of 33% from 2015 levels. First quarter market share was 29%. We have lowered our projection for full-year industry production to 210,000 units, at the midpoint of our guidance, down from our prior forecast of 22,000 units as slower freight activity has contributed to weak industry orders and higher dealer inventories. We currently expect our market share to be in the range of 27% to 30% for the year, down from our prior forecast of 30% to 33%, as Daimler has reduced the number of engines that it plans to order from Cummins and Navistar's market share has declined.","In the medium-duty truck market, we delivered almost 22,000 engines in the first quarter, down 13% from last year. Our market share in the first quarter was 78%, down from 80% a year ago when we completed our final shipments to Ford. We expect full-year industry production to be 123,000 units, down 1% compared to 2015, and our market share to be 75%, unchanged from our prior forecast. Our engine shipments to North American pickup truck OEMs increased by 29% in the first quarter. Shipments to Chrysler increased 9% to more than 34,000 units, the highest first quarter volume in 10 years. Sales also increased to Nissan following the launch of our 5-liter V8 engine in the fourth quarter last year. We currently expect our revenues in the pickup segment to increase by 12% in 2015, unchanged from our prior forecast.","Our Engine revenues from the North American construction market decreased by 9% compared to the first quarter last year. While housing and commercial construction activity remains positive, demand for new equipment from rental companies has declined due to a slowdown in business in the oil and gas market. Power Generation revenues declined 4% in North America in the first quarter due to lower orders from data center customers. We expect full-year revenues in North America to be flat to up 2% as order rates have improved this year following the weak close to 2015.","Our international revenues declined by 8% year-over-year, with weaker sales in Latin America and Asia, driving the decline. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $767 million, a decrease of 5% due to the negative impact of the depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and weaker demand for Power Generation equipment. Industry demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks in China increased by 9% in the first quarter. We continue to increase our penetration at Foton, which is now at 74%, up from 55% a year ago, and at Dongfeng, which","is up more than 5% to 50%.","Our overall market share was over 15% in the first quarter, down slightly from a year ago, as both Dongfeng and Foton adopted a more cautious start to the year than some of their competitors and under produced relative to the overall industry. We still expect that our share will reach 18% for the year as our partners increased production and sales more in line with the industry and our penetration continues to grow. We currently forecast full-year industry sales to decline by 4%, unchanged from our previous forecast. Industry demand for the first quarter was stronger than expected, but visibility to demand in the second half is limited. We believe it is prudent to be cautious about market improvement.","Shipments of our light-duty engines in China grew 9% in the first quarter, compared to 3% decline for the overall market as the increased penetration at Foton is displacing local competitor engines. Our share of the overall market reached 7% in the first quarter, up from 6% a year ago. We currently project industry sales to decline by 4% for the year, again unchanged from three months ago.","Our Power Generation revenues decreased by 27% year-over-year compared to a strong quarter a year ago. Sales weakened in the second half of 2015 as the industrial economy slowed and we haven't seen any signs of improvement yet. Industry sales of excavators in China increased by 15% in the first quarter as OE dealers pushed sales of Tier II inventory ahead of the transition to Tier III emission standards that came into force in April. Overall numbers of excavators sold, though, remains low, and while there is little downside risk left, there is no obvious catalyst for significant growth in the near term.","Full-year revenues in China across all segments, including joint ventures, are expected to be flat for the year, consistent with our view three months ago with no major changes to any of our market assumptions. First quarter revenues in India including joint ventures were $390 million, up 7% year-over-year primarily due to recovery in the Indian truck market.","Industry demand in the truck market increased 25% compared to the first quarter a year ago as the economy continues to improve. Our market share in the first quarter was 38%, down from 39% due to stronger growth in sales of vehicles below 10 tons in weight where our penetration in the market is lower. We now expect industry truck production to increase 10% for the year, up from our prior forecast of 8% growth.","Power Generation revenues in India declined 1% in the first quarter, with a weaker rupee offsetting 3% growth in volumes. We currently project full-year revenues, including joint ventures, to be flat to up 2%, with higher domestic volumes largely offset by the depreciation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar.","First quarter revenues in Brazil were $72 million, down 42% from the first quarter last year with the economy in recession and the real having to depreciate a further 16% against the U.S. dollar. Industry truck production fell 36% year-over-year while our engine shipments declined 35%. Revenues in all of our businesses were lower than a year ago due to the economic challenges in the region. We currently expect a full-year decline of 20% industry truck production with slightly easier comparisons to come in the second half of the year.","Let me now make a few comments on high horsepower markets. As I said in my opening remarks, volumes are extremely weak with the first quarter's volumes down 20% due to lower demand in commercial marine, mining and power generation markets. New orders in the U.S. oil and gas markets are very scarce. We expect full-year shipments of high horsepower engines to decline by 6% helped by growth in sales of our new QSK95 liter engine and easier comparisons in the second half of the year. We were very pleased to receive EPA Tier IV final certification for our QSK95 engine for rail applications recently, allowing us to win some important business in the high-speed passenger rail market.","In summary, we currently expect company revenues to decrease between 5% and 9% for the year, unchanged from three months ago. We did lower our outlook for heavy-duty truck production in North America, offset by an additional North American distributor acquisition and a less negative impact from currency in our forecast from three months ago. We expect EBIT to be in the range of 11.6% to 12.2% for the year, consistent with our prior forecast. We made solid progress in executing our cost reduction plans in the first quarter and every organization throughout Cummins remains focused on driving further productivity and cost improvements.","As one example, starting in April, we combined our Power Generation segment and higher horsepower Engine business into a newly formed segment called Power Systems. This reorganization will consolidate two businesses that are already strongly interdependent, and will allow us to streamline business and technical processes to accelerate innovation in those markets to grow market share and more efficiently manage our supply chain and manufacturing operations. Dave Crompton, previously leader of the Engine business, is now leading the new Power Systems segment; and Srikanth Padmanabhan heads the remaining engine business. Tracy Embree and Tony Satterthwaite will continue to lead Components and Distribution segments respectively.","Finally, we returned $745 million to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and the execution of our accelerated share repurchase program, consistent with our plan to return approximately 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2016.","Thank you for your interest today. Now, I'll turn over to Pat who will cover our first quarter results and full-year guidance in more detail.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. First quarter revenues were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 9% from the year ago with currency movements reducing our sales by 3%. Sales in North America, which represented 61% of our first quarter revenues, declined 10% from a year ago due primarily to lower demand in North American truck markets and continued weakness in industrial markets. International sales declined by 8% as a result of more demand in power generation and industrial markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.","Gross margins were 24.6% of sales, a decline of 80 basis points from a year ago. More volumes and an unfavorable product mix were partially offset by improvements in the field costs and warranty expenses and the benefits from the restructuring actions. Selling, admin and research and development expense of $656 million, or 15.3% of sales, decreased $56 million from a year ago after taking restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of last year. This is 20 basis points higher as a percentage of sales due to lower revenues.","Joint venture income of $72 million increased by $4 million compared to a year ago. Results in the first quarter a year ago included an impairment of our investment in an off-highway joint venture which did not repeat. Earnings before interest and tax were $484 million, or 11.3% of sales for the quarter compared to 11.9% of sales last year, and this equates to a decremental EBIT margin of 19%. Net earnings for the quarter were $321 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, compared to $387 million or $2.14 per share from a year ago. And the effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.4%.","I will now highlight the performance of the individual operating segments during the first quarter. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10% from last year. Industrial revenues declined by 13% from weak global demand for engines in marine, mining and oil and gas markets. On-highway revenues decreased 8% as production in the North American heavy-duty truck market declined compared to a year ago. Segment EBIT was $200 million, or 8.6% of sales compared to 9.7% last year. The benefits of the restructuring actions, material cost savings and more warranty expense were more than offset by lower volumes and an unfavorable product mix, primarily from a reduction in North American heavy truck and medium-duty truck volumes and the 20% reduction in high horsepower engine shipments.","For the Distribution segment, first quarter revenues were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4%, where organic sales declined by 5% with lower sales in North American off-highway markets more than offset in growth in China and in Europe. Acquisitions added 8% to revenues. EBIT margins for the quarter increased from 6% to 6.5% despite the 70 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Excluding the currency impact, margins improved by 120 basis points due to the benefits of restructuring, a stronger mix of aftermarket revenues and positive pricing.","The Components segment recorded sales of $1.2 billion, a decrease of 5% from a year ago. Sales in China increased in the first quarter by 27%, which helped partially offset the decline for more heavy-duty truck production in North America and the negative impact of foreign currency. Segment EBIT was $173 million, or 14% of sales compared to 15% of sales a year ago as lower volumes, unfavorable pricing, and currency more than offset the benefits of material cost reductions and restructuring actions.","In the Power Generation segment, first quarter sales were $550 million, down 19% from last year. International sales declined 27%, with Asia and South America experiencing the largest declines year-over-year due to the slow pace of investment and infrastructure projects. EBIT margins were 5.6% in the quarter, down from 7.2% last year. The benefits from the restructuring actions and more material costs partially offset the impact of the volume decline and helped keep decremental margins to 14%.","For the company, cash flow from operations was $263 million, better than the same quarter last year by $90 million due to lower working capital requirements as sales decline. As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we planned to return approximately 75% of cash generated from operations to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year. During the first quarter, we repurchased 4.9 million shares, primarily resulting from the previously announced $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. And we made dividend payments totaling $170 million, up from $140 million a year ago. Our cash and marketable securities balance declined in the quarter by $537 million primarily due to the share repurchases, the increased dividend payments of $170 million, and capital expenditure of $71 million.","As Tom mentioned, our guidance for our full-year performance is unchanged from three months ago. We are projecting total company revenues to be down 5% to 9% in 2016, lower levels of production in the North American on-highway markets, reduced demand globally for off-highway and power generation equipment and the negative impact of currency movements will drive the majority of the reduction in revenue. We expect some offset from the introduction of new products and increased revenue from distributor acquisitions. We expect EBIT margins of between 11.6% to 12.2% for 2016 and this compares to 12.5% for the year 2015, excluding the restructuring and impairment charges and represents a decremental EBIT margin of 25%. Benefits from material cost savings, restructuring and other actions will help mitigate the impact of lower volumes. Joint venture income is still expected to be flat compared to 2015.","We anticipate operating cash flow performance in 2016 will be within our long-term guidance range of 10% to 15% of sales, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million in 2016.","As Tom just discussed, effective April, we reorganized the company into new operating segments. We will issue restated results for the first quarter of 2016 and results for 2015 and 2014 to reflect the new operating segments before we report second quarter results. We will also issue full-year guidance for each of the new operating segments when we report second quarter results. And just to confirm, our current full-year guidance for the company is unchanged from three months ago.","Now, let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith - Vice President - Investor Relations","Thank you, Pat. And now we'll move to the Q&A section of the call. In respect of the feedback that many of you give me, I would like to ask that you limit your questions to one question and one related follow-up to give everybody the chance to ask a question. Thank you very much. And now we are ready for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","How is it going, guys?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Great, Joel.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Joel.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wonder if you could break out the impact of the warranty change in the quarter and are we getting toward more normalized levels, or is that going to be a number that continues to come down?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, so let me start on that one. So, warranty in the quarter was 2.2% of sales for the company. That was down from 2.6% last year. We are very comfortable with our full-year guidance of 2%. We're right on track with that. So no real difference from what we talked about three months ago, Joel, with regards to our outlook for warranty and improvements that we're seeing in the quality of the products throughout the company.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And just sort of a bigger picture question, it seems like Power Gen in general has been declining for kind of five years or so. Are we getting toward the end of that process or do you think there is still pockets of weakness out there that are going to last for the next two years or so?","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a good question, Joel. I don't really know the answer for sure but we've certainly been declining for much longer than we expected. I think that's why you've seen us take a succession of actions as opposed to just one bigger one which, in retrospect, would have been better. But we are, of course, preparing, as you can tell from these actions, for continued weakness for some time. I think that's why we decided to take further actions in the business. When we did our restructuring in the fourth quarter we did much more out of the Power Generation segment. We've now taken some plant \u2013 significant plant capacity out now with these three closures. So we are anticipating that we may be weak for some period. Hopefully, it improves faster than that, but we are prepared for it now after watching it decline for quite some time.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's great. Thank you very much. Okay, sorry.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Joel, if I could just add that the combination of our segments also, I think, gives us the opportunity now to begin to share overhead, drive improvement and efficiency in our processes between a large engine and the Power Gen business, which we think not only will help us in this tough time, but as the market springs back, we will be able to capture more share and respond more quickly. So, we think it's good for the short run to reduce costs but it also, I think, drives productivity and launch and ramp-up processes \u2013 are much better in the future.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Joel, this is Rich. Just one more comment is, I agree with Tom that the overall markets we are not too optimistic on, but we are restructuring like we talked about, but also creating some of our own growth opportunities. So most of the QSK95 sales that we have are into the Power Generation markets and they're into places we weren't there before. So trying to grow share at a time when the markets are low, we're having some good success.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's great. Thanks. And I'm not getting back in queue. Thank you very much.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Joel.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning. Maybe let's just go one step further with that line of questioning, and you've talked about, Tom, the margins in Power Gen getting better sequentially, I guess as \u2013 on the back of the restructuring that you've done already. If the markets don't recover and sort of stay in this depressed period \u2013 situation, where do we think these margins can kind of normalize just based on what you've done so far?","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we have some work to figure that out, Steve. Of course, we're \u2013 as you know, we've talked before about trying to get back to double-digit margins even in weaker markets. The markets have clearly fallen far more than any of us anticipated, and we've now taken a set of actions that we think normalizes us to these volumes. But we have some work to do to figure out where we think we can get margins at these levels. Clearly, it would help a bunch if revenues stabilized and stopped dropping. But it won't take us long to figure that out. The reason we still have work to do, as you know \u2013 we've just combined the segments.","We just figured out \u2013 we're just now eliminating some of the capacity and the comparison like-for-like will be a little complicated given the combination of segments. But expect us to be figuring that out pretty quickly and being able to set guidance for what the combined segment is and where we can take that in the future. But we're targeting all our segments at double-digit margins even in tough times. So we're trying to figure out how to get there again. There's no question that right now we're not there and we've got work to do to get there.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay, fair enough. And my follow-up is just more on the heavy-duty truck side. Can you just tell us what you're seeing relative to cadence as we go through the quarters? I assume we'll sort of march down again here in the second quarter, but then what happens in the second half if you have any visibility there? Do things stabilize? Does it turn up a little towards the end of the year, or do we just kind of continue the glide slope?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, the way we're looking at what's implied in our guidance is \u2013 actually it's a more downward pressure in the second half of the year. So if you just look at where we were in Q1, that would be a 224 market if you just multiply that by four. And so, I think actually Q2 holds in okay. And I just \u2013 past history says that with backlog down as low as it is, that we start to see some reductions in production in the second half of the year. There's just \u2013 we need order boards more full. That's a normal reaction that we see. So that's what we're putting into where we've taken the guidance down to 200 to 220 from the 220 range before. It's potentially some backend, but most of the reductions happened. We're down 33% already Q1 to Q1. And so most of the reduction is in place for what we saw in Q1.","Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Great. That's helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Hey, Jerry.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Tom, wondering if you could update us on your plans for the distribution back office integration now that you're on the tail end of wrapping up the acquisitions. Over what timeframe are you looking for to complete the back office integration at this point? And can you just calibrate us on the magnitude of cost savings opportunities we should look for when that plays out?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","I'll go ahead and take that, Jerry. And Tom can pitch in here. So, the piece that's behind us or a lot of it is most the back office work has been done. And so, we got a little more integration work to do there, but some of the bigger ones are still in front of us. So like the distribution, we talked about we had 15 distribution centers. We want to go to much smaller. We put two in place and we'll put three more in place this year. And so by over the next couple of years, we'll get that savings.","The purchasing savings, which is to build and we've got a really good purchasing process. You've seen the results we've had in the business of driving costs down. We're just now beginning that one. So, we talked about getting $100 million in synergies, kind of maybe $40 million to $50 million of it in cost and the rest in sales. We're just really getting started. We're probably a quarter away through that on the cost side and more to come over the next couple of years.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Jerry, I would just add that the processes that do the back office work, we have now set all those in place. There's still some follow-through work to do on those, but as Rich said, it's really now just a little bit of \u2013 it's just follow through on making sure that all that HR processes work and we're still acquiring a distributor, so each time we acquire, we got to do them again. The opportunities are still in front of us. So we've actually had to go negative before we've gone positive. We've added cost in various processes to make sure that everybody's on the same pay systems and pension systems. So we're going to see the benefits really starting to flow now. So we're pretty excited about those and both from a sales and support and service point of view for customers, but also on the cost and return side which Rich talked to you about.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And, Pat, can you talk about where Engine margins should count on the quarter relative to your internal expectations? Looks like decrementals were 25%. I think the full-year guide at the midpoint would imply 17% decremental, so an improvement. Is that in line with your plan? Then, I guess, what's the offset to the weaker volumes through heavy-duty truck based on your market and market share forecast?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I was really pleased with how the Engine segment came out in the quarter. I think decrementals \u2013 my numbers, Jerry, show the 20% decremental EBIT margin for the quarter, which in the face of a 33% reduction in North America heavy-duty truck volumes and a 20% reduction in high horsepower, I think, is a very, very good performance. Clearly, we're seeing benefits come through from material costs, we're seeing the benefits from the lower warranty expense I was talking to Joel about a few moments ago. And the restructuring actions that the Engine business took in the fourth quarter and the results are in more SAR spend, I think is all helping to keep those decrementals below what would normally be an acceptable level for them. So I think we are off to a pretty good start this year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the comps are easier is your point, Pat, in coming quarters? Because I think the guide at the midpoint would imply better decrementals than the first quarter.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think if you look at the Engine segment last year, certainly by the time we got to the fourth quarter, it was a very difficult fourth quarter for them. So the second half, I would expect to see a little bit better performance year-over-year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Sorry, just a couple more questions on Power Gen and high horsepower. Can you talk about how comfortable you feel with your inventory levels and what's in the channel in both of those segments? And as I think about the restructuring you've announced and combining those segments, does that imply you think things could be take another leg down? Could 2017 potentially be up? I'm just trying to think if there's any read through with regards to what you're doing and what that means for how you're thinking about demand, if you're more negative or positive.","And then, I guess, my second question relates to market share on the heavy-duty truck side. You brought that down. Again, you talked about Navistar, you talked about freightliner. Tom, confidence level in your longer-term market share goals in North America heavy-duty truck with, I think, Packard saying on their call a couple of weeks ago their addressable market is now 80% to 85% versus before they were targeting a 50% market share. Thanks.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jamie. So I'm going to let Rich talk a little bit about inventory and maybe heavy-duty truck, but again just getting back to the high-level question about when we get \u2013 and we think there's more downside to come in the Power Gen side and then the large engine side generally. What we decided to do was prepare ourselves for that potential outcome. We just don't know. The truth is we don't know if there's more downside to come. We do not see obvious signs of turnaround today.","And so what we decided to do with this last set of actions both in terms of the restructurings we did in Q4, the manufacturing footprint reductions, and the combination of this. And reorganization of these businesses is to prepare ourselves for whatever is in front of us. That's what we committed to do and that's what we're doing. And we've said that all along if we need to take more actions, we'll take them. So these are an example of that. So we just don't know what's going to happen in the future, but we feel more prepared to deal with it, whatever it is. And we feel like we've got our cost structure in place for what the business is now and if, again, it gets a lot worse we'll figure that out and take actions when we need to. But we really like the actions we've taken here as better positioning us for a really, really challenging market that exists today.","And, Rich, you can talk a little about the inventory question.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Let me take your last question first, Jamie, and then I'll get to the high horsepower inventory. So, the long-term view on share, let me just repeat what I think is going on in the market today. What we see is that we took it down as we saw our share go down at Daimler but \u2013 and we've forecasted it to go down, but I think in an environment of excess capacity, we're clearly seeing more pressure to utilize internal resources and more incentives and discountings to do that.","We've also seen some modest increase in Navistar this year. Again, nothing major, but we've actually seen that go down. So those two things are what are behind the immediate change we put in place. Our approach, we're going to stay disciplined. We're not going to chase share with discounting. The product's performing well. And so, we're going to continue to just sell that value to the customer to get that back and at the same time, align our cost to deliver really good financials in this environment.","I think longer-term, as we think about the share, our view is it's still a 50% big bore, 50% medium bore market. Okay? And today, we compete really with the 15-liter product. And that was part of our announcement that we made in New York that we'll be bringing a medium bore product to the market in 2017 to compete on the other end where we used to have kind of ISM product. We're going to have a terrific product down there at that end. So we see our share with Packard kind of in that 50% or 57% range now. Their market tends to be a little more big bore than medium bore. And so we see from a horsepower range, 13-liter products can cover a larger part of the horsepower range. So just the wrong \u2013 they're the wrong product in certain duty cycles and the customer kind of draws that to more of a 50\/50. So that's what's behind our guidance kind of looking forward.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think on the inventory side, I'll let Rich comment more, but we don't feel any concern about our inventory of high horsepower engines. We produce to demand. It's a really easy thing to look at that we do not have any issues with that. And Jen (37:26) said the same thing. In our distribution network, we also don't have extra inventory. We've been planning well. The market has been down for some time. There wasn't a big shift. The biggest concern, I think, in the marketplace really is unused equipment. It's where people have parked equipment. In the mining market, this is an issue. In the oil and gas market, it's an issue. And what that means is that as business starts to pick up, there'll be a lull before we start to see the kind of equipment orders that we'd like to see when that business picks up. That's just the reality of what we see in some of these markets and so that's what we're planning for. But in our system, our inventory levels are as they should be for this level of business.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a couple of follow-up questions. I know you won't guide for 2017, and that's not the purpose of this question, but can you talk a little bit about on the heavy-duty North America on-highway side? Do you see 2016 as kind of a mid-cycle slowdown that we just have too much inventory and we need to clean that up and next year will be a more normal year? Or are you seeing cracks in the fundamentals out there? I mean, I think you addressed it somewhat with the unused idled trucks that are out there? But, just your kind of philosophical thinking on 2017 for on-highway.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Ann, the way I would answer that, the actual amount of freight moving is pretty reasonable, especially if you're in the consumer side, the housing side, the pass-car side \u2013 some of the industrial folks are down. But the freight, actually \u2013 most of those indicators look pretty good. What we had last year, we shipped \u2013 the backlog came down 60,000 units. So we shipped 60,000 units of backlog last year and that's just not needed this year. And I just think we're in more of a normal replacement cycle right now, which is in kind of the 220 to 240 range is where we are. I think this year could be potentially lower because the backlogs are pretty low and it's hard to run plants. There's just no future visibility. So I think what you'll see, and what we're projecting anyway, and again, not that we have any great insight, it just happened in past cycles, is production rates come down a bit in the second half of the year to build up a little bit of backlog. And then I would look \u2013 then you're back to kind of macroeconomic for 2017, and which your guess is as good as mine. But right now, the general freight looks pretty good.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Ann, my comment about unused equipment was really in the high horsepower market, but not about trucks. And really, just to add to Rich's comments, the only real negative on the freight side have been there's \u2013 the oil and gas business is down and they do buy a lot of trucks. And in and around that market there is a lot of trucks. You know the currency is a little strong so some of the exporters have been down, but that's been true for a while. That's not really changing very much. So the freight activity that we have seen has been pretty steady, as Rich said. So I think it is normal. I think we'll see obviously the macro economy in the U.S., I think, will be the primary driver of whether we see further reductions from here or whether we kind of stabilize and hang out at the levels of \u2013 at the second half on into 2017.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I guess I would share your view on that, so I appreciate that. And just to follow up on, I think, when you were at our conference in March, there was some discussion that if there were any upside risk that it would be to JV income. Can you just talk about the pluses and minuses? What you're seeing in the joint ventures?","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think the \u2013 I'll highlight a couple and then I'll let Pat or Rich add. But you heard us comment on China. We had a strong quarter in China in the first quarter and there are some signs that things may be \u2013 could be improving and we are just remaining a little cautious. So we left our forecast where it was. And it's partially because we have just seen China promise better and beat the market, not be that strong the rest of the year, a couple of years in a row, so we want to be prudent and watch and see a couple of quarters before we really call an upside and also just fundamentals don't look that much different. So, I think that's the place where maybe if things are improving, as some people suggest, we could have some upside in JV income there. But right now our view is we are just \u2013 we think we're pretty \u2013 we're going to stay where we are from the point of view of forecasting.","And on the off-highway side, maybe it's the opposite. It's not that things are great now, but I just feel like it's weak markets all over the place and so maybe there is a little bit of downside still on off-highway. But again, there is not much to go. The good news is that we're so low that there's not much to go. But there is just a lot of parked equipment and a lot of challenge in those markets. So again, I think we are pretty balanced on our forecast. I think our JV income lines are pretty well balanced and I'd leave it where it is. But I \u2013 Rich, do you have anything to add?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","I think from a market standpoint, 100% agree, and I think just our position in that market \u2013 a couple positive things that we feel good about. One is the enforcement for the regs are pretty good and probably maybe better than we would have guessed even a year ago as we introduce them, which is good for us. And second, we saw the growth in market share as we've displaced competitive engines, especially with Foton, with the ISF and the ISG engine. And these engines are doing a terrific job. You heard Steve (43:23) talk about revolutionary and they, in fact, are.","They're lighter weight, they're higher performance, they don't break down. And just one number, the RSG engine is 150 pounds per liter and all the competitive engines are up to 200 pounds per liter. And so they are just engines that \u2013 it's a different market, where the old model was you had an engine that was easy to fix because they broke, their parts were inexpensive. And we are changing the market here with an engine that you don't have to get into and don't have to change and have telematics on it. And so, we had the rapid rise with just displacing. Now, we're going to be working with the partners to grow share versus competitors, and that will take some learning with customers to get used to a new technology and really a whole new product than what they are used to. So I like where we stand in that race.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, good morning, thank you.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ross.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to stay on that China discussion. So you mentioned that your market share took a little step backward, and obviously you guys had been growing share pretty rapidly over there. You characterize it as more of a \u2013 it sounded like a customer downtime issue. But I'm just wondering, has there been a stronger competitive response from Weichai or any of your local competitors there, given how quickly you have taken share in that market? And is that part of the reason why the share stepped back a little bit?","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks for the question, Ross. No, it's \u2013 in fact, that's what I highlighted \u2013 what I wanted to highlight in my comments that our penetration at our customers, which also by other engines has grown. So, to the contrary, we continue to make inroads for exactly the reasons Rich mentioned. The engines are doing really well; they're advantaging our customers. What happened with our truck customers, basically didn't discount as much and didn't participate in the market as much in the first quarter. There was quite a bit of activity in the market and quite a bit of discounting by a couple of folks, but just more activity. They didn't participate in that same sort of thing and so they stepped back in their truck share. We are not the least bit worried about that. We think that that all works itself out over the course of the year. So we feel very good about our market share projections. In fact, our penetration is ahead of where we hoped it would be, so we're feeling really good about that. So, very good position, very strong. The real question really is going to be how well did the market do. If the market does well, we'll see good pickup where there's better position than we've ever been and so that \u2013 we are just waiting for the market to pick back up.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you. And I think you mentioned 25% to 30% growth in China components, if I got that correct? And is that showing up in your Components segment or your JV income? And assuming it's in the segment, is that a major reason why you were able to hold a 14% margin in Components? And if that tailed off, would you have to give some of that back, do you think, over the course of the year? And I'm talking on the way you're currently reporting it, obviously, as opposed to the restatement that you're going to make.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so Components will not be affected by the restatement just \u2013 or the restructuring, just to be clear. But the point about Components, the China business that you talked about, 27% increase and that was a result of \u2013 again, as Rich was saying, they are enforcing their standards. And so we are having much more equipment go on Chinese engines, both after treatment \u2013 that's the main one, but also fuel systems going into these equipment, because electronic fuel systems are now pretty much required in order to meet the standard. So what we are seeing is more content on our customer's engines and our own engines in order to meet these new standards. That's really what's driving that. They do \u2013 it's good business. It does contribute to our business. But it's not a higher mix in terms of margin or anything else. So I would say our 14% margin is good all the way around.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The reason why the margin stayed up as strong as what it did in Components even though North American markets were down quite significantly is, again, back to that material cost focus. We've seen terrific improvement in material costs in the Components segment, which enabled them to offset the volume and offset a fairly significant foreign currency impact and still stay at 14%.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore. Your line is open.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, good morning. I was curious, six months now since the analyst meeting, and obviously the tone there was very positive about looking for deals. And I was just curious if you can give us some updates six months later? Are we closer, further away? And what are some of the impediments to getting the deals done?","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, David. Thanks for the question. Yeah, so we remain actively engaged in that process, as I mentioned at the investor conference. I have got a group of people that I'm working with directly on that, so I'm very engaged in it personally. And we are dutifully looking along the tracks that we talked about there where we think we can leverage our capabilities to grow. We are also, of course, remaining disciplined in terms of what we think is value added to the shareholders in terms of how we do it. The unfortunate thing about things like this is there is nothing to report until there is something to report.","And anything in the interim would be \u2013 would buy us our own process. So, unfortunately, I can only say that we are remaining active. I'm very optimistic that we're looking in the right places and thinking about the right things and that whatever we do when we do something, it will be beneficial to our shareholders and beneficial to the company long run. That part I'm sure. I'm sorry that I can't provide you more details and it's just because anything I'd say would just not help us in any way and help our shareholders. But I'd just tell you that nothing has changed about our process. We are still very active and I still feel good about what we are looking at.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","I guess maybe a way to answer a little bit, are you, six months later, a lot further down the road on narrowing and focusing on what you logically can target, and think a deal could occur? Or is it still as wide as it was six months ago?","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we have done a lot of work to focus and think about what's most important to us, a lot of work on that.","David Raso - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Could you just talk about how you expect to manage higher input costs in the second half of the year, given the higher commodity prices? And what's your latest thinking on pricing impact overall for the year?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So pricing impact overall for the year is pretty much in line with what we said again three months ago, that it's somewhere around 0.4%, 0.5% negative impact on margins. So no, we've seen that in Q1. We clearly overcame that through material cost improvement and no change or update in that as we look forward now through the rest of the year. And the first part of the question was?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Commodity prices.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Commodity prices are increasing.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. So how do you expect to manage that in the second half?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","I think that what we've looked at it, it will be minimal impact on us. So we do see some of that and we also have agreements with both customers and suppliers, we do some hedging in that area. So at least at the level that we are projecting commodity price increase the second half of the year that it would be minimal impact on our EBIT.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The good thing for us is we're kind of operationally hedged in the sense that as commodity prices increase, of course, so does demand for mining products. So there are short-term differences where things move a little bit and mining doesn't pick up and costs do, but generally speaking, when commodity prices rise in a significant amount, that's hard for us to offset in our cost structure. We also see mining business improve, which more than offsets it. So, in a way, commodity prices improving is a good thing rather than a bad thing for us.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then outside of M&A that David was asking about, to what extent has the weakness in the heavy-duty truck market caused you to accelerate any of your other strategic plans, maybe product oriented that you talked about at your Investor Day? I thought you had said at the Investor Day the 10-liter and 12-liter was a 2018, and I think on this call you said 2017. So are you accelerating some of those maybe more product strategies?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, on \u2013 let me clear that up. So, we will actually bring product here in 2017 late in the year, which is the same as what we intended to say at the investor conference and then really go into production in 2018.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And in terms of the strategy work that David asked about, we are accelerating now, we were accelerating then. There's really \u2013 we are fully focused on the efforts that are important to us strategically. So there's not a change. But we are working pretty quickly to figure out what's the most important for us to do and figure out how to do it.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thank you. Question on distribution. First off, just in light of the updated currency assumptions, which obviously hits that segment especially hard in both ways, what \u2013 how should we think about the update there and as well as the distributor acquisition? I know at this point that there's probably only small ones left. But maybe any color on those two items, in terms of how it potentially impacts the balance of the year?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","I think on foreign currency, I'll answer really for the company and then we can dive into distribution deeper if you want. In the first quarter, we had a 3% negative impact on sales, and then had a $19 million impact on profitability negative for the company. Given where currency rates currently are today, we expect the foreign currency headwind on the company for the rest of the year to be much less than what we've seen for the past year and a half. We're now guiding for the full-year on currency to be down around $200 million in sales, so one percentage point.","And fairly mutual actually on profitability for the full-year. So if you just back into the rest of the year, that would imply that the sales impact is going to be less than 1% negative as opposed to 3% in the first quarter. And profitability should get a little bit better across all the segments than what we've seen in Q1 and for most of last year. And obviously distribution, given its footprint, it's been the segment that's been most exposed to currency movements, so that should help it as it moves forward too.","N. Thomas Linebarger - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It doesn't always balance out. I think you probably know that, Tim, that sometimes because distribution operates in every currency. Still we can have currencies which are strengthening or weakening relative to the U.S. dollar, but on balance they can work their way out, because some might be going the other way. But \u2013 so I think distribution still has currency exposure, but hopefully as Pat said, on balance, we'll see a little bit less of a negative impact. The one thing I would just highlight to you is that we did see improvement in margin this quarter and that's despite currency and other challenges there. So that's a pretty good evidence that some of the synergies and other work we've been doing is starting to pay off to the question earlier. I think with the distributor acquisition, you're right. There's just the one left in North America left to do. That's the one we'll finish this year. That's in California. So it's not that small a distributor, actually. It's not the biggest, but it's decent size. And we'll be acquiring that in the second half of the year and when that's complete, we'll now then own all the North American distributors and the process will be complete for North America. And as Rich highlighted earlier, will we then kind of fall in to figuring out how we capture the synergies that we know are available to us.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","So I think just to summarize, Tim, a little bit more negative on the Engine business revenue outlook given the heavy-duty truck market, a little bit better on distribution from currency, and from the acquisitions leads us basically in the same place overall for the company. And then we'll refresh every segment's guidance with a new reporting structure next quarter.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Understood. And just maybe one quick cleanup on Components. And again, surprised at how few questions relative to the contribution of profits there. But I know that that segment, you can have some lumpiness just in terms of how some of the engineering costs flow through the quarters. Was it unseasonably low in the first quarter and it will pick up? Or was that not much of a factor either way in the first quarter?","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","That was not much of a factor in the first quarter.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. Very good. Thank you.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Tim.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Hello.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the heavy-duty truck revenue? You talked about some of the challenges in the OE volumes into North America, but the overall revenue there better than what we're seeing in North America new equipment trends. So what you're seeing on the parts side, whether owning distribution is improving some of the demand there as you manage that process? But some of the offsets to North America heavy-duty truck volumes within the reported heavy-duty truck segment volumes?","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, so the parts revenues have remained pretty steady and actually continue to grow slightly through this in the heavy-duty side. The distribution piece is more indirect on the parts sales. So we think by our regional distribution strategy increasing availability, et cetera, we'll get some upside there. But it's more around the synergies of getting product out there on parts. So I wouldn't attribute the acquisition to increasing part sales, although now we participate in those where we didn't used to within the joint venture at the same level. The other thing that I was just going to mention indirectly to your question and it relates a little bit to components in the heavy-duty space.","Our strategy is to \u2013 we sell engines to people who are vertically integrated, and we sell engines, but where we don't sell engines, we sell components. So some of the movement between engines and components, the components business continues to benefit from that. And our share in things like turbos are over 60%, and that's remained solid, our share in after treatment over 50%. And so we've continued to maintain that in a time regardless of what's happening on market share on the engine side.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","And then just to address your specific question, I think, asking about the overall heavy-duty revenue segment, Joe, really the North American on-highway, there's no other changes since we planned around flattish parts revenue for the year. That's still the assumption. We're not seeing any significant change in trajectory. We're not seeing any significant change in some of the international markets like Australia or South Africa that make up the rest of that segment. So a modest lower outlook for the overall heavy-duty as you're asking that question, I think.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yep. That's perfect. Thanks very much.","Rich Freeland - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Joe.","Patrick Joseph Ward - Chief Financial Officer","Okay, thank you very much, everybody, and I'll be available for your calls later on.

My name is Tony, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Mark Smith, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Mark Smith","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins' results for the third quarter of 2012.","Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger; our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Ward; and the President of our Engine business, Rich Freeland. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the teleconference.","Before we start, please note that some of the information you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future.","Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.","During the course of this call, we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors and Media.","With that out of the way, we'll begin with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, on behalf of Cummins, I would just like to express our condolences to the families and communities who have been impacted by the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. I'm guessing that some of you on the phone have been personally affected, and I hope for a quick recovery for each of you.","Now I'll summarize our third quarter results and talk about our key markets. Pat will then take you through more details of our third quarter performance and provide an update on our full year guidance.","Revenues for the third quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of 11% from the third quarter of 2011. Third quarter EBIT was $496 million, a decrease of $144 million or 23% compared to the third quarter of 2011. EBIT percent for the quarter was 12%, down from 13.8% a year ago with the negative impact of lower volumes and lower joint venture income, partially offset by lower product coverage cost and material costs.","As previously announced, we now expect full year revenues to be $17 billion, down from $18 billion last year. Demand has clearly weakened in a number of our markets over the last several months. I will talk about our outlook for many of these markets, and we have included for reference a supplementary slide in today's earnings release presentation that further quantifies the change in revenue guidance by both business segment and by market.","We expect to deliver full year EBIT margins of 13.5%, down from our previous guidance of between 14.25% and 14.75%. Pat will cover the changes by business in his remarks. But overall, the reduction in demand across multiple markets and geographies is the main driver of our lower EBIT margin forecast. I will discuss the actions we are taking to reduce costs following my comments on our major markets.","In the third quarter, our revenues in North America increased 2% year-over-year. The rate of growth of our revenues in North America slowed significantly during the third quarter, with the most significant change in the North American heavy-duty truck market. As a reminder, total company revenues in North America grew 43% in the first quarter and 12% in the second quarter compared to the previous year.","In the North American heavy-duty truck market, our Engine shipments decreased by 26% compared to the third quarter last year. Although an industry-wide cut in production rates was anticipated in the third quarter, the reduction was larger than expected, and the industry is experiencing slower-than-expected new order rates. End-users are reluctant to proceed with new purchases apparently due to uncertainty about the U.S. economy and concerns about possible impacts from the fiscal cliff.","Given the lower-than-expected industry order rates, we are now lowering our full year market size expectations to 245,000 units, down from our previous forecast of 260,000. We expect to achieve full year market share of 40%, unchanged from our previous guidance.","Our forecast for the North American medium-duty truck market is for a market size of 104,000 units, an increase of 11% over 2011 and unchanged from our previous guidance. We continue to expect our market share to exceed 50% for the full year. Our shipments declined by 9% in the third quarter, but are up 20% year-to-date.","Our North American on-highway products continue to perform well in the field. We have now shipped more than 335,000 engines equipped with our SCR technology, and the market feedback continues to be extremely positive. Our products continue to demonstrate very good reliability as evidenced by another quarter of low product coverage costs.","Consistent with our track record of being a leader in meeting increasingly stringent global emission standards, Cummins recently became the first engine manufacturer to achieve certification for the EPA 2013 regulations and the new 2014 greenhouse gas rules with our ISX 15-liter engine.","Also in North America, demand from Chrysler for the Dodge Ram truck remains strong. Our engine shipments increased 81% in the third quarter compared to the third quarter last year as Chrysler prepares for a model year change-over. Year-to-date, engine shipments to Chrysler are up 42% year-over-year, and we expect full year shipments to increase by 30%, consistent with our prior guidance.","In the North American construction market, we continue to experience positive growth in the third quarter with engine shipments increasing 12% year-over-year, although the rate of growth has decreased from prior quarters. Demand in the oil and gas market in North America has continued to decline as customers have further reduced capital expenditures in natural gas frac-ing operations, reducing orders for our engines.","Unit shipments in North America declined by 65% in the quarter, and we now expect full year global demand to decline by 50% compared to 2011, a change from our previous expectation of a decline of 41%.","In mining, our engine shipments declined by 32% year-over-year in North America. It is important to note that a significant proportion of the mining engines we delivered to OEM customers in North America are put into service in international markets. And therefore, the decline in shipments should not be interpreted as a 32% decline in North American mining activity.","Global unit shipments declined 14% due primarily to reduced orders in coal mining in the U.S., China, India, Australia and Russia. Mining activity for copper and precious metals remains strong. We have lowered our full year forecast for mining engine revenues as a result of capital expenditure cuts announced by a number of global mining companies. We now expect engine revenues to decline 1% year-over-year compared to our forecast of an increase of 7%.","In our Power Generation business, we recorded a growth of 14% year-over-year in North America. We are maintaining our full year forecast for revenue growth of 15%, driven mainly by new products as we have previously discussed.","In international markets, our consolidated revenues declined by 21% year-over-year. Consistent with prior quarters, revenues were down most significantly in Brazil and China. Demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa also weakened during the third quarter.","In China, our domestic revenue across all markets, including the revenues of our joint ventures, declined by 26% year-over-year in the third quarter. Demand weakened for trucks, excavators and power generation equipment consistent with the overall slowing of the economy. We continue to experience declining revenues in the construction market with our revenues down 50% in the third quarter. Industry sales for excavators are down 35% year-to-date through September, in line with our full year expectations of a decline of 35%.","Our production of engines will continue to run below industry sales as OEMs lower their existing inventory levels. The outlook for the truck market in China has weakened, as overall growth in the economy has slowed. Our joint venture revenues in the heavy and medium-duty truck market were down 31% in the third quarter. Year-to-date industry sales were down 26% through August. And we now expect full year industry sales to be down 26%, lower than our previous guidance of a decline of 17%.","In the power generation market, we are also lowering expectations for 2012 revenues in China. Our third quarter revenues, including joint ventures, declined by 29% year-over-year against a strong third quarter last year that was driven by summer power shortages. We now expect full year revenues to decline 14% compared to our previous expectations that revenues would be down 5%.","We now expect our full year domestic revenues in China across all end markets, including joint ventures, to decline by 21% compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 13%. We are yet to see any signs of improving demand in the markets we serve despite actions announced by the Chinese government to accelerate infrastructure project approvals.","In India, the economy has remained weak, and recent actions by the government to reduce the fiscal deficit have not helped to stimulate growth in the markets that we serve. On top of an increase in excise duties on commercial vehicles earlier in the year, the government also reduced fuel subsidies, effectively raising fuel prices by 12%.","In India, our total revenues, including joint ventures, declined by 19% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year. As we had expected, production at our Tata Cummins joint venture declined by 33%, as Tata lowered third quarter production rates to reduce inventories.","Our full year forecast for the truck market in India is for a decline of 8%, consistent with our previous forecast. Volumes at our Tata Cummins joint venture are down 15% year-to-date and are expected to be down 13% for the full year, also unchanged from our previous forecast.","In the Indian power generation market, we continue to see strong demand for low-horsepower products due to ongoing power shortages in the country. We estimate that demand for Power Gen -- power in India exceeds good capacity by more than 10%. We expect Power Generation volumes in India to increase 15% this year, unchanged from our previous guidance. As we discussed last quarter though, the devaluation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar means our full year expected revenues in dollar terms is a decline of 1%.","Also for the full year, our revenues in India, including joint ventures, are expected to be $1.5 billion, a decrease of 11% year-over-year and unchanged from our previous guidance.","In Latin America, we expect our revenues, including joint ventures, to be $1.4 billion, a decline of 22% year-over-year compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 17%. We are experiencing lower demand for power generation equipment, and the outlook for the truck market in Brazil has also weakened. Industry sales in the truck market in Brazil are down 36% year-to-date through August due to a combination of the impact of the transition to Euro 5 emission standards and a weaker economy. We now forecast a full year decline of 37% compared to our previous guidance of a decline of 33%. Industry sales of Euro 5 products increased in the third quarter, reaching approximately 12,000 units per month compared to an average of 2,000 units per month in the second quarter.","Industry inventory levels have dropped approximately 10% in the last 3 months as a result of improving retail sales. The inventory trend is, however -- sorry, the inventory trend is encouraging. However, a further improvement in new order levels is required before the industry build rates increase.","We experienced our weakest quarter of the year in Europe. Total company revenues were 19% with lower demand in most end markets, particularly power generation, construction and on-highway markets. As a reminder, a significant proportion of the Power Generation products we deliver in Europe are subsequently put into service in other markets outside of Europe.","In the Middle East and Africa, Power Generation represents our largest business. Demand dropped by 17% in the Middle East year-over-year due to lower orders from rental fleets. And in Africa, revenues dropped 10% year-over-year. Third quarter revenues in Africa were similar to the second quarter of this year and well above the weak levels we saw in the first quarter, but still lower than a year ago. Clearly, we are experiencing significantly weaker demand in many of our largest markets. Unfortunately, there is also a high degree of uncertainty about the direction of the global economy. At this point in time, it is not clear when demand will improve.","In this uncertain environment, the leadership team at Cummins is focused on ensuring that we manage our costs appropriately. We have announced a number of actions over the last 3 months to adjust to lower demand environment. We have frozen professional hiring, cut discretionary expenses, re-prioritized and, in some cases, canceled projects. We have reduced production levels at our manufacturing facilities. And in doing so, we have operated some plants with reduced workweeks, and we have taken plant shutdowns.","Given the decline in revenues over the last 3 months, actions are underway to further reduce our cost structure in several of our manufacturing plants and reduce global headcount by between 1,000 and 1,500 people by the end of this year. This management team has demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through periods of uncertainty, and we will continue to make the right decisions to maintain strong financial performance, while ensuring that we deliver the new projects and programs necessary to meet customer commitments and to drive strong profitable growth in the future.","Thank you for your interest today. And now I'll turn it over to Pat.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $4.1 billion, a decrease of 11% from a year ago. Revenues increased by 2% in North America, but were down 21% internationally compared to the prior year, and currency movement reduced revenues by approximately 4%.","Compared to the second quarter, revenues were down 7% with lower demand in both North America and in international markets. Gross margins were 25.3% of sales, down from 25.7% last year. This decrease was driven by the impact of the reduction in volumes, partially offset by lower material cost and improved price realization.","Sequentially, gross margins decreased from 27.2% in the prior quarter as a result of the lower volume and the more unfavorable mix, partially offset by the benefit from lower material costs. Selling, admin and research and development costs are down by $11 million from last year and down $32 million from last quarter. Both a sequential and year-over-year reduction in spending has occurred in selling and administration expenses.","Joint venture income of $94 million was 8% lower than a year ago and 10% lower than the previous quarter. The year-over-year and sequential declines were driven by lower contribution from joint ventures in both China and in India.","In both comparisons, Dongfeng Cummins in China accounted for the largest variance due to the weaker demand in the China truck market. Earnings before interest and tax were $496 million or 12% of sales. This compares to 13.8% of sales last year.","Earnings per share in the third quarter were $1.86 compared to $2.35 in the third quarter of 2011. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.1%, which included a $16 million benefit for discrete tax items. $6 million of the discrete items were included within our original guidance for the effective tax rate.","Let's now move on to the operating segments and discuss third quarter performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, a decrease of 14% over last year. Sales were down in nearly every international region, particularly on-highway markets in Brazil and industrial markets in China and Europe.","Revenue in North America declined modestly, where strong demand from Chrysler on -- from construction markets was offset by weaker heavy and medium-duty truck, oil and gas and mining markets. Sequentially, segment revenues were down 11% as a result of the decline in the North American heavy and medium-duty truck markets, oil and gas markets and industrial demand in Europe and global mining markets.","Segment EBIT was $239 million or 9.5% of sales compared to 11.8% in the prior year and 13.2% in the second quarter. Compared to the prior year, the benefits from better price realization and lower material costs were more than offset by the drop in volume, lower joint venture contribution and continued technical investments in growth programs.","Sequentially, the decline in volume, a more unfavorable product mix and weaker joint venture income resulted in lower margins. For the full year, we now anticipate revenue for the Engine segment to be down 6% compared to 2011. This is down from our previous guidance of revenue being on par with 2011 levels. The decrease is driven primarily by the reduction in the North American heavy-duty truck market, reduction in sales to our Power Generation business as we focused on reducing inventory levels and lower demand in global mining markets.","As a result of lower volume and weaker contribution from joint ventures in China, we are also lowering our full year expectations for EBIT as a percent of sales. And we now forecast that EBIT will be in the range of 11% to 11.5% of sales.","In the Components segment, third quarter revenue was $938 million, down 8% compared to the prior year and 9% sequentially. Both comparisons were impacted by lower after-treatment and fuel system demand in North America along with weaker turbocharger demand in Europe. In addition, aftermarket demand decreased in several regions.","Revenue in Brazil increased year-over-year due to additional content being sold following the implementation of Euro 5 emission standards. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by almost 4% compared to the third quarter of 2011. Segment EBIT was $89 million or 9.5% of sales, down from 11.1% last year and down from 11.2% in the prior quarter.","Lower volume, unfavorable currency movements and increased technical investments resulted in lower margins compared to a year ago. Sequentially, the impact of the lower volume was partially offset by reductions in selling and administration expenses. We are now forecasting the Components segment revenue to be flat with 2011. This is down from our previous guidance of 5% growth, resulting from lower on-highway demand in North America and in Europe. Full year segment EBIT margins have also weakened and are now expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11% of sales. The reduction is due primarily to lower volumes.","In the Power Generation segment, third quarter sales of $814 million were down 7% from the prior year and down 11% sequentially. In both comparisons, international revenue decreased sharply in several regions. The year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by lower demand in China and in Europe. And while we experienced volume growth in India, this was more than offset by the devaluation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar. The sequential decline was driven by lower demand in India, Europe and in the Middle East.","Revenue in North America grew 14% over the prior year, driven by new products as we have discussed previously. And sequentially, revenue in North America was down 5%. Segment EBIT was $73 million or 9% of sales in the quarter, down from 10.5% last year and down from 10.3% in the prior quarter. Compared to last year, benefits from improved pricing were offset by lower volume, increased technical spending focused on new products and lower joint venture income.","Sequentially, the impact of reduced volume was partially offset by lower material costs. For 2012, we now expect segment revenue to be down 5% compared with 2011. This is a decrease from our previous guidance of being flat with the prior year. While guidance in North America remains unchanged at 15% growth, international revenue is lower than previously expected.","Power Generation demand in Europe, China, India, Brazil and in the Middle East has weakened over the last 3 months. The reduction in volumes has also caused us to lower our outlook for segment profitability. And now, full year segment EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 9% to 9.5% of sales.","For the Distribution segment, third quarter revenues were $801 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year and 1% compared to the prior quarter. During the quarter, the Distribution segment acquired a North American distributor, which added revenue of $57 million. Excluding all acquisitions, third quarter revenue decreased 7% compared to the prior year and 8% sequentially. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by almost 5% compared to the third quarter of 2011. In both comparisons, organic growth was lower due to weaker Power Generation demand in Europe and in Africa and in mining markets in the United States and in Australia. Sequentially, we experienced lower demand in Australia, Europe and in Africa. Segment EBIT was $99 million or 12.4% of sales, which includes a $7 million gain from the consolidation of a North American distributor. Excluding this gain, margins were 11.5% of sales, down from 13.3% a year ago. This decrease is the result of currency movements, ongoing investment in our distribution capabilities and the expansion of a distribution footprint and some variation in geographic mix.","Sequentially, EBIT margins were relatively flat with the negative volume impact being offset by lower selling and administration expenses. For 2012, we are now guiding to 5% growth over the prior year. Growth from acquisitions will be offset by a 3% decline in the base business. This reduction from our previous guidance of growth of 10% is the result of weaker international demand, particularly for Power Generation and in some mining markets. And we now expect segment EBIT margins to be in the range of 11.5% to 12% of sales for the full year.","As previously announced, we now project total company revenues to be $17 billion, a reduction of 6% from last year. Growth in North America on-highway, construction and power generation markets will be offset by lower demand internationally. And we anticipate a negative currency impact of approximately $450 million in the year compared to 2011. EBIT margins for the company will be approximately 13.5% of sales compared to the 14.2% margin, excluding gains and divestitures, that we reported last year. Despite the lower sales, we expect gross margins to improve by 100 basis points, but this is offset by higher expenses in selling, admin and in research and development, with research and development cost, for example, up 15% this year as we continue to develop technologies and products focused on future growth.","Other guidance changes include a lower joint venture contribution, where we now expect joint venture income to decline 8% from last year. Growth in contribution from North American distributors will be more than offset by weaker joint venture income in both China and in India, and we now expect our tax rate to be 26.5% for the full year, excluding discrete tax items. The revision is driven by lower projected earnings in markets where the tax rate is less than in the United States.","I continue to be pleased with our gross margin performance. Despite year-to-date revenue being relatively flat with the prior year, gross margins have improved by 100 basis points. And if you just focus on the second half of the year, revenues will be $1.5 billion or 15% lower than the second half of 2011. However, gross margins, as a percent of sales, will be on par with the second half of last year.","As we continue to manage through this period of elevated uncertainty, we are committed to rightsizing our cost structure as Tom just discussed. We also remain committed to investments in new products and in expanding our distribution footprint that are important for our future growth. The strength of our balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to make these investments for growth and provide additional return to our shareholders even during periods of uncertainty.","For example, in July, we increased the dividend by 25%. Also year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares, and our outstanding share count is 2% lower than this time last year. In recognition of the performance of the company and our strong balance sheet, Fitch Rating Services recently upgraded our credit rating to single-A status. We remain committed to maintaining our strong balance sheet. And specifically, we are taking steps to improve working capital efficiency in this lower revenue environment.","During our second quarter earnings call, we committed to reduce inventory by $200 million by the end of the year. We made a start on this in the third quarter where, excluding acquisitions, inventory decreased by $72 million from the previous quarter, but we still -- but we know we still have much more work to do on this. We have taken actions to reduce inventory levels further in the fourth quarter, and I expect us to deliver the $200 million of inventory reduction we targeted back in July.","In addition, we have adjusted our capital expenditures and now expect to invest between $650 million and $700 million, down from our previous guidance of between $750 million and $800 million. Cummins is well positioned to manage through this period of uncertainty and emerge stronger when growth returns as we have done before. We have taken actions to address spending and are prepared to do more if required.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks, Pat. And it's now time for our question-and-answer section. [Operator Instructions] Tony, we're now ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, could you talk about the visibility that we have in the U.S. truck market? The OEMs -- still some of them have some decent inventory here. Some of them are talking about increases in production. Some of them are talking about decreases in production. How do you get a handle on that? Do you think, now, we are conservative enough in looking ahead in the next quarter or 2 around U.S. truck production?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Well, I'll give a couple of high-level comments, and I'll have Rich talk a little bit about how we get -- we have pretty decent visibility. I'll let him talk about that. But broadly speaking, I'd say we're pretty well -- we have pretty good handle on how conservative we should be. I feel like we're in the right spot. I think the truck market has latent demand. I think there are people out there who, if they had more confidence in the future of the U.S. economy, would buy more trucks and buy a significant number. So there's no question in my mind that when it turns up, it will turn up significantly, and we'll be able to -- and the whole industry will benefit from that. But as you said, right now, there's a -- each of the truck makers is trying to figure out how to find a profitable level of production that works for their plants and also feeds the market at the right level. And given the uncertainty and the, frankly, weakening retail sale, they've all kind of moved around trying to do that. Rich, why don't you comment about how we understand those movements and plan accordingly?","Richard J. Freeland","Okay, just maybe one additional comment on the longer term. So I think Tom said the demand is there and the pent-up -- it's pent-up, and it's going to release. So part of what we view is when it comes back, we're going to be really well positioned for it. We've put in capacity to meet it. The products are doing well. The fuel economy is good. So I think longer term, when it turns -- it's a bit of your question, when do you see it -- that flip. And so while we don't know exactly when that is, we like where we're positioned when it happens. In the real short term, Q3 was a bigger decline frankly than we anticipated, and so there was some correction. While the industry had been building more than we were selling and, obviously, we're building more engines, that correction happened in Q3. We have pretty good confident -- pretty good view in the short term what things look like, and we're confident through the end of the year, at least, that Q4 is going to look a lot like Q3, and there's not a further deterioration that we're looking at. And then, we're not giving guidance today on the 2013. But kind of looking at those macros and say there will be a turn at some point, and we're just not right now predicting when that will be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia","Actually, this is Andrew Buscaglia for Jamie Cook. So my question is actually on China...","[Technical Difficulty]","Andrew Buscaglia","Sure. Two questions just on China. Can you just give me a little more commentary there? It sounds like things [indiscernible] and things aren't improving despite [indiscernible] potential for government stimulus. Can you just talk about your thoughts on that region?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Sure. There's no question that China has -- this year has not met our expectations, the ones we put in place at the beginning of the year. The market was not strong when we started the year, and we knew it wouldn't be a fantastic market, but we anticipated some improvement specifically in the second half, and we have not seen that. In fact, we've seen, as we mentioned in our remarks, further deterioration. And part of that is a result of the fact that the capital spending sectors of the economy really have not recovered. And part of it is because of the inventory levels that got built up in the construction market. So not only are the -- is capital spending lower, but there is inventory in the field and in the plants of the equipment makers and the excavator market, particularly, that they have to get rid of at much lower retail sales rate. So both of those things have caused our production levels to be lower than we anticipated. Right now, we don't have a good feel for when it's going to turn back the other way, and we know that the government is -- has planned and has, in fact, announced stimulus measures to try to get some of the capital projects going in the provinces. But we have just not seen a significant impact on our markets from those efforts to date. And when the last time we were involved in the stimulus, which was not that many years ago, we saw those impacts, they were significant, and they happened pretty quickly. So right now, we're not seeing those, and we're not sure when and if we will see them. And so, we're -- we are definitely -- it's uncertain to us, and we are planning accordingly. So we're planning for markets to remain down for some time. We don't see it worsening further, but we're not clear when it's going to turn back. We're obviously watching very closely to look for signs for that. But right now, we're just not sure. As you may know, in the truck market, there is a emissions hurdle coming next -- in the middle of next year. So as we enter next year, we'll have to deal a little bit with the uncertainty around that as well. What that means with regard to whether they'll buy more trucks in the first half because of that or less or what will happen I don't -- we just don't know today. But what we do know is the recovery has not started in China, at least not in our markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Back on China, I guess, quickly, can you help us understand the cadence in Q3 versus Q2? It looks like the contribution decline kind of accelerated to 40% from 35% in Dongfeng. What's driving that? Was that higher expenses, or is that all volume deterioration?","N. Thomas Linebarger","It's both. I mean, volume is probably the most significant factor. Of course, there's a normal seasonal decline from Q2 to Q3 as you're well aware, Andy, but of course things have weakened. But then, we have got some expenses within the JV as we prepare for NS4, the new emissions change, so some increase in expense as well, but volume's the biggest challenge.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the expense for NS4 pretty much it continued through year -- mid-year next year?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, yes.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a technical question, then a longer-term question. But first, the technical. On the tax rate, does the annual 26.5% x the discrete items -- and I think you had $29 million year-to-date, does that imply something like a 33% rate for the fourth quarter? And then subsequently, are there any remaining discrete items that could affect the rate in Q4?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. The rate for the fourth quarter, Andy, won't be as high as 33%. So [indiscernible] market, I can take you through the math if you're looking at some numbers there, but it will be lower -- much lower than that. We continue to work on our tax planning strategies. There could be some more discrete items in the fourth quarter. But as of now, I wouldn't bank on it.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess strategically, we're in the midst of these mining company CapEx cutbacks. How are you viewing those? Is that kind of a short-term thing and we get on with life 1 or 2 years from now? Or is that something more prolonged?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. Our view is that the long-term outlook for commodities remains really strong, and I think that's what's going to drive mining. We still believe that to be the case. If you just step back and look at the requirements for commodities and the big economies that have been growing over the last 5 or 10 years, commodities still look like they're going to be in demand and in fact, in a significant way, there is not enough source. So I think we -- our view on mining remains strong, long run. However, in the short run, what we've got is commodity price drops, especially in coal. And so needless to say, it's -- the first thing that happens is the ones who are looking at big capacity additions say, \"Well, not now. Don't do it now because we're -- it's a lot of money to put in, and we're -- we have more uncertainty about when the demand picks up.\" And then the second thing that happens is those that are operating marginal mines start to say, \"Well, I'm at the high end of this cost structure. So as prices for my commodity drops, this doesn't look so good to keep going.\" So some of those in the coal side, some of those mines have either reduced production or stopped production. And then the ones that are effective on cost and have good quality keep on going through this time unless things get really low. And as I mentioned in my remarks, coal is clearly down enough that we've seen both first rung and second rung effects, whereas copper and some of the precious metals have not seen that. So we're kind of in the middle there. We're not as big as the drop we saw last time, but we're definitely -- we've definitely reduced our demand forecast as a result of what's already happening. So we're kind of in between those 2. So it's possible that there's further reductions if things continue to weaken. But I think, again, long run, we see the same strength in these mining markets over the extended period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tom, can you talk about which businesses are seeing the most significant staffing reductions? And are there any permanent changes for the manufacturing footprint as a result? I think you've been looking to ship your genset assembly to India to a greater extent. Is that part of what's happening here?","N. Thomas Linebarger","So, Jerry, without commenting on specifics too much yet because, of course, as you guess, we need to talk. We need to go through all the efforts, and we need to talk to our employees first and all that kind of thing, but let me just give you a broad view of it. All parts of our company are participating in this cost reduction because we are, as you -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing weakness in a lot of markets around the world. So if we see reductions in one area, we just deal with that area right away. But in this case, we've got pretty broad reductions in demand. So all businesses and all parts of the company are participating and figuring out how to reduce cost structure. In the plants, most of what we're going to do is reduce within the plants we have and keep largely the same plant footprint. There's not that there will be no changes, there will be because we constantly are looking to say how can we use the efforts in downturns to position ourselves strategically more where we want to be for the long run. So as you mentioned, if we're trying to move more capacity to one area of the world, the other will -- when we reduce headcount, we'll use that as an opportunity to move more towards the production areas that we want to. But far and wide, we've done a lot of that. And so those effects will be relatively small as compared to, say, just reducing capacity in plants that we don't need as much today and then, of course, taking cuts across the company in overhead areas. And I guess the last thing I would say is that we are ensuring that we fund the key product program and other projects that are going to be critical for the future while reducing some of those that we can afford to delay for some period or that we think were the least attractive ones, we'll cut those. So we are doing -- we are being pretty specific about those areas we reduce and those areas we continue to fund and that, of course, ensures that when we come out of this downturn, we'll be -- emerge stronger than we went in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Tom, just to continue on that discussion, I was wondering if you could -- and I know it's still early and you're not providing guidance yet, but I was wondering if we could build out a framework of how you're thinking about 2013 in terms of CapEx and hiring plans and even just on the domestic truck market, whether or not you think the market might be up or down next year might be helpful.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Well, as you said, we're not going to do too much in guidance today because, as you know, some of those, once we start down that trend, we're kind of all the way in. But let me just give you a broad feel about how we're planning for it, which fits with my remarks, which is that our view is there's a significant amount of uncertainty in these major markets. And so we're planning accordingly. We're thinking about the market -- we're not counting on the markets to improve, and we're just making sure that we're ready for it to get -- go this flat, go the same, go up, go down. All those outcomes are possible from what we see. As Rich commented in the North American heavy-duty truck markets, specifically, we are thinking that if things do turn back, they could turn back quite dramatically given the latent demand that's there and if we see improvement in confidence in the U.S. economy, so fiscal cliff goes away and some sort of budget deal struck and people start to think the U.S. is going the right direction, that could be an instigation for improvement in the truck market, and it could come back pretty quickly in which case, again, the work that Rich and the Engine business have done to prepare for it, I think, will serve us well. But we'll be ready if it doesn't come back that fast too. That's kind of how we're trying to think about it. And as Pat said, we'll take whatever actions we need to in whatever area of the company. If things worsen further, we'll take the actions we need to, to be in the right cost position for those activities too. So I'm sorry, I'm not giving you more detail, but we are just planning for -- we're going to set a plan that does not assume a great outcome next year, but we'll be ready if things are stronger than that and we'll be ready if things are weaker than that, and we're doing that, kind of, place by place strategically, what's the most important place to have a quick response capability, where could we have a little bit more delayed response capability and then adjust our cost structure and supply chain accordingly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tom, could you talk a little bit about -- you talked about relooking at CapEx spend and reevaluating projects. Could you give us some examples of projects that you are moving ahead with regardless that you have total confidence in, regardless of what you're seeing out there right now versus maybe a project or 2 that you've decided to postpone or push back or reevaluate?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Just -- in the interest of not revealing too much about our competitive plans, let me just -- I think I can give you a flavor for the kind of thing. So we had a number of projects that were going to drive capacity increases in preparation for next year or the year after, for example, in China, and we've delayed some of those. We've delayed some of those capital projects which increase capacity further. On the other hand, some of the product programs that are addressing NS4, which is -- it's imminent, as well as some of the product programs that we think have major impacts on our long-term profitable growth, for example, our new high-horsepower program that we announced, we are continuing to fund those. So that at least gives you a flavor. So things that have short-term impact, Tier 4, fuel economy stuff, the ones that have major growth like high-horsepower, those we'll continue to fund. Those that have short-term capacity additions, things that we can postpone, projects that might improve our productivity down the road but cost a lot in the short run, we might delay some of those. IT programs, things like that, we might delay. Those are the kind of the ways we're thinking about it. And as you'd guess, in a company of our size, there are a lot of those to think about. And so we're, of course, reviewing the major ones with my leadership team but then, each of the leadership teams around the world are taking a look at their projects and seeing where they sit on all of them. And all of those do, by looking at these programs, not -- it doesn't just impact capital expenditure, it impacts the demand we have for resources, which means when we have lower demand for resources, we can then reduce the number of resources because we've already frozen hiring. So you can't bring in new people and then, we've -- we're reducing headcount so there'll be fewer resources to do the work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vance Edelson of Morgan Stanley.","Vance H. Edelson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So given that you believe there's pent-up demand and you expect a pretty healthy snapback when it does occur. When you do see that turnaround, you've suggested you'll be ready. But just how quickly can you bring back the capacity, bring back the headcount and so forth? Are we talking a number of weeks or months? Could you just provide some color in that regard?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, I'm going to let Rich talk about that.","Richard J. Freeland","Yes. We're actually able to respond really quickly especially if you think about the heavy-duty truck demand. So we've -- the long lead-time capacity items, plant assembly, test cells, we've got in place and in fact, we've -- we're increasing it a bit to be ready for that. We've also -- we've been through this a few times before, and so we know the key suppliers and where the bottlenecks are and we actually tested the system pretty hard earlier in the year. And so we're doing work with those. So we don't have to go out and buy capital equipment, invest in bricks and mortar. We can bounce back and handle different scenarios of a peak demand pretty well. I mean, our workforce flexes really well, and the whole supply base we work with does that. So I think really well -- think in weeks, months, not longer than that to respond.","N. Thomas Linebarger","And we have one -- as Rich said, we have one of the most flexible plants that, at least, I've ever been in contact with in Jamestown, and we have demonstrated -- just in 2010, you can just go look at the production levels that we talked about in 2010 to see the variation that we can deal with at that plant. And it comes because employees are flexible. We've figured out ways to bring in temporaries and let go of temporaries and other kinds of things where we can get ramp-up and ramp-down quite quickly. It's a remarkable place in that regard. And then some of our other plants like Rocky Mount, North Carolina where we serve mid-range truck have some of the same capability. So again, it's not something that we've come to just now. It's something we've been working at for many, many years to be ready to go up and down. Rich has also got some supply chain work he's done to put in some strategic inventory. So one of the things that we're trying to do is reduce inventory, while still maintain some strategic inventory to allow us to ramp up in those markets that we think might come quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann of Jefferies & Company.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Tom, this is a finger in the wind kind of a question. But if your implied revenue guide for the fourth quarter is down about 20%, do you think all your customer production is down that much? Or how much of that might be inventory reduction across the various end markets?","N. Thomas Linebarger","It's both for sure, Steve. It's definitely both going on. I mean, some -- I mentioned in my remarks some places where it's pretty clear that there's some inventory adjustments that went on in Q3, and some of those inventory adjustments are definitely not done. We talked about excavator markets in China, which is the most dramatic case of it, where you've got inventory in the system that is going to extend sometime into next year. We don't know how long. It depends on retail rates, but there's a lot of inventory in the chain there. I talked about Brazil trucks being another place where retail demand has picked up, inventory started to drop, but there's no question that there's more inventory to make up. And then we even talked about North American trucks where -- what Rich said is we saw the industry producing at a higher rate than demand was happening in Q3. And so they have adjusted build rates in Q4 to try to balance the 2 things. So that -- both are going on for sure even in the genset market, where there's some of the big project demand dropped off. There'll be some inventory in some places in the field, where they will have to clear out and that will reduce production. So it's both. No question it's both. But make no mistake, end markets are not in those that I -- in the areas I talked about are not strong. So both are going on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso of ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Questions on the thinking of second half 2012 run rate. And if you can indulge me in taking us through which markets you think sequentially, second half '12 to first half '13 -- so if there's some sense of visibility. It's not a full year-type question. Which markets do you think will be better, which will be worse, second half '12, the first half '13?","N. Thomas Linebarger","I'll give you a high level, and Pat may have other comments. But again, I think that's part of what we're not really clear about. I think we -- in my remarks, what I was talking about is that we don't have particularly good visibility about where the markets go from here. And as I mentioned, we're not assuming that things are going to get a lot better really quickly. So we're building our plan and our actions around the fact that things are not going to improve quickly. Again, some markets will improve, some markets may not. But right now, our view is visibility is not very good. And so we're going to assume not a bunch of improvement, but -- Pat, I don't know if you want to make any other...","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, I'll add a couple of things, Tom. I think much of it is dependent on factors outside of our control. So in the U.S., if we get a decent resolution on this fiscal cliff issue early in the new year, I think that could really help a number of markets in North America. If we punt out a bit longer, clearly, that's a different scenario. If you look at Brazilian markets, for example, given the major events that they've got coming up between the World Cup and the Olympic Games, we know they're behind with significant infrastructure investment, and you would expect, at some point, they have to kind of get a move on with that and pick up the pace. So again, we'll talk more about it on our call at the end of the year and hopefully by then, we'll have much more -- a much better view of some of these external factors that can drive it one way or the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Research.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Can I have just one clarification? Somebody asked about the tax rate in the fourth quarter. Since you true up your tax rate in the third quarter, why would you be 26.5%, unless you come up with a somewhat discrete item?","Patrick J. Ward","So let me take you through that. I may have confused a few people with [indiscernible] tax. The tax rate in the third quarter of 24.1% that I talked to, that was the all-in tax rate, so that includes discrete items. The year-to-date tax rate, including all discrete items, is 25.5%. And so when you look at the full year, I was giving you a full year ETR, without discrete, which is 26.5%. All-in, it's going to be somewhere between 24% and 25%. So Q4 is going to look somewhat similar to Q3 when it comes to tax rate. It might be a little bit lower if we get some of the tax planning work we're working on completed by the year. So hopefully, that's clarified it a little bit for people.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right. My main question is, you just signed a -- made a finalized agreement with Navistar or so. Do you have any feeling -- would you give us some guidance of what that will mean for the company with some -- what impact on revenue a quarter [ph], something like that? I assume that you won't get anything until fiscal '13, but can you give us some feeling for what it means?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. It's hard to estimate today, as you guessed, Eli, because what -- we understand what products we're doing from them. What we don't know is how quickly those products are going to ramp up and go into the market, right. Because they'll -- Navistar truck with our engine will have to compete with the other trucks with our engine and other engines. So we just don't have a good way to quantify it. Our view is that we're working really hard to be ready on Navistar schedule to have the 15-liter in the ProStar truck and then in other trucks if they ask us to put it in, and we're working with equal urgency to make sure that we've got components on their 13- and 11-liter engines, so that those are available in the market with SCR Systems in the first -- next year as well, hopefully by the end of the first quarter. So we're working with urgency on both things. It's just kind of hard right -- sitting where we are right now to say so what's the estimate of the -- of sales or profit for next year.","Operator","And the next question is a follow-up from Andrew Casey.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question on the heavy-duty truck capacity, given what Eli just alluded to, the Navistar business win. On the Engine side, if memory serves, you were running up against some constraints in the first half of the year, mainly the first quarter. If the industry goes back up to those rates and you have the incremental market share, does that imply that you're adding capacity at Jamestown or somewhere else to support that? I know we're a ways away from there right now.","Richard J. Freeland","Yes. Andy, this is Rich. I'll -- yes, in fact, we have continued to add capacity through the last 12 months because even then while we met demand at that peak, it was pretty hectic, okay. And so we're operating over our capacity. So we've -- again, on all of the bottleneck operations and in some cases, we've added hard capacity or inventory to be able to do that. So, yes, we have added capacity really through last year and then into this year to meet that increased demand or hit those -- to be able to meet those peak demands.","N. Thomas Linebarger","I guess, in summary, Andy, we feel confident we can meet the peak demand even if it comes next year, and hopefully it comes soon next year, we'll be ready to meet the peak demand with our customers that we've agreed to supply. That's part of our commitment to them.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, due to time, I'm turning it over back to Mr. Mark Smith for closing remarks.

Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www.cummins.com under the heading of Investors And Media.","Now I'd like to begin the call with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning. I will start with a summary of our second quarter, including some brief comments on individual business performance, and then I will talk about our outlook for the full year. Pat will then take you through more details of our second quarter financial performance and our full year forecast.","Revenues for the second quarter were $4.5 billion, an increase of 2% year-over-year. EBIT for the quarter was 13.7% of sales compared to 14.9% a year ago. Revenues improved by 15% from first quarter levels, driven by higher revenues in North America. Profitability also improved from first quarter levels with incremental EBIT margins of 31% sequentially.","Revenues for the engine business declined by 7% compared to the second quarter last year due to lower demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market. We saw a 38% decline in shipments of high horsepower units driven by global weakness in mining and other highway markets. EBIT for this segment was 12.8% and held up well compared to 13.2% last year considering the decline in high horsepower markets. Performance rebounded strongly from first quarter levels due to higher demand across a number of on-highway markets in North America and higher joint venture earnings in China.","The Components business benefited from increased demand in on-highway markets in several regions, achieving record revenues in the second quarter of $1.1 billion and delivering strong earnings. EBIT of 12.2% was up 50 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year.","Performance for the Power Generation business has been below our expectations in recent quarters. Second quarter revenues declined 10% year-over-year as weakness in most international markets offset higher demand in North America. EBIT of 9.3% was down from 10.3% a year ago, mainly due to lower volumes. We did though see encouraging improvements in operational performance from first quarter levels with EBIT margins improving 250 basis points due to higher volumes, lower warranty costs and improved productivity. We expect to maintain the improvements delivered in the second quarter and see opportunities to drive further improvements in gross margin.","Acquisitions in North America contributed strongly to revenues in the Distribution business this quarter. In fact, nearly all of the revenue growth in the quarter from that DBU came from acquisitions of North American distributors completed in the last 12 months. We expect to pursue further acquisitions of distributors in North America in the future, so we do not expect any additional transactions to have a significant impact on 2013 revenues or earnings. We will discuss our long-term plans for the North American distribution systems, along with other important regions of the world at our upcoming Analyst Day in September.","EBIT in the Distribution business for the second quarter was 10.5% compared to 11.6% a year ago and 12.2% in the first quarter. In both comparisons, acquisitions added to the EBIT dollars but were dilutive to the EBIT percent because we were acquiring 50-50 joint ventures, where the sales are not consolidated, but 50% of their earnings are already included in our EBIT.","Pat will take you through the details of our guidance for the rest of 2013. But in summary, we now expect full year revenues to be approximately even with 2012. This compares to our previous guidance of flat to down 5%. With Components revenues, we now expect to increase 7% compared to our previous expectation of an increase of 2%. We still expect to deliver EBIT in the range of 13% to 14% of sales for the year with some changes in guidance for individual segments, which Pat will discuss.","Before I close, I want to provide some more color about our sales for the quarter and our key markets. As I said, company revenues increased by 2% in the first -- from the first quarter, with revenues up 7% in North America and international revenues down 4%. Our shipments of engines for North America heavy-duty trucks were 21,000 in the second quarter, a decrease of 19% from last year but an increase of 12% from the first quarter. Demand continues to recover moderately after a period of very weak industry orders in the second half of 2012, but OEMs remain cautious in raising build rates. For the full year, we are adjusting our forecast for the market size to 229,000 units, down from our previous forecast of 233,000 units, with third quarter production likely to be close to second quarter levels.","Our year-to-date market share is 40%, in line with our full year guidance. We shipped 15,000 units to the U.S. medium-duty truck market this quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year. We continue to expect a full year market size of approximately 109,000 units in 2013, an increase of 2%. Our products are performing extremely well in terms of reliability and fuel economy, leading to market share gains. We now project our full year market share will be 60%, up from our previous guidance of 52% and up from 38% just 5 years ago.","Demand from Chrysler increased in the second quarter by 10%. Due to a weak first quarter though caused by Chrysler's model year changeover and tough comparisons in the second half of 2013, we expect unit shipments to decline by 10% for the full year, in line with our previous forecast.","Our international revenues decreased by 4% in the second quarter, with the most significant declines in India and Europe offsetting growth in Brazil and China. Our revenues in Brazil increased 22%, with improvements in engines and Components driven by stronger on-highway demand.","We are maintaining our forecast for industry growth in truck production of 19% this year. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, increased 8% year-over-year, with the increase due mainly to a higher demand in truck and bus markets. In the medium- and heavy-duty truck market, demand increased by 35% in the second quarter, driven largely by uncertainty regarding the implementation of NS4 emissions regulations that were scheduled to be in effect on July 1, 2013.","Year-to-date industry sales are up 10%, and we now expect full year demand to increase by 5% over 2012 compared to our previous forecast the market will be flat year-over-year. NS4 was supposed to be implemented nationally in China on July 1. Implementation has not started nor has there been official delay of the standard. There's a lot of activity by industry participants to try to assist the government in forming the implementation plans, which achieves a transition to NS4 technology but deals with the incomplete availability of the low-sulfur fuel, especially in the center and the west of the country. In the meantime, approximately 40 cities or regions have announced the implementation of NS4, though it's unclear if they have begun issuing new certifications in any of these jurisdictions. There's a lot of uncertainty among end users and industry participants anticipate [ph] as to what is going on -- going to happen. Though most expect the government to announce a transition plan of some kind in the near future, we do not expect a rapid transition to full NS4 compliance technology and expect very modest volumes of these products to be sold during 2013.","Demand for excavators remained weak in the second quarter with industry sales up 5% against weak comparisons but down 12% year-to-date. We continue to expect no growth in this market in 2013 as OEMs continue to reduce inventory.","Volumes and revenues at our light-duty joint venture with Foton grew in the second quarter, with revenues for the domestic market up 66%. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of 70%, as Foton continues to produce more vehicles equipped with our joint venture engines.","Power Generation revenues in China, including joint ventures, were flat year-over-year in the second quarter, consistent with the overall weak economy. Revenues for the year are expected to be in line with 2012, consistent with our prior forecast.","For the full year, we still expect that our total revenues in China will be up 5%, with strong growth in light-duty engine and modest growth in medium- and heavy-duty trucks, offsetting weakness in off-highway markets.","Moving to India. Business conditions remain weak, and our second quarter revenues, including joint ventures, declined 12% year-over-year due to the weak truck market and the impact of depreciation of the rupee against the dollar.","Industry production for the medium and heavy commercial vehicle market declined 6% in the second quarter, and we expect full year decline of 12%, consistent with our previous guidance. In our Power Generation business in India, we now expect full year unit growth of 8%, down slightly from our prior forecast of growth of 10%. We expect full year revenues from all businesses in India, including joint ventures, to decline by 11%.","In Europe, we experienced a 3% decline in revenues year-over-year. Revenue in the Components business increased by 17%, due mainly to the acquisition of the urea doser business completed in the third quarter of 2012. This increase was offset by continued weakness in the Power Generation business.","Overall, I was pleased with our performance in the second quarter and particularly with the improvement in profitability from the first -- from first quarter levels. I remain very confident about our ability to execute both in strong and weak markets, as well as our prospects for sustained profitable growth when global markets recover. I look forward to sharing our plans with you in more detail at our upcoming Analyst Day in September.","Thank you for your interest today. And now I will turn it over to Pat.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were $4.5 billion, an increase of 2% from a year ago and included record revenues for both the Components and Distribution segments. Sales in North America, which represents 52% of our second quarter revenues, were up 7% from a year ago due to stronger demand in the light-duty and medium-duty truck markets, growth in our Power Generation business and from acquisitions in the Distribution business completed in the last 12 months. International sales decreased by 4% as a result of weaker demand in Power Generation and in mining markets.","Gross margins were 25.5% of sales, down from 27.2% last year. This decrease was driven by the impact of unfavorable mix and higher warranty costs, partially offset by the benefit of improved pricing and from lower material costs.","Selling, admin and research and development costs were down $13 million from last year and positively impacted our EBIT margin by 50 basis points. Joint venture income of $108 million was up 4% compared to a year ago. Compared to last year, higher earnings in China offset lower earnings in North America. The reduction in JV earnings in North America was partly driven by the impact of acquisitions.","Earnings before interest and tax were $621 million or 13.7% of sales for the quarter, though earnings per share was $2.20. This compares to 14.9% of sales last year and earnings per share of $2.45, excluding special items. The tax rate was 28.1% for the quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, sales were up 15%. The engine and Components businesses benefited from increasing demand in on-highway markets. We also saw revenue increases in power generation markets and from the impact of the acquisition in the Distribution business. Gross margins increased 110 basis points when compared to the first quarter, due to the increase in volumes across all 4 business segments and from lower warranty and material costs.","Selling, admin and research and development costs were $35 million higher but 140 basis points lower as a percent of sales, compared to last quarter as we successfully leveraged spending on higher revenue. Joint venture income of $108 million was up 32% compared to the prior quarter. The sequential increase was driven by higher contribution from joint ventures in China, where truck and power generation demand was stronger compared to the first quarter of 2013. And the earnings before interest and tax were $621 million or 13.7% of sales compared to the 11.1% we reported last quarter, which represents an incremental EBIT margin of 31%.","Let's now move on to the operating segments and further discuss second quarter performance and outlook for the full year. In the engine segment, revenues were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 7% from last year. The decrease was driven by a lower demand in heavy-duty truck in oil and gas markets in North America and by a 38% decrease in global mining revenues. This weakness was partially offset by improving demand in the Brazilian, North American and European medium-duty truck markets and from stronger demand in North America and Latin America for engines for agricultural applications. Compared to the prior quarter, sales were up 15%. Sequentially, we experienced stronger demand in North America truck and bus markets and saw modest improvements in most industrial markets, except mining, which declined by 11%.","Segment EBIT was $339 million or 12.8% of sales, down from 13.2% last year as a result of unfavorable product mix. This was partially offset by improved pricing, lower material costs and higher joint venture income. Sequentially, the increase in volume and higher joint venture income resulted in EBIT margins increasing by 430 basis points. Overall, the engine business delivered very strong EBIT margins, considering the shipments of high horsepower engines declined by 38% year-over-year and 14% sequentially.","For the full year, we continue to forecast that revenue for the engine segment will be down 5%, driven by weakness in industrial markets, particularly mining, and from lower full year demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market. This will be partially offset by improved demand in the Brazilian truck market and market share gains in the North American medium-duty truck market. We are raising EBIT projections for the full year to 10.5% to 11.5% of sales. This compares to our full year 2012 margin, excluding restructuring, of 11.8%.","In the Components segment, second quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, a record for the segment and up 8% from last year and 10% from the prior quarter. Compared to the prior year, higher revenues were primarily driven by stronger international demand for aftertreatment systems and the impact of the doser business acquired last year. Compared to last quarter, sales increases in all 4 businesses within the segment were driven by growth in on-highway markets in North America, China, Brazil and in Europe. Segment EBIT was $136 million or 12.2% of sales, up from 11.2% last year.","Higher volumes, along with lower material costs, resulted in the improvement in margins compared to a year ago. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins increased by 50 basis points, primarily due to the stronger volumes.","We now expect full year revenue growth of 7% compared to a prior forecast of 2%, primarily due to increased market share in the North American medium-duty truck market, and we are raising EBIT projections for the full year to between 11.5% and 12.5% of sales, largely due to the increased volumes. This compares to our full year 2012 margin of 10.8%.","In the Power Generation segment, second quarter sales were $814 million, down 10% from the prior year and an increase of 9% sequentially. Year-over-year weakness in most industrial and international markets was partially offset by stronger demand in our North American business. Sequentially, we saw improving demand in North America, China and Brazil, partially offset by weaker demand in India. EBIT margins were 9.3% of sales in the quarter, down from 10.3% last year. The negative impact of lower volumes was partially offset by pricing actions. EBIT margins improved compared to last quarter, growing from 6.8% of sales to 9.3%. Increased volumes and joint venture income, combined with lower warranty expense and improved operational execution, all contributed to the margin improvement.","For 2013, we continue to expect sales to be down 3% compared to last year, primarily due to weakness in Europe and in Russia. We are maintaining our EBIT projections for the full year of between 8.5% and 9.5% of sales.","And for the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $954 million, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year and 23% compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, second quarter revenues increased 1% from the prior year and 13% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, stronger North American power generation demand was partially offset by weakness in North American oil and gas markets and in global mining markets.","So EBIT increased in dollar terms both year-over-year and from last quarter. EBIT margins as a percent of sales declined by 1.1% from a year ago and down 1.7% from the previous quarter. And both comprises acquisitions added to the EBIT dollars, but with the biggest driver of the lower EBIT percent. Sequentially, we also experienced the mix shift away from aftermarket to whole goods, which also contributed to the reduced EBIT percent.","For 2013, we continue to forecast 10% growth in revenue over the prior year. However, we now expect that a greater proportion of the growth will come from acquisitions and less from organic growth than we previously expected. We are reducing EBIT projections for the year to between 10.5% and 11.5% of sales, due to lower organic growth, the dilutive impact on EBIT percent from acquisitions and the expected negative impact of currency in the second half of the year, assuming that exchange rates at the end of the second quarter prevail for the remainder of the year.","As Tom mentioned, for the company, we have adjusted revenue guidance to the top of a previously announced range. We now project total Cummins' revenues to be flat in 2013 when compared with 2012 levels. We continue to project EBIT margins for the company will be in the range of 13% to 14% of sales, and as is typical for our business, we currently expect the earnings for the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third quarter, as the impact of OEM summer shutdowns and seasonal declines in joint venture volumes, particularly in China, impact third quarter results.","We are now projecting the tax rate to be 29.1% in 2013, excluding any discrete items. Finally, with regards to cash flow, we produced $532 million in cash flow from operations in the second quarter. And through the first half of the year, we've produced almost $1 billion in cash flow from operations, more than double the amount during the same period in 2012. Our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in our business. We will invest between $750 million and $800 million in capital expenditure, slightly below our previous projection. And we will continue to return cash to our shareholders.","Earlier this month, we declared a 25% increase in our dividend. With this announcement, we have increased the dividend by total of 237% over the last 4 years. We also repurchased 2.6 million shares in the second quarter, and in doing so, we completed the $1 billion share repurchase program authorized by the board in 2011, and we began repurchases under the new $1 billion program authorized at the end of 2012. We have now repurchased 50 million shares over the past 4 years. Our second quarter results represent solid improvement from the first quarter, and we demonstrated with -- that with increased volumes, we can deliver good incremental margins and generate strong positive cash flow.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark A. Smith","Okay, thanks, Pat. Operator, we are now ready to move to questions and answers. [Operator Instructions] Thank you very much.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a first question from the line of Andrew Casey from Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First on Components, margin was quite a bit higher than I expected. Could you run through what the material cost impact was on margins?","Patrick J. Ward","You're talking year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter, Andy?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Year-over-year.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. So for year-over-year, there was about a 1.5 percentage improvements in material costs for the Components margin through material cost.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the engine side on the joint ventures, the Beijing Foton Cummins had quite a sequential improvement and increased to 9 million in the quarter from 1 million in the first quarter. Is there anything special behind that or is that all -- it's hard to see the volume improvement from the retail sales data that was out.","Richard J. Freeland","Andy, this is Rich. Couple of things, about half of that is volume and so leveraging the volume going forward. The other -- there is a onetime -- or not a onetime, but a warranty improvement that we've seen there. So that product is performing very well. And so we've been able to adjust the accrual rate down in Q2. So about half of that gain was warranty and about half of it's the incrementals from the volumes.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Would that warranty level be a catch-up or would it continue on the...","Richard J. Freeland","That's a catch-up, but we'll also adjust the rates down going forward.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Remember how those work, Andy? So we set a rate and then we have actual experience. And then if our actual experience is different enough, then we adjust the liability and that's the point that when you say catch-up, what you're doing is adjusting the liability, but then you also lower the rates going forward, which means you're lowering ongoing expense. So we do both things at once. And of course, if the reverse is true and warranty goes up, you have to do the other thing. You have to figure out how to add the liability and then increase your -- but in Foton, we've had good experience on the -- at the engine quantity, which has allowed us to lower the liability and lower the ongoing rate going forward, which is good news.","Operator","We have a next question from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tom, as we think about your business, once the China national 4 standards are ultimately implemented, whenever that is, can you just give us a sense for how your discussions with other engine manufacturers are tracking? Can you get your aftertreatment market share at the similar levels that you have in your turbocharger business? And can you give us your latest sense on content per unit of aftertreatment based on the latest sets of configurations that you've seen?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, the aftertreatment business is still, I would say, is unclear what the competitive landscape is going to be because there's just been such uncertainty about the NS4 standards. I mean, obviously, we're coming to market with a set of competitive products, not just one. We'll have a set of competitive products in the aftertreatment business with our full intention of gaining significant market share with our JV engines, as well as with other people's engines. But I would just say, right now, the landscape's unclear because the enforcement of the standards is unclear, how fast it's going to move. I mean, one thing is clear, at least to me, is that it's not going to go fast this year. Other than that, it's not so clear how fast it's going to go. I think the stronger the enforcement of the reg, the higher our market share will be. And weaker the enforcement, the more a competitive other products might be. So we just don't know. We're ready to compete in whatever this thing turns out, but I just would say that's how high a market share we can reach relative to turbos is uncertain. But that's certainly our target. I mean, that's where we're headed. Our view is that we're competing in China like it's our home market. So we compete on the terms of competition there and we're going to win.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in the U.S. Components business, pretty massive win on the Navistar medium-duty aftertreatment. Can you just flesh out for us your production plan to support the additional business? Is it as simple as adding a ship? Do you have capacity to do that just so we can get a sense for operating leverage next year?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, I think we have capacity. We've had to do some significant planning as you guessed for that, especially on the supply side. So we've had to do a bunch of work with suppliers to make sure that we have adequate capacity. You remember in the past, when things peaked out, we had capacity limitations on the insides of the aftertreatment system, both coatings as well as bricks. And so we've done a lot of planning on that to make sure we have adequate capacity, not just for the start but for when things get stronger. And I think we've got a good position on that. I'm not worried about our ability to ramp with that. I mean, they are the mid-range business that they've transferred to us. It's not all ramping at the same time, so we have plenty of ability to kind of ramp up with them. But as I said, the important thing is making sure we're planning to have adequate capacity for all customers at the peak of the market, not just to the start. So we feel good about that as the net answer.","Operator","We have a next question from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My first question, could you talk a little bit about what drove the Power Gen demand in North America? What specific segments, what size of product? Just a little bit of clearing that would be helpful.","N. Thomas Linebarger","The strongest business growth we've had, I mean, this is about -- as you know, we had to do a lot of different business, but the growth has mostly come from the military business. You remember this contract that we won some time ago to supply this forward operating base generator instead of the one that they send to every base, and that business has been ramping up over most of the last year. And we're now sending them at reasonably large volumes and we've got the line quite productive now. It's a good piece of business for us. And in the midst of a market, which is pretty weak across the board, that's been a really good win for us. So that's been most of the growth.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that will wind down when?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Not anytime soon. So it's still -- because it's really, over time, it's replacement of all the generators out there. So it's -- at what rate it increases is really the question as opposed to whether it's going away. I mean, there's obviously, with sequestration, things like that, there's always a question what military priorities are. But so far, we've been able to keep demand rates up pretty high from the military.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Good. That's great color. And then 2 real quick follow-ups. On the Chinese demand, can you talk about when the joint venture with LiuGong will become material to the business?","Richard J. Freeland","Yes. We'll go into production next year and begin ramping up. We've got capacity for 50,000 units therein. And so it'll begin to become material next year and then full production in 2015.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And a real quick follow-up on the same sort of question on the 12-liter natural gas engine with Westport. We heard a lot of pent-up demand on the alternative fuels conference a couple of weeks ago. When would you expect that business to start to become material?","Richard J. Freeland","Well we've -- as you know, we introduced in April with some of the ratings and we said we would bring out the full ratings in August. And so we're on track with that. In fact, we're about 3 weeks ahead of schedule. And so there is lots of interest. As you know, the products are really just now getting in the market. The feedback on them is terrific. And so there's a lot of excitement for it. I think just putting it in perspective, we still see over the next couple of years, that's 2% to 3% of the total truck market. And longer term, we're thinking 5% to 10% over a 5- to 10-year period.","N. Thomas Linebarger","And I think, Ann, this is where kind of disagreement starts among different people with different interest in the truck market. Nobody really knows what final percent natural gas will be of the truck market. Some of it will depend on fuel prices and some of it will depend on other factors about buildout of availability and things like that. But this is where it kind of gets -- people kind of lose track of things. If you're very invested in natural gas business, you'll be thinking that because there's a lot of interest, there'll be hundreds of thousands of units in no time. Most of us that have been watching all of the units don't really think that's very likely. It doesn't mean it's not of great interest. There are some customers who think that this is the answer to their problems. In fact is, though, if you look at all the orders and all of the buys in total, most people are buying a few now to try them, as opposed to replacing their whole fleet. And we'll see what happens after they try them, at what rate people change. But I think Rich has kind of given you sort of the middle-of-the-road consensus view that maybe it gets to 10% or 5% or something like that over some period of time. But we're prepared for all of those eventual outcomes. But it's just kind of what we see right now and we are working very actively to get that 12-liter in as many peoples' hands, who want to try it, as we can, while still making sure we're doing our normal quality launch. So we perform -- with every launch of a new product, we make sure we have good infant care, we know every customer who's got it, we're tracking everything really closely and that's really important in this market just like every other. So we're doing that as we go.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I obviously agree with you on the outlook for the natural gas side of the things. So I'll leave it there and get back in line.","Operator","We have a next question from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. Just one, could you give a little color on just sort of what you saw in mining in the quarter in terms of OEM aftermarket, how much that was down? And then, I guess, my other question is sort of, I guess, longer term. As I think about your implied margins in the back half of the year, I think the midpoint implies like 14.5%, which is pretty healthy. So, Pat, I'm just wondering as I can make my own assumptions about 2014, but is there any reason to believe going forward that, assuming some volume growth, we still can't get to 20% incremental because the margins are looking pretty robust as we exit the year?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Well, good, Jamie. I'll start with mining and then Pat can chip in on the profitability. So in Q2, our engine shipments were down 40% in mining year-over-year, which is kind of in line with what we said for the full year of 40% to 45%. Our aftermarket revenues were down slightly, although they have increased from fourth quarter levels, both in Q1 and Q2. For the full year, we've said total revenue was down 27% including parts. We're kind of tracking along that range, plus or minus a little.","Patrick J. Ward","Then on the margin question, Jamie, I think we're obviously very pleased with the incrementals that we've seen in the second quarter. And while nobody talked too much detail of the 2014 just now, we're still targeting that 28% incremental EBIT margin over the long term, so there has been no deviation on that particular target.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Are there any particular sort of cost savings that are hitting the back half the year that you could quantify or no? I'm just -- because if you look at the back half the year, I think your top line, if we look at the back half versus first half, it implies, I think, 5.5%, 6% growth and 25% EBIT growth. So I'm just trying to get comfort with the back half. And also then, of course, what it implies for going forward?","Patrick J. Ward","I think the one segment that we are looking for continued improvement in the second half of the year is Power Gen. So engines picked up really nicely in Q2. We expect Rich and his team will continue at those levels as we go forward. I think, and Paul [ph] is having a terrific year or on track to deliver their guidance. Power Gen are 8%, just over 8% for the first half the year, so they're going to have to pick up about 1 point, 1.5 point to hit the midpoint of their guidance. That's where the biggest batch is going to come from. But I'm really pleased with the full desk [ph] Tony and his team has made in the second quarter around their business. The other factor to keep in mind here, it's going to get a bit technical. But in the first half of year, we built up about $200 million in inventory. And that had a negative headwind on trough and inventory that takes our -- you see that in the eliminations column [indiscernible]. We are not expecting to build up $200 million of inventory in the second half the year, so that should help us.","Operator","Next question is from that line of Eric Crawford from UBS.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the CapEx, could you speak to some of the factors leading to the 9% lower guidance? Is that a function of the competitive dynamic easing as competitors dial back their own CapEx or more of a shift in your growth outlook for certain markets? Any color would be helpful.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, we took it down a little bit. There's been a couple of projects overseas, facility projects we're getting approvals from the local authorities, took longer than what we anticipated. So construction's about 3 months behind what we intended to be. So that's going to carry into next year. That's really the biggest driver. The rest is really just tweaking around the edges. There hasn't been anything significant that we've got back in the capital. It's more of a timing issue.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the Distribution guidance. And sorry if I may have missed it. But I'm looking at the biggest uptick in your EBIT guidance -- in your EBIT margin guidance is in that segment, but you haven't touched the revenue. So just wondering if you can reconcile what the drivers are for the better margin performance there?","Patrick J. Ward","Great, we actually lowered that one, Eric.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Did you? From?","Patrick J. Ward","From prior guidance. We dropped it to full percentage point because we're getting more of the revenue from acquisitions, which is dilutive.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, engine's the one, and Components, they went up and then Distribution went down. And the Distribution, remember, what's going on with Distribution is the profitability of the businesses are still doing about the same. So the area that we highlighted in the business was that the aftermarket-related mining and oil and gas has been weaker in the last couple of quarters than we've seen in prior years and that's just related to those markets. But broadly speaking, the business is still doing about the same and then we have the situation whereas you buy a joint venture distributor, you now consolidate the sales, which you're 100% up, I mean, and you bring in 50% of the earnings. So that's a little bit of an effect on the EBIT margin. So other than that though, not a lot of changes in the Distribution business.","Operator","We have a next question from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just coming back a little bit to the question on margins in the back half. Last quarter, you had given us a little bit of color on how margin's trended through the quarter. I was wondering if you could do the same this time. If you're calling for, say, Power Gen to have a little bit better margin contribution in the second half, were things looking better towards the end of Q2?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, things were fine all the way through the quarter, Alex. There wasn't anything of behavior that we talked a bit back in January and February.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, okay, fair enough. And then switching over to North America heavy truck. You brought down your full year market expectation. Are you in the camp -- I know you're probably not going to talk too much about 2014. But just generally speaking, from a marketwide standpoint, are you in the camp that would believe that anything that we're cutting in 2013 in terms of heavy-duty truck volume are just going to get back into 2014?","N. Thomas Linebarger","I think our cut was so small. We took 4,000 units out of the 250,000 markets. So I really wouldn't look at it that way. I think longer term, we think all the fundamentals are pretty good that you look at, yet no one is expanding their fleet size. So we're kind of in a replacement mode right now. So you've seen a little bit of time, so maybe a little bit of timing, but I wouldn't declare that kind of a one-for-one.","Richard J. Freeland","The one thing you hear, Alex, is that because we've been below replacement value numbers for so many years and it's that what we're doing here is replacing, doesn't -- at one point, don't you have to catch back up again. Even if you've taken out, you've stretched out the amount of time someone will haul the truck. Doesn't there need to be some production over retail demand for some period of time? There's a lot of discussion about that and we do believe that that has to be the case. How much and for how long? We don't know, but we just don't know when. And so that's why I think it's hard to say, \"Well this is 4,000. It goes next year.\" But we do believe based on talking to customers and things that there is -- there will be a point when people will buy more trucks than they're retiring for some period of time in order to kind of restock to some level. We just don't know when it's going to be. And we think most of it has to do with the confidence in the U.S. economy. So when people believe that due to whatever sort of debt budget and debt deal or whatever set of combination of things, people get confidence again about the U.S. economy, we think that's when it will happen.","Operator","We have a next question from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies & Company.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sort of along that same line, Tom, I'm wondering sort of, I guess, how the Navistar project is going in terms of ramp and so forth? And I guess what I'm trying to think about is if these things remain sort of flattish that they seem to be for the overall industry, that would still be seem like you might have some opportunity for growth with that new project?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Rich is really close to that. I'll let Rich talk to that.","Richard J. Freeland","Okay. So a couple of things. First, we're on track with introducing the 15-liter where we thought we'd be. So we're engineered in where the market share between the '13 and '15 is right about 15%, which is where we projected. And kind of as you stated, the thing that's behind a bit is Navistar's share in the market. And so I do know and they publicly stated their plans and they've got solid plans to increase that. But it's a tough business and tough competitors out there, and we know them well and we supply them. And so I think we will see improvement in the Navistar share. I think for us, we still view the net of all of that is about the 40% range. And that's where we are year-to-date. You'll see some month-to-month variation around that, but I think the 40% is solid when you put all the variables together that we're looking at.","N. Thomas Linebarger","But as you said, we do -- that is up from our -- some -- before we were working with Navistar, so we do think that helps a little bit. We also think the midrange business, as we talked about aftertreatment, is going to help our Components business. So there is incremental business for us relative to where we were before we started working with Navistar even in a flat market. But because there -- it is a competitive market and because we supply some other really terrific partners, PACCAR [indiscernible] who are going to fight for their share too. It's not going to be dramatic move month-to-month. It's going to -- there's a lot of people fighting in a flat market.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then I guess, just maybe more broadly if you would, I appreciate the outlook on the markets by end market and geography and so forth. But everything sounds fairly sort of flattish to me as we look going forward. And I guess I'm just wondering as you have these conversations with your consumers, do you get a sense that things are sort of bottoming in any of these end markets? Is there a reason to be optimistic in certain areas or end markets?","N. Thomas Linebarger","You noticed that too, did you, the flattish tone? Yes, it is pretty flattish. I mean, that really is how it is. I mean, I think Latin America is a notable exception. When you go -- when I go to Latin America, I was there not too long ago. Things are definitely moving in the positive direction. Brazil, we had talked about but it's true really and Spanish-speaking Latin America too. Mexico is pretty good. I mean, this quarter, the size, generally speaking, has been pretty good. But I would say in India, the trend is not good. It's not only is it not bottoming, it's hard to say kind of what's -- when it's going to bottom, but I don't think it's bottomed yet. I don't think it's going to get a lot weaker, but it's not strong. China is the most perplexing. It really is flattish. It's not getting a lot worse, but it's not getting a lot better either. There's clearly a lot of pent-up demand. When you visit there, you will definitely hear all the reasons why next week it's going to be taking off and doing great. It just turns out that that's not been true for some time. So my own view is that China is the one where if it got going, a lot of other things would get going. But right now, I just don't see that in the near term. The one with the most positive potential short term is the U.S. I think if we can get some confidence in the U.S., we would see -- turn, at least in our businesses in the U.S., pretty quickly. We talked about the truck, but it would be true in Power Gen and other things as well. And that would be a pretty good boost to demand for a whole bunch of companies like us, and we'd be ready to respond with capacity. And again, whether that's going to happen or not is another question. But right now, I think the flattish view is about right. It doesn't seem like it would take a whole bunch to change the fortunes of the U.S. and China in the market to at least get a little bit better and that would make a big difference. I don't think India is going to turn so quickly. But I think China and the U.S. could, but when? I don't know. We're just kind of planning for that flattish. I mean, what you see from us in our estimation for this year is sort of that flattish view.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Mining bottoming or no?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, looks like it. I mean, it's not very good, though. It's not very good, but it's bottoming. I mean, it's hard to say for sure. Rich, you've been talking to mining customers more, what are you hearing?","Richard J. Freeland","I mean, I think we're close to bottom, but I think there's still some pressures to take that down. I mean, all the mining houses have balance sheet problems now. They've turned over their leadership. They're trying to get -- they're driving to take capital down and so I think we're close to the bottom, but there could be another small step there down.","N. Thomas Linebarger","And then the only thing I guess I would add is that there are some emissions changes coming up, which we think stimulates some demand for us, even in flat markets. So obviously, we're hoping for some good recovery in 2014. That'd be terrific. But we also have some sort of noncyclical things going on. We've got Tier 4. We've got Euro 6 coming. Each of which are going to increase content and increase demand some of our businesses, irrespective of volumes going up.","Operator","We have a next question from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just want to dig in a little bit to the guidance for the overall joint ventures and just specifically kind of how you're thinking about the interplay between the manufacturing businesses in North American Distribution, given what you discussed earlier in terms of -- as you're consolidating more of those North American partners, obviously, that's -- it'll be a drag on that -- on the JV line. But I guess I'm just trying to get at, has your underlying view in terms of the profitability in manufacturing business has changed over the last, say, quarter or so?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Now I think strategically -- I can let Pat or Mark talk a little bit about more of the accounting if you want to. But strategically, our view is our growth prospects, as I had mentioned in my remarks, remain equally favorable from a manufacturing business. What we've been doing over the years, and we've been doing across the world, is acquiring more of our Distribution business so that we can get some of the system benefits of having a consistently coordinated Distribution system. A lot of the product we sell is highly technical. We've talked about mining as an example. And our customers are looking for very technical -- technically capable support. And they want support whether or not they bought a lot of engines this month or last month or 2 years ago. And they want consistent support region to region. Marine business, Power Gen business, these customers are now spanning geographic regions. So our old network idea of most customers operating within one geographic region has, over years, just come under more and more pressure. So as we operate as an overall system, we're able to say to a customer, \"If you do business with us, you'll experience the same technical support, same service, same quality at all parts of our network that service you.\" And we can make the investments necessary to do it. It's one thing to say you're going to do it. It's another to have the investments in place, technical, people, tools, et cetera, and we need to make sure we make those investments in a coordinated and on-time way. So that's what's driving the changes in strategy as opposed to any lack of confidence in the growth of the manufacturing business.","Richard J. Freeland","Just add one thing, Tom, so I think we got a pretty mature joint ventures in the manufacturing space, the DCEC, CCEC, and those are going to move with the market. But we've got a few others that were coming through in investment period that we see some really nice growth opportunity. We talked about Foton, but we -- also, we have the new joint venture in LiuGong with Hyundai that are both coming through in an investment period that then move into profitable businesses and growth businesses. And then we talked about even the Westport with the 12-liter gas becoming a part of that portfolio. So several pretty positive ones were coming through in investment period over the last 2 or 3 years.","N. Thomas Linebarger","That's a good point. We are adding more new joint ventures in faster than we're taking them out by acquisitions, for sure. So I think Rich is right that there's a big potential growth still on the joint venture line coming from the non-Distribution side.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Pat, any update on the outlook in terms of the full year expectations for -- in terms of the gross margin impact from pricing and raw material costs? Or is that...","Patrick J. Ward","No, I don't think it's changed very much since last time we talked. But we're still thinking close to 1% from pricing and close to 1% from material cost and we've experienced that really through the first half of the year and expect that to continue as we go through the next 6 months.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you wanted to touch at all on the September 17th Analyst Meeting that's coming up. Maybe just set some expectations and how we should be thinking about what we should hear at that meeting.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Well we'll -- I'll let Pat add some detail but in our typical fashion, what we're going to try to do is update people on the strategy of the company, what, if anything, has changed from a point of view strategy and our look at the environment over the next 3 to 5 years. We'll lay out a new model for what we think financially we're going to be doing over that time. And as we've done before, we'll look at different economic scenarios and see how the company will perform over those times and try to demonstrate that we're setting targets that are on financials that are appropriate for shareholders in all kinds of markets, be them weak or strong. We'll make sure that we talk about that. We'll also highlight -- we'll have our business leaders there. We'll have our big international leaders there who can talk about what are some of the key things going on, both from a view of market but also what are the key initiatives, what strategic initiatives we're running to make sure we capture growth in those regions and businesses. So pretty typical for us. Again, a lot of interactions with our leadership and a lot of opportunity to hear color on how we think we're going to achieve the financial targets we're setting out, as well as whether those financial targets are appropriate given shareholder expectations. Pat, I don't know...","Patrick J. Ward","I think you covered it, Tom. I think we'll talk a little about 2015 and what's different from what we indicated 2 years ago. And then we'll talk beyond that what we think for the next 3 or 4 years we think we can do.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I think what I'm trying to figure out is obviously goals from a couple years ago, understandably, the revenues have to come down and maybe the margins as well. But at the same time, maybe less growth also frees up some use of the balance sheet in a more aggressive fashion. And if I recall correctly, I don't think last time you really incorporated a ton of the use of the balance sheet, getting to more, I would call, appropriate leverage financially in your outlook. Could we see with maybe a slower top line baked into the longer-term targets a more aggressive use of your balance sheet? Because, as I've asked in the past, I'm still surprised you're running at such a heavy net cash position?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Well, the one thing we did cover last time and we expect to cover again is how do we intend to use the cash that we generate because, of course, the cash we've generated is not a surprise. It's pretty much in line with what we expected. We talked about what percentage of the cash we think we'll invest in the business, which has been tracking pretty closely to what we said. And then what are we going to do with the rest? So we think it's -- again, from our point of view, as we talked to analysts and shareholders about this kind of thing. We think it's basically shareholders' money, not ours. So what we're talking to them about is here's our intention to use it to grow the company and therefore grow the value of their company and then secondly, the things that we don't think we can use to grow the business, how we're going to make sure that they get it returned to them and they can use it somewhere else. Broadly speaking, we will give that guidance again. We will, of course, get questions and discuss whether or not our balance sheet is too conservative or not conservative enough and all those kinds of things. We will -- we've got those questions the last time and we'll get them again this time. And as you guessed, there's a difference of opinion between shareholders as to how to deal with that and we were, of course, talking to all of our shareholders about exactly that question. We really feel obligated to them to use their resources in a way that they think is appropriate, and so we talk to them regularly about that question and we're still doing that. And I think that the one you can say, whether you agree with our strategy or not, is that we are living our strategy. So as you look at the share repurchases we've done, you look at the dividend purchases we've done, you look at investments we've made in the business, they are very consistent to what we said we would do and we are continuing to do it as we look forward.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I keep telling myself -- what's telling about what you just said there was, again, how to use the cash you are going to generate. As of the current financial leverage, it's okay to maintain. Because I still look at -- you can write a check for $2 billion, buy back 9%, 10% of the company right now, and still have net debt-to-cap below 15%. But it just sounds like, again, even September 17, whatever guidance we're going get, even though it's a slower growth environment from 2 years ago, it's only about spending the cash you're going to generate, not changing their current financial leverage. Is that correct?","N. Thomas Linebarger","I think you should wait for the day. I mean, it'll be a good encouragement for you to come, I hope, to hear whether we'll address that directly. And by the way, the question that you're asking has been asked by others. It's not new to us. So it's not that we're not -- we don't have a tin ear. We got it. We heard the question. We are looking at that among a whole bunch of other strategies. And we -- I'd love to be able to address your question at that meeting with more detail and more financials. So please come and ask it. It's a good one.","Operator","We have one more question from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So industrial overall revenue and engine revenue was up sequentially for the first time since 2011. You had mentioned the 20% sequential increase in shipments. This is despite mining being down 11%, you said. So are we seeing a modest inflection in this business? And can you talk about your confidence level of overall high horsepower engines bottoming here in terms of shipments?","Patrick J. Ward","It's firstly the volume trajectory in industrial is on the construction side, Andy. So it's not the high horsepower units are down sequentially on the year-over-year, and Rich can talk a bit more about that. So we did see and as we anticipated in our first quarter call, sequentially industrial volumes improved primarily in North America in 1 or 2 international markets.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, maybe highlight those markets, Rich.","Richard J. Freeland","We're seeing, all around the construction, with housing up, it's helping us. We're seeing that. We're seeing agricultural business up good. And then we're seeing some modest improvements kind of across the board once you back the mining out and once you back the oil and gas out, which are both, as we've talked about, down.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, Rich, were these anticipated improvements or maybe a little better than you thought? I think they're just kind of in line with what you would have expected?","Richard J. Freeland","A little better. A little better than what we've expected on those sides. And mining might have been a little bit worse than we expected.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, we did -- so we tweaked the industrial guidance for the year slightly less negative for the full year. I mean, ag is the one small units for us, but it's up 83% year-over-year, so that's one area where it's probably exceeded our expectations.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then, Tom, maybe if I could ask you about Brazil a little bit more. You didn't change -- if I'm not mistaken, you didn't change your Brazil truck shipment forecast, but you started the year pretty strong. And obviously, there's been some recent political issues down there. So is it conservatism around that or is it something else because I would've expected maybe a slightly tweak higher than that?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. No, I totally get it -- me, too, by the way. But yes, GDP is not doing that well. I mean, overall, Brazil it's definitely showing some signs of slowing again. The government lowered their forecast for GDP. Orders have weakened for trucks. So the signs are that despite a pretty strong start, it doesn't look like it's going to hold up. Again, it doesn't -- it's not plummeting or anything, but it's not doing as well as it was. So that's kind of why we've -- we didn't grab the first quarter and say, \"Okay, now we're going to see this big upturn.\" That because, in fact, things are not quite as strong as we maybe we were hoping. And certainly, it hasn't gone from -- building hasn't gone from strength to strength. And we'll see what happens, but overall, I think the economic growth, while it's there, is not nearly as good as the government was originally hoping for.","Mark A. Smith","Okay, thank you very much.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, everybody.","Mark A. Smith","I'll be available for your follow-up shortly.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Thomas Linebarger","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I will summarize our second quarter results and talk about our key markets. Pat will then take you through more details of our second quarter performance and provide an update on our full year guidance.","We delivered strong profitability in the second quarter despite the challenging economic environment and continued investment in new products and growth initiatives. Revenues for the second quarter were $4.45 billion, a decrease of 4% from the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of currency movements and divestitures, revenues were flat year-over-year.","Second quarter EBIT was $663 million, a decrease of $44 million or 6% compared to the second quarter of 2011, excluding gains related to business divestitures. EBIT percent for the quarter was 14.9%, the second highest in the company's history. Gross margin at 27.2% set a new record for the company, reflecting continued progress in driving productivity and lowering product coverage costs.","For the second half of 2012, revenues increased by 5% -- sorry, for the first half of 2012, revenues increased by 5% over last year, and our EBIT percent increased from 14.6% to 14.8%. We delivered incremental EBIT margins of 19.4%, very close to our long-term targets despite the lower-than-anticipated revenue growth.","As previously announced, we now expect full year revenues to be flat with 2011, a reduction from our previous guidance of 10% growth in revenues. Continued weakness in some international markets, particularly in Brazil and China, coupled with slowing orders in the U.S. truck, oil and gas and Power Generation, have caused us to lower our outlook. I will talk further about our outlook for a number of these markets, and we have included a supplementary slide in today's earnings release presentation that quantified the change in revenue guidance by business segment and by market.","We expect to deliver EBIT margins in the range of 14.25% to 14.75% in 2012, a decrease in our full year guidance of 0.25 point but continuing our trend of increasing profitability year-over-year. In the second quarter, we continued to experience year-over-year growth in North America, offset by weakness in a number of international markets. Although our revenues in North America increased, the rate of growth has slowed recently. Our second quarter revenues grew in North America by 12%, significantly lower than the 40% growth we experienced in the first quarter.","In the North American heavy-duty truck market, our Engine shipments increased by 13% compared to the second quarter last year. Order rates have slowed recently, and we are now lowering our full year market size expectation to 260,000 units, growth of 14% when compared 2011, but down from our previous forecast of 278,000 units. We expect to achieve full year market share of 40%, unchanged from our previous guidance.","Orders in the North American medium-duty truck market have also softened, and we are lowering our market size estimate to 104,000 units from 117,000 units. We continue to expect our market share to exceed 50% for the full year in this market.","Our North American on-highway products continue performed very well in the market. We are very pleased with the reliability of this product as evidenced by our product coverage costs, which declined again this year and by the performance and fuel economy demonstrated by our engines in operation. We have now shipped more than 300,000 engines, equipped with our SCR technology, and the market feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Our market share has grown in both heavy- and medium-duty truck and bus markets in the last 12 months.","Also in North America, demand from Chrysler for the Dodge Ram truck remains strong. Our shipments increased 23% in the second quarter, and we still expect full year shipments to increase by 30%.","In the North American construction market, we experienced strong demand in the second quarter where engine shipments increased 23% year-over-year. On the other hand, demand in the oil and gas market in North America has continued to decline as natural gas prices have remained low. Unit shipments declined by 32% in the quarter, and we now expect full year demand decline by 41% compared to 2011, a change from our previous guidance of a decline of just under 20%.","In mining, our unit shipments declined 6% year-over-year in North America due to lower orders from the coal industry. Globally, strong aftermarket revenues contributed to revenue growth in the mining market year-over-year.","In our Power Generation business, we recorded growth of 23% year-over-year in North America. Unfortunately, we saw the rate of new orders decrease starting in April. Although we have seen some signs of improvement in orders in July, we lowered our expectation for full year growth to 15% from our previous guidance of 20%. Approximately 2\/3 of our Power Generation growth in North America this year is coming from new products rather than underlying market growth.","In international markets, our consolidated revenues declined by 16% year-over-year, with the most significant declines experienced in China and Brazil. In China, our domestic revenues across all end markets, including the revenues of our joint ventures, declined 25% year-over-year in the second quarter. The most significant decline was in the construction market, with our revenues down 55%.","The second quarter 2011 was an extremely strong quarter for this market, and this represents the toughest quarterly comparison for the year. Having said that, demand across the industry remains weak and the rate of GDP growth has slowed, causing a reduction in investments, both in infrastructure and private residential construction.","We have now lowered our full year expectation for industry-wide excavator sales to down 35% from our previous forecast of down 15%. Our production will run below industry sales as OEMs lower their existing inventory levels.","Although the Chinese government has taken steps to stimulate growth, the steps taken so far have been less significant than previous programs and have not been targeted specifically improving short-term demand in the markets that we serve. As a result, we no longer expect any improvement in demand in the second half of the year.","The outlook for the truck market in China has also weakened as overall growth in economy has slowed. We now expect the market, heavy- and medium-duty combined, to decline by 17% compared to our previous forecast of a decline of 10%.","Second quarter Engine revenues were down 29% year-over-year, with volumes marginally higher than the first quarter. Truck volumes will be lower in the second half of the year than the first, with the third quarter expected to be the weakest quarter of the year.","In the Power Generation market, we're also lowering our expectations for 2012 in China. In aggregate, the Chinese economy experienced 0 growth in electricity consumption in the second quarter due to the slowdown in industrial activity.","Second quarter revenues, including joint ventures, declined by 17% from a very strong quarter in 2011. We now expect full year revenues to decline 5% compared to our previous expectation that revenues be flat.","We expect our domestic revenues in China across all end markets and including joint ventures to decline by 13% compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 5%. Decreased demand for construction and truck engines will be partially offset by stronger aftermarket sales and increased sales of light-duty truck engines.","In India, the economy has also slowed. First quarter GDP was 5.3%. It was the lowest recorded in 9 years. Our revenues included -- and revenues, including joint ventures, declined by 4% compared to the second quarter of 2011.","In the truck market, industry-wide sales declined sharply in June, with Tata and other OEMs taking shutdowns as they lowered their build rates. Second quarter production volumes at our Tata Cummins joint venture declined by 35% year-over-year. We now expect industry sales in the Indian truck market to decline by 8% compared to our previous assumption of 7% growth. Declining confidence in the economy coupled with the addition of a new excise tax on commercial vehicles is driving our lower outlook.","In the Power Generation market, demand continues to be driven by power shortages in India despite the weaker economy growth. Shortages have been experienced in a number of regions in the country, increasing demand for our lower horsepower products. Demand for high horsepower products, typically more linked to general infrastructure and economic growth, weakened in the quarter. In total, we expect revenues in rupees to increase 16% year-over-year, but revenues reported in U.S. million are now expected to decline by 1% due to the devaluation of the rupee. Previously, we had expected our revenues in dollar terms to increase by 10%.","In Latin America, our revenues this year continued to be impacted by the difficult transition to the Euro 5 emissions standard in the Brazilian truck market. Unfortunately, the economy in Brazil has also slowed. For the full year, we now expect our total revenues in Latin America to be $1.5 billion, a decline of 17% year-over-year compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 6%.","A lower outlook in the Brazilian truck market, coupled with lower demand for Power Generation in the number of markets in the region, including Brazil and Argentina, is driving the lower outlook. We now expect industry sales in the truck market to decline by 33% compared to our previous expectation of a decline of 19%. Truck prices increased approximately 15% with the implementation of Euro 5 at a time when the Brazilian economy faltered. Consequently, demand for new trucks has been very weak. Through the first 5 months of this year, less than 6,000 Euro 5 trucks have been sold to end users industry-wide.","Despite truck OEMs lowering build rates, Euro 5 truck inventory across the industry built up to approximately 39,000 units at the end of May due to the weak level of retail sales. We expect it will take some time for sales to recover enough to reduce inventories and justify significant increase in industry build rates. Although we anticipate a difficult start to the year, retail sales of Euro 5 trucks have been much weaker than most participants expected.","In Europe, on-highway demand has largely trended as we expected, with full year forecast lowered modestly. Power Generation sales were down 22% year-over-year as demand clearly weakened in the second quarter across most major countries.","As I discussed in our first -- during the first quarter recall, our Power Generation business got off to a slow start in Africa and the Middle East. Importantly, our business improved in the second quarter in both regions. In Africa, second quarter revenues increased 72% year-over-year, and revenues in the Middle East increased 24%.","Clearly, we are experiencing challenging conditions in a number of markets. We are confident that in time demand in Brazil, China, India will improve, and these markets will continue to offer higher growth opportunities than in developed markets. Higher rates of GDP, rising income levels, increasing investment in infrastructure and societal demands to improve air quality will all improve our business.","Despite the weaker economic outlook, we are pleased with our performance in expanding gross margins and continuing to deliver strong profitability. We have taken actions to manage our costs. We remain confident in our long-term prospects as evidenced by the recent announced increase in our dividend.","Our future growth will continue to be driven by the 4 key macroeconomic trends driving our industry: increasing the global emissions standards; the price and availability of energy; globalization; and increased investment in infrastructure, particularly in the developing economies. We will continue to invest in our growth programs to ensure that we benefit from these trends.","Thank you for your interest today, and now I'll turn it over to Pat.","Patrick J. Ward","Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were $4.45 billion, a decrease of 4% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 12% over the prior year, driven by strong demand from on-highway and construction markets while outside of North America, sales were down 16% as a result of weaker demand in several markets, most notably China, Brazil and Europe.","Compared to the first quarter, sales were flat. We experienced low demand in the heavy- and medium-duty truck markets in North America and Brazil and the construction market in China, offset by higher revenues in Power Generation, with the first quarter typically a seasonal low point.","Gross margins were a record 27.2% of sales, up from 25.9% last year despite the lower sales revenues. The improvement over the prior year was driven by manufacturing productivity improvements, price realization, lower warranty and material cost, along with a more favorable product mix. Gross margins also improved compared to the first quarter despite flat revenue as a result of productivity improvements, lower warranty cost and product mix.","Selling, admin and research and development costs were up $54 million from last year and were $18 million higher than the previous quarter. The growth in spending was driven primarily by the search and development for new products. And we've also been investing in distribution network and IT infrastructure.","Joint venture income of $104 million was 11% lower than a year ago and on par with the previous quarter. Year-over-year, more contributions from joint ventures in China and in India were partially offset by an improvement in North American distributors. Sequentially, joint venture contribution was relatively flat.","Second quarter EBIT was $663 million or 14.9% of sales compared to the 15.2% we reported last year, excluding gains related to business divestitures. Compared to the first quarter, EBIT margins improved 20 basis points despite the flat sales revenue. And as Tom just mentioned, for the first half of 2012, EBIT margins improved to 14.8%, up from 14.6% for the same period last year and were also a full 1% better compared to the second half of 2011 despite 7% lower revenues. Earnings per share in the second quarter were $2.45 compared to $2.41 in the second quarter of 2011, excluding gains from business divestitures, and the tax rate was 25% in the quarter.","Let's now move on to the operating segments and discuss second quarter performance and the outlook for the remainder of the year. In the Engine segment, revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 2% over last year. In North America, we experienced stronger demand across on-highway markets and in construction. That was partially offset by weaker demand in the oil and gas market as a result of lower natural gas prices.","Demand in international markets was lower, with on-highway markets in Brazil and construction markets in China showing the more significant declines year-over-year. Foreign currency movements had a negative 2% impact on segment revenues in the quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, sales were down 1%. Demand from heavy- and medium-duty truck markets in North America were lower in the first quarter, but this was partially offset by stronger demand from Chrysler.","Outside of North America, tough markets in Brazil and construction markets in China both were sequentially weaker. Despite lower Engine shipments, segment EBIT was $376 million or 13.2% of sales, up from 13% last year as a result of more favorable product mix, better pricing for parts and industrial engines and lower warranty costs. This was partially offset by weaker contribution from joint ventures in China and India, along with increased spend on growth initiatives. Compared to the first quarter, EBIT margins decreased 10 basis points due to higher warranty costs and research and development spending.","For the full year, we now expect revenue for the Engine segment to be flat with 2011 levels. This is a decrease from our previous guidance of an increase of 10% due to lower-than-expected demand in the on-highway markets in North America and Brazil, as well as in the China construction and the U.S. oil and gas markets. Demand for engines for Power Generation has also slowed. Segment EBIT projections for the full year remain unchanged at 12% to 13% of sales.","In the Components segment, second quarter revenue was $1 billion. Compared to the prior year, revenues were flat with growth in North American on-highway markets offset by lower demand from international on-highway markets, foreign currency movements and the impact of divestitures completed last year. Compared to last quarter, revenues were down 6% as a result of lower demand in on-highway markets in North America, Brazil, China and India. This was partially offset by higher aftermarket demand, primarily for filtration products.","Segment EBIT was $116 million or 11.2% of sales, down from 11.6% last year. Despite flat revenue, gross margins did improve. However, this is more than offset by increased research and development costs and currency movements, which had a negative 50-basis-point impact on EBIT. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins declined 1.8% due primarily to lower volumes and increased selling, admin and research and development costs, some of which were acceptable to the highlight acquisition.","We're now forecasting revenue growth of 5% this year. This is a decrease from our previous guidance of up 10% due to weaker demand in on-highway markets in North America, Brazil and China and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.","Segment margins are now expected to be in the range of 11% to 12% of sales, which is below our previous guidance. The reduction is the result of lower volumes and additional spending associated with the acquisition of Hilite.","In the Power Generation segment, second quarter sales were $909 million, flat with the prior year and 17% higher sequentially. Growth in North America was offset by lower demand in Europe, China and Latin America and from the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.","Sequentially, revenues improved from a seasonally weak first quarter, with the Middle East, North America, U.K. and China showing the largest improvements. Demand in Africa also improved significantly after a weak first quarter.","Segment EBIT margins were 10.3% in the quarter, down from 11.6% last year. Gross margins remain stable. However, increased spending on growth initiatives and lower joint venture income resulted in a decrease in EBIT margins. EBIT margins did improve 60 basis points from the first quarter as a result of stronger volumes and spending on selling, admin and engineering increasing at a lower rate than revenue growth.","For 2012, we now expect segment revenues to be flat with 2011. This is a decrease from our previous guidance of up 5% to 10%. In North America, we now expect growth of 15% compared to our previous expectation of 20% growth. The growth in North America will be offset by lower demand in China, Latin America and Europe. Segment EBIT margins are expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% of sales.","And for the Distribution segment, second quarter revenues were $794 million, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year and 2% compared to the prior quarter. Currency movements reduced revenues by 5% while strong demand for parts and service in most regions offset weaker demand for engines in the oil and gas market in North America and in some segments in Europe.","Compared to the first quarter of 2012, the higher parts and service sales offset weaker demand in the oil and gas market in North America and in the industrial markets in Europe. Segment EBIT margins for the quarter were 11.6%, down from 13.5% a year ago due to the impact of currency and increased spending to build out our Distribution network, particularly in Africa and in China. Compared to last quarter, EBIT margins decreased 50 basis points largely due to foreign exchange and increased SAR spending.","For 2012, we are now forecasting 10% growth over the prior year, with approximately 6% of this growth coming from acquisitions. This represents a reduction from our previous guidance of an increase of 20% due to declining demand for Power Generation equipment in a number of markets, lower engine demand in the oil and gas market in North America and the adverse impact of currency movements.","We expect segment EBIT margins to be in the range of 12% to 13% of sales for the full year. As Tom mentioned, we're now projecting total Cummins revenues to be flat with 2011 levels, with growth in North America being offset by weaker demand in overseas markets. And we estimate that the stronger U.S. dollar will have a $500 million negative impact for the full year.","EBIT margins for the company will be in the range of 14.25% to 14.75% of sales compared to the 14.2% margin we reported last year. Our second half revenues are expected to be 4% or $400 million lower than the second half of 2011. The midpoint of the EBIT guidance assumes second half EBIT margins will be 14.2% of sales, up from the 13.8% we reported last year. And as is normal, the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third quarter.","Our assumptions in our guidance include the contribution from the joint ventures to be down 5% from last year, and the full year tax rate is now forecasted to be 26%.","Finally with regards to cash flow, we now expect to invest between $750 million and $800 million during 2012 on capital projects. While working capital and in particular inventory grew in the second quarter, we expect to reduce this by around $200 million in the second half of the year.","The balance sheet remains strong and pension is well funded, which gives us the ability to invest for growth and provide additional return to shareholders through stock buybacks and increased dividends. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares and earlier this month, we announced a 25% increase in our dividend.","Although revenue growth has slowed in the near term, we remain committed to expanding our EBIT margins. We are pleased with our gross margin and EBIT performance in the second quarter despite the decline in revenues. And while we will continue to invest in critical growth initiatives, we have already adjusted spending plans in view of the reduced outlook for the remainder of the year.","Now let me turn it back over to Mark.","Mark Smith","Thanks, Pat. We do have plenty of time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're now ready for our first question. Jasmin?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you gentlemen say more about the actions you've taken to adjust the cost structure? Are we talking SG&A or production reductions and which businesses are impacted most?","Patrick J. Ward","Well, let me start with that one, Jerry. We've taken actions across the business. But I think it's really important to point out that the critical growth initiatives that we've talked about for some time now, we're not going to cut back on those. So they're really important to the long-term future profitability of the company, and they're kind of sacred. We are cutting back around areas such as travel, and we are looking to reduce the rate of hiring in some areas. We will freeze it in other areas across the company. But it's important we find the right balance of continuing to invest for growth while at the same time managing spending prudently across the company, across all 4 business segments and the corporate areas.","N. Thomas Linebarger","I would just add, Jerry, the leadership team here is pretty experienced with cost-reduction activities. All of us have been through it before. So every one of them in our recent strategy meeting had to come up with a set of reductions that they thought they would implement and still be able to meet the key -- strike a balance that Pat talked about, about investing in the key growth programs and making sure that they can still hit their growth targets and revenue commitments. So that's what we're trying to strike here, and I think every member of the team is committed to doing that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And as a follow-up, I'm wondering, Pat, if you can bridge for us the margins you're targeting in Power Gen and Engines in the back half of the year versus back half of last year? On flat to down sales, you're looking for margins to be flat to up. Can you just step us through the major moving pieces there?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, let me try and take this one, Jerry. I'll give you a high-level bridge from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. And the first half of the year was considerably better than the second half of last year. We do expect revenues to be flat, maybe slightly better in the second half of the year than the first 6 months that we've just gone through. That being said, there are a number of headwinds coming our way, so the product mix is not as favorable in the second half of the year. We've talked about reduction in oil and gas. We've talked about reduction in Power Gen. So in the high horsepower engines where we do have some margins, we see a lot of negative mix going on there. Warranty costs are expected to grow a little bit in the second half of the year. And joint venture income will certainly be down in China and in India, more so in the third quarter, I expect, than the fourth quarter but it's definitely softened. Now on the other hand, we've seen terrific work so far in the manufacturing plants to improve productivity. We expect that will continue as we go into the second half of the year. The supply chain savings that we've talked about, the 1% margin target for 2015, we're on track there, the 0.2% or maybe even a little bit better now this year based on what we've seen in the first 6 months of the year. And finally, material costs are almost certainly going to be better in the second half of the year than what we've seen in the first half of the year. And that's a combination of metal markets being a little bit better than what we thought they're going to be and just ongoing good working cost-reduction with our supply base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two relatively simple questions. One, if you could just expand within North America and Power Gen. Last quarter, you talked about some weakness in orders. You still cited North America is up. I think you said in your prepared remarks that things in July looked a little better. So can you just give a little more color there and comment on the overall competitive environment? And then my second question, just with regards to Pat, as you're thinking about your guidance cut for the year, generally the thing I like about Cummins is you make a cut and it's big so there's not generally risk in the back half. I guess what I'm concerned about is I still look at your North America ACT forecast or your North America truck forecast, which is essentially in line with ACT. So what gives you confidence orders pick up in September? Or could you just speak to where you think the risk is to your guidance in the back half?","Mark Smith","Okay, Jamie. This is Mark. I'll answer the first part of the question on Power Gen and North America. So the first thing to remember is we are expecting 15% revenue growth in North America on Power Gen, but 2\/3 of that is coming from new products rather than the underlying market. And that remained like a stable forecast for the full year. We have seen orders bounce around. So for the base business, originally we're expecting 10% growth for the full year, and we've now lowered that to 5%. We did see a pretty sharp drop in incoming orders around the middle of March, April time, and we talked about that on the Q1 call. Orders stayed down for a while and then have picked up a little bit recently, so a kind of 10% growth underpinned with the new products, 5% from underlying market. I think market\u2019s reasonably competitive at this point in time. But I think based on current trends, it's a little hard to exactly forecast, but we feel good about the 5% underlying market growth.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Jamie, I guess the other thing I would just say is the volatility of the market has obviously picked up some. To talk about recent order trends and things that's obviously a little frustrating even for us because we would have liked to have had a better view of what our current guidance is back when we gave our first quarter call, but things fell off quite quickly. And we saw the order rates trending down in April, and we just didn't know how lasting or how big a deal that was. They stayed down through all of Q2 and then recently have picked back up a little bit. So it's volatile, and we just don't exactly know how to read it other than generally speaking, as Mark said, we've got some new business in the market that's helping us, plus we've got a pretty broadened global business that's helping us. So all in, we feel good about the Power Gen forecast, but we are definitely seeing more volatility in order rates in a number of markets and in a number in North America that you highlighted. I've got Rich here though, Jamie. Let me ask him to comment a little bit on the ACT forecast in the North America truck market.","Richard J. Freeland","Jamie, this is Rich. So yes, as you noted, we've taken our forecast down from the 278 production build down to 260. So that implies we're basically building at a 280 the first half of the year, building at a 240 rate the second half of the year. And so a few things we're looking at. One is, as you're aware, net orders have been weaker than that the last few months. I think that will probably continue through July. The things we're looking at that give us some confidence is one is retail sales. That averaged over 24,000 last 4 months. So you think at a 240 rate, that we'd be building at 20,000 a month. So retail sales are coming in higher than that. Conversations we've had with lots of customers, especially, again, more geared towards the larger customers are saying they're sticking with their second half order rates that they're going to continue with. The backlog remains pretty strong. So here we are in July, and there's well over 80,000 in the backlog. And I think lastly, we will see just the normal seasonality and some elements of increased orders in November, December ahead of the emissions change or greenhouse gas change in 2014. So I think it's obviously a moving target. But the net of that, I think the 240 build rate is balanced and right for the second half the year.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I'm sorry, just last question, Pat. Can you just quickly quantify what's the material cost benefit in the back half of the year?","Patrick J. Ward","Well, for the first half of the year, Jamie, we'll be 3\/10 or 4\/10 of a point benefit. Second half of the year, we expect to be 1%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to delve a little bit further into the second half margin guidance. Obviously, the margin guidance is pretty impressive. And the 2 businesses that stick out is the Power Gen business, the margins in the first half the year were 10.1. You're implying they go up to 10.9. In Distribution, it was 11.9 in the first half, and they go up to 13.1. But can you take us through a little bit what you're seeing? I think you mentioned in Power Gen, the mix is a bit adverse. I'm just trying to understand why the margins would go up first half to second half? I mean, you are implying the revenues go up a little bit sequentially. Some of that -- some could be just better overhead absorption, but just trying to better understand that part of the margin guidance.","Patrick J. Ward","Yes, so we'll start with Power Gen. Their gross margins have actually been doing quite well over the last few quarters. And some of that has been masked by mark-to-market adjustments we've had to take on forward contracts with copper. So we don't see copper decreasing further beyond this point. So we don't expect to see any more of those mark-to-market adjustments having kind of negatively impacted their margins in the first and more so in the second quarter of the year. So as volumes pick up in the second half the year in Power Gen, I expect their gross margin to improve and then not to fall to the bottom line. Tony and his team are thinking all over the cost management activities in the Power Gen groups, so I feel pretty good about their ability to expand margins from where they've been in the first half of the year. Distribution, they suffered a little bit in the first half of the year as I was taking in the earlier remarks on higher currency impact than what we had anticipated. They're down almost 2 points from a year ago, and half of that is currency and half of that is just increased SAR spending on key initiatives for them in the future. I think the revenues are going to improve in the second half the year. There's no question to that in my mind. I think the mix we're starting to see in that business is starting to move more towards aftermarket and away from whole goods which, again, will give them a lot more of a bump as we go forward.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","All right. That's helpful. The backlog at the end of the second quarter, do you have any color at all you can provide us on where the backlog is at the end of the quarter year-over-year?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Backlog for what, David?","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I\u2019d don\u2019t know if you have a total company number. I'm just trying to get a feel for you were down 4% revenue for the second quarter back half and implied down 5%. Just trying to get a little feel for kind of where we're launching from on a backlog going into the second half in the growth rate.","N. Thomas Linebarger","We don't have an overall one because it's just so different by markets. I think Rich talked a little bit about where he sees industry backlog for North America, so we\u2019ll have different numbers for different, but some of our businesses operate with no backlog ever. So it's just too wide a variety.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","All right. I'll just wrap up then. The related one is share repo. What should we think the second half the year maybe at a minimum compared to the run rate we've said in the first half of -- in the second quarter was, whatever, 188 million-or-so of repo. How should we think about the next couple of quarters on share repo?","Patrick J. Ward","We're not really going to change any part of our strategy or our planning when it comes to returning value to shareholders. So we said before, we'll look to do that by growing the business profitably. We'll look to do that by increasing the dividend, which we just did, and we'll look to do that by buying back stock. And we go into the year, as you know, with a target to reduce stock by 1%. If the market price is attractive, we may do more than that. We did more of that in the second half of last year. So we have the flexibility. I'm not going to commit a number just now, but we certainly don't see any change in the way we want to look after shareholders when it comes to dividends and stock buybacks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Vertical Research Partners.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","I just wanted to drill into the Power Gen segment a little bit. I assume that your outlook in the comments you made today were made in advance of any changes relative to the terrible outage they're having in India. Does that have the potential to affect anything this year? And then just in general, in 1Q, did you -- I'm trying to figure about the gap between the Indian segment stationary power and then Power Gen revenues. Did you overbuild a little bit and then -- or underbuild a little bit this quarter and the rest of the year?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Rob, I'll start with the India thing. You're totally right that we did that. All the comments we made were before we considered that. And really, I don't exactly know how it's going play out. It is terrible, actually. There's quite a bit of problems going on even in some of the bigger cities like Delhi, with mass transit basically unusable. So it is a bad situation for them. It's unfortunately reflective of the stability of the power grid broadly across the country. And that helps our business, of course, because that's a lot of reason why people buy standby generators. But definitely there's great need for much more stability than it had. We will definitely see what we can do to help in different parts of the country with trying to stabilize the grid, as well as provide emergency services. That's one of the things we do regularly and do best. So we'll be actively trying to help what the impact is. It's just way too early to tell. But I think it talks about why we have -- why we're optimistic long run about our participation in the Power Generation market in India. There just is a lot of grid improvement and other kinds of things to do there, and that's kind of where our products are targeted.","Patrick J. Ward","I think the second part of the question on inventory, the drop that we see in demand in the latter part of the second quarter kind of took us by surprise. And across the business, we ended up with more inventory than we anticipated. So as I said in the earlier remarks, we intend to work that down through the start of fourth quarter and get inventory back into a more normal target range for us.","N. Thomas Linebarger","I should add to that, that there's not really any area that's got a lot of extra inventory or where we've seen a lot cancelations. As Pat said, it's just across several parts of the business. The deceleration happened faster than we could adjust, and we're now going to adjust that to the next couple of quarters. So there's no area we're particularly concerned about, but there are several areas where we'll have to take production rates down below what sales have been. That's what affected our guidance for the second half.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","That's very helpful. Can I ask real quick on the oil and gas, which I know is small. But did your outlook assume that new builds -- I know the revenue outlook but I don't know how much is aftermarket. I don't know but it seems new builds go close to 0. Are you still getting orders for new builds in that market and do you assume to continue to get orders in the back half of the year. I'll stop there.","Richard J. Freeland","Yes -- this is Rich. Yes, we're continuing to get orders for new builds. We're down over 50% from where we were in the first quarter, but there is a level of that coming in. And then the parts and service business has remained pretty steady. So while there's been some shutdown, we've remained slight growth on the parts and service side of that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer with Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","A couple of questions on the Components margins. Pat, can you quantify the impact in 2Q of the Hilite acquisition? Was there an impact? And can you also just talk about the revenue and margin profile of that acquisition?","Patrick J. Ward","Yes. So in the second quarter, we incurred about $5 million of cost relating to the acquisition, so that's about 50 basis points. In the second half of the year, as we look forward in our guidance, we think that the ongoing cost with that technology business that we purchased is going to cost us about 0.5 point at the Components segment level under margin both in the third and fourth quarter. With regards to the profile of the business, I mean, this is a technology that we went out to purchase them. So it's not really -- it's not one of these big acquisitions you see other companies do. We've always said that where we attractive opportunities to move faster with technology development, that's what we'll be interested in. And that's exactly what this deal is. I think the revenue benefit in the second half of the year is going to be fairly modest. It's probably going to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million. But overall with the cost structure, with the technology investments we're seeing there, it will have a negative impact at a segment level of about 0.5 point.","N. Thomas Linebarger","The technology there helps us across our entire after-treatment business, so we'll see the technology impact our after-treatment business totally. But the big next hurdle for that business is really Euro 6. So Euro 6 is where the volume starts to turn up and the opportunity further shows, it also affects Tier 4 Final. And as I mentioned, it will affect all of our business. But if you want to think, \"So when does this thing start to show some positive benefits?\" It's not -- even though a technology investment, it's not 100 miles off Euro 6 and Tier 4 Final relatively close in time.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And is it fair to assume that the liquid-base SCR, the doser, is lower cost than the ARS ones they are using now in North America truck?","N. Thomas Linebarger","What I'll say about that now because new products -- and of course, we want to make the proper announcement at the proper time. Our target is to provide customers with better performance at a lower cost across this technology. That is -- in an after-treatment, the name of the game is being able to give people the ability to integrate effectively in a very complex system with higher liability, lower cost and better performance. That's what we're thinking this technology brings us. Especially across the large engines, the technology is pretty unique. And so we think it will be -- we think it will give us an advantage with customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, I want to ask you about the mining business. You mentioned that it was a little bit softer in the U.S., but you have a big international business. What's your visibility like in that business and what are your customers telling you? There's a lot of noise out there, as you know, in the system.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, there is a lot of noise. I\u2019ve got Richard. I'll let him comment. But I would just say at a high level, our view about the mining business is that we have pretty -- it's one of those markets where we do get reasonably good visibility. We are able to look out pretty far in terms of order rates and backlogs. We do have -- there's now 1 million customers that we're serving there, so we can kind of see what they're doing. And we can watch commodity prices with relatively -- with relative ease. You can kind of see what the numbers are and see what drives what. Obviously, our view of the market changes when we see commodity price changes dramatically, but we do have reasonable lead time on that. And Rich, I know, has been in conversation with a number of customers, so I'll let him comment further about what he's seeing.","Richard J. Freeland","Yes, so we're still in the guidance of up 7% for the year. Coal obviously is our biggest concern with commodity prices coming down, so that's the one we're paying the most attention to. Copper, iron ore, gold, those remain strong. We have not seen a lot of cancellations, small numbers. We've seen some delays. And so it's one we'll be watching. I think through the balance of the year, it looks pretty solid. And just one, we'll have to pay attention to going into 2013. Order boards are still strong as you know. In our orders and there's a delay, we have a lag effect on our side. So folks are still building out equipment. We're still shipping engines. So I feel pretty confident through the balance of 2012 that we\u2019ll see not a lot of changes.","N. Thomas Linebarger","I do think, Andy, it's one of these things where if copper, iron ore prices fall off a lot again, we would then change our outlook probably for 2013. Again, it's unlikely to have a big effect in the second half of this year. But change in commodity prices down would affect prospects for next year and vice versa. Of course, if they strengthen or get some underpinning for where they are, we think that will help next year. So we're keeping our eyes really closely on this. And everybody knows the things to watch here in terms of commodity prices. But right now, the good mines still are keeping their equipment running and ordering new equipment -- the good mines, I mean, the ones that are a low-cost operation and effective and are still doing it. New mines, we've seen a bunch of announcements about people saying they're going to postpone activity on new mines. I think you've probably read some of those, but existing mines are still going.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Tom, that's helpful. So kind of similar but maybe a little different, a place where we have -- it's more difficult to get visibility is China. I know you've talked about China. Your OEMs sometimes tell you one thing and then something else happens. The confidence level that you have from the OEMs now as we go forward, given that China at least is sort of making more noise about infrastructure investment and sort of doing the right thing, how comfortable are you that we won't need to change our Chinese forecast again when we go forward?","N. Thomas Linebarger","I think you've characterized it well that it's difficult to get good numbers. I think the OEMs, in their defense, suffer from the same lack of information that we do, to some degree. The published numbers are not often timely or not often complete. And there's even some game playing by the OEMs in terms of how they put the numbers, how they feed the numbers into the market, research work. So I think there is some uncertainty around the numbers. And I think there's also a debate within the Chinese government about what they want to do with the stimulus program. I've met with members of the government while I was there last, that there's clearly -- the #1 priority is to make sure it's a soft landing, not a hard landing. But there's also priorities within the government about shifting the economy a little bit away from only internal infrastructure and into consumer-based economy, which you've probably read some about that. And there's also a sense that the last stimulus program kind of over stimulated. There ended up being quite a bit of waste in some of the programs, and they ended up with a big bump that they have to recover from when inflation overruns. So I think there's just different parts of the government and different goals they're trying to manage here. So I have high confidence that they will stimulate, and they will continue to work on the economy to ensure it's not a hard landing. In other words, it doesn't get a lot worse than it is now. But I do think it's hard to say how quickly it's going to improve, especially in this infrastructure side. And we were feeling reasonably confident that they would stimulate enough to clear the excavator inventory and to get construction going by the fourth quarter. As you know, from our remarks, we have now -- our view has dimmed on that, and we think it will not do enough to clear the inventory and begin to increase build rates this year at all. We think it will be in the next year before that happens now. When and how, we're just not sure. So I think it's uncertain. I would be very careful about anyone who says they're certain about what's going to happen there because I think it's hard to know. And certainly, any one OEM would not be a reliable estimator.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Curious about sort of the cadence of the quarter. It seems like -- please correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems likes things sort of changed fairly rapidly through the quarter. And I'm wondering, you made a couple of comments, Tom. I think that you thought things had sort of stabilized. And I wondered if you could just sort of take us through the key end markets where things really did deteriorate and whether they have stabilized and if you even have any kind of quick look into July?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, Steve, it's a good question. Because again, we left the first quarter call with a couple of troubling signs but not a clear view really of where the rest of the year was going to go. So we were unable to change our guidance in a way that was any more accurate than what we already had. That was unfortunate. Because, as you said, it changed pretty quickly. April was a very good month for us, and then May and June were weaker. And that was the cadence, basically. And what -- I think what made it worse is that our view was that as we saw those numbers weakening, we didn't see instigators that we're going to make them improve quickly and turnaround. Good examples we talked about today, North American truck, while we do see some improvement in the back half of the year, we didn\u2019t see a way we were going to get back to 278,000 units. And we saw the order rates dropping. You saw them, too. But the -- we were all debating in April, was that just a one-off with special causes. And then as we went through the rest of the quarter we said, \"No, it looks like it's going to stay.\" In China, we saw a bunch of new data come out, a bunch of information about how inventory had changed in the first quarter or in this case, had not changed very much about in excavators was disturbing news for a whole bunch of people and made us rethink where we were. Truck markets in China, same kind of thing. India economic results were much worse. Excise taxes got implemented. There was some debate about where they were. And then I mentioned Brazil, where what we saw -- we saw Euro 5 transition struggling. That was evident, but the combination of the worsening economy and how badly retail sales were going was just kind of came to light during the course. So we saw a lot of negative news about how things were progressing. I mean in all of those things, you hear about stuff. But then when OEMs actually take build rates down, which they do over and they don't do -- they do that for a few months, you know now you're going to have to lower your realistic expectations. That's the example that happened in Brazil. So anyway, a lot of those things happened in the quarter. They made us change not only our view of the quarter, but our view of the year. And we just felt like given what we saw in May and June, we wanted to get out and tell you guys that things had changed in just 2 months. With regard to change now, it's not that there's been significant improvements anywhere. It just looks like we've kind of now captured this new environment as best we can. I did mention that there's volatility and hard to know in some places like China, and the Power Gen orders have been bouncing around. But broadly speaking, we feel like we've reflected the environment that we're experiencing now, and so that's why we feel good about the guidance. But I would say it's a much more volatile economy than we were looking at in the first quarter of the year, and it's much harder to predict.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So just to be clear, can I say the last few weeks have sort of stabilized or they remain volatile and you just think this captures it?","N. Thomas Linebarger","I think the second thing is more accurate. They remain volatile, and we think we've captured it. We think we better characterize what we think is going to happen because when we're out in the first quarter call, it's when everything was starting to get a little bit squirrely. We now had 3 months to look at it and say indeed, it is worse.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow up, just to broaden that out a little more. Feels like a lot of companies this quarter have sort of taken the tack that things have certainly slowed here, but we're still in a growth market. '13 and '14 are probably still up years. We don't want to cut a lot of muscle here, so we're willing to build a little inventory. We're willing to keep our R&D spending going, et cetera. Would you to put yourself in that camp? Are we still in a growth market of a kind of a longer-term backdrop or are you kind of more nervous? And what would you have to see to really start to batten down the hatches?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Definitely, we would put ourselves in that category of seeing our long-term growth prospects remain the same but the basic characteristics of our industry, as I mentioned in my remarks, have not changed. Our view still is developing countries will be growing faster than developed countries and investing in infrastructure and our position there remains strong. We will still be investing in new products and technology. The Components business, for example, we've got a lot of promising technologies there that will require investment. We'll still be spending money there. Having said that, we do know how to reduce costs, and we are starting to reduce costs. So we're striking a balance now is the way I'd characterize it. And obviously, we can change that balance pretty rapidly. There's a whole bunch of us here that have a set of programs that we know what to do when we need to do it, and we will be monitoring. In a volatile economy like this, watching closely all the time and making adjustments on the fly is exactly what we need to do. Having said that I feel, like those others do, that the characteristics of our industry are still ones that will give profitable growth over a sustained period as the economies return. The question for us, and I think probably for a lot of people, is when do the economies return? What's the instigator that gets things back? And I think that's where there's a fair bit of uncertainty and frankly, right now, a fair bit of negative yield.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But I'd say somewhat tongue in cheek, we've gone almost an hour and nobody has asked about it, natural gas, which I think is a big change from 1 quarter ago or 2 quarters ago. Maybe if you could just update us in terms of your outlook for NAFTA heavy-duty. Have you seen any change in demand for CNG equipment or CNG-related engines?","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes, well certainly, the demand on our natural gas engines has increased significantly versus a year ago. The volumes in the second quarter were double. So there's definitely more -- we're definitely seeing more demand. We're seeing a lot of inquiries. So it's an active market for sure, and we expect that to grow. It's still, if you look at the overall mix of business relatively low compared to the total, but it is growing. And we are active in the market. Rich, I don't know if you want to comment at all about anything else?","Richard J. Freeland","No, that's fine.","N. Thomas Linebarger","Yes. So I think that's -- we are seeing active. We are seeing growth, and we are seeing a lot of inquiries about it. And with gas prices where they are, I just don't expect those are going to slow down. I think there's going to be a lot of people that are going to try to get natural gas into their on-highway truck engines among other applications and see if they can get the overall cost to work out when they look at where they can fuel, on how they maintain, all that kind of thing, because prices are really attractive today.","Richard J. Freeland","It remains, as you know, somewhat infrastructure constrained so places where that's not a constraint like refuse market where you can go out, refuel. We've seen high market share in business move there. But I think it's going to be mostly driven by as infrastructure builds out and you can take advantage of these lower prices.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure, I appreciate that. And then as my final quick follow-up. We know that Navistar is going through a supplier selection process for its SCR components. Is that something you're prepared to talk about? Are you bidding in that business? Have you been invited to bid? Is it something that you'd be interested in or is it an Engine plus after treatment or nothing?","Richard J. Freeland","Ann, this is Rich again. As you said, lots of speculation, rumors out there. A couple of things we do know is the technology now settled out, EGR versus SCR and with their announcement moving to the SCR. Another thing we know is Navistar is -- remains -- is a large customer of Cummins. And 25% market share we still have in our NAFTA business, again, outside of the U.S. So we know where the technology is. We know -- we've been partners or customers for long time and have maintained discussions, relationships even despite the competition we've had the last couple of years in the U.S. How this technology changed impacts their product plans, we don't know. And so it wouldn't be appropriate for me to add to that speculation of how that might turn out. And so I\u2019d really need to direct you back to Navistar on how -- what their product plan will be and who their resources will be to meet that product plan.","Mark Smith","Okay. I think that's the end of the hour. We appreciate your interest and your questions, and I will be available for follow-up. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation, and you may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."]}}
