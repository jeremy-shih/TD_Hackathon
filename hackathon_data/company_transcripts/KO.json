In order to allow as many people to ask questions as possible, we ask you to limit yourself to one question.","Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In late 2014, we announced a clear five point plan to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. We committed to transform the company to one that is focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer relationships, and leading our franchise system with a goal of becoming a leaner, higher margin, higher return and more focused company. And I'm pleased to say that we made significant progress against our initiatives, including the very important announcement this morning about accelerating our refranchising. Importantly, our progress against these initiatives is leading to improving performance, even in a very challenging macro environment.","Let's start with our key announcements today. One of our five strategic initiatives has been to refocus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners. As part of this, we've continued to advance our global refranchising initiatives. With the success of our efforts in Europe and North America, we have the confidence to accelerate our plans.","In North America, we learned a significant amount from our initial territory transition efforts. Including the additional territories announced this morning, to-date, we have signed agreements or transferred territories representing over 40% of U.S. bottle can volume. At the same time, the performance of our North America businesses continue to improve throughout this process, delivering the highest revenue growth in three years, while we executed this important transformation. Based on our success and the knowledge we gained through the transitions, we're now ready to accelerate the pace.","Today, we announced we are committed to refranchising 100% of our bottling territories, including Coke cold-fill production by the end of 2017. This is a critical step for our entire system in North America. It will not be easy and will require the hard work and dedicated efforts of our entire team and close collaboration with our bottling partners. So we have a clear plan in place, and are confident that this is essential for our future success.","Moving on to China, our bottling system in this dynamic country has evolved to the point where refranchising is the next logical step. Today, we are the bottler for roughly one-third of our dynamic China business. We have now entered into a non-binding letter of intent to refranchise our bottling operations to our existing partners, COFCO and Swire. These bottlers have been excellent partners, demonstrating their willingness and capability to grow the China business for the long-term. Therefore, we believe they are ready to take on additional territory and look forward to strengthening our partnerships with them.","These new announcements, combined with the pending creation of Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, as well as our investment in our Indonesian bottler, will strengthen our global bottling system for the coming decades. To put it in perspective, adjusting for these transactions, the percent of our 2015 volume sold through company-owned bottlers would have decreased from 18% to 3%. None of this would have been possible without the continuous investment and hard work of our Bottling Investments Group. When we are finished, our Bottling Investments Group will be smaller, more focused, but will remain a critical strategic growth enabler for our company.","Taking a step back, I'm proud of the progress we've made over the past 18 months and look forward to completing the next critical phase of our journey. When we complete these refranchising efforts by the end of 2017, we will look very different than we do today, as we return to a company that is focused on our core strength of building strong, sustainable and valuable brands, creating value for our customers and partners and continuing to drive system capabilities. As a result, we will become less capital intensive, with significantly higher margins and returns, which will enable our core strengths even further.","Another of our five strategic initiatives is targeting disciplined brand and growth investments. While much of this discussion has been about increasing the quantity of our marketing, we know that improving the quality of our marketing is just as critical for success. That is why I am particularly pleased by Coca-Cola's new global marketing campaign. Actually, this is not just a new global campaign, but a new business approach. While we've added a lot of choices to the trademark Coca-Cola portfolio over the years, drinks with calories, without calories, with caffeine or without, this is our first campaign ever to cover all the refreshing brands within our Coca-Cola trademark portfolio.","As the most valuable beverage brand in the world, people continue to love our brand, but we recognize consumers want to enjoy Coca-Cola in different ways. Regardless of which one they want, they want a Coca-Cola brand with great taste and uplifting refreshment. Our One Brand strategy transitions us to a single iconic brand campaign that celebrates both the product as well as the brand. Importantly, this campaign gets back to our roots, featuring the product at the heart of the creative, and celebrating the experience and simple pleasures of drinking a Coca-Cola, any Coca-Cola.","This campaign is also an example of how we are transforming the way we work to be faster with reduced costs. This campaign was built end-to-end from the start, from consumer through to shopper, digital, and music, and was developed to support the entire globe. This helped us reduce the number of agencies and better leverages production costs as well. This discipline, combined with the inspiration of our talented marketing teams, is what will continue to fuel our growth.","While trademark Coca-Cola is the oxygen for our company, we have the leading portfolio of strong valuable brands across multiple categories. And this portfolio continues to grow with 20 $1 billion brands and a strong pipeline of growing regional brands. This year, we gained global value share across the core sparkling packaged water, juice, and juice drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea categories. In addition to internal innovation, we look externally for bolt-on opportunities to expand our still beverage portfolio and capabilities.","Just last week, we announced an investment in Chi Limited, Nigeria's leading value-added dairy and juice company. This adds to our other recent investments, including Monster, Suja, and fairlife, expanding our presence in the energy juice and value-added dairy categories. Last quarter, we also announced our intention to sell our shares in conjunction with JAB Holdings' pending acquisition of Keurig Green Mountain. We will recover our initial investment when that transaction closes, while continuing to drive our Keurig KOLD opportunity in the marketplace.","In summary, we recognize we still have much work to do, but we have a clear plan, clear path to transform the company, becoming more focused on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, thereby giving us even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets.","I will now hand the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, James Quincey, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in 2015.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. So, as Muhtar mentioned, let me spend a few minutes reviewing our 2015 operational performance, before handing the call over to Kathy.","In 2015, we delivered our plan for our transition year, despite challenging macroeconomic environments. We gained value share in NARTD, sparkling and still beverages, an important metric for us as we manage the business, especially during periods of slower economic growth and volatility. For the full year, organic growth of revenues was 4% and, importantly, we delivered 2% global price\/mix. This was stronger price realization than we have generated in several years, reflecting our segmented revenue growth management strategies and enabled by our increased investments in media.","Unit case volume grew 2% for the year. We're pleased with this volume performance, given our focus on improving price realization during a time when consumer spending was pressured in many markets.","And I'm also pleased to confirm that globally, we captured over $600 million in productivity, ahead of the target we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. So structurally-adjusted, comparable currency neutral income before tax grew 6% for the year, as we benefited from the productivity efforts and favorable commodities, although partially offset by our increased media investments.","During the year, we saw a slowing environment in China and challenges in several key emerging markets, including Brazil and Russia. This was offset by solid performance in North America and many of our Latin American markets. North America itself delivered its strongest performance in three years, delivering 4% organic revenue growth, with three points of price realization, supported by our increased marketing effort and a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management.","Consistent with this strategic focus, our driving of consumption small packages could be seen across North America. We grew purchase transactions 3%, outpacing the 1% unit case volume growth, as consumers increasingly reached for the mini cans, the smaller PET, the 8-ounce glass bottles, as well as our premium aluminum bottles, all of which drive more value per occasion than our traditional packages. Hopefully, many of you also saw an example of this strategic focus on Sunday night during the Super Bowl, when we aired our latest commercial focusing exclusively on the mini can package.","Our performance in 2015 gives us confidence that our strategies are working and that our underlying performance will be within our long-term targets in 2016. However, let me be clear. The global economy remains challenged and is not improving rapidly. We do see slightly better GDP growth rates for 2016 as compared to 2015. But to be fair, forecasts continue to be revised downwards and there is still much uncertainty. Notable are Brazil and Russia continuing to deteriorate, while China's growth rate does also slow, putting pressure across many of the emerging and developing markets.","Now, while helpful to consumers, the lower price of oil is also causing volatility in the Middle East and other oil-driven export economies, with further implications for those nations. So, given the erratic nature of the global economy, we will continue to focus on what we can control in order to deliver our plan. We will continue to build on the fundamentals of our strategy for long-term success, while delivering solid revenue growth and strong, underlying operating margin expansion, through the expected continued management of our portfolio, price\/mix and productivity efforts.","With that, I'm going to hand off to Kathy, who will give you additional details on North American productivity programs, and walk through the 2016 outlook.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the interest of time this morning, I intend to cover just three topics: North America refranchising; our updated productivity targets; and our outlook for 2016.","Let me start with our refranchising efforts in North America. As we accelerate our refranchisings, we are returning to our core business of brand building, driving customer value and leading the system. At the same time, the refranchising causes a lot of complexity in our North America P&L. Therefore, in order for management to view the underlying performance of our core business in North America separately, we made the decision to adjust our operating segments such that, starting in 2016, CCR will be reported within our Bottling Investments Group.","Going forward, the vast majority of any structural impacts to our business will now be reported within a single operating segment. We believe this will also be helpful to our investors for the same reason of assessing the continued underlying performance of our core business. We understand that the accelerated refranchising, coupled with the shift in reporting segments, will likely result in a lot of modeling questions. So we will provide revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before the end of the quarter.","With regards to modeling, we are providing detailed structural guidance for 2016, the majority of which is related to the North America refranchising efforts. The remainder of the territories will transfer by the end of 2017, but the P&L impact will depend on the timing of transfers. We will share more with you at the appropriate time on the expected impact in 2017.","As we transition territories, we are committed to eliminating the temporary residual costs we have referenced in the past as quickly as possible, and we anticipate the majority of these will be removed in 2017. With that said, there could be a portion of residual costs remaining in 2018 as we wind down the final support of these operations, but this amount would be relatively small and would be eliminated by the end of 2018.","Our productivity program is also evolving due to the accelerated refranchising. Approximately half of our $3 billion productivity program was expected to come from supply chain savings. And a significant portion of those savings were expected to come from North America, due to the size and finished goods nature of the business.","Now that we are accelerating our refranchising, we will no longer be able to capture a portion of the identified supply chain savings prior to divestiture. However, we have built a disciplined process and capabilities that have allowed us to exceed our goals to-date, and identify incremental opportunities within cost of goods sold, operating expenses and marketing to replace the supply chain savings being refranchised, thus enabling us to maintain our $3 billion target.","As we've communicated to you in the past, we said we would continue to look at every layer of spending as we move through the productivity work and we have done just that. Coupled with the success we've seen so far, we have the confidence to effectively raise our level of targeted savings across our remaining spend base. With the incremental savings identified in our core business and the fact that our addressable cost base will substantially reduce post-2017, it should be even more evident that our $3 billion program represents a sizable opportunity. We look forward to providing further details at CAGNY next week.","Turning to outlook, despite challenging macro environments in many key markets around the world, our focus on revenue and disciplined brand investments continues to improve our top-line growth. Also, we are seeing productivity flow through our P&L. While much of this was obscured by currency and structural changes, we saw solid underlying margin expansion last year, even while we grew marketing expenses at a faster rate than gross profits. For those reasons, in 2016, we expect to be back on our long-term growth algorithm prior to any structural changes, which are primarily driven by our accelerated pace of refranchising.","Organic revenue is expected to grow 4% to 5%, in line with our long-term target, as our marketing investments continue to pay off. Given the current macro environment and lapping better comps in 2015, we believe this is a solid target.","We expect the commodity environment to be benign, but considering that we hedge our exposure to many commodities, we may not see the full benefit you would expect when looking at today's spot prices. Given the general weak macroeconomic environment and the associated pressure on top-line growth, we are focused on capturing more than $600 million of productivity in order to deliver our profit targets. We will do this even as we continue to increase the investments in media behind our brands and step up R&D investments in 2016.","Finally, we anticipate interest cost to increase in 2016 due to higher interest rates, as well as our decision to shift some of our debt from commercial paper to longer-term maturities that carry slightly higher interest rates.","After considering all of these factors, we expect comparable currency neutral income before tax, structurally-adjusted, to grow 6% to 8% in 2016, in line with our long-term targets, as strong operating profit growth is partially offset by net interest expense.","As Muhtar mentioned earlier, there will be significant structural impacts to our business as we accelerate our refranchising efforts in North America, complete the mergers of Coca-Cola European Partners, and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, and cycle a half-year impact from the Monster Beverage transaction, which closed in mid-2015. We currently expect both Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa to close during the second quarter. Taken together, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a four to five point headwind to net revenue.","Because of the nature of the structural changes, we also anticipate that the impact will be slightly higher on cost of goods sold and SG&A. We expect the benefit to equity income from Monster, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa and Coca-Cola European Partners to partially offset that impact at operating income, resulting in a three to four point negative structural impact to income before tax. Our underlying effective tax rate is expected to remain at 22.5% for 2016.","Finally, we expect approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion in net share repurchases for 2016. We therefore expect comparable currency neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of the three to four point structural headwind to income before tax.","As you well know, many of the world's currencies have continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar. Since we operate in over 200 markets, we are not immune to this effect. In addition, we will be cycling the Euro debt re-measurement gain we recorded in Other Income during the first two quarters of 2015. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect a four point headwind to net revenue and a nine point headwind to income before tax. However, the currency headwind to operating income will be lower as we cycle the gain I just mentioned.","In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2016. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies.","Finally, we expect to spend $2.5 billion to $3 billion on CapEx, as we continue to maintain our facilities in advance of transitioning territories and production assets. By the end of 2017, our capital needs will decrease significantly, as we refranchise healthy businesses in North America and China.","As you model the first quarter, please remember that due to our reporting calendar cycle, there will be one less day in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a five point headwind on net revenues and a 12 point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter of 2016. We expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a slight headwind on net revenue and structural items to be a two point headwind on income before tax.","In summary, our financial performance for 2015 was slightly better than our expectations, and we executed our five point plan effectively. And we are already working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value and leading the system, so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower risk, higher return business with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets.","We look forward to sharing more with you at CAGNY.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm great. How are you?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, can you just talk about why now is the right time to pull all this stuff forward on the refranchising front because, obviously, there's like a ton of macro volatility? I know there was some challenges as you kind of wanted to standardize the IT platform and then even some of the key account stuff, which I thought had a little bit of a longer tail. So any thoughts you have on that would be appreciated.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Bill. Ever since I took over as CEO, I have always emphasized the importance of our franchise model. And one of my clear priorities was to accelerate growth in our biggest profit pool, the United States. And we bought the business of CCE, U.S. operations with that goal in mind. So when you think about it now, we've been able to prove to ourselves that we can accelerate the business in North America. We've had the best year in 2015, and you saw the results from the quarter. And these results show that our strategic focus on driving consumption of smaller package sizes is continuing to pay off. Transactions are growing. Price\/mix is healthy.","And so we're bringing those two things together, both the goal of going back, returning to our core model, which we've always emphasized, even the first time we announced the purchase of CCE's U.S. operations, we said there will be a role for partnerships going forward as soon as we can put some things right.","We have got the three legs of the stool in place, the customer governance, production governance, and the IT platforms. And so we feel very confident. We have proven to ourselves that we can do it and we feel very confident that this is the time. The new model is established. Bottler performance is improving. We have a new structure to last us the next number of decades. And we're putting our bottlers in the right hands. As Kathy said, the bottlers are very healthy and thanks to the great leadership and capability of our Bottling Investments Group.","And so, yes, we are now going to the core and this is the time. And we feel very confident that we can do the two things together, accelerate momentum and bring the franchising to a bookend that really, we feel, is going to be very beneficial both to our company, our shareowners, as well as to leading to better customer service and better value creation on the bottler side. So it's really a win-win from all those perspectives, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Bonnie.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was hoping you could actually give us a concrete example that gave you the confidence to make the decision to accelerate your refranchising plans. And then, while your margin should certainly expand and your returns will increase, could you help frame for us the incremental dilution expected from the new system? And then finally, I'd like to hear what your plans are for the cash you'll receive from the planned sale of the 39 production facilities, which I guess, I assume should raise a fair amount of cash, considering I think the earlier sales, the nine sites, had a book value of $280 million, if I'm not mistaken.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Bonnie. I'll say a few words and then I'll let Kathy and James comment, too. But I'll say that certainly, we have the proof points in the United States. Our Chinese business, for example, also has great momentum, gaining share and growing in that difficult environment, if you look at the quarter, if you look at the full year results. And the capability that has been put into place in all our expanding bottlers, everywhere, is really giving us the confidence. And also just look at the momentum of the business. Our revenue growth was a priority. We got it up to the 4% to 5% range. And the increased marketing is working, clearly, and now better marketing was even going to enhance that.","And at the same time, we feel that every time the territory has transitioned, it's actually continued to do well, continued to gain share, continued to drive momentum, continued to drive incremental transactions. And from that, any of the territories in the last four, five quarters that have been transitioned, we have seen, without exception, that to be holding true. And if you look at all these bottlers that we're refranchising, look at the results. Look at the performance of our German bottler. It really has the greatest momentum in the continent of Europe right now.","So all of these bottlers are going in to a system, to a structure, to an architecture, to a geography that will continue to do even better when you combine it and when you create the synergies with the combination. And so, we feel confident.","And then, what took a little while to get right was the governance model around production in the United States, the governance model around the IT platform, the governance model around the customer service. All of those are in place and working well.","So, I'll just hand over to James to add some flavor to that in more details, and then Kathy can comment also on your questions related to the financial aspect of cash.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Bonnie, let me just add one thought to what Muhtar has laid out there on we've been fixing and building. And we're finding the right partners. I mean, a simple way of looking at why it's working is there's just more people coming to the table saying, we want to be partners. Our existing partners want more territories. And new people who aren't in the system want to get into the system. So they're seeing that we've fixed the business and we've built momentum. And so, there's a lot of heightened interest in being part of a growing Coke system, particularly in North America.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Then, Bonnie, I think the next part of your question, you asked about the incremental dilution and the impact of that. I can help you with the impact of that.","So for 2016, we gave you the impact. And then for 2017, we are doing several things, because we know you all have lots of questions about 2017. So we are going to provide revised operating segment financial information later in the quarter. And then at CAGNY, we're going to give you a look at kind of what to anticipate the business will look like after everything is finished in 2018, because the actual dilution kind of depends really on the timing of these transactions.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And so the best way we can give you some indication of that is really to kind of help you understand what our business will look like when everything is said and done in 2018 and beyond, which is what we're going to try to do at CAGNY. So I would ask you just hold off on that, and more to come on that.","And then on the question about cash, so the cash will basically go into basically our capital structure and be part of just our normal mix. And at this point, no board level decisions have been made, so we anticipate that these proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Muhtar, you've posted a couple quarters in a row with volume growth back up in the 3% range, along with solid pricing, despite the difficult emerging markets macro environment we're seeing. So, I just wanted to get an update on your market share performance. Obviously, you're gaining share, but have you seen a relative change in terms of incremental market share performance and what level of payback you're getting on the higher marketing? And as you look out to 2016, 4% to 5% organic sales growth is a fairly tight range. So how much visibility do you think you have around that? Could macros pose a risk to that guidance, particularly given you're assuming higher GDP growth? Thanks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dara. As I mentioned, we're pleased with our market share performance, value share gains across the world, and I'll let James highlight some details on that.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. So, Dara, let me just give you a quick run round the world, in terms of share. I mean, firstly, on an overall global basis, perhaps consistent with our strong fourth quarter, we gained a little more share in the fourth quarter than we had in the whole year, so a better performance at the tail end. And in terms of how that played out across the world, you see, again, in line with the volume performance, strong results in North America. We gained share in sparkling. We gained share in stills, and we gained share overall in the quarter and in the year, so good momentum in North America coming through in share.","In Europe, we're gaining share in sparkling and in stills. Given our different starting points, that's netting out to kind of being flat overall, but we got a strong growth in Europe as we build our stills business.","Latin America, this is a long-term track record of success, so small gains there, building on a long history of building a great position.","Eurasia, despite some of the volatility in that part of the world, we gained share in both sparkling and stills and overall, pretty strong momentum there, in terms of share.","And then in Asia Pacific, we've focused more on re-staging and re-energizing the sparkling business, where we're gaining share. We lost a little bit in stills and overall flat. So I think wherever you look round the world, we're largely flat to gaining. And so, and consistent with our volume growth, which is broad-based and across the world, we're also largely winning across the world.","So in terms of \u2013 which one do you want me to do, marketing payback? So I think what you're seeing is, there is results from the marketing payback. I mean, our organic revenue growth in 2015 was better than 2014. We're guiding for a good number that's ahead of 2015, in 2016. So, we see the marketing payout beginning to build the momentum globally. And I think if you doubled-down on that one and look under that, North America was one of the first places we started with the incremental marketing and that's self-evidently building momentum. So, we see the underlying business results coming through in revenue, very much tied to where the extra media money is going.","And then in terms of macro outlook and risk to top-line, I think we feel that we got underlying structural momentum in the business. Now, when I said we're planning on the macros slightly better in 2016, and I really do mean slightly, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the same growth rate in 2015, but we think we have the right portfolio and the right optionality to be able to deliver our financial numbers in that environment.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then, if I could just slip a detail question in, Kathy, I was hoping you could give us clarity on the impact to 2017 earnings from FX, if spot rates stay at this level, given the hedging in 2016, and how much hedging you have in place for 2017 on some of the hard currencies.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, for 2017, Dara, we are also fully hedged on our major currencies. So, obviously, the emerging market currencies are the ones where you can't really hedge more than a quarter or so out. So, obviously, we have done nothing on the emerging market currencies. But on the hard currencies, we are hedged at rates slightly worse than in 2016. So there will be a slight impact, but I wouldn't think it would be terribly significant.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Two questions here; first off, it's a little tough with all the refranchising of the bottlers to get a handle in terms of what's truly going on on the gross margin. So, can you try and strip some of the impact out from the refranchising and give us an idea what the underlying gross margin is doing?","And then, Kathy, going back to your points on the balance sheet, can you just sort of talk about what you're seeing out there that's causing you to maybe term-out some of the longer term debt? Is it just sort of the short market volatility, or is this something where you would expect to maybe go with a more conservative balance sheet approach on a go-forward basis? Thanks.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, John. So the gross margins in fourth quarter impacted by the six fewer days, and the currency and then the structural impact. So, if you take all of that out, basically, we had good gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","What was the second question? So, the balance sheet, basically, as we've got so much cash that's outside of the United States, we are taking a little bit more of a conservative approach with our balance sheet. And it was just more prudent to manage with the longer-term maturities than with short-term maturities. So, we still have a robust portfolio of commercial paper. So we're just kind of balancing that out differently.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, and if I can ask one quick follow-up on that, in terms of the interest income line and some of the cash balances overseas, any change in that approach, or is this mostly going to be on the interest expense line?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Basically, it's going to be on the interest expense line. Yeah.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we're expecting much more interest expense, given the rate changes. But also, the longer-term maturities are also causing more interest expense.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. One of your stated strategies was to improve the balance of price\/mix and volume in your developed markets, and we've clearly seen that in the U.S. But I was hoping you could walk around the world and offer us what you're seeing in other developed markets, provide us with your prospects and confidence for improving price\/mix in other developed markets around the world going forward. Thanks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Brett. I think, if you look at our overall for the whole year, and as well as for the quarter, our price\/mix globally, you can see that that has improved. As was mentioned, part of the reason for that is we're beginning to see the results of the increased marketing play through as well as our packaging strategies and mix management. And coupled with that, the value share gains, which is even more pleasing, given that we're able to get healthy pricing in our business and in our markets around the world, but I'll let James comment in terms of Europe and Japan and what is being seen in some of the other developed markets in addition to the United States, okay?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, thanks, Muhtar. I think firstly, it's important to remember, starting with Europe, that our price positioning in Europe, we have, over time, substantially taken a lot of rate and mix in Europe, such that we are more premium priced compared to our competitors than we are in North America, so less runway in that sense. Now, having said that, we continue to focus on smaller packages, more premium offerings in terms of the brand portfolio, such that despite what is a pretty deflationary retail environment in a number of Western European markets, we're getting price\/mix in Europe, both in the quarter and for the full year. So I think going out, one should not expect the same sort of levels the U.S. has been able to develop, especially given the macro environment in Europe at the moment.","In terms of Japan, we're very focused on rebuilding our ability to get positive price\/mix in Japan. We've recently been able to get some, again, very focused on leveraging both packaging options and the brand portfolio to reshape it to allow us to drive positive mix. Again, I don't think you will see, in Japan, the same sorts of levels as the U.S., as much as anything to do with the deflationary pressures in Japan. But we are starting to see chances of a better pricing environment in Japan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Bryan.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to get a couple of points of color on the productivity program. I guess, Kathy, to start, you're keeping the original $3 billion plan, but a portion of the COGS opportunity is now going to go off with the refranchising, so could you just give us some sort of idea of just how big that is, how much you had to sort of make up in terms of keeping the $3 billion where it is?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly. So we will lose about $500 million of productivity, primarily out of cost of goods sold. But, again, we committed to making up that lost amount and we're going to make it up between cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and DME.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And so net, this productivity plan is actually now a little bit bigger than it originally would have been. Is that just a function of as you're doing more, you're finding more savings, or was the refranchising kind of motivating you to look for more savings, just trying to get a sense if there's more momentum building on the productivity program itself?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, we always said we were going to continue to look for additional productivity opportunities, and so we have done just that. And we've learned a lot about our costs as we have continued the programs, the ZBW as well as other cost optimization programs. So basically, we've looked end-to-end and we saw additional opportunity and we're going to take it.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just last one, of that $500 million that essentially goes off in refranchising, will that actually still be realized within the franchise system? So does the Coke system itself still see the $500 million of savings, or is that kind of lost because it needed to be sort of integrated with Coke to get it?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it will be captured by the system.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've been hoping that they can find additional areas, Bryan, to even increase that going forward. Part of the whole plan around the production governance is also to ensure that we can actually lever and pull more synergies out of our production system in the entire sort of template of North America production. So, yes, the answer is a definite yes.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So from a systems perspective, this is truly incremental savings. It's just a matter of where we're seeing it.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's right.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","I wanted to come back to the Asia Pacific region. I have two questions. First is on price\/mix, and then second on China specifically. So price\/mix in the quarter was down 9%, and margins were down pretty significantly. James, I think you talked about re-staging the sparkling business, and I know there's been some negative geographic mix, so a little bit more color there would be helpful. And then the second piece on China, 1% volume growth, but you were cycling a pretty soft compare of down 1% last year. Maybe you could just elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in that market and your expectation here over the next 12 months. Thanks.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. A, let me start with the price\/mix in Asia Pacific. I think the most important thing to note here is because the different geographies in the Asia Pacific group have some quite different pricing and concentrate shipments can be lumpy, you do get some erratic price\/mix numbers on a quarterly basis. And that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific. So there were more shipments to somewhere like India than Japan. You can actually see the flip side of this in the Eurasia group, where we got very strong price\/mix in the fourth quarter, which was the flip side. We had more shipments to places like South Africa than the Middle East. So this is all about country mix. I think it's important for particularly those two groups, Asia Pacific and Eurasia, to look at some longer-term four quarter trend line on price\/mix, given the very impactful country mix issue and the lumpiness of concentrate shipments. So that's the key thing there.","And then in terms of China, clearly not as much as we would have liked to have grown in China in the first quarter; I think that the environment in China is pretty clearly having slowed down, but we think we had a strong momentum over the last couple of years coming back into China. We're looking to do better in 2016, but we don't actually provide country-based forecasts. What I would say, however, is we're continuing to do very strongly in terms of share, particularly in sparkling, as we've re-energized that business.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much. So actually a relatively quick set of questions for each of you, if I could; first, Muhtar, on refranchising and the decision to retain hot-fill and juice assets, is that an indefinite plan or is that subject to further review? And similarly, thinking about China and the rest of the world, should we be thinking differently about your plans in India in terms of future refranchising in that market as well?","And then, Kathy, the 4% to 5% organic growth you're calling out for next year, can you just give us maybe a rough sense of volume versus price within that and how much, if any, you expect to spend incrementally on A&P in order to achieve what amounts to underlying acceleration?","And then finally, James, sorry for all the questions, we debated this a little while back, and I'm just wondering if you've got additional thoughts in terms of your longer-term growth, how much you expect the portfolio to lean on stills versus sparkling, and do you think you have the right balance of demand building support against each of that in order to achieve your long-term goals? Thank you.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Steve, so related to juice and hot-fill and stills, stills continues to perform very well in North America for us and the template for stills production is completely different in terms of how it is configured to cold-fill. And juice is an integrated business. So given those aspects, we intend that for the future to not change the structure related to both hot-fill as well as to juice and our foodservice business. All will remain as integrated in that respect, and they're doing very well. And we feel that they add value to the overall structure of North America, and they're an important strategic part of how we move forward and continue to increase momentum in North America.","India, look, you saw that number. Given all these changes we're announcing, basically, if you brought it back to 2015, the total bottling assets that we would have under our management and on our balance sheet would actually go down from 18% of the total mix globally to about 3%. So, yes, in India, there are opportunities in other parts of the world remaining, but it's a very small template based on where we are, and we'll look at opportunities.","As James said earlier, one of the litmus tests \u2013 I've always said, one of the great sort of litmus tests for the health of the Coca-Cola business is the desire of investors and our franchise partners to have more territory. That's at an all-time high, and we expect that to remain high. And therefore, there may be other opportunities in the remaining geographies, but I can't comment on that any further right now.","And then I'll pass it over to James to take you through the longer-term question on portfolio stills versus sparkling, and then Kathy, the question on 4%, 5% organic growth, volume versus price. So James?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Look, I think our aspiration is to have both of them growing, both bottling and stills, and that's what we achieved in the fourth quarter and in the full year of 2015. Now, I think in a total portfolio sense, much as in the same way has happened over the last decade or so, we've gone from about 10% of the portfolio being stills to roughly 25% of the portfolio being stills. I think mathematically, the stills will grow as a percent of the total portfolio.","And I would note, as Muhtar commented earlier, I think we need to break out the stills and not just look at them as one thing, but look at them in terms of their individual categories. And we gained share in packaged water. We gained share in juice and juice drinks. We gained share in energy, and we gained share in ready-to-drink tea. So we think we can do well in each of the categories that represent non-alcoholic ready-to-drink. And in particular, we can still grow sparkling. And that growth of sparkling into the future is not just in aggregate, but I think over the long-term, we'll see increased growth of low, no and reduced calorie variants. I know that's not the case yet in the North America, but globally in our international business, those drinks outgrow the regular drinks within sparkling and they're fueling our growth, so broad-based growth.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Then on your question of 4% to 5% organic growth, volume versus price\/mix, so we expect that to be balanced, volume versus the price. So as you know, we have the strategy where we now focused more on net revenues. And as we are segmenting our markets and we're focused on price realization, so we do anticipate that strategy will continue and that will achieve a balance between both volume and price.","As advertising and promotions, in 2014, we announced this program. We said $800 million to $1 billion that we would invest. We are still going to invest, continue to invest behind our brands on that program, although we're also going to start investing in R&D. So basically, we're still on our program that we announced back in 2014, so you will continue to see investment in marketing kind of slightly above gross profits.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So on refranchisement, obviously, good news that it's going faster, but I still have a few questions on this. One is I get the discussion about holding onto juice. I'm not quite there on hot-fill, so if you can elaborate on that, that would be helpful.","Trying to get a better sense, secondarily, about when you think you will actually be able to grow out of the dilution. So there's clearly dilution right now, and then 2016, 3% to 4%, and then probably 2017, but at what point will you be able to grow out of that dilution, given kind of better margin, top-line growth, et cetera?","And then kind of the core question is that you mentioned your goal was by buying the North America Bottling, that you would be able to accelerate momentum for sales and profitability. And I agree you've kind of done that, going to smaller pack sizes, increasing prices, closing some plants, increasing media spend, improving IT, but I guess I'm still confused why you had to buy one consolidated bottler, I guess, in North America to do a lot of those changes. I mean, why do you have to spend billions of dollars to push these changes through? Was there not a more efficient for shareholders way to do it? And I guess in that context, how do you give investors confidence? Because I get this question a lot, how do you give investors confidence that five, 10 years down the line, you won't have to buy these bottlers back again in North America?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Ali, let me start with the last. First, when we announced the acquisition of CCE, it was, essentially, kind of a 25-year-old problem, and we said it would take a while to basically course correct. The level of investment was not where it was needed, and also the level of customer service was not where it was needed. And, essentially, we believe that having more than just one bottler essentially having that big a territory was a better way. Scalable size bottlers, right ownership values, right structure and right capability, and that's what we have today in North America. And so, we feel very good that this is a model that is going to stay where it is and continue to add value. It's not going to require any further \u2013 all of the time, there will be tweaking necessary, but not the scale that was needed when we did the transaction back at the end of 2010. And so, that was a core decision that was needed. That was a major surgery that was needed, and that's really what took place.","As far as the juice business is concerned, as I said before, it's an integrated business. It basically performs well as an integrated business, similar to other juice businesses that we have around the world. It's a very different model. It's a very different production. It's a very different \u2013 grove to table model, and requires a different way in terms of its distribution, especially when it is chilled. And that's really where a lot of the growth is and value-added dairy. And that's what you see, whether it's in fairlife, or that's what you see, whether it's in juice. And it's a very distinct production model, very different, as well as hot-fill is also the same, so same with Innocent in Europe, the same with many parts of the world. And so, Jugos Del Valle is also very similar in terms of the way it's produced, and that is just a needed aspect for success and for performance in the hot-fill and juice business, very different.","Now, to your other question related to dilution from franchising, maybe I'll pass it over to Kathy.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Certainly. So we've given you guidance for 2016. 2017, it totally depends on timing. So, we plan to give you more information to help with that, with your modeling, between CAGNY, and what we will give you before the end of the quarter, but it's all based on timing. In 2018, you asked when we would grow out of this. We plan to complete the program by the end of 2017. So, 2018, we are out of it.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And our long-term outlook, just to add, for the industry, remains very positive, Ali. Our system is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of this. We're going to be a much more focused company. We're going to be building brands, leading the system, and driving new growth platforms. So, our core business will have attractive growth going forward, in terms of ROIC, free cash flow and so forth. And so we're very confident and very excited about where the company is going, from that aspect.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, I apologize. Maybe I wasn't clear on the dilution piece to it. I understand the timing of the program. I'm not looking for timing in terms of when in 2017 something happens. I'm more looking longer-term, and if you're getting rid of these businesses, you will be a better growing business, right, better margin, better growing business? That's the hope. That's, I think all of us, as we're trying to estimate longer-term. I'm just trying to figure out, because you're going to be better, when do you offset the dilution? So you're growing faster, you've taken a hit. When are you going to offset the dilution? At what point in time, effectively, do you become net positive and then go beyond that? So, that was the question. Maybe, Kathy, if you can kind of refine your answer. I'll leave it at that, if you can help there.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So in, basically, so 2018, obviously, there will be some dilution effect because the base hasn't been totally adjusted by that time. But once we get the base adjusted, short of other structural impacts, which will not be North America refranchising obviously, but short of other structural impacts, we will have \"gone through that refranchising impact.\" Now, we do have some residual costs that will come out, as I said, throughout 2016, 2017, and there will be a little bit left in 2018, that certainly by mid to late 2018, even the residual costs will be gone. So I think once the base is reset, short of other types of structural impacts, we will have transitioned through that.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Just one last question, sorry, on diets, it looks like volumes are down 5%, but that's better than we've seen recently. Can you give us some color on whether you're seeing that actually kind of stabilize and perhaps a little bit improve, or is it because Pepsi changed formulation and you guys are kind of getting the benefit of it? Just some idea of whether that's getting better on diets would be helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Ali, it's James here. Look, I think in the U.S. business, we did reasonably well in growing Coke Zero. We're getting Coke Zero back to flat, and there's still a decline in Diet Coke. I think the bigger picture is in the 80% of our business which is the international business, the diets and lights and Coke Zeros outgrew Coke Classic, and so we're seeing broad-based growth outside the U.S. of those Coca-Cola variants, and that's what gives us the belief that in the long-term, we will be able to turn around the business also in the U.S.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, just finally add on that, Ali, also with our recently-announced One Brand approach to marketing trademark Coke, we're extending the strong brand equity of Coca-Cola across the trademark to offer consumers more choice and to also better promote our great-tasting diet and light portfolio, which is going to, no question, help. So I think that's going to also help us with the stability that is the target. So I'll just leave it at that.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, James, Kathy, and Tim. So in summary, we delivered the plan that we laid out at the beginning of last year. And we made significant progress against our five strategic initiatives that we laid out. Importantly, our progress against these initiatives is leading to improving performance, even in a very challenging macro environment. And we are evolving and strengthening our global bottling system as we accelerate refranchising and return to a predominantly cost rate-driven model with significantly higher margins and returns.","The long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising, and we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is best-positioned to capture that growth in non-alcoholic beverages and to deliver long-term value to our shareowners.

Recognizing the number of companies reporting today, we have limited our prepared remarks to provide plenty of time for questions and complete the call at approximately 9:50.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance. During the quarter, we continued our progress towards transforming our company to a higher margin and return business focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value, and leading our franchise system. Our continued focus on our five strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another quarter of global value share gains, while delivering 3% organic revenue growth in a worsening macroeconomic environment.","Importantly, our segmented revenue growth strategies drove three points of price\/mix in the quarter. Further, our strong focus on productivity was instrumental in expanding operating profit margins and delivering our profit target. While we are pleased we accelerated our price\/mix from 1% last quarter to 3% this quarter, our volume and top-line results still fell short of our expectations. This was largely due to a weakening demand in certain large emerging and developing markets, which also impacted our company-owned bottling operations' revenue growth. Within our Bottling Investments segment, positive pricing at our North American bottler was offset by challenges in our China bottling operations, resulting in even organic revenues for our company-owned bottling operations globally.","However, our core franchise operations continued to perform well, growing organic revenues a full point ahead of our consolidated organic revenues and in line with our long-term targets. Despite weaker conditions in several emerging and developing markets, we continued to see a positive return on our marketing investments, with solid performance in key markets such as United States, Japan, and Mexico, which James will touch on in more detail.","While the macroeconomic headwinds we are facing in these emerging and developing markets are cyclical in nature and not secular downturns, we're not expecting a material improvement in the remainder of the year, given the continuing volatility in the global economy. This outlook, coupled with where we are year-to-date, will make achieving our previous 4% to 5% organic revenue growth rate very challenging. Therefore, we are lowering our outlook for full-year consolidated organic revenue growth. James and Kathy will discuss this in greater detail later on the call.","With that being said, we remain fully committed and confident in achieving our underlying profit target, despite this challenging environment. We're also confident that our core organic revenue growth will continue to outperform our consolidated organic revenue growth by a full point.","Finally, we remain on track with our refranchising efforts, and we are confident we will complete those efforts by the end of 2017. Over the past few months, we successfully completed the Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa transactions, announced the transfer of certain territories in the United States to Arca Continental, UNITED venture and reached a new understanding with Coca-Cola FEMSA regarding joint value creation in Mexico and certain territorial expansion opportunities for company-owned bottling operations, which was announced just this morning. As we work through the comprehensive refranchising and near-term macro challenges, we will emerge a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets.","I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why, and what we're doing about that. Our volume deceleration from the first quarter was concentrated in a few number of markets facing specific macroeconomic challenges; firstly, China, but also Argentina and Venezuela. The slowdown in our consolidated organic revenue versus our core organic revenue, which grew 4%, the consolidated slowdown was due to our Bottling Investments segment slowdown. It's the mechanical effect of owning both bottling operations as well as concentrate operations in certain challenged markets. BIG slowdown was principally driven by the challenges the industry, the broad industry, is facing in China.","So let's start with China. And what are we doing about it? There are three factors impacting our performance in China. First, no question, the overall consumer environment is weakening due to the economy's economic transition. Secondly, as this is occurring, wholesalers are adjusting to lower expected sales growth and bringing down inventory levels, which has a whiplash effect on our bottler sales. Third, there are some category mix shifts occurring as different consumer segments respond to these new circumstances. For example, juice and juice drinks category is the weakest performing, whereas premium water is stronger and positive. So there's an opportunity here to both innovate with more premium products positioned for the higher income new mainstream consumer segment, as well as opportunities to address strong affordability needs across the rural and blue-collar areas.","So I guess importantly, perhaps most importantly, what are we doing about it? Firstly, we've got a number of new premiumizing offers across multiple categories we compete in being launched. We're also focusing on better execution, particularly in the second tier and rural areas where they serve more of the mass consumer segment and upping the game in terms of affordable offerings. We are also rebasing the way we approach trade incentives to drive better performance with wholesaler and from our own distributors.","Now, despite these actions to improve our business, we still expect our China operation to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. This is a key factor driving the organic revenue outlook, particularly the difference between consolidated and core, but I think it is worth finally making a note that we are keeping a long-term perspective with regard to China. We always knew that for a country as large as China, transitioning to a consumer-led economy was going to have its challenges. Those may have turned out to be more than we expected in the short-term; however, we absolutely believe in the long-term opportunity of this market of 1.4 billion consumers with relatively low beverage per capitas compared to the global average.","Okay. So that's China. Let's move for a second to our core business. The core business, understood as the concentrate and the franchising business, this is where we grew organic revenues 4% for the first half of the year as segmented revenue growth strategies continue to drive positive results. Yes, some markets are tough, but others are doing very well.","Let me start, perhaps, with the more challenging markets. I've already touched on China, so let me move to a couple of the other ones I mentioned earlier. Argentina, we believe that the Argentinian government is taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, but this is resulting in a contraction in the near-term that accelerated in the second quarter, therefore impacting our business. In Venezuela, severe shortages in certain raw materials resulted in us temporarily suspending production at the bottling partners' plants during the quarter, clearly impacting the results.","Additionally, Brazil, the challenges there are well-understood and we think will continue for the remainder of the year; however, we are focusing on key affordability packages and activating a strong Olympic marketing campaign in the coming weeks and months. We have lived through downturns before in emerging and developing markets and understand how to manage the business in these circumstances. It requires a disciplined approach to pricing relative to inflation and, of course, where necessary, aggressively moving to address consumer dynamics through adjusting the portfolio, both in terms of affordability and product innovation.","But as I said earlier, not every market is under pressure. In markets with relatively stable economies, we are executing our strategies and seeing strong results. For example, in North America, we grew organic revenues 4% in the quarter, reflecting continued pricing initiatives for our sparkling business as well as the ongoing strength of our stills portfolio. In Mexico and Japan, we're delivering strong performance across our portfolio, driven heavily by innovation. And turning to some of the emerging markets, in Southeast Asia, we are growing volume double digits year-to-date behind strong integrated marketing and commercial initiatives across the core brands and key entry level packaging.","Taken together, these results give us confidence that in stable markets where we increase our investments in marketing innovation, combined with improving marketplace execution, we can continue to deliver strong performance. Ultimately, we operate in over 200 countries, and there will always be some markets with macro challenges. Our ability to grow doesn't require macro perfection.","In fact, even with this current broader macro adjustment phase in a good number of emerging markets, our segmented revenue growth strategies are enabling us to capture solid pricing of 3% year-to-date for our core operations on top of 1% volume growth. And we're using the productivity to prudently fund marketing where there is momentum and where we see a solid payback, but we're also holding on and making sure that we can use it to deliver strong underlying margin expansion. These actions have enabled us to grow underlying profit before tax in line with our expectations for the first half of the year, and despite more challenging conditions than we initially expected.","So let me conclude by saying we are confident in our growth strategies. We continue to push in markets where we see success and proactively address those markets that are more challenged, of course, while always keeping an eye on the long-term.","So with that, let me hand over to Kathy to take you through the numbers.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full-year outlook. Starting at the top line, our organic revenue growth was impacted about a point by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investments segment grew slower than our core business. At gross profit, our comparable margin declined 20 basis points due to currency and structural headwinds. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points, driven by solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment, productivity and segment mix. Our comparable operating margin improved about 15 (14:31) basis points. Similar to gross margin, currency and structural headwinds impacted our operating margin. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying operating margin increased about 180 basis points in the quarter, due to gross margin expansion, as well as the timing of productivity savings and certain expenses.","Now, turning to outlook, as Muhtar mentioned, we are revising our full-year top line target. For the full year, we now expect 3% organic revenue growth. With that said, we are confident our strategies will deliver stronger organic growth for our core business. And we are maintaining our full-year underlying profit target as we continue to manage our business. Therefore, we expect to deliver comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax growth of 6% to 8%, in line with our long-term target.","During the first half of the year, we generated strong underlying operating leverage. Consistent with our previously-provided guidance, we expect this to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons in the back half of this year. Coca-Cola European Partners closed about a month earlier than we estimated in our previous structural guidance. And we continue to move faster with our refranchising efforts in North America. Therefore, we are updating our full-year structural outlook. We now expect a six to seven point structural headwind on net revenue and a four point headwind on income before tax. Our currency outlook remains the same as our previous guidance, a two to three point headwind on net revenue and an eight to nine point headwind on income before tax. So taking all of this into consideration, we expect full-year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%.","And there are a few phasing items to consider when constructing your models. Our fourth quarter has two additional days, as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. In addition, the two additional days in the fourth quarter, coupled with what we are cycling in SG&A in the third quarter of last year, means operating leverage will skew strongly into the fourth quarter.","Therefore, we expect virtually all of our growth in comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax to come in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a nine point headwind on net revenue and a three point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be a two point headwind on net revenue and a two to three point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter.","In closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year, and we continue to accelerate our refranchising efforts. While our expectations for top line growth have softened, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit target this year.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Powers of UBS. Your line is open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Hi. Good morning. Maybe we could start with a question for James on China mainly, because it sounds like that market was the biggest driver of the gap between your reported 3% organic growth and the 4% core number that you that cited, and I'm guessing it cost you roughly a point of unit case volume in the quarter as well. So first, is that right? But more importantly, is there a way to parse how much of the adverse impact is tied to the macro slowing, which I think is more likely to persist, versus supply chain corrections and wholesaler inventory de-stockings, which might hopefully be more transitory?","I guess I'm really trying to assess just how much of a headwind China was in Q2 and then how severe you expect the ongoing headwind to be, acknowledging the improvement initiatives that you called out? And then finally, do the issues facing BIG in China impede, at all, your ability to refranchise that market on time and on favorable terms? Thanks.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Okay. Morning, Steve. So, okay, let me try and get to China, and let me start from the top and work downwards, if I may. I mean, firstly, it's clear that, when you look at The Coke Company, almost half our revenue comes from bottling versus the other half comes from concentrate and franchise, but given, as you all know, that a bottling business comes with four to five times more revenue per drink sold and the accompanying cost, any effect on the revenue of the bottler is going to have a magnified impact on revenue and much less on profits, which is part of this dynamic.","So in China, it's our largest international bottling operation. We own bottlers that are roughly 20% of the global business, but the biggest one outside the U.S. is China. So that's where it's coming from. And it's the mechanical impact of being hit in China, where we own about a third of the system, that's creating that whole difference between the 3% and the 4%. And what we've assumed in our outlook, just to be more confident, clear in our confidence going forward, is we have not really assumed that China is going to get better in the rest of the year. So if it did, that would be great. But we are assuming it's not in terms of our outlook and guidance, but obviously we're working to try and make it better.","Now, as I said, as you kind of tried to split the difference, what's changing is both the consumer and the supply chain. I think in round numbers from a revenue perspective, you've got about half the impact coming from the consumer and half coming from the supply chain.","What's happening on the consumer, you can see is it in the scanned Neilson, and the non-scanned Neilson is probably a bit worse than the scanned Neilson in terms of slowdown in sell-out to the consumers of all types of FMCG categories, so it is a kind of a broad-based consumer slowdown. Within that, from a beverage point of view, you've got juice drinks and juices, which were kind of more for the rural areas and blue-collar, they are down double digits in terms of revenue from a consumer point of view. Something like Coke is down low single digits and premium waters is growing. So there's a shift in the category mix going on, which is also actually impacts revenue because juice drink prices tend to be higher than sparkling or water, so that doesn't flow through to profitability. So there is a kind of rebasing going on in there.","But as I said, about half of it's the supply chain, the whiplash effect of the de-stocking by the customers and that, as you say, is likely to be a much shorter-term impact, but, again, we're working on it, but we're not including an improvement in that in our outlook, although clearly, we want to get focused on it and get it to work.","I agree with you. The consumer thing will take a little more time to come back, which is why we're focused on our kind of the game plan we know that works in downturns, where we focus on affordability, on premiumizing for those parts of the country, like the premium metro areas, and bringing out new products for them. And that way, we believe we can gain value share, which we continue to do, in China, so that we're set up as the consumer starts recovering. So about half and half and we believe that the consumer will come back and the supply chain will sort itself out in the relative short-term in the rest of this year.","Now, with regard to the refranchising, obviously, can't really comment on the M&A, but I would say that we and our partners all believe in the long-term potential of the China market. We're very excited and, as I said, because a large part of what's happening in the short-term is de-stocking in inventory. Everyone's looking past that and looking to the long-term, and I think there's still good motivation and animation by everyone to get the deal done. And we'll obviously, from our point of view, make sure we do it on the right terms for ourselves. And they'll be looking for the right terms for them, but we still think it's the right deal for everyone and with a good likelihood of getting done.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to better understand why you maintain the FX-neutral income before taxes guidance, despite the negative full-year top-line revision. I'm assuming part of that is just the top-line weakness is in lower margin areas, so probably less of a margin impact, but can you give us more detail on why the local FX profit goals have not been as impacted by top-line weakness and how much visibility you have on the profit side and any leverage you have to protect downside if macros weaken further?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dara, I'll just comment first and then maybe ask Kathy and James if they want to add anything. But certainly you've answered part of it by saying that, yes, revenue challenges are coming from those areas that have much lower margins, number one, for sure. And then, secondly, productivity efforts are continuing that's driving the margin expansion in quarter two. Kathy mentioned the significant margin expansions that we have achieved. And I think productivity efforts are going to continue.","And then, finally, I think there's also a mix. Some of our better markets, more profitable markets, are doing well, like the United States and Mexico and also in the Far East and Japan, so there's a mix issue. And then, finally, the commodities continue to be pretty benign in terms of the outlook. So those are the things that play into all together, but primarily, the one that you mentioned, which is the revenue challenges are coming from much lower margin areas in terms of our business. Kathy, anything to add?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I would say that those are the reasons, Muhtar. I would say probably you are picking up the fact that we do have more difficult comps in the back half for some of the things that Muhtar mentioned, but we are confident that we will still be on our guidance.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're overall very confident that the changes in marketing, the strategy on innovation pipeline, the One Brand strategy, which is just at the beginning, the promotions that we have in store in the summer around the Olympics, the price\/mix expansion that we've experienced in quarter two, all of that we feel play very into the equation and feel, give us confidence in the back half that there are likely more challenging comps in the back half that we can actually cycle them and achieve them going forward and feel confident that we can.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj, Bernstein. Your line is open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just a couple of clarifications; one is on back to guidance, and, look, if comparable currency neutral income, excuse me, before taxes is still in the 6% to 8% range for 2016 relative to Q1 guidance, so you gave that same guidance in Q1, and the structural move only went from negative 3% to 4%, to negative 4%, so, like a 50 basis points change there, currency is still a 8% to 9% drag. I guess I'm confused about what's driving the EPS guidance effectively down by two points at the midpoint. So what's going on between profit before tax and the EPS to drag it down another two points? Because the only thing that seems like it's changing is the structural, in what you've told us, relative to Q1. That's my first question. I have another one, if you permit me.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, Ali. So basically, it's in the rounding. So, yes, we gave comparable currency neutral guidance on EPS of 4% to 6%, and that was comparable currency neutral. So then when you either take out another rounded point of structural, so it rounded down, but it's really is a rounding point of structural. And then you take out currency, that gets you basically in the actual numbers, if you take out only a point of structural, gets you to 3% to 6%, but then it's in the rounding, so that's how we came up with the 4% to 7%.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If you start with the 4% to 6%, you back out the currency and you back out a rounded point of structural, that gets you down to your 3% to 6% and then it's really in the rounding to get to the 4% to 7%.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I have trouble getting there. Maybe I'll follow up. I still see it being kind of an incremental point somewhere in there. But basically you're saying there's no change in the gap between PBT and EPS. Tax isn't changing. There's no other things in there, right?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. That's correct.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Maybe I'll follow up just about the rounding point to help me with my math.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","The second piece is in the press release and, James, in some of your comments, I think, you said, look, we are, from the release, \"reassessing local market initiatives\". Can you tell us a little bit more about what you mean exactly, so where? Is it all about China, perhaps Argentina? And is advertising spend as a percentage of sales still up for you in the quarter? And does it impact, in any way, this confidence we had a year ago, six months ago, about really good ROIs on the marketing spend? Thanks.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. I think perhaps that's two questions in the second question there, Ali, but let me have a go. Look, in terms of reassessing the actions, that's both on the places with momentum and the places that are suffering. There are parts of the business that are growing strongly, whether that's at one end of the spectrum like the U.S. and Japan, where we've got good momentum. And the U.S. grew organically 4% in the quarter. Japan is growing well. We are increasing the amount of spend as we see the tailwinds and the effectiveness of the marketing, the innovation, the execution.","So we're reallocating money to the places that have momentum. And that's on the developed end, like the U.S. and Japan. It's also on the emerging end, like Indonesia and the Philippines and places like that. So we're going where we see the opportunity to get the biggest bang for the buck.","Now, we're taking some of the money from those markets that are under most pressure, and, in those places, we're prioritizing. Yes, there's still some advertising, but we're doing innovations and we're doing execution and very importantly, doing affordability. So the most extreme example perhaps is Venezuela, where there was no sugar. And we've actually doubled-down on really driving Coke with zero sugar in Venezuela with kind of a full red One Brand look. So there are places where we are adjusting to the need that just because you advertise, doesn't mean people are going to buy if it's an affordability problem. And I think China is a good example of where affordability is in there as well, and I think I've talked a bit about China.","But the game plan that we've used in those emerging markets under pressure, we're really (30:44) rolling out, so that reassessing is moving some top line money to those with momentum and doubling-down on execution and affordability and innovation in those pressured markets. And that kind of goes a bit to the advertising. Advertising is up this quarter as we continue to see the value of advertising as part of the marketing mix in combination with innovation and execution. It's only when you get all of those together that you really get the best returns, and we always look to make sure that all three are there. Otherwise, we'll end up wasting our money.","So we're out there and we're pushing ahead with it. And I think what we always have said is that advertising takes some time to work. So, for example, the One Brand strategy that we announced in the first quarter, we started the rollout, the latest iteration of the graphics went into Mexico a couple of months ago. That sort of marketing innovation takes time to build up an effect. So we'll keep pressing away with the investment and keep assessing. It's too early to call the success. We'd do that towards the end of the year, but we are focused on making that work.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ali, just to add to the point of ROIC on the marketing, when you take into account the price\/mix expansion going from 1% to 3% in the quarter, when you take into account the core business that we have, which is really the company that's emerging out of this very rapid transformation and refranchising, is growing still at a point ahead of the total company currently consolidated number, which is at 4%, which is within our sort of long-term growth target that we've espoused to and talked about. I think that's also not maybe a micro metric, but certainly an important metric to consider in terms of the payback on also all the activity. And we are still in the early days of the One Brand strategy. It just launched in Mexico a few months ago, just launched in Europe and parts of Europe. So again, we feel confident that that is going to continue to work in our benefit, coupled with the marketing that James talked about.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I look forward to it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks for the question. Just two quick ones for me, there is a lot of stuff going on at Coke right now, international organization management, refranchising at an accelerated pace. I'm just curious if you can give us some clarity on maybe how much of the volume issue this quarter was partly related to disruption. And then, just on the price\/mix, I mean, it's pretty good number. We've seen a kind of 3% price\/mix a couple of times over the past two years. Just curious on what you think the sustainability of that magnitude of price\/mix is as we think out the next one to two years.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. Let me start. I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just throw out another way of looking at it, has started at the beginning of the year. I think it's probably one of the few times we've seen the developed and our developing countries grow volume and actually seen the emerging markets decline in aggregate. I know we only put out the numbers by groups. But if you look at developed companies and developing economies, you see volume growth in both those blocks of countries.","So in the end, our business, when you take the segmented roles, we've got volume growth and price\/mix growth in developed and developing countries, which is very positive in terms of the long-term trajectory of the business. North America has got multi-years of making that work at the revenue line, so that's very strong. The volume weakness is all in the emerging markets, and it's all concentrated in a few of the emerging markets. It's big in some of those markets, but it's very concentrated. And the people then on the country levels are all largely still the same and working on these problems. So hopefully, that gives you a little insight on where the volume weakness is, but I don't think it has anything to do with the reorganization. In fact, I think the reorganization is helping us bring some refreshed views and some experience on what to do in emerging market weakness going forward in the downhill this year and into the future.","And then on the price\/mix, 3% is a good result. I think we've always talked about our long-term growth model calls for 4% to 6% revenue growth. And we see a balanced split between volume and price\/mix into the future. So that gives you a 2% to 3% for price\/mix as the component of the long-term growth. And also, 3% is a strong result. Long may it live. For the long-term growth model, we're looking for 4% to 6% in a balanced way.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Two questions, one on Europe specifically, James, I guess I am surprised Spain was down in the quarter. You cited weather, but it's been doing pretty well, so what is going on in Spain beyond weather? And can you give us any color on Great Britain, because Europe overall had a nice sequential \u2013 or at least did better than where consensus was, so looking for some color there? And then, Kathy, on FX, really no change in your FX view for the year. Can you remind us how you're hedged on some key currencies and how that might play out, the duration of those hedges and what those currencies are?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. On Europe, I think Europe got a little bit better this quarter. There are things weighing on our business. I'm not a big fan of calling out weather as a driver of performance. The weather occurs, for good or for bad, all around the world. Now, in the case of Spain and also France, at kind of that end of the Mediterranean, it was particularly poor in the middle part of the quarter. So that's really what's driving what's going on in the Spanish business and also it impacted the French business. So we see Europe getting a little bit better.","I mean, we had some good results out of Germany. And, as you said, some sequential improvement out of GB cycling out of some of the supply chain problems and as they got fixed, that came out of the first quarter. So we see that starting to improve going forward, but I think I hate calling out the weather, but I think that's really the reason in Spain, and France. And I think we'll start to see those businesses get better.","Now, it is worth saying that we've got a lot of good programs in Europe, but the recent tragic events in Belgium, in France, and recently in Germany, do weigh on consumer sentiment and consumer behavior. They go out less and we have strong on-premise businesses, in fact, particularly in Spain. And that is being dragged down as people respond to some of these tragic events by, perhaps, staying at home a little more. Now, that hopefully will get better in time as the security situation improves, but I don't want to get into weather and global events. I think the business in Europe can get better. We've got a lot of launches coming up and we've got some strong programs. I think Europe can continue to perform.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. And quick follow-up on that specific to Spain, what does your work say about underlying health of the business, either because of performance in July? You're saying it sequentially should get better but I'm kind of wondering what's underlying that view. How are you getting to that?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","I mean, I'm not going to comment on the beginning of July from a volume perspective. I would note that I think July was the biggest-ever month for Spain last year, so they've got some tough comps to cycle. They had a record summer last year. The underlying business in Spain is improving. Firstly, the economy is getting better. Secondly, the supermarket environment in terms of rational pricing and some of the activities is getting better. And the Spanish bottler made a massive investment going into last year to reinvest in returnable glass, which is one of the preeminent places in the world where this is true in the on-premise accounts. And that's starting to show good results, notwithstanding the weather and the security impacts in the year-to-date. And now, with the CCEP deal closed and management fully focused on leveraging the best of the marketing, the best of the innovation and really doubling-down on the execution, I think we'll start to see improvements in Spain and the other CCEP territories.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Excellent. Great. Thank you, James.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on currency, so, yes, we did not change our guidance this quarter. We've had a lot of movement in some key currencies, but basically they are offsetting each other. Given the volatility that we've seen kind of across the portfolio, some currencies are getting better, like Brazil. Some are staying the same or getting worse, like a Mexico. Our hard currencies, we are hedged 100%, basically, and then we hedge our emerging market currencies on a short-term basis as kind of opportunistically. With 2017 being fully hedged for our hard currencies and, obviously, our exposure then would be basically in our emerging market currencies.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So you said you're fully hedged for hard currencies for calendar 2017, for the duration of 2017?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. For 2017, that's correct.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Great. Okay. Thank you.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to go back and follow up on the price\/mix question. And clearly, the 3% is a good number, but obviously you're benefiting from pretty high inflationary markets. So I just wanted to better understand how much of this is really coming from your segmentation, the revenue segmentation strategy versus the price growth that you're seeing in inflationary markets, so any granularity that you can give us would be helpful. And then a little bit related to that, I think the flat volume growth that you've seen this quarter, I can't recall the last time you had this kind of volume trend. So, again, how much of this is really a function of your strategy to focus more on revenue and not chase unprofitable volume growth and if this is something that you'd be willing to accept for some period of time?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Judy, good morning, again. It's Muhtar. First, I think James talked in detail about where the volume shortfalls were coming from and specifically related to certain large emerging markets that drove that number, and so that's related to Brazil. That's related to China being the large ones, but also Russia. All of those emerging markets that used to have better disposable incomes, better macro conditions, basically drove some of that. And going forward, certainly, we expect some improvement in that area. So that's number one.","Number two, I think important to note that, again, mentioned that the developed markets grew and developing markets grew volume and were ahead of the total company number, which was flat and ahead of emerging markets.","That itself will tell you that certainly the price\/mix coming from those markets and then the total geographic mix that coupled with that, is something that was instrumental in driving our price\/mix number in the way it landed in the quarter. So all of those factors and algebras, all the algebra coming together is what made that, the country mix coming out of that, the geographic mix and then the volume, coupled with the pricing that we got. And today, when you look at our U.S. business, with 4% organic revenue growth in North America, that tells you that that is in, certainly, in very much in the upper quartile of all large consumer businesses in the country. We are doing very, very well. Japan performed well.","Again, Mexico performed very well in terms of the volume and pricing combined, driving the total number of price\/mix. So all of that really goes to explain and hopefully answers your question on that. Anything to add, James, there? Okay.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the price\/mix question, Judy, so we did have this quarter, price\/mix was positive across in all of our groups. Yes, primarily driven by Latin America and inflationary pricing, but also operational pricing in EAG, but then it was offset by some segment mix coming from the Bottling Investments segment. So, as James said, pricing of 2% to 3% is what we expect and what we would think would be very good pricing and in line with our segmentation strategy, even though EAG was probably more than kind of out of its normal range at this point, but North America, pricing is still very strong. So we do believe in the segment strategy and the 2%, 3% is kind of what we expect going forward.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then, the sparkling segment, just to finalize that, continues to be a segment of the non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink, where consumers continue to spend a very large amount of money and in terms of consumer spend and in terms of the dollar value, is still very, very healthy. And that's why it gives us confidence looking into the future about what we're doing in terms of the segmented revenue growth strategy and in terms of the marketing approach and the One Brand strategy in taking the lion's share of that spend going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just two quick ones, one, for James, just you've talked a lot I think on this call about some of the short-term things that have affected organic sales and kind of changes, I guess, sequentially in the environment since the start of the year. Can you just update us on kind of what your view for the industry forecast is, maybe not so much for this year but just over the medium-term, has there been any change in terms what you think the non-alcohol ready-to-drink beverage industry is going to grow over the medium-term?","And then, second question, just you had mentioned Coke FEMSA earlier and it looks like you've got an agreement with them to negotiate on a preferred basis. Could you just sort of expand upon that a little bit? Are they exclusively looking at some of these territories or is it a matter that they're just getting a first look? Thank you.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. I think in your first question, I mean, our medium-term outlook for the industry hasn't really changed. We're still expecting robust growth in the industry in the long-term, driven by the disposal income, urbanization, the middle class, innovation. We see these things expanding. Now, we've talked about that being in the 5% sort of ballpark and then probably in the next few years, talked about it being in the 4%. So we do see it coming back over time. But we do see industry growth slightly moderated in the short-term, as we talked a little bit about in some of the previous conferences.","Now, you did ask the question, which kind of seemed short to me because I think I would \u2013 give me a second to just re-underline from our point of view, the biggest mechanical impact in the quarter and the year-to-date is this asymmetry between where we own bottlers and where it is less than 20% of the volume or about 20% of the volume versus being in 200 countries. If you part the bottling side, and just look at the core concentrate and franchise, we're running organic at 4% and we're meeting our profit guidance.","So we're not trying to say small ups and downs in the macro economies is what should buffet us every quarter, we just need to deal with those things. I just think there's this one asymmetrical effect of the bottling thing, which is kind of important, which is affecting the number. But I don't want to give the impression we're seeing a massive \u2013 or trying to signal a deterioration in outlook for the concentrate and franchise business.","Now, with regard to Coke FEMSA, yeah, we talked about looking at some territories on a preferred basis. I'm not going to get into exactly how that means in terms of what preferred means versus exclusive, et cetera, but they're our biggest bottling partner. We have a very strong relationship. We've made an agreement on how we're going to create more value together in Mexico and how they can look to participate in some of the refranchising of the territories that we own in bottling and we're very excited about doing more stuff together.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So as I look at some of the disclosure in the press release, it seems like you've broken from convention a little bit, a lot less brand disclosure, Trademark Coca-Cola only called out in North America. You guys aren't breaking out sparkling and stills anymore. So I'm just curious if we can get a little more color on Trademark Coke outside of North America and China, and also whether the change in convention speaks to a broader shift in terms of how you're thinking about balancing volumes across your portfolio? Thank you.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, I think, yes, I mean, in part, please read into this that we're moving the business to more of a revenue focus. I mean, absolutely under the heading everything communicates, that is part of what we're trying to say. We believe in our segmented revenue approach. It's not that we have forgotten about volume or don't believe it's an underlying driver in the long-term, particularly in the emerging markets of what's going to create the business over the long-term, but as we look at places like North America and some of the other developed markets, clearly, we're going after more of a revenue strategy that's driven by smaller packages, by some pricing actions, so we do want to call out that perhaps the best way to think about health of the business going into the future is the revenue growth.","And that's where I think what we're trying to say is, not just the beverage industry, the sparkling industry category and brand Coke all remain healthy in terms of revenue growth. All three of those are growing revenue globally, and we continue to see good attraction both in the U.S. in terms of sparkling revenue growth and internationally in terms of sparkling revenue growth.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I would like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, James, Kathy and Tim. I'd say we're on track with transforming The Coca-Cola Company to one that is even more focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system, the transformation that will result in significantly higher margin and returns. The macro headwinds are putting pressure on our top line, but they're cyclical in nature and we're taking the right actions that give us confidence that we will emerge a much stronger company, while we also deliver our profit targets. We remain confident that the long-term dynamics of our industry are promising, and we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders.","As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning."],"5739":["The Coca-Cola Co.

While many markets around the world face macroeconomic challenges, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver improved top line results. Net revenues grew 4% on an organic basis, driven by positive price\/mix and 3% growth in concentrate shipments, as outlined on our second quarter performance scorecard on slide four.","Our top line performance was broad-based, with each operating segments delivering positive organic revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of our global brand portfolio and the robust distribution capabilities of our bottling partners.","As a result, we once again gained global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages. This represents the 32nd quarter in a row that we've gained NARTD value share, an important metric for us, particularly in a tough macroeconomic environment. Notably, the levels of our volume and value share gains are accelerating versus the second quarter of last year.","Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter, cycling 3% in the prior-year. We've seen an improvement with all operating groups growing despite a shift in Easter holiday sales from the second quarter last year into the first quarter this year, as well as challenges in key emerging markets, most notably Brazil, Russia and India.","During the quarter, we continued our strong focus on controlling operating expenses. Even with a double-digit increase in our media spend, we were able to deliver a 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a comparable currency-neutral basis and grow our comparable currency-neutral operating income and PBT by 6% and 3% respectively in the quarter.","Finally, we generated record cash from operations and grew free cash flow 16% on a year-to-date basis, due in part to the six extra days in the first quarter, but also due to effective working capital initiatives, something Kathy will talk about later in the call.","Last year, we took decisive action to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. Halfway through our transition year, we're pleased with the progress we're making, but recognize that we still have much to do. We're acting with speed, with urgency against each of our five strategic initiatives.","First and foremost, our enhanced focus on revenue growth across market is delivering value share gains ahead of volume share gains on a consolidated basis, as well as in our International and North America businesses.","Our North America business delivered a very strong quarter, with 5% growth in organic revenues and 8% in comparable income before tax. This performance reflects increased marketing, a disciplined approach to managing volume, price and mix as well as the shift of July 4 holiday sales and our Share a Coke campaign into the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year.","Importantly, in North America we delivered revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio in the quarter due to further expansion of our pricing strategy, resulting in 4% sparkling price\/mix. Our disciplined price\/pack strategy has seen wide adoption across all retail channels as we emphasize smaller proprietary packages, while also raising prices on traditional packages, including 12-ounce cans and two-liter bottles. While sparkling unit case volume grew 1%, transactions increased 2% due to strong growth in the smaller packages, which are on trend with consumer preferences, such as our mini cans, which grew volume double-digits during the quarter.","The second action to reinvigorate growth is to increase our media investments globally to fully fund our brands across our markets around the world, while enhancing the quality of our advertising at the same time. In the markets where we are investing more with better quality, we're seeing better performance. Let me just give you an example of how marketing, along with solid execution by our bottling partners, is driving top line growth across our emerging, developing and developed markets.","Starting with our emerging markets, despite a soft macro environment in China, we grew brand Coca-Cola volume double-digits. A record 20 million consumers participated in China's Coca-Cola Break consumer promotion, which along with the third edition of the Share a Coke campaign, fueled our growth.","Turning to our developing markets; in Argentina, we gained both volume and value share and importantly gained value share ahead of volume share for the second quarter in a row, due in part to integrated marketing campaigns around Copa Am\u00e9rica, the main International football tournament for national teams in South America.","Finally, both the quantity and quality of marketing in North America helped us realize four points of sparkling price\/mix, resulting in solid revenue performance. The trends we're seeing in these markets, as well as initial results in other markets, gives us continued confidence that our stepped-up investments are working. Further, we still have significant opportunity in many other markets where we began increasing media investments towards the end of 2014. Given the typical 12-month to 24-month time period for these investments to deliver their full return, it will be 2016 before we see real results in some of these other regions.","Turning to productivity; we remain focused on fueling our reinvestment through embedding productivity into our DNA. We're on track across all spend areas to hit key milestones this year and deliver $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. One area, which we are seeing momentum is supply chain related savings, which benefited our gross margin in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've consolidated three distribution centers and closed one plant in North America, as well as began the process of installing in-line blow molding equipment.","Further, we recently kicked off the next phase of our zero-based work, which consists of a launch in our international markets and a second year of this work in corporate, as well as North America. Zero-based work is a mechanism that helps our leaders make very tough choices to free up resources that can be redeployed and reinvested to fund growth. As we go through this process, we're working to ensure that the priorities we are funding to drive growth in our business units are also seamlessly prioritized across our entire system.","The implementation of our new operating model is on track, and we have made significant headway on the previously announced head count reductions. This now includes Europe, where we began implementing changes this quarter following the appropriate consultations. As we begin operating within our new structure, we are actively engaging in connecting our global organization and implementing our standard processes.","Finally, focusing on our core business model, we continue to make progress on our North America refranchising efforts. During the quarter, we transitioned territories representing over 5% of the U.S. bottle\/can volume. Additionally, we announced the signing of new Letters of Intent for territories covering close to another 10% of the U.S. bottle\/can volume.","In aggregate, territories transitioned to-date and those covered by definitive agreements or Letters of Intent represent approximately 25% of the total U.S. bottle\/can volume. We're getting better; we're getting faster, which is why we are confident we're going to achieve our previously-stated goal to have approximately two-thirds of U.S. bottle\/can volume distributed by our independent bottlers by the end of 2017.","Our bottling partners are critical to our success. We held our annual global system meeting in May this year; and I can tell you that the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They are encouraged by our plans, and have committed to support our investments with further enhanced focus on local market execution.","To conclude, I would like to address the macro environment, given the challenges many CPG companies are encountering today and the fact that approximately 75% of our operating income is generated overseas.","The global economic recovery remains uneven. Given the continued slowdown of the Chinese economy, the prospective U.S. tightening cycle, as the U.S. prepares to increase interest rates, and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Greece and its place in the Eurozone. Additionally, many emerging markets, large and small, remain challenged, as evidenced by our low single-digit volume declines in both Brazil and Russia this quarter.","While we have the right strategic plans in place to navigate through the volatile operating environment, we're not fully immune. With that said, as we pass the midpoint of 2015, we're broadly where we expected to be.","I remain encouraged by our progress to-date, but also acknowledge that there's still much work ahead of us. We're confident in our strategies and execution, and remain on track to deliver against our full-year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations.","I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance, as well as update on our outlook for 2015.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter came in broadly as we expected. Organic revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and one point of positive price\/mix. Consolidated price\/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by negative geographic mix, consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter.","Concentrate shipments outpaced unit cases in the quarter, primarily due to the timing of shipments in our Asia Pacific group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipments were generally in line with unit cases on a consolidated basis.","Our comparable gross margin declined on a consolidated basis as positive pricing, productivity savings, and a slightly lower commodity cost were offset by currency headwinds and structural changes. Positive comparable currency-neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by the impact of structural items which unfavorably impacted gross margin, but was roughly neutral at operating income and income before taxes. For the quarter, comparable currency-neutral operating income grew 6%, including a mid single-digit increase in DME.","Below the operating line; on a comparable currency-neutral basis, net interest income, equity income, and other income were lower, resulting in 3% growth in comparable currency-neutral income before tax. Consistent with the outlook we provided on the last call, on a comparable basis, other income benefited from foreign exchange gains associated with the euro-denominated debt issued during the first quarter.","Our second quarter comparable EPS was $0.63, which included a six point currency headwind. On a comparable currency-neutral basis, our EPS grew 4% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to a net gain recognized in connection with the closing of the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation.","During the first six months of the year, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, up 16%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of six additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates. We returned $3.8 billion to share owners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first six months.","I'd like to take a moment to talk about working capital management, which we view as another key focus of productivity, as it is incremental to our P&L project and it adds significant value to the company and share owners by targeting cash flow improvements.","In 2013, we initiated a program to better manage our working capital with an initial focus on our trade receivables and payables. As a result of this program, we have improved our cash conversion cycle, which resulted in $400 million of incremental cash flow for the first six months of 2015 versus the prior-year.","Turning to outlook, halfway through our transition year we are where we expected to be, recognizing that economic growth remains challenging in many markets; notably Brazil, Russia and China. For the full-year 2015, our comparable currency-neutral outlook remains unchanged, although there are a few adjustments to specific items.","Our outlook for net interest is slightly more favorable, offset by a slightly larger impact from structural items at the profit before tax line. We estimate an increase in the currency impact in the back half of the year based on the latest exchange rates, and after considering our hedge position, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior-year rates, we now expect an approximate six point currency headwind on net revenue, 11 point headwind on operating income, and a seven point to eight point headwind on income before tax for the full-year 2015. And we expect net share repurchases for the year to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.","In addition, there a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the third quarter. Due to the timing of our fiscal quarter end, the benefit associated with the July 4 holiday fell in the second quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue and a one point to two point headwind on income before tax.","We currently estimate currency will be an approximate seven point headwind on net revenues, 13 point headwind on operating income, and a 10 point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior-year. The variance between the currency headwind on operating income and on income before tax is primarily due to the cycling re-measurement losses in the prior-year. Finally, while not a third quarter consideration, I wanted to remind you that in 2015 our fourth quarter will have six fewer selling days.","In summary, we are seeing initial progress based on our plan to reinvigorate top line growth, while recognizing that we continue to operate in a challenging macro environment. Therefore, while currency headwinds are increasing, we see no change to our full-year comparable currency-neutral growth expectations. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. The first question on queue is from Mr. John Faucher of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning. I want to talk a little bit about the advertising spending. There's been some questions \u2013 and I've had them myself \u2013 in terms of whether you're just sort of fighting a headwind in terms of trying to advertise the category. So, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing, how you're gauging the success that you're having, and kind of what we should expect from an advertising spending increase as a percentage of sales as we look out over the next sort of 12 months to 18 months? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, John. It's Muhtar here. I'll just say a few top line remarks about it and then also ask both Sandy and Ahmet to give some more specific details on their \u2013 in specific markets. I'd say overall pleased with our initial results, but as we've previously discussed and as I've just recently said it takes some time, anywhere from 12 months to 18 months, to realize the full value in terms of a return on those investments. We've found that disciplined quality marketing investments drive growth better than any other strategy or action.","We're seeing good initial results in markets that have received the incremental media investment and also have improved the quality of marketing in our case, and the marketing investments in North America is a great point, which is a clear contributing factor in the strong performance in the quarter \u2013 continued strong performance in North America and the performance is getting better with 5% growth in organic revenues and 4% price\/mix. That price\/mix and that volume and that, therefore, growth in organic revenue would not have been achieved clearly without the infusion of that marketing and the quality and the quantity.","In China, also seeing positive trends, strong marketing activation, as I mentioned in my remarks. Sparkling growing at 7%, Coke growing at double-digits in the quarter, allowing us to gain \u2013 continued to gain significant share in that market. And additionally, we're seeing accelerated trends in our value share gains, where you compare them against our trends a year ago.","So with that said, clear that it will take some time for the full benefit on a quarterly basis as these investments take some time to ramp up, also challenging consumer environment and macro environments, and so, those are really what I would say.","And in terms of our results, you see year-to-date, our marketing investments are growing and our margin is expanding by 50 basis points. So, I think the key is to be able to achieve both, and we are confident that we will continue to see more positive results. So with that, let me turn for some more specifics to Sandy and then to Ahmet for International example.","J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America","Thanks, Muhtar. And good morning, John. The core driver of our business across the world over time is the quality and quantity of our advertising and the related execution and activation by our bottlers.","And in the U.S., over the past 18 months, we've vigorously pursued that strategy, increasing our advertising spend significantly, and you're seeing the payoff in the top line results that Muhtar just went through. But underneath that, a metric that you can watch also is just the price elasticity of our brands and how volume reacts to price over time. And it's a good metric of the payoff of advertising, along with the efforts of our bottlers in the marketplace.","As we look ahead, we see advertising as an important proactive item to grow the business, but as you start to see in North America over the past few quarters, we're now leveraging the P&L, so that the infusion of advertising is coming from the accelerated top line growth and expense efficiency across the total business. So, net-net, it's part of our ongoing algorithm and an important part of the way we intend to drive growth going forward. Ahmet?","Ahmet C. Bozer - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola International","Thanks, Sandy. Hey, John. We have a very similar story in Coke International. The bottlers and our teams have strong conviction about how better and more advertising drives top line. The examples that Muhtar quoted, there's more depth to that. I would add developed markets such as Germany and Spain to that list. I would add a developing market such as Mexico to that list. I would add an emerging market such as Nigeria as a good example. And there are other examples, where we increased media and we improved the quality of that communication, revenue results improve. Having said that, the history of this increase is less than a year for most Coke International markets. I would caution that it is early days; but definitely, we're seeing the positive examples of this action.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Steve Powers of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I guess, first, could you just, maybe I missed it, but could you just address the reduction in net buybacks for the year and what lies behind that? Is free cash flow coming in weaker, because that would seem surprising, just given your working capital comments, et cetera? Or is there a competing use for cash that we should be considering? Just a housekeeping question.","And then a kind of a broader question on productivity, the update and the report card you provided was certainly helpful, but I was wondering if you could maybe quantify what those initiatives translated into in terms of savings in the quarter? And how far along you are, admittedly early, against that ultimate $3 billion goal? I think that would help just frame where you are in the overarching initiative.","And actually, if you could perhaps talk about other initiatives underway and what kinds of achievements we should look for on Q3 or Q4 report cards, that would be great as well? Thanks.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Steve. On the share buybacks; basically, we've given the range of $2 billion to $3 billion, so we're still in that range. We've looked at where we were for the first half of the year and then we looked at cash, particularly because of the currency getting worse in the back half, and just tightened the range. So, basically, we're still in that range, in that corridor, we just tightened the range.","And then on the second question, on productivity, we have basically stated that we are $500 million for \u2013 we are on track. The working capital has allowed us to basically focus on share repurchase, even with the significant currency headwinds, so basically the productivity initiatives we \u2013 that we are on track.","We didn't give specific initiatives that we were working on for this year; you know about the people initiatives that we had, and we said we were going to be on target with the $500 million for this year. They're still coming from the three areas, so we're still actively working on reducing our cost of goods sold and moving DME from more promotional activities into media spend. So we are basically on track. I don't know \u2013 I can't give you any other specifics, other than we are basically on track for the $500 million that we anticipated that we would have for this year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Is it fair to assume that the savings build, and that there's more of an impact in the second half versus the first half? Or is it more kind of ratable throughout the year?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know, I don't know that I can quantify how they come throughout the year. Part of it was dependent upon when we started to see movement with some of the people, and we've not gotten \u2013 for instance, Europe has to focus on the working \u2013 had to work with the Work Council, so their initiatives with people are really just starting \u2013 although everybody is aware, the movement of people is just starting. So part of that will be coming out, now that they've been able to focus on their moving people initiative, but I don't know that I can quantify the how and when it all comes through, because we focus on dealing with the work first. And we deal with the work first and then a lot of the other impact will kind of trail, making sure that we deal with \u2013 that the organization is appropriately set up for success going forward, which included focusing on the global organization and restructuring how we worked with the global organization. So all I can say is, we are on target with everything that we've done.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just adding to what Kathy mentioned, Steve, I'd say that also, in terms of simplifying our organization, wiring our business units closer and more directly to the functional centers in our company, that largely has taken place.","We have essentially eliminated a functional layer in the company, allowing us to make faster and quicker and more effective decision-making in the company. That is already largely in place, and I think lots of continued work streams going on in COGS that will continue to benefit and help us to deliver more than the $500 million in savings for the year.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Mark Swartzberg of SFI (sic) [Stifel] (29:58) Financial. Sir, your line is open.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. It's Stifel Financial. But good morning, everyone. I guess, two questions here; one a region question, Muhtar, and then more a strategy question. With Asia Pac, at least versus my model, the price\/mix was disappointing. It's only a quarter, and you highlighted China and I think some product mix issues; but when you think longer-term about price\/mix in Asia Pac, given the superior growth I think you expect from China, what's a sound way to think about that region in the larger Coke system?","And then, unrelated to that, or less related to that, when you think about scale and bolt-on M&A, can you just update us on your thinking for the larger Coke \u2013 how you're thinking about scale M&A and how you're thinking about bolt-on M&A?","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. First, Mark, good morning. On the Asia Pac, I think it pretty much came in line with what we were expecting, and it's related to timing, it's related to how you look at it on a year-to-date basis. And I'll have Ahmed comment on that once I finish. I'll just say a few things about the second question.","In terms of scale M&A and bolt-on M&A, I think you need to think, we will be again looking at bolt-on targets that fit our strategic portfolio. That's the way you should think about our continued interest in any M&A, and how we target M&A.","Just the same way as you've seen us look at it in the last three, four, five years, how we look at the acquisitions that we made, in terms of Innocent, in terms of Honest Tea, in terms of ZICO, in terms of other bolt-on and then, more recently, the announcement from China that we had.","So essentially, bolt-on acquisitions that complement our current portfolio, and that give us an ability to also scale it up from a geographic scale, goes up from a geographic point of view, just like you saw us launch smartwater in other European markets more recently. That's a good example of how the scale-up continues, and how we've turned smartwater into one of the leading premium waters in the world, both here in the United States and now in some other new markets. Ahmet, comments on Asia-Pacific?","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Can I just ask one quick one there as a follow-up, Muhtar? It sounds like what you're saying there this precludes an interest in scale M&A. The focus, just to be super clear, the focus is on bolt-on to the exclusion of scale \u2013 and we could debate scale, I realize, but it sounds like that's the focus.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I won't say it excludes anything, but I'm saying our focus would be \u2013 I think you should assume that it would continue in that area. If there's something that \u2013 obviously, the future, none of us know what the future holds, we can never be \u2013 we're always guided by the past, the future as something, and there may come some opportunities that we will look at. But, right now, what I will say to you is, base it on what I've said, the past few years being an indication of the future.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Okay. Got it.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Ahmet C. Bozer - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola International","Mark, just to add on to the price\/mix on Asia Pacific, the minus 6% was not a surprise to us. It was expected, and there was a lot of timing between the first and second quarters. If you look at the first half price\/mix for Asia Pacific, we're in negative 2%, which is very much in line with what has been happening in Asia Pacific due to geographic mix and other channel mix issues. So, no surprises there.","Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Great. Okay. Great. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So Muhtar, clearly very strong 4% pricing in North America. Can you run through how much of that was mix versus price, and then comment on the sustainability of higher pricing as you look out through the back half of the year once you cycle the higher pricing from last year? And longer term, how you think about any pricing? Clearly, we've seen a big improvement here over the last year, looks like it's worked well in terms of limited demand elasticity, some more longer term thoughts on pricing in North America?","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks. I'd say look, I think, North America delivered strong second quarter revenue profit, value share performance, driven by better increased marketing, better marketing and a disciplined approach to both volume, price and mix management.","Few things; mix management is working in our favor, consumer is very much approving the smaller packages. Smaller packages are growing much faster than larger packages, smaller packages have a higher NSR per liter, per gallon, per case; and therefore \u2013 then when price driven by \u2013 and the ability to keep the volume where it is and gain the price\/mix, our historic best in terms of the past quarter performance in the United States.","Why is that happening? More marketing, more focus on better marketing as well. So, the rate is coming through, mix from transactions and packs coming through, that is the general comment I'd make. And Sandy, if you want to provide more color to this?","J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America","No, I absolutely agree with that, Dara. And our strategy is, as Irial and I said a year and a half ago, we were putting in place a strategy of building strong valuable brands with accelerated quantity and quality of marketing, and we were going to take proactive opportunities to get our price in line with the value of the brand and to lead price up in a consistent and strategic way, working on the development of packages that consumers want, in particular, premium packages, and the consumer is pulling very clearly to smaller packages, so they can enjoy the ice cold refreshing taste of one of our beverages, but in a portion size that they want.","The net effect, as Muhtar said, is that we have a benefit for mix, but our strategy as we look forward is to continue to lead. We see this strategy of disciplined price pack volume management underneath the brand building of strong powerful brand, as a long-term strategy and we continue to take action across our system every day to reinforce it, to grow our capability and to continue to grow our business in a very balanced and disciplined way.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So, it sounds like the way you approach pricing in North America going forward, you think you'll continue to see progress both from a mix and rate perspective, and obviously while we could see a sequential slowdown as you comp over this period you're pretty committed to the efforts longer-term. Is that fair?","J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America","Absolutely. The strategy is very consistent and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to make the levers work because our brands are strong and we're investing in them and because our bottling system is executing very well and we continue to get better.","I think one of the mantras in our team, Dara, is that we've got the right strategy, but we are just beginning to hit our stride from a capability standpoint and we have much more opportunity to improve than we have progress made so far.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I was going to focus on Diet Coke. While your total sparkling unit case volume growth was clearly impressive, Diet Coke continues to be challenged. And so, Sandy, could you please update us on what you're seeing in terms of North America? And then, Muhtar, if you could comment on any other geographies where you're seeing Diet present a challenge? Thank you.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Vivien. Firstly, I'd say, the challenge is never taken for granted, but the challenge is broadly very much a U.S. centric one, so let me just preface that and then have Sandy comment on what's happening in the United States and also comment \u2013 give you some more comments on other diet drinks like Coke Zero performance and so forth.","J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America","Sure. As we've discussed in several of these calls and in our interactions more one-on-one, the Diet and frozen parts of the food and beverage industry have been struggling for a number of quarters, it's getting into years now, as the consumer, the U.S. consumer moves really strongly to fresh. It's a good dietary change, actually, for the country, but the impact on categories and particularly categories that are appealing to diet-oriented positionings has been pretty negative.","Inside our particular portfolio, we have brands growing and have brands struggling, Coke Zero, as Muhtar mentioned, grew in the quarter. Diet Coke continues to struggle. Our near-term improvements, though, we're starting to see the consumer base stabilize. We have an incredible number of very loyal drinkers in Diet Coke that love Diet Coke, and our milestone that we're seeking to achieve soon is to level our revenue to match price and volume such that Diet Coke's revenue gets to flat and then starts to grow again.","As we look ahead, what I would tell you about Diet Coke is that we believe strongly in the Diet Coke franchise. Diet Coke, the brand is the number one diet beverage in the United States and it will be for a long time to come. We also are looking at changes in the category. Our largest competitor is changing their formula and they'll be launching that in August and that'll create a lot of buzz in the category, some of it good, as the good science of the safety of non-nutritive sweeteners gets out in the marketplace and is reinforced.","We are looking at multiple programs to not only strengthen Diet Coke, but to offer consumers adjacent innovation in the Diet Coke franchise and we're excited about the long-term future. But, as we say around here, it's a work in progress and a lot more work to do, but we still are very optimistic about the long-term.","Vivien Nicole Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Morning. So, just I had a question about geographic mix. I think you came up earlier that geographic mix was negative in the quarter. And is there any way you can outline for us if geographic mix also had a negative effect on profit margins or profitability? I know there's a lot of moving parts in the P&L, but when you kind of look at it currency-neutral, you saw some margin expansion. My thought is, within that margin expansion, you actually had some negative geographic mix on margins. So, any help on that would be helpful.","And then I guess related to that, as we're modeling out the balance of this year and I guess it goes back to Mark Swartzberg's question about the Pacific region, should we continue to model in negative price, geographic price\/mix into our models for Pacific in the back half of the year? Thank you.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Hi, Bryan. Yes, on the margin question, our margins were negatively impacted by currency and by structural. Obviously, there is always some negative geographic mix that plays into that, but if you look at our margins and if you look at Pacific gross margins first of all, and if you look at them on a comparable basis, we lost some margin; but then if you take out currency and then you take out structural, then we were at positive margins again. And the issue more is about gross margin, it's not so much about operating margin. Then on your second question, which was...","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just related to price\/mix, price\/mix in Pacific, should we continue to see negative geographic mix there?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is normal in the Pacific to have negative geographic mix, just because of the base of the country \u2013 Japan, and then all of the emerging markets there. So, yeah, I would say for the remainder of the year, I would anticipate that we would have negative geographic mix in Pacific. Ahmet, do you want to comment on that?","Ahmet C. Bozer - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola International","Yeah. I mean definitely not in the numbers that you've seen in the second quarter, but the general trend of \u2013 around a couple of points of (44:11). However, we do continue to aggressively implement our more balanced top line growth in terms of price and volume across the territory, and we are aiming to improve on that.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you. And if I could just sneak one last one in for Sandy, if we're looking at smaller packs, the effect of smaller pack sizes in North America and just simply looking at it on transactions, I know it's kind of early, but is it incremental? So, if we were just measuring transactions, are the purchases of those smaller packages, are they incremental to the base business? Or is it cannibalistic? Thank you.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Before Sandy comments on that, Bryan, let me just also say that also, in many parts of the Pacific, since your question was somewhat related to the Pacific and in terms of geographic mix, I think sparkling and particularly, Bryan, Coca-Cola, again with things that are happening around advertising and media spend and better quality, is getting stronger. Whether you take Indonesia or whether you take Southeast Asia, whether you take China, sparkling is getting stronger, and momentum on sparkling is getting better.","And therefore, I think you're also seeing a positive shift in category mix for us that is somewhat countered by continued geographic mix. So, I think there's a balance there, and I think we're happy to see that balance coming through.","I just want to mention that, that important this year, we see that balance beginning to come through \u2013 more favorable balance coming through. And then, Sandy, if you want to talk about the smaller packages referenced?","J. Alexander M. Douglas, Jr. - Executive Vice President & President, Coca-Cola North America","Sure. The growth in North America transactions is healthy, and that's coming from a number of things, but the small packages clearly are driving a tremendous amount of positive growth. Some of it is cannibalistic, but the cannibalistic nature of it accrues to higher margin; so the mix shift is positive, and then you have the incremental transaction growth that's being driven there.","And the primary reason is that the consumers want smaller packages. That's why they're buying more Cokes. Our marketing model is about more people enjoying more Cokes more often for a little bit more money, and that's what we seek to accomplish in the marketing and execution of our brands. And what you can see by the mid-teen growth of the smaller packages is, they're driving that transaction growth and transaction performance positive, so the net effect of it is that it's positive in net-net.","The other comment I'd make is that we have data in some of our retail partnerships that shows that moms, in particular, like small packs and are returning to the category to use small packs as a way of giving treats to teenagers and others in the household, and it's a particularly positive thing, because moms can do that with a pack that isn't too big; whereas, for many years in the category, we marketed packages that were too big, that were either wasted or over-consumed. Our package mix no longer does that, and it's one of the reasons why our growth is accelerating.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Nik Modi of RBC Capital. Sir, your line is open.","Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, I just wanted to go back to the bottler reinvestment question, and maybe, Muhtar, you can give us some perspective on where the bottling match and resourcing has been most significant, just so we can get an understanding of kind of where there could be potential leading indicators on that impact on volume growth?","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Nik. Firstly, I would say to you, as I mentioned in my script, in remarks, that we had a very successful global system meeting back in May, and I've seen much more improved engagement and also commitment by our bottling partners across the board: small, large, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Eurasia and Africa, North America. So I'd say to you, it's broad-based; and I'd say to you that there is a great deal of excitement that is around our plans, particularly our reinvestment plan, and also great amount of commitment for better execution and more investment on the side of our bottling partners.","So, as I look at the pipeline of investment, I would say, I am much more encouraged today than I was, say, 12 months to 18 months ago. And I believe that that's driven by our plans and, basically, our belief in the future, and what is happening is yielding early results, and that is driving that engagement.","Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And Muhtar, are we starting to see cooler placements actually hit the market, and more feet on the street? Or is this kind of bottler commitments on that they're going to do it at some point in the next quarter or two?","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. We see it this year, and we will see it at a trend that continues to increase next year and beyond \u2013 certainly over a three-year period \u2013 here in the United States, in Latin America, in Europe, in Asia Pacific, in Eurasia and Africa.","Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Last question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is open. You may proceed with your question.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. A couple of things I wanted to talk about, if possible. One is around top line and one is around asset base. First on the top line, I think you guys have done a pretty good job explaining and playing out the pieces in terms of price\/mix, which is great.","On the volume side, how would you describe the company trajectory right now, from a volume growth perspective? So, do you think we've seen the bottom, in terms of volume growth, after a series of kind of plus 1% and now at 2% and some easier comps going forward? So do you think we should be projecting kind of a turning point upward, in terms of volume growth for the company going forward? And I'll come back with the asset question in a second.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Ali, the algebra is volume times, price is what we generate as revenue and I think it's good that you ask that question and it's one of the important elements of the algebra.","I think we're encouraged by actions where we basically expected to be. We're cycling 3% and we generated 2% and I think the volatility, as I mentioned in Russia on the verge of a recession today, from a macro point of view or Brazil where there's still significant challenges in disposable incomes; China disposable income levels haven't improved significantly. But importantly, improving trends on share were an all-time high in many markets, value share particularly which is very important and value share is driven again by the actions that we're taking.","So, based on your question have you seen the bottom? I'd say, we're about where we expected to be, and we see that what we're doing is continuing to help keep that equation in place at an improving trend; equation being if the marketing wasn't there, the volume wouldn't hold up where it was and the price wouldn't hold up where it was. See it in that respect \u2013 both being propped up by the investments that we're putting into the marketplace and those investments being driven by the zero-based work that we're generating.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful answer. On the asset side of things, if you look at Germany and India and Vietnam, (53:12) those continue to do quite well. Seem like they're improving.","In North America from discussions we've had \u2013 this call, other calls \u2013 it looks like that's getting better too. You know productivity and profits are actually growing finally. Do you think there are ways \u2013 what are the hurdles given all those improvements for you not to be able to divest or re-franchise those assets more quickly and have a smaller asset base, which is a long-term plan even more quickly than you've laid out so far?","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think you said it, those are continuing to improve. As they improve, they become \u2013 there's more that are getting in line for those assets and that's a good place to be. And I think basically we see those are great markets, not just in our hands but in the right hands. And that's the way we see it. And I think that we are encouraged by the internal plans we have, and I think that's all I can say right now. We're in a place where, let's call it this way, the fruit is getting riper.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. I just hope it's not overripe at some point. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","This fruit will never get overripe. It will be good on the tree and off the tree.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.","Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim.

If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue after that.","Now, let me turn the call over to James.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, Tim. Good morning, everyone. We were encouraged with our performance this quarter, and we can report that we are on track to deliver our full year plan. Today, I'd like to talk to you about the performance in the quarter and then drill down a little bit into the actions that we're taking to expand our portfolio and drive top line growth and, finally, update you a little bit on the refranchising process.","In the quarter, we gained global value share and grew organic revenue 4%. This was driven by North America, Europe, Mexico and China. We also benefited from improvements in certain large emerging markets like India. Our strategic focus on small baskets and packs continued in the quarter, resulting in strong 3% price\/mix and transactions outpacing volume by two points. Finally, our ongoing productivity initiatives helped drive strong underlying operating margin expansion in both the quarter and year to date.","Turning to our operations around the world. We are pleased with our continued good performance in North America, and we have full confidence in our sustainable growth strategy. As we announced on Monday, Sandy Douglas will retire as President of Coca-Cola North America after a remarkable three-decade career with the company. He'll be succeeded by Jim Dinkins, who currently serves as Head of the Minute Maid business unit and Chief Retail Sales Officer for Coca-Cola North America.","Sandy's done an outstanding job leading our flagship market through a period of enormous system change and has set it up for success in the coming years. We thank him for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement. Jim, who is a highly experienced and respected leader within the Coca-Cola system, will assume the leadership of our North American segment as of January 1, 2018. We look forward to introducing him to many of you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 16.","Turning to Mexico, our volume did decline a point in the quarter, negatively impacted by some cooler weather and natural disasters, and higher rainfall as well as slightly softer consumer environment. And in our Europe, Middle East and Africa group, solid marketing and innovation, coupled with improved execution, continued to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.","In our emerging markets, China saw another quarter of improving performance, with volume up 2% due to strong marketing campaigns across sparkling soft drinks, juice and premium water. At the same time, the business has made a strategic decision to de-emphasize low-margin water, which follows the strategy we are executing with success elsewhere. Whilst this resulted in a 3-point impact to China's volume growth in the quarter, it did not impact our profitability.","Also, during the quarter, India returned to growth, with volume up 6%, driven by solid performance across the portfolio. Our business successfully moved past the recent difficulties related to demonetization and the implementation of a Goods and Service Tax during the first half of the year.","With that said, we are still facing difficult conditions in certain markets, notably in Latin America. Venezuela and Brazil were a 1-point drag on our overall global volume. However, there are some indications of light at the end of the tunnel in Brazil where we've seen the first signs of recovery in GDP for the country. However, consumption of consumer goods appears to be lagging behind durable goods and services, so it may take further time for recovery to translate into faster FMCG growth.","So, we're continuing to build out our returnable packaging infrastructure and adjust our price\/pack architecture, which has resulted in sequential improvement in volume trends as we have progressed through the year. Since launching our affordability plan, we've seen good results from entry packs, which grew double-digits in the quarter.","Now while we see various opportunities and challenges in each of our markets, one thing is consistent across all of our businesses: the consumer landscape is changing. We see an increasing number of small and fast competitors; consumers' desires are evolving, whether they're seeking low or no sugar options, drinks with functional benefits or simply more variety.","In order to thrive in this kind of environment, we need to be more entrepreneurial and agile, to take intelligent risks, and build a broader consumer-centric portfolio. As we accelerate our way forward to becoming a total beverage company, new categories and premium segments will play key roles in our growth. We are growing our portfolio in multiple ways whilst leveraging the strength of our core brands as its foundation.","First, we're identifying and incubating high-growth brands. For example, in the U.S., we acquired the rights to Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water from Mexico that has earned a strong following in Texas and beyond. Our Venturing & Emerging Brands unit will serve as an incubator for Topo Chico and will guide the development of the brand's distribution footprint. Within VEB, this approach has been highly successful for other investments, like Honest Tea, maintaining the essence of the brand and the entrepreneurial culture of the company while supporting its rapid growth phase within the power of the Coca-Cola system.","Second, we're building stronger capability to nurture and expand small brands internationally. We've learned a lot from the VEB model in the U.S., and we're leveraging those lessons to develop similar structures and processes in other markets. For example, in Central and Eastern Europe, we recently launched a unit in partnership with our bottling partner, Coca-Cola Hellenic.","We will seek emerging brands and potential partnerships, but we will start by testing premium brands in high-value outlets and channels through a separate and dedicated sales force. Many of these, like smartwater, ZICO, Appletiser, will be lifted and shifted from other places. Products will follow the incubate grow and scale path, with a goal to expand fast and discontinue quickly if necessary.","Third, we're looking at opportunities in growing premium segments such as adult craft beverages. As you know, more consumers, most notably adults, are seeking unique and distinct products with sophisticated flavors, quality ingredients, and smaller-scale craft production.","Mixers are seeing a resurgence in many parts of the world as part of this trend. So earlier this year, in Spain, we introduced a line of premium mixers in glass bottles called Royal Bliss for sale only in the on-premise channel. In Great Britain, we just relaunched the storied Schweppes brand to offer mixers designed to pair even better with premium spirits, including a new range of premium mixers called Schweppes 1783.","We're also building on a solid foundation in sophisticated flavors through brands like Blue Sky, Barrilitos Aguas Frescas in the U.S., and Appletiser and BOBO (09:27) in Europe. And we plan to leverage these in the appropriate channels where these premium products can excel.","Now while innovating and growing small brands in new categories is critical, it is only part of the equation. That's why we're continuing to invest in our core billion-dollar brands to drive relevance. We increased our media investments behind our sparkling brands before moving aggressively into non-sparkling categories, and we will continue to innovate within these core brands as well, for in the end, a healthy core will fuel our expansion as a total beverage company.","So for example, we launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in the United Kingdom last year. And with the combination of a great-tasting reformulated product, better marketing, new packaging, and improved execution, this product has been in the market for more than a year, and we continue to see double-digit growth in the UK.","And we started to roll out Coke Zero Sugar to other markets around the world, including the U.S., which leveraged the UK marketing and execution playbook to launch in the third quarter. We've seen positive results, including a meaningful acceleration in Coke Zero's trends in the U.S. since launch, and year-to-date global volume and revenue for the brand is growing double digits.","We're applying the same concept to refresh our important Fanta brand. We relaunched Fanta globally this year, reaching most of our major markets by the end of the second quarter. We did this with a four-pillar playbook. That was a new look and a new integrated marketing campaign, a new recipe that tastes great and reduces added sugar, a new spiral bottle that differentiates Fanta on the shelf, and improved execution and more media investment. Thanks to this work, we've seen a return to volume growth and an acceleration in revenue growth for Fanta.","Now obviously, not everything is going to work. That is why an agile testing and learning approach is essential. For example, in Costa Rica, we launched Fanta sweetened only with juice and with no added sugar. And we learned that consumers saw the new formula really as an incremental brand rather than an improvement to the existing brand. So we had to bring back the original formula and are retooling the market for this new approach.","The lesson is ultimately a single approach across all markets will not work. We need to tailor our approach based on consumer mindset and tastes in each market. Further, our model needs to be flexible, so if a brand introduction isn't successful, we can adapt and change strategies quickly. And we have empowered our local leaders to make these key brand decisions.","Lastly, moving on to our system, as we approach the end of 2017, we're nearing the completion of the refranchising process. In the U.S., our refranchising will be complete when the Tri-State Operating Unit and the West Operating Unit transactions close, which we expect to be in the coming weeks. This will leave Canada to be refranchised, and our expectation is to transition to a partner in 2018. Also in early October, we closed on a transaction that makes our company the majority owner of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. As we've previously disclosed, we're in discussions to refranchise this territory, and also expect this to happen in 2018.","Before I hand the call over to Kathy, I'll end by saying this was a solid quarter and that we're committed to delivering against our full-year targets. We will continue to execute our plan with innovation and marketing by focusing on the consumer and building a culture that embraces change, focuses on growth, and is entrepreneurial in spirit.","Thank you and, Kathy, I'll hand over to you for the key financial results.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by highlighting a few key items we've reported today before moving on to talk about guidance.","We delivered solid financial results in line with our expectations, with strong organic revenue growth and operating expense leverage driving double-digit growth in underlying profit before tax.","As James mentioned, we continue to refranchise our company-owned bottling operations, which resulted in a 15% decline in comparable net revenues. However, adjusting for those divestitures, we grew organic revenue 4% in the quarter, with positive performance across all operating segments.","Comparable gross margin increased over 150 basis points, reflecting the benefit from refranchising our bottling businesses and strong price\/mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs and a slight currency impact. Comparable operating margin grew over 400 basis points, driven by the divestitures and continued productivity, including the ongoing removal of stranded costs in Coca-Cola Refreshments.","Moving to cash flow, we generated $4.7 billion in free cash flow year to date and have returned that excess cash to our shareowners. Year to date, we've returned $3.2 billion in the form of dividends, reflecting a 6% increase in our dividend this year and $1.7 billion in net share repurchases.","Now turning to outlook, we continue to expect comparable EPS to be flat to down 2% this year as we complete the bottler refranchising process and return to a higher-margin, capital-light business model. We continue to expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% growth in underlying profit before tax.","We now expect currency to be a 1-point headwind on profit before tax for the full year. The improvement in the currency outlook is offset by an increase in the full-year structural outlook. The higher structural headwind is due to the transition of our interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which we will account for as a discontinued operation, as we intend to divest the operations in 2018. As such, we will no longer derive equity income from our previous minority stake in CCBA.","In addition, the largest driver of the structural impact in Q4 is from the one-time impact from eliminating intercompany profit from our concentrate sales. In addition, because CCBA will be accounted for as a discontinued operation, we will exclude CCBA's net income from our comparable earnings.","So in summarizing the above, for the full year, we expect a $0.02 lower currency headwind to offset a $0.02 higher structural headwind, so our full-year comparable guidance remains the same. In terms of phasing, the improved currency outlook with a $0.01 benefit to the third quarter, and we expect it to benefit the fourth quarter by roughly a $0.01. However, we expect the $0.02 increase structural headwind to impact the fourth quarter.","As you model the fourth quarter, there are few other items to consider. First, our calendar fourth quarter will benefit from one extra day versus the prior-year period, which equates to roughly one additional point of topline growth for the quarter. Second, the hurricanes that occurred in North America during the third quarter caused disruption to our supply chain, leading to an estimated $50 million increase in costs, the majority of which will impact the fourth quarter.","Third, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 27-point headwind on net revenue and an 11- to 12-point headwind on profit before tax. And finally, we expect currency to shift to a zero- to 1-point tailwind on net revenue and a 4 to 5-point tailwind on profit before tax as we cycle significant volatility in the U.S. dollar from the fourth quarter of last year.","Now, looking beyond the fourth quarter, we will provide more comprehensive 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter call in February. However, we are reaffirming the outlook on certain items provided at the beginning of this year. We continue to expect structural items to be a 1- to 2-point headwind on profit before tax. Remember, we have a rolling hedging program on hard currencies, so the currency benefit we expect in the fourth quarter should not be taken out of context and extrapolated into a similar benefit for 2018. As such, we still expect currency in 2018 to be a low single-digit headwind on profit before tax. And finally, we continue to expect that our effective tax rate will increase to 26% in 2018.","As you recall, we are holding an Investor Day on November 16. During that time, we'll focus on our longer-term opportunities and how we'll get there. We look forward to sharing much more with you then. So, please plan to join us via our webcast.","And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Speakers, our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My question was really around North American pricing long term. Obviously there's been a lot of concern in general over the pricing environment in the U.S., not just in beverages but across the CPG industry with brick and mortar retailer struggles and theoretically pushback as they look for lower pricing and differentiate themselves or just a margin grab versus CPG suppliers. So, I was hoping in that context, you could give us a review on if Coke's increased focus on pricing in the U.S. over the last few years, is that pressured at all longer term by these retailer dynamics? How do you manage through that? What are you hearing from your customers? And also, just given the new leadership in North America as well as the bottler refranchise, I mean, how does that play into that pricing focus longer term? And how do those changes impact that? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, sure, Dara. Look, a few thoughts. Firstly, I think the most important thing we focus on as a starting point is making sure we are bringing the innovation, the marketing and the execution to bear for each customer such as the beverage category grows faster than their overall business. And that is the basis on which you get better in-store placements, execution, and the pricing conversation becomes more manageable because in the end, you're creating disproportionate value for the customer. So, that's the first objective.","The second point I would make is we have different \u2013 to some people, we are a very multi-channel business. Yes, we have large presence in the grocery channel, but we have multiple other environments where we sell our beverages. And therefore, part of it is being in lots of different places that helps manage the pack\/price architecture dynamics and creates value for all our customers in the different channels.","And I would, perhaps, leave a last third thought on the marketplace, which is, yeah, some of the extra pressure from private labels or the stratification of retailers on strategy and pricing is somewhat of an emerging dynamic in U.S., but it has been present in other parts of the world and we have found ways to work with each of our customers to make it work for them and for us. So, we are believers in our ability to create value for ourselves by creating value with the customers even in this ongoing changing environment.","And I'll leave you with the last thought, which is, there's no one better positioned to understand this in the context of North America than Jim Dinkins because he's ran the national sales company for the U.S. system for a large number of years. He's worked as \u2013 leading accounts in lots of other channels, too. So he understands this dynamic very clearly, and he has been at the forefront of leading a team to build value with our customers in collaboration with our bottling system.","Operator","The next question comes from Carlos Laboy from HSBC. Your line is now open.","Carlos Laboy - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","Hey everyone.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Carlos Laboy - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","James, what might be some of the green shoots of performance list that you're seeing in the North American territories that were first refranchised?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Well, I think, the first and most important green shoot is to look at the performance once you get past the 12-month mark, by which I mean that it's as much like having any new thing, management attention and focus gets heavily directed to new things. And so, of course, you would expect better performance initially on refranchising, and we have got that in the vast majority of territories. But I think the most interesting thing is that after 12 months, when it's cycling and people have got the real hard work of building for the long term, we're still seeing the vast majority of the refranchised territories performing ahead of where they were before.","So they've been able to build on the great re-foundation work that CCR in conjunction with the North American team did. And the sorts of places we're seeing that performance coming from is not just doing better with existing customers which is true, but also in finding new customer outlets expanding the universe of the customer outlets and performing better in the small formats which in a way is partly the theory of the case of why refranchise to local partners.","Operator","The next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC. Your line is now open.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","James, a quick question on Coke Zero Sugar. When you think about the launch in the markets that you have and also the early data points from the U.S., how much interaction is there with Coke Classic and if you could just give us some context on kind of overlapping cannibalization rates?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to get into the mathematical specificity, but I think look the headline is that as Coke Zero Sugar is coming to marketplaces. And particularly interesting, those ones where it's been there for more than 12 months, a bit like my comment on refranchising, we're seeing continued acceleration of Coke Zero Sugar. It's lifting the whole franchise.","Yes, it is cannibalizing at times either Coke Light or sometimes Coke Original. But in the net, there is additional volume and additional consumers coming back into the franchise. I think it's unrealistic to expect cannibalization to be zero. But obviously the key is that to be a net positive. So, we are pleased with how it's playing out. It's slightly different in different countries depending on the mix of the Coke franchise in those countries, but it's a net positive and we are encouraged.","Operator","The next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to get an update on the progress from a productivity perspective. So the $3.8 billion that you mentioned last time, where are we on reinvestment phase versus dropping to the bottom line phase? And essentially, coming to brass tacks, how much in billions of dollars should we expect to drop to the bottom line?","And if you want to be generous and answer a second question, lower priority question, can you talk about the Topo Chico brand positioning versus LaCroix for example in the marketplace? Thanks. Please choose the first one if you're going to choose one.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Okay, so I will take the first one and James can decide if he plans to be generous or not. So first of all, we separate those two programs, Ali, from the $3 billion program, the original program that we announced earlier and then the $800 million program that we added on. On the $3 billion program, I would say we are on target. The productivity is clearly coming from three different places, cost of goods, DME, and OpEx. And we're on target to do around $400 million this year. And we had always said about half of that would be reinvested to drive growth.","Of the $800 million program, that is associated with our Lean Enterprise activities. Those activities really just got started last quarter, so this year. So they really \u2013 and we've said that you'll see the benefits of those in 2018 and 2019, and they'll be split between those two years. And again, about half of that will go to reinvestment and half will hit the bottom line. So we are on target with both programs, and the Lean Enterprise program has started off well so far. And we will plan to update you as we continue to go along.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","And if we have time, we'll come back to Topo Chico, Ali, so that we can respect everyone's one question at a time.","Operator","The next question comes from Laurent Grandet from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, James. Good morning, Kathy.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","My question is about e-commerce. Your commentary in the last earnings laid down the size of the opportunity of e-commerce and the way they were investing ahead of the curve in people and big data, saying that they had a larger market share in e-commerce than elsewhere. Could you please tell us how you are doing after that channel, your objectives, and how you plan to get there?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Firstly, we over-index in terms of share, generally speaking, online. I think the second thing I would say is e-commerce is not one thing. It's a spectrum. And in part, what I mean by that is there are pure-play e-commerce players. There are bricks-and-mortars who have e-commerce. And you can say that the omnichannel, there are aggregators. Remember, we're not just grocery. We work with a lot of restaurants, and there are all sorts of restaurant aggregator platforms, and restaurants or some QSR chains have their own platforms as well. So there's a wide spectrum of different versions of how consumers are interacting with customers that is digitally enabled.","As I said, we very generally over-index. Our objective is to work with each customer, helping them drive value for the beverage category with their consumers. And generally speaking, we do better when that happens. And so you can see progress in the traditional grocery idea of e-commerce, whether omnichannel or pure-play. You can see progress on restaurant or quick service platforms. So there's a lot of growth, a lot of activity.","But in the simplest sense, it comes back to the central idea. If we can work with them to help the beverage business grow faster than their overall business and be a key participant, it creates a lot of value for them. And therefore, we have a lot of engagement with many of these companies on how can we help create value for them within the context of their strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Hi. I have a question about Latin America. And, James, if you could just maybe give us a little bit of an update on it's been a drag to organic sales growth and unit case volume, or I guess you'd say it's been a drag on unit case volume. A lot of that is Brazil, Venezuela, I guess the Central America business unit as well. Can you give us a description of, A), how far away are we from maybe the environment bottoming? Second, maybe just some of the actions that Coke has taken to adjust to the environment? I'm just trying to get a sense for how far away we are from being at maybe a clean base where you can start to grow again.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","I think let me take them in pieces. Each one is a slightly different story, although the headline is, I'm hoping to see the light at the end of the tunnel by the end of the year.","What does that mean? In Brazil, we've talked about the actions we've been taking around price\/package architecture, around returnables, investing in new infrastructure, not over-promoting to try and protect the volume but to try and reestablish our price\/pack architecture that's going to work for the medium term.","Brazil as a country is struggling or has struggled. There are some signs, as I commented on the script, of light at the end of the tunnel. FMCG is lagging durables a bit in that. Am I completely happy in Brazil? No, I wouldn't say so. I think there's more that we can do that's within our control. But I am still somewhat hopeful that that will all play out by the end of the year and things will start bottoming out in the fourth quarter. It has been sequentially improving as we've gone through the year. I think with more focus and more effort, we can see this play through, and so it will bottom out by the end of the year. We'll see, but I think the signs are encouraging.","Venezuela is really a very tough human situation. It's almost a tragedy. And I think that the simple reality is the fourth quarter of significant declines in Venezuela will be the fourth quarter this year, at which point it will have shrunk to a size that it won't be able to impact our overall numbers to the same extent in 2018. I would love to think it's going to get better. I'm not hopeful in the short term. But I would say it's going to stop impacting our numbers heavily once we get into 2018, and then Colombia similarly to Brazil.","So I think the sum of all that is what I said at the beginning, we've been through a very tough year. We've been taking action. We are happy with some of the things we've done. We've got more work to do in places. But the floor should be set by the end of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","James, can you give us your perspective around your performance in some of the non-sparkling category clusters? You look at the quarter I think the growth actually softened across all of your segments there. Why do you think we aren't really seeing stronger growth, setting aside what you're doing in China? And then I think you talked about maybe increasing investment behind some of your bigger brands. So maybe you can elaborate on your strategy and the investment, whether that will be funded by shifting investments from sparkling to these brands or the total portfolio really looking to further increase investments.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","I think there are a few questions in there, Judy. Look, I think, as we disaggregate the categories, obviously, the categories intersect with the geographies. And so the story is not neither claimed by geography, nor by category. But let me try and add a little texture to what we see going on. I think sparkling beverage growth got a little bit better volumetrically in the quarter. And I think that that shows a slightly improving trend.","So I think firstly, the sparkling has got volumetrically better. It's back to slightly across the zero line, whereas it was negative at the beginning of the year, and that's coming with better revenue growth. So our focus on Coke Zero Sugar, the re-launch of Fanta, Sprite in some places, smaller packages, working with customers is getting a better volume trend sequentially and good pricing. So, I think there's good progress there.","In terms of juices, what we're really seeing there is doing a lot better on the top end, things like chilled juices, plant-based drinks, fairlife, the premium dairy going strongly, would love to have more capacity to grow even faster. You're seeing some growth in the juice drinks end of spectrum, where there's some volume has come out, it's more in the nectars. I think that's part of people converting up and converting down. So, I think there's continued trend there.","In terms of teas, good growth there, volume growth, price growth. We're pleased with our performance in teas. We're going to continue to invest in tea. Coffee, lots of up in coffee. In the U.S., we've launched our own brands. We've launched some brands in partnerships with some other players. All of those have gone successfully well. We've got new innovations coming. We had a bit of a bump in coffee in Japan in the quarter. Not so pleased about that, but we have the plans in place to do better.","The one where we have done less well and it was a choiceful decision is on water. In some parts of the world where we have been too heavily into very low-margin, large bulk water, we have pulled back deliberately in the quarter and that has affected some of our water growth rate numbers.","Operator","The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just want to ask a bit about, in North America, sticking with the conversation around price\/mix, so it just jumped out to me that sparkling price\/mix is up 3% but total for North America was 2%. So what was the drag there? Was it price? Was it mix? Was it category performance? And then, in particular, if the answer, since I get one question, was it something in water in particular with smartwater? Are there plans in place for re-accelerating that business? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","So, yeah. I mean, we're going to re-accelerate smartwater. Look, I think the key in terms of North America is to see a bit of a trend on the price\/mix. You'll remember from last quarter, for example, that we talked about a point of the revenue growth was extra inventory in our fountain business ahead of the summer. Obviously, that's been boxed out in the third quarter.","So said in simple terms, I think the easiest way to understand North America and look through inventory and look through natural disasters is as I look to summer as a period, let's add the second quarter and the third quarter together and look at what we got. And there, I think, you can see revenue is 3% to 4%, price\/mix is on average 3% which is in line with the year-to-date trend and is in line with what we did in previous years more or less.","So I think when you just look past some of the blips what you see is an ongoing successful track record of driving the North American strategy, reinvigorating the portfolio, a focus on revenue, a focus on smaller packages, a focus ultimately that drives price\/mix ahead of volume, with transactions ahead of volume. And I think that's what you saw once you ignore the blips in the third quarter. And so, we're committed to our strategy, and we continue to drive it.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Grundy from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","So James, just sticking with the topic of North America. But my question relates to your expectations with respect to competitive activity. And, I guess, I ask you in the context that your key competitor had probably one of the most difficult quarters they've had in a long time in North America beverages and they have discussed ramping investment in key categories to address some of these market share losses, which will include carbonated soft drinks and sports drinks. So, you've talked a lot about your strategy, which has been helpful. Can you talk about your expectations with respect to competitive environment in the near to intermediate term and your ability to flex up spending to respond, if necessary, within your guidance? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Look, I think the North American market is certainly one of the most competitive markets around the world. It's not just one large competitor we face. There are multiple competitors large, medium and small. There's a lot of activity, a lot of innovation, a lot of jockeying. In the end, we will continue to focus on our strategy.","We have a clear strategy about driving the portfolio inspired by the consumer, working with customers to create value for the beverage category, our underlying category because that includes all people, brands and products. We work with the customers to create value for the beverage category, which will drive, ultimately, growth.","And I think that has shown that we have been able to gain share over the long-term, on a steady basis, as we have deployed this strategy, supported, of course, by the increased and improved bottler execution investment through the refranchising. It's a long-term game plan. I've commented on previous quarterly calls.","Will there occasionally be quarters where customers take certain decisions that cause disruptions to that or competitors do? Of course, that may happen, and we will respond. But we believe in our strategy. We think it's the right long-term play and we will always look to get back to it even if we respond to short-term actions.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. James, if you can expand on the comment about better execution of the refranchised bottlers in North America. So how was the performance gap of the refranchised territories against BIG in terms of volumes and pricing? And as it relates to better execution at the trade or would you say the flat fizzy volumes against negative before has been mostly driven by innovation by Coke Zero Sugar, smaller packs? So basically, I wanted to ask you if the 2% is coming \u2013 performance that you had is coming from better execution or just better mix?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","I think the top part of the answer is if all the pieces worked together. It's about having the right portfolio for the consumers, the right marketing, the right innovation and the right execution. There's no question that when you bring all those things together, that's when you get the best possible result. In terms of what better execution from the refranchised bottlers, I think that they have been able to build on the foundation that was created by the CCR team. That was we pushed more devolution of accountability, of empowerment, down into the organization of this national bottling company. We were refounded some of the manufacturing supply chain and execution of processes. I think the local bottlers have been able to take that, bringing their passion, their entrepreneurialism, their local knowledge and turned that into an even better result.","As I mentioned earlier, that's typified by things like more outlets, typified by things like working better with the smaller format, yet also, at the same time, being able to increase the degree of execution and service to some of the larger customers. So it's been an ability to work across the board. There wasn't a silver bullet. It was in fact getting a little bit better across the spectrum, from the largest customers to the smallest customers, in support of our portfolio marketing and innovation plan.","Operator","The next question comes from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","A question on reinvestment. And when the company started the program of savings and reinvestment, emerging markets were turning negative or in some cases were already negative, and probably didn't get as much investment as they otherwise would have. As we're seeing some signs of emerging markets improving, is it safe to assume that we'll see investments accelerate there?","And then can you just expand on what you've learned from the activity you've undertaken in developed markets, and then finally, where those funds, if my assumption that increased investment is coming will come from? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","So yes, it's safe to assume that we're going to invest where we see the opportunity for growth. And therefore, as the emerging markets begin to bounce back, I'm not sure they're all going to bounce back to the same degree as they were pre-crisis. But we absolutely will be investing to drive our market position.","Now I would just underline that other than some situations very specifically, we don't tend to try and pull back very aggressively when markets turn down. We generally speaking adopt the strategy when there's a downturn, particularly in some of the emerging markets, it's better to invest through it to gain competitive position so that you are positioned even better for the upturn. So it's not the case that we pulled the cord on loss of markets.","Having said that, as I said at the beginning, we will up the investment as we start to see the acceleration, and you can see that we've talked about things we started to do in India, things we started to do in China. As we see the momentum starting to come back, we're investing behind those.","Will it be across the portfolio? Yes. It won't be shotgun. It needs to be focused on helping us achieve category leadership positions or near-leadership positions or driving new interesting consumer innovation in conjunction with the execution of our bottling partners. We're not trying to do more mediocre stuff. We're trying to generate good strong consumer brands, whether they be large or they be niche, but that they be profitable and they be successful.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, good morning, James and Kathy. My one question, James, is refranchising-related and how much runway you think you face for sustained improvement in price\/mix in Western Europe, where you're a little more into the exercise of refranchising, and also China and Africa where refranchising has begun or will soon begin, simply the price\/mix opportunity in front of you in those markets?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","I think in Western Europe, we've had a very good start to the creation of CCEP [Coca-Cola European Partners]. Yes, it was a little bouncy in the third quarter with some localized poor weather that offset the better weather that was in Q2. If you look past those blips, I think you see momentum in Western Europe coming back in and good growth.","I've talked previously about expectations on price\/mix, where in Western Europe I think we can have, in comparison perhaps to the U.S., a little more volume growth and therefore a little more balance between volume and price in Europe. As we go forward, the U.S. is more assertively looking for a package price architecture mix led part of the equation. So I think that the sustained idea for Western Europe is a balance.","In terms of China and Africa, there's a slightly different situation in Africa. Clearly, there's more opportunity for expansion of the portfolio volumetrically, although of course there will be a price\/mix element. And China is again a place where we're looking to rebuild the volume momentum with a moderate degree of price\/mix.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust.

Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bill.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","James, can you just talk a little bit more about Mexico? I think you alluded both to the weather, and then you did a little bit of a slowdown in the category. Any way to quantify what the hurricanes or anything had impact on the quarter, and then if there's any lingering impact, and then just touching on the slowdown you said for the quarter?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Clearly, the natural disasters in the whole Caribbean basin, whether we're talking Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, or Mexico with the earthquakes, all occurred in the same quarter, so there's clearly an impact.","I'm not going to attach a number to it because I'm not really a big fan of putting it all into the one-off temporary basket, but clearly there was an impact. The weather was a bit more miserable in the third quarter, and there was a bit of softening of consumer sentiment through the third quarter in Mexico. I don't think these are new enduring trends, certainly not the natural disasters hopefully not, nor is the consumer one. I think that will slowly reverse over the balance of the year. We'll see. So I don't think there's a big issue in Mexico.","Of course, it's one of those places too where we're looking to work on our price and package architecture and the full portfolio that we've developed as a system over the last few decades there to really be able to continue to drive revenue and I think it was a strong revenue quarter for the system in Mexico and I think that will continue.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Sharma from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","James, talking about the leadership change in CCR can you talk about what would Jim Dinkins key priorities would be? And then as this leadership transition happens here, do you see that as an opportunity to maybe reorient the organization to develop new muscles as you transition the portfolio?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Look, I think the leadership change in North America, I mean, leaders don't last forever and this is another one of those changes. There's a new chapter about to begin in North America.","We've had a great run over a few years. We've successfully carried out a humongous refranchising task and I think Sandy made a decision this time for a new leader. And I think Jim is the right person. He's got full portfolio experience, he got marketing experience, he knows the customers across the whole spectrum and he has the right capabilities as a leader to take us to the next stage of growth.","What does that need to be? Clearly, it needs to be about continuing to execute the strategy we got in place. But like all strategies, they need to evolve in the same way that company's global strategy evolves for the circumstances we face so will the North America one. It's not just the fact that the leader changes that you need to continue to evolve and build new capabilities. We knew that before. We had some things under development. Of course, we'll learn new things and we'll identify new ideas.","So I think it's about the continued journey of the North American business. It's a great team. It's a great system. They've got their mojo back. They know they need to do more things to execute and complete the mission in the short-term and to evolve and build new capabilities for the long-term.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much. James, in the beginning, you talked about increasing desire of consumers for variety that helped driving innovation and many new brands, new competitors. I think that's mostly a comment about the U.S., but I'm wondering if you could take that comment and those trends and talk about how that is playing out in the rest of the world and whether that is something that if you've seen it sort of first in the U.S., you can kind of get ahead of it and take advantage of, perhaps learnings in the U.S. to perhaps capture more of those opportunities in other countries. Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. Look, I think it's not just the U.S. trend. You can look at Japan where, arguably, beverage diversity is even greater than the U.S. But I think the central point is the following. If you look back over time and you look at what is the behavior of teens and young adults of each generation as it comes through, there's one key fact. Each generation consumes and, importantly, buys more commercial beverages than the previous one.","The second important fact is they do so across a greater variety of drinks. It's not that they buy more commercial beverages and drink ever-increasing amounts of the same thing. They go for diversity. Therefore, you can see around the world that those places which have the highest amounts of disposable income, each generation is coming along and looking for that diversity. That's true in the U.S. It's true in Japan. It's true in other developed markets and other wealthy parts of even emerging markets.","And so the learnings that are available are actually not just one directional, they are actually from many different places across the world. We've got to find ways to take the learnings from the U.S., from other parts, Japan, from Europe, from Australia and finding the best of the best and allowing ourselves to fuel the diversity of the portfolio, yet understanding that, in the end, what grows are the global brands.","I mean, the world, over the last number of years has been typified, at least in beverages, by outsized growth by global brands and the entry of lots of new smaller brands. The bit in the middle was tougher. So you have to keep fueling the machine by having innovation and testing the frontier of variety, yet, over time graduating those to large-scale consumer franchises, not necessarily single flavor franchises but consumer franchises.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Holland from Soc G\u00e9n.

So just related to CCBA, you're saying that you're now expecting completion in 2018. I'm pretty sure that this time last year, you were expecting it in the second half of 2017. I'm just wondering what on earth is taking so long, mindful that, for example, (56:00) dropped out of that process, I think, as long ago as March. Are we left concluding that the business that is up for sale is not in a state where anybody wants to buy it?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","No, that's the wrong conclusion, Andrew. The simple answer is that the regulatory process in South Africa is not time-regulated and the fact is we got regulatory clearance in the last month or so, and that then led us to closing. And now we will proceed to work with our prospective partners that are interested and have substantive interest. And when we say 2018 that's because it includes regulatory and closing approval.

If you have multiple questions, please ask your most pressing one first and then re-enter to the queue in order to ask any follow-ups.","Now let me turn the call over to James.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As we pass the midpoint of the year, I'm pleased to say that we are where we expected to be and remain on track to deliver our full year guidance. Importantly, we continue to accelerate the transformation of our business into a total beverage company by driving against the strategic priorities we laid out at CAGNY: mainly, expanding our portfolio with new products, marketing platforms and a consistent strategy to offer our customers the best consumer-centric beverage portfolio; second, driving revenue growth through enhanced revenue growth management strategies and a strengthened system; third, digitizing our enterprise; and fourth and very importantly, unlocking the power of our people as we instill a growth culture and establish a new, leaner operating model.","With this as the backdrop, I'd like to talk about our performance in the quarter and then drill down into actions that we are taking to drive top line growth and finally update you on refranchising and our new operating model. So firstly, starting with the quarter, ultimately amidst a weak consumer retail environment in emerging markets, particularly Latin America, and some softness in North America, our actions are enabling us to win in the market. Globally, we gained value share in total non-alcoholic beverages and in most of our category clusters.","As expected, organic revenue grew 3% in the quarter. Not only did we see a strong performance in rapidly expanding areas of our business, such as Innocent in Europe, but our revenue growth was also largely driven by innovation in sparkling soft drinks where we have continued to roll out Coca-Cola Zero Sugar around the world. Price mix continues to benefit from a focus on smaller pack sizes. Globally, our immediate consumption packs which are typically sold at a higher retail price per ounce grew unit case volume 3% in the quarter. Taken together with the effective management of our portfolio and cost structure, solid pricing enabled us to deliver another quarter of strong underlying operating margin expansion.","Now turning to look around the world, many of our developed markets, particularly North America and Europe, continued to perform well. In North America, improving performance in our refranchised territories with a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management and some favorable timing of shipments in our foodservice business led to an organic revenue growth of 5%. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa group, solid marketing and innovation along with improved alignment with our bottling partners resulted in strong 6% organic revenue growth.","Importantly, though, some of our larger markets like China and Nigeria are also accelerating top line revenue growth this year as we accelerate the revenue management strategies. However, as I noted earlier, there are still regions around the world experiencing political instability and some challenging economic conditions. Most of Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies. Additionally, while we believe India has taken the right steps towards modernizing its monetary and tax system, new policies have resulted in near term uncertainty for retailers and consumers that impacted the beverage industry in the first half.","In all of these instances, we are responding quickly to the volatile external environment and building strategies that will allow us to deliver value to our customers by responding to these new challenges faster than the competition.","Now, let me turn and take a deeper look at some specific actions we're taking to drive revenue growth. These efforts are the result of a keen focus on innovation, small pack sizes and more robust segmentation strategies. For example, in China, we launched new innovative versions of Minute Maid Pulpy brand to serve the premium consumer segment at retail prices above the original version. In Europe, innocent, our premium juice and smoothie brand, continued to outperform with double-digit revenue growth as a result of expanded distribution and product innovations, such as pack improvements and the launch of new, higher-value-added smoothies.","Within our sparkling soft drinks, revenue growth was driven by our no-sugar options, where we are perfecting recipes, expanding availability and supporting enhanced execution with the right level of marketing support. Specifically, we continue to see excellent results from Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. This product has demonstrated strong consumer appeal in Europe, Mexico and other markets, resulting in double digit global volume growth for the brand year-to-date. So, we will continue to roll this new and improved product out across key markets, including the U.S., supported by substantial marketing and media support. And with its even more Coke-like taste, we expect it to continue to be a growing and important part of our portfolio.","You all know that small packs are an important part of our business. They enable us to provide price mix-accretive offerings at affordable consumer price points as well as high-value products in developed markets like the U.S. This year's success of the small pack initiatives in China, South Africa and Central and Eastern Europe is helping to deliver growth in these markets.","Finally, we are looking to grow through more robust segmentation of our existing portfolio. In West Africa, for example, we are tailing (8:01) our package offerings and trade incentives for rural and urban markets even further and, as a result, we are delivering stronger top line results.","Now, to support all of these initiatives, we have been taking significant action to strengthen our system. In May, we held our annual Global System Meeting, and the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high. They are encouraged by the innovation we are bringing to the market and are committed to support our investments with enhanced focus on local execution. And over the past year, we started to see tangible results, starting, let's say, in North America. We've seen continued strong performance from our bottlers as we complete refranchising and are confident in the actions we have taken to complete the changes this year while also improving execution in the marketplace.","For example, we are seeing improved execution from Coca-Cola UNITED and Coca-Cola Beverages Florida across the state of Florida. In territories it acquired, UNITED is increasing outlet penetration in eat and drink channels whilst also improving same-store sales with local convenience stores and workplaces. These are the types of account where at the local touch from our network of independent bottlers provides a significant strategic advantage and is one of the reasons why our overall performance in North America has consistently outshined our performance in measured channels.","And I'm pleased to say that we are getting close to finishing our planned refranchising activities. With the latest letters of intent to divest both West and the Tri-State Metro Operating Units, we now have 100% of the U.S. territories of Coca-Cola Refreshments under agreement or letter of intent.","Turning to Europe, we are already seeing better results than we have seen in several years from this important profit center as our new pan-regional bottler, Coca-Cola European Partners, leverages best practices from its three predecessors and we work together to bring new products to the market at a faster pace.","Turning to Asia, Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan completed its first quarter as an integrated company, and earlier this month, we completed refranchising of all our company-owned bottling operations in China with the sale of the Shanghai bottler.","Finally, turning to Africa, we reached agreement with the South African government on conditions addressing public interest considerations in connection with our planned acquisition of ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Over the coming months, we will continue to work with the various regulatory approval processes and expect to close these transactions around the end of the year. As a reminder, we plan to account for these bottling territories as discontinued operations until they can be refranchised to other partners.","As I laid out earlier this year, we are also embracing a new operating model and changing our culture to smart risks and be more growth orientated. As we expand our portfolio, we are taking a test and learn mentality which means some things will work right off the bat, some will need tweaking and that's all okay. For instance, we launched Honest Tea in Europe earlier this year and learned that the brand resonates better with consumers in certain channels, so we've immediately begun to evolve the packaging format and go-to-market channel strategy. We are seeing what consumers want and making adjustments immediately. At the end of the day, speed and agility are critical in this rapidly changing consumer landscape.","Now turning to our Lean center initiatives, we are on track. Much of the organizational design work we outlined earlier this year is now complete and we are rapidly implementing our new corporate structure to support faster growth. While these large-scale changes are never easy, our associates understand the need for our company to adapt and I am very encouraged by how well the organization is embracing the transformation. Our system has proven that it is taking the right actions to be successful in the market and going forward, we will remain relentless in becoming a more efficient, leaner, more agile while continuing to expand our portfolio, therefore building a strong position for future growth.","Looking at the back half of the year, we will continue to face many of the macro headwinds we have seen year-to-date and over the past few years. However, we are building on a solid marketing calendar, an innovation pipeline, and strong execution. And I am confident we will achieve our full-year outlook.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through our numbers.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We delivered good financial results in line with our expectations with price mix and operating expense leverage driving 6% growth in underlying profit before tax. As James mentioned, we continue to refranchise our company-owned bottling operations which, together with a slight currency headwind, resulted in a 16% decline in comparable net revenues. However, adjusting for the impact of currency and those divestitures, our revenue management initiatives led to 3% organic revenue growth in the quarter with strong performance in North America, Europe and Mexico.","Comparable gross margin increased over 200 basis points, reflecting the benefit from refranchising lower margin bottling businesses and strong price mix, partially offset by increased commodity costs and about a 40-basis-point currency impact. Comparable operating margin grew over 375 basis points, driven by the divestitures, the timing of SG&A expenses, and continued productivity.","Moving to cash flow, we generated $2.6 billion in free cash flow year-to-date and have returned to our shareowners $1.6 billion in the form of dividends, reflecting a 6% increase in our annual dividend and $1.3 billion in net share purchases.","Turning to our comparable outlook, for the full year, we expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% growth in underlying profit before tax. In addition, we expect divestitures of company-owned bottlers to result in a five- to six-point structural headwind to profit before tax. However, due to the strengthening of several currencies, we now expect a currency headwind to profit before tax of two points, slightly better than our previous guidance of a three-point headwind. This will result in approximately a $0.02 benefit to full-year EPS. So, we now expect comparable EPS to be flat to down 2% this year as we complete the bottler refranchising process and return to a higher margin capital-light business model.","As we model the third quarter, there are a few items to consider. First, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 19- to 20-point headwind on net revenue and a nine- to ten-point headwind on profit before tax. Therefore, we also expect this to result in greater comparable growth in operating margin expansions than we saw in the first half. Second, we expect that currency will be a one- to two-point headwind on net revenues and a two- to three-point headwind on profit before tax. And then finally, as a reminder, our calendar fourth quarter will benefit from one extra day versus the prior-year period.","So in summary, our performance during the first half of the year was in line with our expectations. And given that many markets remain volatile, we're maintaining our currency neutral estimate. However, with a slightly better currency environment in the back half of the year, we now expect full year comparable EPS to come in $0.02 higher than our previous guidance.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We have Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bryan, your line's open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, my question is related to the flexibility to spend more. I guess, as we're kind of watching the year evolve and watching the performance, it seems like you're having good traction with a lot of the revenue initiatives, packaging product. So James, could you just talk to us about maybe sort of the flexibility you have within your plans to maybe increase some of the marketing investment, or some of that investment to drive revenue growth, given that it seems like you've got pretty good response to kind of what you're doing now?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning. Yes. Yeah, I think we've said that we're going to manage the year, and we're going to try and put into that balance the obvious building of the business over the long term. We have stated that we'd like to get out of the trend of declining EPS, which we've seen in the last few years, and that we are going to invest where it makes sense.","So, we are constantly looking at where that places our momentum and should we invest more, and we have done so. And we have increased our plans in the downhill in a couple of places where we see really good momentum and the good reasons to invest for better results. But the world remains volatile, and there are places where the environment is better suited to affordability, to returnables, to adjustments and where markets are just frankly under a lot of macro pressure. Extra investment is not going to drive us very far. So, we will continue to manage it with flexibility. We know that going forward, we'll have some of the money we're going to generate out of Lean Enterprise, to look across the portfolio, but we're going to decide that on an ongoing basis.","Operator","Thank you. We have Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Judy, your line's open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hey, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. I guess my one question is just around your organic revenue growth guidance for the full year, and just kind of how you're thinking about the puts and takes around it in the back half. So obviously, you're doing 3% year-to-date. The full year guidance implies a continuation of the similar growth rate. I think a lot of your peers are actually guiding to acceleration in the back half. And there may be some unique timing situations for you guys, but just kind of the puts and takes as you think about the back half from an organic sales growth perspective? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Judy. I think a couple of things. On an as-reported basis, you will indeed see an acceleration in the back half, principally because we have an extra day in the fourth quarter and we had the less days in the first quarter. So, I think as you look at the reported numbers, there will be some acceleration.","Now, underlying that and seen in its most simple sense of taking unit cases and price mix, as you say, we did roughly 3% in the first quarter and roughly 3% this quarter. We're guiding to 3% for the rest of the year because, frankly, the world has not changed. We're doing a lot of the right things in the places that are going well, and frankly, some of the ones that need to be fixed. But we don't see the world is improving rapidly, and therefore we're not banking on that happening and so we're more focused on doing what we know needs to be done and having a moderate view of how that's going to play out in the rest of the year. And I think the expectation for the downhill should be more of the same of what we've had so far this year, hopefully with some of those macro situations improving as we get towards the end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Bill, your line's open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bill.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","James, one of the things we've heard with regards to U.S. refranchising is that as they've taken over the territories, that are actually performing maybe better than Coke was when they were doing it. And you've seen an acceleration in some markets. They've been a little more aggressive. So, I guess, this is really one question. Is that the case? Why is that happening? And do you expect that to be a tailwind for the business in the U.S. over the foreseeable future?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yes. I think the headline answer is yes, it's happening. And I think it was part of the design and the strategy. To be fair to the team running CCR, they have been improving the operations of Coca-Cola Refreshments over the years and have been getting increasingly better results over time and doing a lot of the things that set the platform for better local operations and better coordinated national operations.","But there's no question that as the bottlers have taken over these new territories, they have been very energetic in trying to improve them. They have made good progress particularly in some of the non-directly measured channels, the up and down the street, the smaller stores where they build on their local expertise. So, I think, it is in aggregate a tail-wind. It was part of the strategy that it should be that way, and I think, it's a compliment to the local bottlers that they are driving that forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Sir, your line is open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Wanted to talk a little bit more about the margin expansion that we saw, so 375 basis points on a non-GAAP basis. Can you quantify the disaggregation that you lay out in words? So quantify how much is coming from bottling divestitures, how much from expense management, how much from timing of expenses, which I assume that means is coming back at some point. So really want to disaggregate that and quantify that. And think about how we should think about the sustainability of each of those going forward to really draw the path on operating margin expansion going forward. Thanks.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","So morning, Ali. So the operating margin expansion, the 375 basis points, I mean, clearly we see that operating margins are expanding, when you see that we're at 6% in (22:40) profit before tax and on organic revenues of 3%. The upside is driven by that price mix and so you know exactly where the price mix came from in terms of a lot of it being driven by North America and EMEA in this quarter. And then the timing of SG&A expenses. Yes, part of that is \u2013 yeah, it will moderate over the balance of the year. But that wasn't really the bulk of what was driving that. It's more about the productivity and cost management that we have in the year. So we have more plans over the next couple of years for additional \u2013 for the rest of the productivity and that will continue to drive operating margin expansion.","Plus just the refranchising itself has driven a lot of that 375 basis points. As we have gotten out of the capital-intensive businesses, the more people-intensive businesses, that specifically drove that 375 basis points. So we had guided to the fact that our operating margins were going to go up after the refranchising. We plan to be in that range and continue to look for obviously other opportunities to increase operating margins as we go forward. So basically think about it as the refranchising driving most of that, good price mix and the cost management and the other productivity that we will continue to get over the next couple of years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie, your line is open.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you. Good morning, James and Kathy.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was just hoping to get an update on your Gold Peak and Dunkin' Donuts ready-to-drink coffees and whether you think there's an opportunity to expand these brands globally at some point. And then curious to hear how you're managing the launch of these in light of Monster Cafe in terms of, I guess, positioning and then what gives you the confidence that the three new coffee brands will all be incremental. Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, sure. Morning. I think, we're very happy that we're doing well in teas and coffees, both globally and in North America. Obviously, the Dunkin' one is early days. Good start. I think, Gold Peak is a good tea brand and again, an early start on the coffee. The basis of our kind of ready-to-drink coffee business and strong global position is actually Asia. So we have some strong brands there. So I don't think you should see it as there's going to be one brand for ready-to-drink coffee and ready-to-drink tea across the world. We're going to see some strong growth coming out of Asia in Asian teas. Yes, we're launching Honest Tea in Europe as the joint venture with Nestle winds down teas in the European space at the end of the year. So you will see us use some of our brands more broadly, but it won't be one brand everywhere.","Net-net, we are positive on the long-term growth opportunity for both ready-to-drink teas and coffees. We will end up with a portfolio of brands, particularly as it relates to different geographies. And each will have its own positioning, but, in the end, the consumer will decide the one it wants. And if all work, great. If two work, then we'll take one out. Maybe we'll bring one more in. But we'll continue to pay attention to what the consumer wants and help customers grow their businesses by selling our brands.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Powers of UBS. Steve, your line is open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. James, I wanted to build on the test and learn comments that you made upfront and the quest for speed and agility. There's some great examples that you've highlighted today in terms of portfolio progress, especially in Europe with smartwater and innocent and Zero Sugar and Honest. But what I'm trying to understand is, can you talk more about the specific, any specific steps or tools or incentives that you're putting in place to facilitate that speed and agility? Because in the end, I'm just trying to get a better feel for what that looks like in terms of day-to-day changes and how you push for speed, and, at the same time, efficiently manage risk and portfolio complexity as you accelerate into new SKUs and additional category country combinations. Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. I mean, I'll give you a couple of ideas. But I think the net of the answer is it's more of a cultural process than a process-process. Having said that, we're clear on when we're talking about test and learn or experiment, that people need to understand the scale and the potential impact of the experiments they're undertaking. In other words, we are starting to use some frameworks to classify how people are going after things.","So said in simple terms, if the test you're undertaking is not life threatening, do lots of them, learn quickly, and move on. I mean, if the experiment is potentially creates a material risk if it goes wrong, then let's look at it more closely. So we're starting to push through some ways of looking at the portfolio in the market so that they can categorize what sort of strategy and what sort of scale of experiment are they undertaking, whether it's a launch of a product or a new marketing program, et cetera, et cetera. And so the risk can be managed appropriately. And it's all about what's the potential downside to the corporation. And that, if it's not big, or said differently, if it's very small, then it's okay to let them go.","But as I said at the beginning of the answer, it's mainly a cultural mindset. It's the essential idea that the world is undergoing some important structural changes, multiple ones at the same time. And that is causing disruptions on many fronts, and we have to continue to do what we've done for 130-plus years, which is stay relevant for the consumer and help our customers grow their businesses. And that's cultural. So we need people to really be focused on where do we stand really, to be curious about what's going on in the world, to kind of not look at things through rose-tinted glasses and come to quick conclusions and move on.","Why? Not because we fancy it and it's a nice thing to have. It's because that's what's needed in the marketplace. And I think the employees understand that. I think that's why the Lean Enterprise is resonating, and I think that's why it will get pushed through. And we'll back that up with some tools and processes to help people. We're making much more embedded into the organization the use of real agile processes and agile teams because that's the way that we're going to get to answers quicker.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Andrea, your line is open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, James, Kathy and the team. We have seen continued weakness in sports drinks in the U.S. in the scanner data. And you highlighted also that water, enhanced water and sports drinks were down mid-single digits in the second Q. So could you maybe comment on what you're seeing in the category and do you expect the trends to improve in the back half of the year? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yes. Morning. And yeah. Yes, we saw some weakness in the water and sports drinks categories in the second quarter. Some of that was weather in May. There was a particularly poor period there. I don't like throwing the weather under the bus, but that's the Q2. I think in the longer-term trend, well, I think water will continue to grow, particularly enhanced water, premium waters, I think, you see a lot of activity by ourselves, by competitors in that space. So I think that is going to come back and will continue to be a source of growth for the industry. And we will participate very competitively. And it will be a source of growth for us. So I think it's a moment in time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. Good morning, James. Good morning, Kathy.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Laurent.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. I think you will have surprised many with your 5% organic growth in the U.S., especially after the soft quarter from your major competitor and still potentially with some disruption from transferring to bottlers. So how should we think about the price-mix going forward? Is 4% the new norm in the U.S., and by extension in developed countries? And if you can give some colors about what's coming from price, what's coming from mix, that would be helpful. Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Clearly, I'm not going to say that 4% is the projectable price-mix for the U.S. I think that's the top-end of what would happen. I think, it's important as you look at the U.S. result, I mean, clearly it was a good quarter and we're pleased that it comes on top of multiple years of the U.S. business performing at the top-end of large consumer products companies.","A couple of points that are very important to note. Firstly, we benefited in the second quarter from a little bit of extra gallons in the food service business that was kind of inventory call that a point. So, it was really more of a full percent.","Now we're getting a lot of that in the non-measured channels. We're getting it through the small packs. It's about a balance between mix and rate. We've got transaction packs growing mid-single digits in the quarter, high-single digits year-to-date in sparkling. So it really is a bit of a sweet spot between rate and mix.","As I said, it won't stay up at that high level because of the effects of the extra food service gallons. But they are executing strategy, and I think, it's playing out very nicely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Lauren, your line is open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Japan. It wasn't called out much in the release, and Asia, at least for me, was a bit softer than I had modeled. So can you just tell us anything about what's it doing in Japan overall trends across the bigger categories? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, let me start with Asia and then work towards Japan, Lauren. I think, there was some softness in Asia. We would have liked to see Asia come in better. I would call out obviously the slight disruption in India from the general sales tax obviously affected us in the back-end of the quarter. As I said in the opening remarks, we think that's good for the country, but it did obviously make some impact in the second quarter. And we're seeing softness across some of the ASEAN countries. Each has their own reasons, but the ASEAN region has been soft.","China bounced back a little bit. Japan had a solid quarter. It wasn't knocking out of the park like it has on some of the previous ones. There were some kind of cycling things in there. But we've had some good launches with some local products in Japan, Coca-Cola FOSHU, I need more time than I have now to explain it, but a pretty solid result. So, year-to-date, Japan is going reasonably well.","Obviously we've got the new bottler coming into being, which sort of affects the inventories that we sell into them, which kind of makes it look like they're not doing as well as they should. But I think Japan is going to continue to do well. China bounced back. So coming back to the beginning, it's really about India and ASEAN.","Operator","Thank you. Next is Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Kevin, your line is open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","So, James, question on the company's ability and then timing around accelerating top-line growth of the company. So to you and your team's credit, there's been universally positive response from the investment community around the changes that you've implemented. But organic sales are now trending around 3% and you're gaining market share, which is great, but the implication is that the NARTD category is broadly growing sub-3%.","So the question is, how quickly can you deliver on that trajectory of about 4%, which is where I think you sort of peg overall NARTD growth, at least something reasonable longer-term? How much can you drive with strategic changes and share gains? How much of this is maybe just cycling Brazil, which is a big market for the company? How much do you need an overall improvement in the macro to sort of take this growth rate from 3% to 4%, and over what time period do you think is sort of reasonable for investors? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Look, I think a couple of factors. Just mechanically, if Brazil and Venezuela had been flat in the quarter, we'd have grown 1 point faster. So you could say, okay, well, by next year, Venezuela will have declined so much it won't matter, and Brazil I think there's some belief that it will get better as we come out of the year.","So if you want it on a mechanical basis, yes, mathematically, if everything else stays roughly the same, then we'll get there next year as Brazil and Venezuela stabilize. Now, other countries could fall off the wagon, and so that's always an uncertainty.","Having said that, our underlying core revenue growth, organic growth, in the second quarter was actually 4%. So, if you strip out the bottling operations that we know we're going to sell, we talked about the core growing 4% last year. It grew 4% in this quarter. So I think in there is the seeds of that number as we go into 2018. We're not making a projection on 2018 yet, but I think on the line are the bread crumbs towards that conclusion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Brett, your line is open.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. From the outside, it seems bottler alignment's better than it's been in many times in the past. Just curious how dependent that is on you guys delivering better products to the market, whether that's organic, lift and shift M&A or delivering better marketing, investing more in the markets? And then, how long do you think the grace period is for you guys to deliver something better to the bottlers before that alignment begins to break down? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Look, I think clearly the company's role is to provide some leadership to the system and obviously the marketing of the brands, the marketing and innovation to create the business in the countries that they operate in. So to the extent the company doesn't do that, it's always going to be a problem on alignment.","Similarly, if the bottler's not taking advantage of when there are all those things and investing in execution, investing in the capabilities that develop the marketplace, to expand the number of outlets, to build a stronger base of cold drink equipment and the sales capability to help the customers develop their businesses, then there will be alignment problems.","So net-net, both sides need to come to the table with that piece of the equation and get it done. And when either side slips, yes, we have more robust conversations, but this is a business that really works well when both are coming to the table.","Operator","Thank you. Next would be Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Ma'am, your line's open.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Good morning.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hey, Faiza.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So I just wanted to talk about Coke Zero No Sugar. How sustainable do you think the growth is of that brand in Europe? And I'd love to hear more about your motivation to bring this to the U.S. Is it really designed to combat sugar taxes that we're seeing in a few of the markets? And how big do you think it can be? Are you going to phase out sort of Coke Zero over time? And is it meant to really target sort of the Coke Zero customer, the Coke Classic customer or more of a Diet Coke customer? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. I mean, I think, firstly, it's gone really well. Global volume growth for Coke Zero Sugar has stepped up over the last few years from mid-single digits to high-single digits, and now it's running in the teens. So it's done well in Western Europe, and that's really good. But actually, the global growth continues to accelerate, and we think it has a long way to go.","And in terms of bringing it to the U.S., of course, we're bringing it to the U.S. because we think it will do better and help the U.S. business grow. And you asked the question about, are we phasing out Coke Zero? It is a re-invention of Coke Zero, and it is a slight repositioning and, yes, it is about helping the zero-calorie part of the portfolio grow, which is linked to playing a role in tackling obesity.","And by that I mean, it's part of what we call the one-brand strategy. So Coke Zero Sugar, of course, is an improved version of the Coke Zero Sugar formula but it comes in more of a red visual identity, more of a red can, with more of a red label, and will actually help people stay in the Coca-Cola franchise. And whether they want the original with sugar or they want a Coke Zero Sugar without any, and it's less switching between brands, which will ultimately help us keep and attract more consumers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next would be Carlos Laboy of HSBC. Sir, your line is open.","Carlos Laboy - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Carlos, good morning.","Carlos Laboy - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","In order to realize the new strategic priorities, can you expand on the actual behaviors that are necessary for the next generation of leadership to succeed and how these might be different from the past? How do you provoke these behaviors, especially speed?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. Good question, Carlos. Look, I think the first thing is it's going to be clear to the associates why we want change rather than just asking for it. And so part of the task is helping everyone understand the business necessity of the need for change. As I mentioned earlier, the world is undergoing a lot of structural change and what it's driving towards is a place where the speed at which consumers, customers and the rate at which insights can be generated from data to give competitive advantage is changing such that the cycle of speed, experimentation, and learning will create higher business volume.","And firstly, you have to land the idea that you've got an ultimate competitive and business value underpinning rather than I prefer X versus Y.","How do you drive it forward? Well clearly, in order to get that done, you do need some technical skills. We'll need more consumer digital engagement-type skills, more e-commerce type skills, more artificial intelligence type skills, and more collaboration type skills.","In terms of the behaviors, in order to take advantage of that competitive cycle, you need greater transparency. So we need to push behaviors where the information is made available, more broadly, more transparently, more quickly. We need to keep encouraging a candor of looking at where we really are, opportunities and issues, no rose-tinted glasses because then you get to the insight quicker. That has got to go along with a greater curiosity. We've got to \u2013 one of the dangers being 130-plus years successful is you think you've got the answer to some things whereas we really need to have lots of curiosity about how things could be different, could be better, and how we respond to the way things are changing and then, of course, there needs to be some courage to try new things.","I talked earlier about that's got to be managed with risk appetite. All experiments are not born equal and there will be lots of tolerance for doing it in a sensible way and then commitment to making things better. And I think all of that can be created. Of course, the tone needs to be set from the top. We need to put in place the training and the programs and if people understand why, I think you get a much more empowered autonomous organization that is capable of creating a better future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Pablo, your line is open.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning, everyone. When I think of refranchising being completed by the end of the year in the U.S., you're going to end up with a very, very fragmented bottling system which is the opposite of what you have in other parts of the world and in turn has been for consolidation (44:09). So why does that make sense? Isn't that a problem or should we assume that five years from now, that system will look a lot more consolidated? And related to that, the fountain business remains in the hands of Coke. I think it's about 35% of volumes. It doesn't make sense for you to over time to gradually convert the fountain business into RTDs, or is that just impossible to do? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. Let me talk about the question around the bottling system and refranchising. Firstly, yes, there are some legacy small bottlers, but principally the U.S. bottling system by the end of this year will be a relatively small number of bottlers distributed in a very logical geographic distribution across the country, which has moved away from the great mosaic of the past of the patchwork quilt. I think what we will have is people who are really strong locally in their marketplaces where they know what to do and the U.S. is not one place, there are lots of local differences, but the important element of the strategy in the U.S. is the putting in place of the structures and mechanisms so the system can act as one; act as one with customers; act as one from a production system; act as one in terms of IT; act as one in terms of really working out what's the strategy. So, it will be a strong combination of local knowledge and the ability to act across the system. It's in place. I think they've done a great job over the last several years in bringing it to life and delivering top-class results in the U.S. environment and I think that's going to continue to be the system of the future.","Operator","Thank you. That will be the final question. And now, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. James Quincey for closing remarks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, Kathy and Tim.

[Operator Instructions].","Now let me turn the call over to James.","James Quincey","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. So here we are halfway through the year, and we see good momentum in our business as we continue our transformation as a total beverage company. We gained global value share with a balanced contribution from both developed and emerging markets led by strong performance in our sparkling soft drink business. Organic revenue growth is up 6% year-to-date, including growth across all operating segments and with a good balance between volume and pricing. Worth noting, about a point of that is due to benefit of timing. The underlying results, though, are still ahead of plan.","Unit case growth -- volume grew 2% year-to-date and 3% in the quarter. Comparable currency-neutral EPS was up 13% year-to-date, partially offset by a stronger-than-anticipated 9% currency headwind resulting in comparable EPS growth of 3%. While currencies continued to be headwind, we are focused on achieving our full year EPS target through stronger performance in the underlying business.","Looking around the world, we delivered strong top line growth in the first half driven by both developed and emerging markets. In Asia Pacific, we grew organic revenue 4% during the first half of the year. Strong performance in emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia and China drove 7% volume growth for the segment as we focused on underserved consumption occasions. This was partially offset by performance in Japan where our system continues to work through supply chain disruptions stemming from last year's natural disasters.","In addition, volume declined in Japan during the second quarter as our system implemented the first price increase to consumers in over 25 years. Looking ahead, we expect improving results in the back half as consumers adjust to the new pricing levels and we implement a robust innovation plan including Coke Energy and Innocent chilled juice.","Turning to EMEA. Here, we grew organic revenue 9% year-to-date driven by continued growth in Europe and Turkey, improved performance in South Africa and the first quarter benefit from our shipment timing. Across Europe, revenue growth management initiatives and Zero Sugar innovations are creating sustained momentum in the majority of our markets as shown by the 3% volume growth in our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. And in Turkey, despite the challenging macro environment, we are delivering a solid performance due to strong marketing and execution plans that are quickly adapting to the local conditions.","Turning to Latin America. Here we delivered 7% organic revenue growth year-to-date amidst a mixed operating environment. Brazil continues to deliver strong performance driven by better execution within a stable operating environment while Argentina continues to grapple with the economic crisis. Mexico's economic growth is slowing so we expect tougher operating conditions. However, we are adjusting our plans to ensure affordability, so that the business continues to grow sustainably.","Finally, turning to North America. Here, our results continued to mark steady progress driven by improved marketing and execution. Our performance was largely driven by consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our best-known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the smaller packages with less sugar. Retail sales of our No Sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio grew 6% in the quarter in Nielsen-measured channels. Strong revenue growth for our core sparkling soft drink brands continues to fuel and enable new innovations and investments across our expanding total beverage portfolio. For example, our premium water brands, smartwater and Topo Chico, are delivering healthy growth supported by the national launch of smartwater antioxidant and smartwater alkaline and the ongoing strategic expansion of Topo Chico.","Across all of our markets, we are driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth and aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. Beginning with our portfolio growth. Here, we are making progress in operationalizing our leader, challenger and explorer framework consistent with the strategy we outlined last year. Within our leaders, the core sparkling soft drink business registered healthy volume growth of 2% year-to-date with trademark Coke continuing to perform very well with volume up 3% year-to-date and 4% in the quarter fueling our portfolio expansion. Importantly, we're seeing healthy household penetration growth for our sparkling soft drink portfolio.","Whilst also encouraging is Coke Zero Sugar is now in its third year of double-digit volume growth. Along with our focus on smaller packaging and premium innovation, year-to-date, we are growing trademark Coke revenue faster than transactions, transactions faster than volume and reducing calories, what we believe is a winning strategy for the future. Our innovation pipeline. Our innovation pipeline for Coke Trademark expanded in April with the launch of Coke Energy, offering the edge of a great refreshing taste and an inclusive brand. The energy occasion is fast growing and expanding in multiple spaces to satisfy more consumers. We remain fully committed to our partnership with Monster, and we believe there are opportunities to capture even more value in the energy category for the Coca-Cola system and to bring new drinkers into our rapidly evolving category.","The initial results are encouraging. In Spain, the first market where Coke Energy was launched, has already captured 2% share of the energy category modern trade and it has achieved similar sales for outlet as the market leader with strong repeat levels that indicate good consumer acceptance. We're taking everything we have learned and applying these insights as we rapidly scale Coke Energy across our system. We are currently in 14 countries, and by the end of 2019, we expect to have Coke Energy available in 20 markets. Coke Energy, along with many of our other innovations, are being created to target specific occasions and need states but in very different ways, particularly as we grow our challengers and explorers. For example, in Australia, we recently launched NutriBoost after learning from its success in Vietnam. NutriBoost is a nutritious milk drink with zero added sugar that was designed for busy families looking for a mid-morning or afternoon energizing snack. With this, our focus on consumer-centric innovation, almost 25% of our revenue is now from new or reformulated products, up from 15% 2 years ago.","At the same time, we are taking a disciplined approach to curating our portfolio to ensure we have the capacity to focus on the right brands. So far, this year, over 275 zombie SKUs have been eliminated. We're also making progress on our plans to build a multiplatform coffee business. Since we finalized the Costa acquisition in January, we've been moving with speed across three areas: integrating Costa into our business, making sure Costa's existing clients are executed well and accelerating the opportunity to build a multiplatform business.","As we move forward on these opportunities, our focus is on accelerating three segments: the express vending machines, beans and machines for food service customers and ready-to-drink products. We've already launched ready-to-drink products in the U.K. with plans to roll out in additional markets in the coming months. And consistent with our other innovations, ready-to-drink Costa leverages a unique brand and product edge that will allow us to capture category growth.","We're also accelerating our plans to roll out more express machines across a number of markets. So far, this year, we've placed 1,200 new vending machines and have plans for many more by the end of the year. Finally, as you may have seen last week, we reached an agreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic to launch Costa Coffee across a number of formats within all their markets over the next three years.","Returning to the overall view. Of course, none of this works without our bottling partners. Globally, our bottling partners are aligned and energized and committed to building scale and investing into the future, and we're working with them to collectively raise the bar on our consistent execution. I've talked before about the revenue growth management initiatives, which are helping to drive increased velocity in our portfolio. Coupled with this has been a focus on expanding horizontal distribution through opening new outlets and placing more cold drink equipment. And we're making progress, especially in Asia where our system opened over 750,000 new outlets so far this year.","However, gaining penetration is only part of the equation. Consistently measuring and managing our performance in existing outlets is the other part that drives sustained performance. So, we're working to better leverage data and mobile technology in order to evolve our Right Execution Daily platform from a point-in-time scorecard into real-time integrated analytics capabilities that will drive faster and better-formed execution decisions across our system.","Before moving off our bottling system, let me quickly our address our plans in Africa. In May, we announced that we were stepping back from our plans to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. Instead, we will hold onto the bottler until we move through a period of political and economic change in the region. But to be clear, our bottling ownership philosophy hasn't changed. As with all our bottling investments, we will look to sell at the right time to the right buyer. In the meantime, we have a new and energized leadership teams on both sides of the system, and we are already seeing promising results.","Finally, in order to deliver long-term, sustainable growth, we must collaborate with our stakeholders. One critical issue facing the world is plastic waste. In 2018, we announced our World Without Waste goals through recycling, recyclable packaging and the use of recycled material. As noted in our earnings release, we are making progress against our goals. We used approximately 30% recycled material in our packaging globally in 2018. We now have 100% recycled PET bottles in the market in over half a dozen countries with more launches planned in 2019. And importantly, our system is also working to improve collection. We currently refill or collect equivalent of 58% of what we sell in the marketplace.","While global traction will take time given the need for infrastructure investments and various regulations by our market, we're actively working to lift and shift successful collection models such as PETCO in South Africa, ECOCE in Mexico and Coca-Cola Amatil is already leading our collaboration to run a deposit return scheme across all of its territories in Australia. Ultimately, the heart of our success are our people. We've been working to continue to build our growth culture because that is what will drive our performance year-after-year, moving faster, taking intelligent risks and learning from our mistakes. And I think this is beginning to show in our results.","So, in summary, we had a good first half of the year as evidenced by our solid organic growth rate. We're driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. And the momentum in our business gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year EPS target and drive shareholder value.","Now I'll turn it over to John.","John Murphy","Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Before addressing our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, I'd like to start by discussing a few key areas that I believe are critical to the company, specifically, driving healthy top line growth, expanding margins across our business segments, improving cash flow and leveraging a disciplined capital allocation process.","James has talked about our revenue growth management efforts. This quarter, we've continued to scale our work in both Asia and Latin America. We're implementing better analytical tools and processes to develop price\/pack architectures to meet evolving consumer and customer needs. And it's showing results, contributing to the robust organic revenue growth we've delivered now for the past eight quarters. Translating top line performance into sustainable margin improvement is where our ongoing productivity efforts and leader, challenger, explorer framework come into play. For the first half of the year, we delivered underlying operating margin improvement, a function of continued innovation, revenue growth management strategies and the effective management of our cost structure.","We've also advanced our efforts to improve cash flow and capital allocation. We're improving our working capital as evidenced by our year-to-date cash flow increase. We're taking a close look at all assets on our balance sheet. For example, we're in the process of selling our building in New York and we recently divested our equity stake in our Peruvian bottler. And we are reducing the sizable costs related to our productivity program that were part of the transformation of our business. So, we're making progress, and we aim to do even better.","Turning now to our financial performance in the quarter. We delivered another solid quarter with broad-based organic revenue growth, underlying margin expansion and improving cash flow trends. Organic revenue grew 6% with a healthy balance of price\/mix and volume and a 1-point benefit from timing. Our developing and emerging markets drove strong volume performance, which resulted in strong growth in our Bottling Investments Group. A continued rollout of revenue growth management initiatives across our developed markets resulted in good price\/mix.","Comparable margins contracted in the second quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and currency. However, both growth and operating margins expanded on an underlying basis. This translated into 14% currency-neutral operating income growth, partially offset by an 8-point currency headwind. The currency impact to operating income included a 2-point impact from hedging activity driven entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year.","Comparable EPS grew 4% in the quarter, which was comprised of 13% comparable currency-neutral growth, partially offset by a stronger-than-expected 9% currency headwind. And finally, year-to-date free cash flow was up $3.7 billion, up 87% due largely to strong underlying growth, working capital initiatives and the timing of cash taxes and capital expenditures. While we do not expect a similar increase in the back half of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver at least $6 billion in free cash flow.","Now looking at the remainder of the year. For the first half, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, and as James noted, about a point of this came from the timing of shipments, which we expect to reverse in the back half. But after normalizing for the timing benefit, the best way to think about our underlying top line performance for the first half is 5%. Considering this strong performance, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue to 5% for the full year, which is translating into stronger underlying profit performance, and that better underlying performance is enabling us to maintain our full year comparable EPS guidance even as currencies have gotten worse and structural changes are less of a benefit than we expected at the beginning of the year.","As you model the flow of the year, there's a few items to consider in terms of phasing due to cycling, the timing of shipments and expenses, moderating currency headwinds and an extra day in the fourth quarter. We expect all of the comparable operating income growth in the back half of the year to occur in the fourth quarter.","Specific to currency in the third quarter, we expect a 6-point currency impact to operating income. This includes a 3-point impact from hedging activity driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year as year-over-year spot rate headwinds are softening. As we move through the back half of the year, we expect the impact from currencies to become less of a headwind. Looking even further out at current spot rates and hedge positions, we expect a benign currency environment in 2020 compared to 2019.","As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to answer any questions as you build out your models for the year. So, in summary, we've had a strong first half of the year. Our strategies are driving strong performance in our business. Cash flow is improving, and we remain very focused on delivering our full year EPS guidance.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","So, a very solid set of results today. I guess the question from here, notwithstanding some of the timing factors that may cause some movement in the back half, just is what makes you most confident that this momentum can continue, if not further improve as you look out over the next few years?","And perhaps as an underappreciated part of that story, how do you view improvements in your -- the current bottling footprint factoring into that momentum? I mean bottling clearly contributed this quarter. And I guess the question is that an aberration? Or do you see bottling contributions as potentially sustainably accretive to total company top line and profit growth over the next couple of years?","James Quincey","Let me try and offer three thoughts, Steve. Firstly, I think we have in front of us a tremendous long-term opportunity in the beverage industry. I'd refer you back to one of the pages we've used in one of the investor decks with the two bottles, the one of the developed worlds and the one of the developing worlds. With the developed world is a small portion of the world's population, 20% of the population of the world. Yes, there, 3\/4 of what they drink is a commercial beverage, but we still have a relatively small share of that in aggregate and we're gaining share. So, there's huge opportunity for value growth in the developed world.","And yet in the developing part of the world, which is 80% of the world population, only 1\/4 of what they drink evolves from commercial beverage. And again, our share has lots of room for expansion. So, the first point is I would reunderline the long-term opportunity for growth of commercial beverages in the developed and the developing markets, and that's a huge opportunity in front of us.","The second thought I would offer you is I think we're seeing not just momentum in the second quarter or the year-to-date, and yes, leave aside some of the timing benefits, but what we're seeing is a sustained set of results over if you want to take the last four quarters and you average out the unit cases and you average out the price\/mix of the last four quarters to just give you a year, I think you get about two in volume and about three in price. And if you were to do the calculation, I think you'd end up with a three on price with or without BIG. So, I think you're seeing sustained momentum of the core business over a 12-month period. And perhaps even more encouragingly, that is now lapping a period where we were also in the band we were looking for, for our long-term growth model of 4% to 6%. So, we've now got 5% in round numbers lapping 5%. So, I think the momentum is now multiyear. I always encourage everyone to look at some multiquarter average given where we are in the supply chain and the timing effects. So long-term opportunities, and we're now building momentum that is called multiyear momentum.","And I think to the question of how much BIG can affect that going forward, yes. Look, we've clearly given the BIG team a mission to grow the top line and the bottom line. I think the countries that did well this quarter are -- happened to be the countries where we own the parts of the bottling operation. So that obviously -- that obviously was very helpful. But BIG is centered in a number of countries that have long-term growth prospects. They're largely in the bottle but is only 1\/4 commercial beverages. So, they have a lot of opportunity, and we've given them a clear mission to abandon the concept of the hospital ward. We should be aspiring for bottling operations we own to be just as good as all the other bottling operations, and obviously, we'll look to find the right owner at the right time. And therefore, yes, we should expect the BIG operations to do better in the coming years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","John, you opened up the door crack on 2020 earnings guidance with the benign FX comment. I know you won't give us an explicit guidance range today, but I guess just conceptually, besides FX, are there any big puts or takes we should think about for 2020 versus the typical EPS growth algorithm you've outlined? And also, maybe perhaps you can discuss if FX were to worsen and become more unfavorable from the spot rates where we are today, are there any leverage can pull to offset that from the earnings growth perspective as you look out to 2020.","John Murphy","Yes. No. Thanks, Dara. It's still very early days to talk about 2020. As you know, there's a number of factors that go into how we'll ultimately perform in 2020. The global macro environment continues to be pretty volatile. There's a lot of discussions as to where interest rates will land. And in some of our -- the markets that are particularly important to us, places like Mexico, like Turkey, South Africa, Argentina, there's a lot of moving parts there. So, it's very early to talk about 2020.","I do think it's -- it is good to look at 2020 though in the context of currency. We think the dollar is at the -- towards the end of a strong cycle, and hence, we think that we're in for a benign environment over the next year, 1.5 years.","With respect to sort of managing the potential headwinds from currency, I think we're starting to connect the dots better across the world between the decisions that need to be taken locally to help us have a more holistic approach to dealing with this topic because it's not going away. We -- the emerging markets represent almost 50% of our PBT. So, in the future, it's going to be a very important topic for us to address even better. So early days yet on that. But certainly, connecting the dots better, and as I said in the call, for the back half of the year, the upside on underlying operating performance is actually helping us to maintain our full year guidance.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the strength in the Asia Pacific segment. It's been pretty good so far first half of the year. And so maybe, James, if you could just dig in a little bit in terms of what's driving that underlying performance, and really what I'm after is, I guess, as we're kind of looking beyond this year, sort of some view of whether or not this type of performance is sustainable.","James Quincey","Sure. I mean clearly, we had a good quarter in Asia Pacific. I think we were somewhat helped by the kind of a later monsoon in India or the later start of the monsoon in India. So, I think one would be cautious in extrapolating one quarter into the future. But clearly, this quarter, we saw good growth in India, good growth in ASEAN, particularly in the Philippines, in Thailand, in Vietnam. We saw some good growth in China. Actually, that was despite deprioritizing some of the low-value water, and we're cycling the best quarter of last year.","But I think what is representative of is the long-term continued opportunity for the beverage business. We basically -- most of the money comes in from the Americas, North and South America, Europe and Japan and Australia. But that's a small part of the world's population. Actually, if you take Africa, if you take Indian subcontinent, ASEAN and China, that's the vast majority of the world's population, and we're only getting started. And that's where we're seeing good growth this quarter and we have been seeing it for a while. So, I think it's representative of the long-term opportunity. I wouldn't say let's extrapolate this one quarter, but there's absolutely long-term opportunity in those four large population zones.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So, one big controversy for investors around Coke is that as you transitioned from Coca-Cola of old to total beverage company, your margins will be pressured. And so, to zero in from that kind of broad controversy into the quarter, you provided this gross margin and operating margin bridge set of charts. Can you just aggregate please the \"underlying green,\" i.e., positive bar more in terms of cost savings, one, negative sales mix, maybe geographic mix and price\/mix, really with an idea of trying to get us comfortable with the sustainability and maybe positive momentum in margins. And particularly this quarter, we saw SG&A as a percent of sales improve, but that overall controversy remains on the margins. And then if I might, just a very quick clarification. You mentioned Coke Energy rolling out to 20 countries by the end of this year. Is the U.S. on that list?","James Quincey","So, let me start. I'm not sure there's a controversy at all. I think we've been super clear on what we believe is happening on the operating margins and I think, clearly, there's a couple of things happening here. And I would not all rotate on one quarter because of the movements of gallons and those sorts of things. I'll talk about the first half because that's -- I would prefer to talk about four quarters rather than even two, but let's go in.","So, I think our messaging has been very clear: the mechanical changes to the operating income margin happened because of ins and outs, particularly of bottling operations given their very different cost structures and the acquisitions, and I think that's clear on the chart. And I think what you can clearly see is we continue to execute against our game plan to improve operating margins over time. We've been tracking on that towards the target that we had talked about, but given all the confusion, we've removed and had this bridge instead.","So ongoing improvement in operating income margin, that's been happening and it's happened again in the second quarter or the first half. It's clearly driven by the sum of the parts. We're getting improved pricing. Yes, some of those are in categories, which have higher cost of goods. But as you can see in the gross profit line, the gross profit basically in the first half was flat yet it was better in just the second quarter, but again, I prefer the longer time frame.","So, against the question, will expansion of new categories cause the compression of the gross profit margin, we had previously said yes, it might be a little, but it will be offset by productivity. What you've seen in the first half is it's a wash. We've been able to drive the Coke franchise and the innovation and manage the portfolio such that the net impact on gross margin is a wash, which is a great result. And then obviously, we're getting some flow-through of our ongoing productivity efforts. Just because we haven't announced the new program, we are still focused on using resources effectively in the SG&A on the back -- in the back office and investing wisely with the marketing such that this operating leverage is flowing through into the margin. So, I think the game plan is intact and we're continuing to drive against it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","So, James, I guess, my question is just kind of looking at the coffee and Energy opportunity, and you've laid out the plans for the year in entering some of the newer markets. I guess my question is how do you determine and so what's the criteria in determining which markets to enter as kind of the Phase 1 and then over the next couple of years? And then I think Ali asked about a question about if the U.S. fits into that plan so if you can address that as well.","James Quincey","Yes. I mean just starting on the U.S., I mean we haven't -- the markets we haven't announced yet, I mean, we're not going to announce until we're ready. Clearly, we're thinking about the U.S. market and when would be the right timing for Coke Energy. Clearly, it's a big market and a big opportunity. I think, ultimately, the way I would look at it is we've launched in a number of markets and our approach is essentially to launch in markets where we know we have capabilities and a lot of strength and a strong Coke franchise, and therefore, we think would represent a robust good opportunity and that should give us an idea of what -- how well we could do. So, Spain would be an example of that. We have a great franchise in Spain. We have a great on-premise business there with the caf\u00e9s and restaurants. We have strong relationships with the modern trade and a very strong bottler. So, we know that if we do well there, that in strong markets, then we know what that would represent.","Then we've also launched it in some of the other emerging markets and some markets that our strengths are not as good as the Spanish end of the spectrum, but it'll give us a range of learnings and experience in different types of environments. And that'll give us, in a way, a set of learnings on the 1.0 of launching Coke Energy from which we can learn. And purely from a rollout perspective and a tactical perspective in something like this, it would probably suit us to have those learnings and have a 2.0 for the U.S., whatever tweaks that may be, whether it's taking the formulation tweaks and the graphic tweaks and the marketing mix tweaks and the execution approach, because it's all about accelerating the learning cycle and driving that forward.","So that will be the conceptual approach on how we want to get it done. And that's kind of will be true, whether it's Coke Energy or Coke with coffee. Every time we've done it, we've tried to make sure we learn from the cycle of the 1.0 or 2.0 before we go to the next set of countries. Obviously, that means you need to go back at some point to the initial countries to bring them up to the latest thinking on what can be done.","And similarly, for coffee, there, of course, we're looking at which of the formats best establishes the brand and can work. And clearly, we think that rolling out with the express vending machines and being a kind of a beans-and-machines beverage partner to the restaurants and caf\u00e9s and the kind of immediate consumption channels is the way to a kind of drive the brand forward. And ready-to-drink coffee will play a part of that but not necessarily be the first piece.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","James, I was hoping you can just give us some context on the U.S. market. Obviously, the sparkling business is doing quite well. But maybe you could just talk about the still portfolio. I understand there's some kind of gaps and weakness in that portfolio when it comes to the DASANI, POWERADE, Gold Peak. So maybe you can just kind of talk about those brands and kind of what the plans are there to get them back in the right direction.","James Quincey","Sure. I mean, I think, again, I'll talk more about the first half than the second quarter because, of course, you get things bouncing around in the short term. I think on the side where there's more work to be done, the water brands, the mainstream water brands like DASANI we're under pressure a bit so far this year as much as anything due to the expansion of retailer private labels and particularly in the larger formats of number of bottles in a case. So, there's some challenge there.","The flip side of that is we continue to do really well with the premium water brands. So, Topo Chico continued its fantastic growth wave, smartwater continued to grow. So, I think you see a diverging set of performance in the water market between the mainstream and the premium water brands.","POWERADE, again a bit of Tale of Two Cities. POWERADE, the main brand, has not had a good start to the year, faced some executional issues yet POWERADE Zero's growing, and I know the BODYARMOR is doing well in the Coke system. So again, a bit Tale of Two Cities in the sports drink\u2019s category.","In terms of juice, again, it's a bit of a repeat. Minute Maid was flat, slightly soft, but we did really well in some of the new launches. And Simply was growing nicely. So again, I think you see a bit of that contrast between some of the mainstream, in this case, more flattish or slightly negative and growing in the premium, especially off Simply and the smoothie. So, I think you see a little of a dichotomy going on there.","And I think it's worth talking about the second half. We really got a good program going into the back half of the year, a lot of focus on media and experiential sampling on some of those still categories whether it's smartwater or POWERADE or Gold Peak and some agreed commercial activities with specific customers and market blitzes on merchandising as to kind of bring those back around. So, I think we'll see a lot of attention and focus on reverting some of those trends going into the back half of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","James, it would be really helpful if you could sort of walk us around the world. You did mention a bit of softness in Mexico if I'm not mistaken, and you said Brazil was stable even though you did better. And if you just looked at the state of consumer and the friendliness towards U.S. companies with China specifically being part of that question, could you just talk to us a little bit about how you see that around the globe? What's getting significantly better? And if anything's deteriorating? Is the Middle East getting worse, for example?","James Quincey","So just going back to -- starting in Latin America where you mentioned -- the Mexico that I mentioned, the little softness in the economy, Mexico, we still grew volume in the second quarter slightly, but we still grew volume in the second quarter in Mexico. So, I think it's more of a generalized concern of the environment. Brazil obviously did well. The Argentinian business suffered again in the second quarter. I think there's a clear macroeconomic environment. We're very focused on what we can do in terms of affordability and execution, but you can't completely outrun a macro crisis. So, we're definitely seeing some of that. So, Argentina was very weak.","Middle East, yes, that was negative. Clearly, there's some struggle there across the Middle East and that was negative in the quarter. But then once you get out of that, I think it's a bit kind of the theme of the year, which is the clouds on the horizon don't quite arrive with the storm or the storm doesn't arrive. So yes, when you read the reports and look at the forecasts and listen to the news, you would conclude that things are worse. But there seems to be some calm underneath of that and I think that's what we're seeing. As we've executed against our plan, the macros have not been as bad perhaps as one had feared and that has allowed us to deliver strong operational results, and I think Asia Pacific is one of the examples of that where we continue to do well across a broad number of countries on the basis of great plans.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Congratulations on strong first half results. James, a question on North America. So broadly, three consecutive quarters where volumes have been negative but not very consistent with the industry with pricing that's been put into place. But I guess the other key topic, of course, is that your key competitors ramped investment spending that started last year. This is continuing behind key brands like Pepsi and Mountain Dew and Gatorade. Arguably, to some degree, the strategic changes that they're making in North America will really be sort of a key watch point for investors whether this turnaround is, indeed, going to be successful. So broadly, if you could discuss sort of the competitive environment. And then the second part of that, whether you're comfortable with current investment levels in your portfolio going forward.","James Quincey","Yes. I mean, firstly, I think I would say that if competitors are investing in the category behind branding and rational pricing and trying to create value, that is ultimately good news. Yes, it means we have to be on the top of our game, but it's better to be in an industry where there's more consumer demand being created than not. So, I think that's a very important starting point that we think will be beneficial ultimately to the total beverage business in the U.S.","In terms of the volume, I mean, the volume was slightly negative in the U.S. I think it's important to remember what we're trying to do in the U.S. business. We're focused on building the consumer engagement, and so a lot of what we've done, particularly in some of the sparkling brands, is have a focus on some of the smaller packages and drive for transaction growth even if that means the volume's flat. We'd love a little bit of positive. But if it's a little bit of negative, that hasn't concerned us because we think we can stabilize the volume in the long term and have the value be created ultimately through the price\/mix. So, more price versus volume. Obviously, like to see volume a little bit positive in the case of the U.S., but really sticking with the strategy of driving the consumer interactions, heavy lean on smaller packages. Of course, the portfolio piece that goes with that is some of the Zero Sugars and the reformulation.","I think that's what you see turning into the strong revenue growth rates from North America. So, you're seeing North America do consistently over time well in terms of revenue growth, and they're gaining market share across a broad swathe of categories from sparkling to a number of the still categories.","So, we think it's a strategy that's working for us. We think the investment levels are good for what we're seeing at the moment. Of course, we constantly review all aspects of the business mix and the variables we control as well especially, and we will go up or down as we believe to be appropriate and necessary.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sean King with UBS.","Sean King","A question about the expanded launch of alcoholic beverages in Japan. While I recognize there might be market-specific competitor or maybe demographic considerations, why not look to other markets besides Japan?","James Quincey","Well, clearly, this one evades a very Japanese logic we talked about when it launched regionally. The competitive set, we can face a set of local competitors in Japan, which operate in a multicategory, not just soft drinks and sparkling and stills, but wine, beer and spirits going to the same customers, and in the case of the Lemon-Do, competing for an occasion and a consumer which heavily overlaps here. So, there's a lot of logic in the context of the Japanese business and what you're seeing is a horizontal distribution expansion in the Japanese business, still very small in the context even our business in Japan.","The logic of taking it elsewhere has not been clear for The Coca-Cola Company. Of course, historically, our bottlers have carried beer or been brewers so that in parts of the world where there's some distribution logic that it has been -- there have been relationships with our bottling partners. But the Japanese -- example where we own the brand is the Japanese example, and anything else would need to be considered very carefully and the business logic would be very clear for why we should do something different.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. I actually wanted to circle back to your full year guidance. Obviously, your results so far this year were better than you originally expected given that you increased your top line guidance. So, could you maybe highlight or summarize for us the main drivers of this or essentially what was an upside surprise from your perspective? And then on the second half, comps are still tough, but could you highlight why you expect your organic sales to grow a point or two? Are you just being conservative with your outlook for the back half?","James Quincey","Sure. Look, the story I think ultimately follows the trajectory. We had, have and still have going forward a clear strategy with a strong view on what we need to do to capture the opportunity ahead of us, and we started executing that a number of years ago. And we were getting momentum and -- we were getting momentum coming out of '17. We had good result, top line momentum in '18.","We did at the beginning of this year like our plans still, but see the macro clouds on the horizon and we're a little more cautious in our guidance in February from a top line point of view. The clouds, as we've talked about, are still there, but the storm never arrived. And so, we did better in the first half. I mean, ultimately, it's a result of executing the right plans and the right place and the headwinds not being there.","So, where have we seen the benefit? I think we've seen the benefit across a whole series of places doing that a little bit better, whether it's Asia Pacific or some of the parts of Europe and Africa. So, I think it's the flow-through of execution, but it just wasn't one place. As I talked about on the first question, I really do think of the first half more as a 5 than a 6 and there are lots of ways of getting at that answer whether you like the simple rule of thumb or just taking the average of the unit cases and the average of the price\/mix and that gets you five, whether it's two quarters or four quarters or you can get into the minutia or the detail on the timing of the Brexit, gallons and all this sort of stuff. But ultimately, you come to the simple headline answer that it's basically a 5, and it's a 5 cycling other growth rates. So, there's really good momentum there.","And then when you count the second half, the clouds are still there. The storm hasn't arrived. We have great plans. We have a strategy and a bottling system with momentum. And so, we think we can see our way through to delivering an underlying five in the second half. Of course, if those timing elements reversed, the reported numbers are going to be slightly softer than that in the second half. But that won't detract from the ultimate conclusion that it's a system that's creating momentum around five with a plan that's working.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Japan because in the commentary so far that you've offered on Asia, you really highlighted developing and emerging markets. And I think there were supply chain issues in Japan last year that we would have been cycling through. So, if you can just run through kind of what's doing in Japan and why that wasn't called out as being a stronger contributor.","James Quincey","Sure. No, Japan was a detractor there in this quarter and for some very specific reasons. Firstly, in the natural disasters last year, one of our important bottling -- one of the important manufacturing facilities of our bottle was knocked out completely last year. So, we lost capacity just as we were starting to grow in the Japanese business, and they're working very hard to install new capacity. They're doing a great job in doing it, but one cannot defeat the laws of physics. And so that's going to be brought online over the course of this year, and that has produced a constraint on the business this year.","The second reason, which is super important, is we have taken a pretty broad price increase in Japan in April, the first one in a couple of decades. So that's a big deal. And whilst our competitors did not follow us immediately, they did follow us by the end of the quarter. So of course, there was -- the price of leadership in those circumstances is we suffered a little bit of a volume hit in the second quarter. But of course, as they've gone up, too, we think that, that will normalize. And in the context of capacity constraint, we deprioritized some of the lower-margin water volume.","So, some very specific reasons in Japan, but we are focused on making the right decisions to invest and drive the brand going into the future. We've got some improving trends in the vending channel. We've got some product innovation and some packaging and pricing stuff -- more stuff coming through with the digital platform as well. So, we think that these decisions will allow us to start to really get some better results in Japan as the production comes back on track -- production capacity comes back on track as we go into the second half of the year.","So, we see it more as -- much more as a point in time, but we believe it was what was needed to be done given the natural disasters and it's the right decisions in terms of setting the business up for the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Grant O'Brien","This is actually Grant on for Bill. Just want to touch on free cash flow a little bit. Obviously, you guys are focused on it a little bit more. I understand some of that is timing year-to-date. But just wondering on some of the changes you guys have made and maybe some of the initiatives in place going forward to improve free cash flow conversion and kind of room to run on that.","John Murphy","Thanks. Yes, this is a key area of focus and we've talked about it over the last few months as being such, and there's a number of elements to improving our position as we go forward. One is in the area of working capital. We know that we can do better. We know we have opportunity to -- between where we sit today and where best-in-class is. And in this quarter, we made significant strides with -- in the payables arena, we've delivered almost $600 million of benefits to our working capital number in the quarter.","A second area that we've talked about is reducing the amount of onetime cash outflows that have been a key part of the transformation work, particularly with the refranchising in North America. That number is going to decline as we move forward and we saw a little bit of that impacting us in -- favorably in the second quarter.","And the third area then would be to get our CapEx, capital expenditures, in line with what we think the run rate should be going forward. That's going to take a little bit longer given the fact that we have taken back for the time being the Philippines and South Africa. And so, in the second quarter, in addition to the working capital improvements, the benefits from timing of cash tax payments in 2018, we did not have them this year. And our capital expenditure flow for the year is weighted more in the back half.","So good progress on working capital, some timing benefits in the quarter. But as we look to the second half of the year, we are very confident that we'll deliver the free cash flow guidance that we've given.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Well done this quarter, everybody. I guess first on two things. One on Coke Energy now that it's been in the market for a little bit. Can you give us some context on source of volume? Is it really coming from Red Bull as I think you guys have mentioned? And then is any of the growth coming from outside of Energy? And then the second question, John, I don't remember your words exactly, but I believe you said you felt the dollars coming to the end of a strong cycle, and I'm just curious if there's something you're seeing that you could provide to help us kind of understand that comment.","John Murphy","Sure. Let me start with the second point. When you take a step back and you look at dollar cycles over the last 20 or 30 years, the current cycle is the longest one we've had, number one. And when you look at the -- both the macro indicators over the next 12 to 24 months plus some of the political commentary that has been in play around the world, it does point to us being at the high end of dollar strength. And hence, my comments on the environment as we look at it today based on both spot rates and the outlook that we see through a number of lenses to be a benign environment in 2020.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any closing remarks.","James Quincey","Thank you, everyone. Just to summarize again, bottling system is working very hard with us.

And we're making good progress not just in the near-term, but for our long-term goals. So as always, thank you for your interest and your investment in the company and for joining us today.

This will be my last earnings call as CEO of this great company. First and foremost, I'd like to thank all of you for your support and collaboration. It's been my distinct privilege and pleasure to serve you and all of our shareholders as CEO for almost nine years now. During this time, we achieved a lot. We delivered $110 billion of share-owner value with continued annual dividend increases and growth in our share price. We embarked on the biggest re-franchising in bottling restructuring effort in our history, transforming our company to a pure and effective consumer and brand business with approximately 50% of our Global Bottling business in positive motion.","With today's announcement, we're on track to achieve almost $5 billion in savings from 2008 through 2019, through productivity and reinvestment programs. We completed a net total of around $16 billion of M&A, bringing in some of our strongest and fastest-growing brands, including smartwater, Santa Clara, Innocent, Jugos del Valle, Honest Tea and Fairlife, just to name a few. We introduced almost 1,000 new products and added $9-billion brands, bringing our total to 21. We grew daily servings by nearly 0.5 billion from 1.5 billion at the end of 2007 to more than 1.9 billion today, and we achieved 39 consecutive quarters of global value-share gains.","By focusing on our Three W's; Women, Water and Well-Being, we've created the most progressive, sustainable and connected business cycle, empowering 1.7 million women in our value chain through the 5by20 initiative to support economic empowerment of 5 million women by 2020, becoming the first Fortune 500 company to announce that it is replenishing 100% of its global water use and supporting the World Health Organization's guidelines of limiting sugar intake. And finally, we expanded our portfolio to become the largest juice company in the world and strengthened our leadership in straw beverages.","Our brands, our bottling system and our various partnerships are the strongest they have ever been, but most importantly, and for which I'm the most proud, in just a few days we will be completing the smoothest and the most seamless leadership succession. The foundation of our company is as strong as it's been ever being. As we move to the next phase, I have every confidence, that our company and our system will accelerate growth under James' new leadership as CEO, and I very much look forward to following and supporting him in every way I can.","As I've said before, the future is bright. We compete in a fantastic industry with solid growth prospects. We have the greatest brands, our strength in bottling system is comprised of passionate partners, and we have a great new CEO and a fabulous leadership team.","It is with a great sense of pride, therefore, that I'm passing on the role of CEO to James in a few days, and I have great confidence in our future. Thank you for your support and your trust and confidence over the past nine years.","So with that, I will turn the call over to James, The Coca-Cola Company's next Chief Executive Officer.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Muhtar. Thank you for your leadership over the last nine years and for your unwavering partnership. It is truly a privilege to succeed you as Chief Executive Officer, and I look forward to your continued support as we take the next steps to further capture the full array of opportunities before us. To do this, for these next steps we've laid out how our strategies and operating model will evolve and provided guidance as to our expectations for the first steps and through 2017.","So let me turn, then, to the quarter firstly. Operating results were in line with our expectations, and we are on track to deliver against our full-year guidance. As we anticipated, organic revenue was even in the quarter with solid price mix offset by declining concentrate shipments, and it's worth noting the 3% decline in concentrate shipments was primarily driven by a few factors that will self-correct over the balance of the year.","Our first quarter had two fewer days this year, impacting growth by about 2%, and of course, Easter shifted into the second quarter. Additionally, there was a time lag between our unit case sales and concentrate shipments.","Price mix, meanwhile, was a healthy 3% with good performance across our operating segments. So the way I think about it is we delivered even unit case volume growth and 3% price mix, so we're running at around a 3% trajectory, in line with our full-year organic revenue guidance. And while revenue growth is a key objective, we also intend to do this efficiently, and so the underlying operating margin expansion in the quarter underscores our commitment to value creation.","Now looking around the world, many of our key markets like North America, Europe, Mexico and Japan continue to perform well. We also saw improved performance in China, in part driven by a strong Chinese New Year campaign, and India, while it began the year slowly, performance improved with any remaining impact from the demonetization largely worked through by the end of the quarter. However, consumer demand challenges in Brazil and Venezuela in particular continued to pressure our performance, impacting total company volume growth by over a point in the quarter.","Now, let's turn to the actions we're taking against the five strategic priorities we laid out at CAGNY. These are those that will help us realize our goal of becoming a total beverage company and to deliver our long term financial targets. Namely, one, accelerate growth of the consumer-centric brand portfolio. Second, drive revenue growth. Third, strengthen the system. Fourth, digitize the enterprise. And fifth, unlock the power of our people.","So as we've made progress, let me give you a few examples. For our portfolio we continue to broaden and innovate with new product launches, reformulations of existing products to reduce added sugar, and acquisitions in on-trend categories like plant-based beverages.","During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of AdeS, the leading soy-based beverage in Latin America and the latest addition to our growing juice, dairy and plant category cluster. This adds to a list of successful acquisitions, including Jugos del Valle, Santa Clara, and Tonicorp that are building a strong presence in this nutrition-focused portfolio.","Within our hydration cluster we continue to expand our premium smartwater brand, driving double-digit volume growth for this brand in Europe, and building off smartwater sparkling's early success in both the U.S. and the U.K., we will soon be launching flavored sparkling smartwater in GB.","In the sparkling soft drink category, we're working to drive top-line growth through innovation and reformulation. For example, we've seen the excellent results for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. I told you at CAGNY, we'd be expanding this new and improved formula, supported by a new visual identity, to more markets around the world. In the quarter, we rolled this out to 11 of our top markets, resulting in double-digit volume growth for the brand. By the end of the second quarter, we expect to be in five more markets, with the intent to be in most of our top markets by the end of the year.","We're also targeting the adult sparkling mixer categories, a key growth opportunity. We feel Schweppes, our premium tonic water, is relevant and appealing to the growing cohort of adult consumers. So starting in Western Europe, we relaunched Schweppes in early April with the intent to roll out to other markets in Latin America, Africa and Asia this year.","In the U.S. we're leveraging our digital capabilities by using data captured through our innovative Freestyle machines to identify new variants and flavors popular with consumers. As a consequence, during the quarter we began bottling Sprite Cherry and Sprite Cherry Zero as the first national launch of new beverages in response to their popularity on Freestyle.","Finally, we're looking to add functional benefits where applicable. In Japan we have launched new zero sugar products fortified with fiber, like Coca-Cola Plus and Canada Dry Plus in the fast-growing segment, where ingredients are added to beverages to address specific dietary needs.","So these actions, along with others, are part of growing our consumer-centric brand portfolio. Of course, generating revenue and profits for the whole portfolio, new and existing, requires having the right package offering at the right price in the right channel, and that starts with a deep understanding not just of the consumer, but the shopper's needs.","For example, in Brazil, we are in the midst of resetting our price pack architecture to hit key price points as consumers' purchasing power has decreased during the country's worst economic contraction. While we are still in early days, we expect by the end of the year, the actions we are taking will return our Brazil business to growth.","So having the right portfolio is critical, but so is having the best-in-class market execution to support it. To date this year, we have already achieved several milestones in strengthening our system across Africa, Asia, and the U.S. During the quarter, we reached definitive agreement with ABI on its stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. We are now working through the necessary regulatory approvals and expect to close these transactions around the end of the year. As previously announced, we plan to hold these bottling territories temporarily until they can be refranchised to other partners.","Also earlier this month, we refranchised the majority of our company and bottling operations in China to strong local partners. And our two largest bottlers in Japan completed their merger.","Finally, in the U.S. we closed several transactions in the quarter, and on the 1 of April, swapped our Southwest operating unit, comprised principally of Texas, for a 20% stake in Arca Continental beverage business.","At CAGNY I also talked about the need to create a new, leaner, more agile operating model to enable this growth strategy going forward, which included anticipating the structure of our business post-refranchising. And that to capture fully the opportunity before us, we need to become more category focused to outweigh resources to innovation, IT and digital.","So we've made some changes. We've created one new position in the center and elevated two others.","Firstly, the new Chief Growth Officer. He will have a clear leadership mandate for global growth across category clusters with marketing, customer, commercial leadership and strategy all reporting into this position. I've asked Francisco Crespo, previously President of our Mexico business unit, to take on this opportunity. Under Francisco's leadership, our Mexico business has shown remarkable strength, driving growth within our existing portfolio, expanding into new categories like value-added dairy, and building a healthy direct to consumer route to market. He is the right person to drive greater connectivity across our business, enabling our growth in each of the five category clusters.","Innovation will be critical to our goal for a consumer-centric brand portfolio. We have a need for hundreds of new products and continued evolution of our beverages, packages, ingredients and other areas of our business. To do this, we are separating out R&D and making it a direct report to the CEO. Calling it the Chief Innovation Officer is reflective of the need for greater impact.","Additionally, as part of our work to digitize the enterprise, we elevated the information technology function and our Chief Information Officer role which will now also be a direct report to the CEO.","Lastly, we're working through redesigning the organization to be faster and more agile. When we first laid out the new operating model in February, we were clear that this is about a new way of doing business. It's about creating an environment that can enable growth for long term. We are well on the way to designing the new corporate organization with a clear understanding of what work will stop, what work will shift to other areas and what that means to our people.","As we create a more focused, lean corporate center and broadened enabling services, we expect this will result in approximately 1,200 job reductions beginning in the second half of 2017 and carrying into 2018. While these necessary changes are always very difficult, they will help us to do fewer things better to lead and support our operating units while upholding best-in-class corporate governance.","As a consequence of this new operating model and further productivity opportunities across our entire spend base, we now expect to achieve incremental savings of approximately $800 million. This will bring our current program to $3.8 billion, or $4.3 billion including the $500 million of productivity that will transfer to our bottling partners due to the accelerated pace of refranchising.","Given the phasing of the initiatives, we expect the majority of the upside to accrue in 2018 and 2019 as we have already included an estimate of the savings we expect to capture in 2017 in the guidance we provided earlier this year.","To the question of how will we use this increased financial flexibility, our goal, and we're clear on this, is long term value creation. So to the extent we see reinvestment opportunities to improve our current revenue run rate through further category expansion, we'll take a disciplined approach to make that happen, but we will make the final determination on reinvestment when we move into the 2018 to 2020 business planning process, as this decision will also depend on economic and currency environment. But based on our current expectations of the opportunities, we expect to reinvest at least half the savings.","So in summary, we are on track with our strategic transformation plan, and as to the remainder of the year, I'm confident we will achieve our full-year outlook and that the actions we are taking today will enable us to deliver margin expansion and higher EPS growth into 2018 and 2019.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. As James mentioned, organic revenue growth was even in the quarter. We also continued divesting company-owned bottling operations which resulted in a 12% decline in comparable net revenues. Price mix benefited from positive package mix with immediate consumption packages outpacing future consumption packages across all operating groups.","Comparable growth margin increased 120 basis points, reflecting strong price mix and the margin benefit from refranchising, partially offset by increased commodity costs and about a 60 basis point currency impact. And comparable operating margins grew nearly 140 basis points as our productivity initiatives remain on track and we sold off lower margin bottling businesses.","Moving to cash flow, we generated $788 million in cash from operations, up 30% driven by the cycling of a pension plan contribution, partially offset by the impact of two fewer days in the quarter and our ongoing refranchising efforts. And we received a $1.4 billion cash inflow from the sale of certain North American and Chinese bottling assets.","For 2017, we increased our annual dividend by 6% to $1.48 per share. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled $836 million dollar, and for the full-year, we expect to achieve the $2 billion in net repurchases as we communicated during our last earnings call. We expect to return approximately $8.4 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases for the year.","Turning to outlook, we continue to expect to deliver 3% organic revenue growth and 7% to 8% underlying profit before tax growth with momentum building throughout the year as our plans gain traction. In addition, we expect our comparable growth and operating margins to expand as we continue to divest lower margin bottling businesses throughout the year.","Due to a strengthening in several currencies including the Mexican peso, we now expect a 3 point currency headwind on profit before tax which is at the low end of our previously provided range. However, currencies continue to be extremely volatile. We remain hedged on the hard currencies, so fluctuations and flat rates will not necessarily impact our P&L to the degree that you might expect. Therefore, we will continue to update you as we move through the year.","As a result, we are tightening the range of our full-year EPS guidance. We now expect comparable EPS to be down 1% to 3% this year as we return to a high-margin, capital-light business model.","As we model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. First, we expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 17 point to 18 point headwind on net revenue and a 3 point to 4 point headwind on profit before tax. And therefore, we expect this to result in greater comparable growth and operating margin expansion than we saw in the first quarter.","Second, we expect that currency will be a 1 point to 2 point headwind on net revenue and a 3 point headwind on profit before taxes.","In closing, we are on track and fully expect to deliver our commitment for 2017. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Operator? Ready for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, we are, sir. We'll now open up the line for questions. And we have Mr. Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and Muhtar, congrats. And James, congrats again on your new roles. I guess a quick clarification, James, and then a broader question just on the clarification. When you talked about the global macros, you sounded a bit more constructive, so I wanted to get a sense because we're hearing from a lot of companies, yes, January and February were tough, but March seemed to have improved not just in the U.S. but globally. So just wanted to get a clarification there.","And the broader question is, as I'm out in the market and talking to the bottlers, there seems to be some concern regarding the focus outside of CSDs. Not that Coke doesn't need to do it, but there's just too much emphasis outside the CSD business where in fact the bottlers make 85% to 90% of the profit from CSDs. So when you speak to them, how do you reconcile that dilemma? Any context around that would be helpful.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Nik. This is Muhtar. Just let me say a few things on the global macros. Then I'll pass it over to James also to reflect on your \u2013 particularly your second question. And I assume the second question you had was mainly talking to U.S. bottlers, but you can clarify that.","The world growth, based on the latest numbers from the IMF or taken from any other organization, is expected to rise in 2017 versus 2016 by about 0.5%, so going from 3.1% to about 3.5%, just under 0.5%, and further expect it to slightly improve in 2018 based on the latest numbers.","Now always what we have seen in our business is that Industrial Production Index, IPI, goes a little bit of ahead of disposable income growth, and that's what we are experiencing once again here. So yes, some countries' growth looks better. China for sure. India, with the impact of the currency exchange initiative still is moving out of that, as James mentioned. And as well as Brazil and Venezuela I think we can term as being in deep recession. And then geopolitical factors in the Middle East and part of North Africa probably means the balance of risks remains still tilted to the downside, if you like.","But there was a divergence in terms of the Consumer Confidence Index since 2014, and that's narrowing down between the developing world and the developed world, which is a positive that. That means the developing world is getting a little better from a confidence index point of view, and I think we're seeing that in parts of Africa, like particularly big markets in Nigeria. Again, our business in China also is reflecting the improved macros.","And then we still see growth in Japan, Korea, in the industrial markets, which is a very positive sign, again, as the emerging and developing markets get better. We see there's still growth coming from the developed markets as in Western Europe and Japan and Korea. So that's sort of what I'd like to just say on the macros. James, go ahead and...","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Thanks, Muhtar. So, Nik, I think particularly, as your question seemed more U.S. oriented, in the end this is an and answer. Our objective is not to run from one side of the ship to the other. This is an and answer.","We need the company and the bottlers individually and collectively to make both work, and I think the U.S. is an example where we have a vibrantly growing revenue line for sparkling and a vibrantly growing revenue line for the other categories. We're engaging the consumers. We're improving our execution. So I think it's about growth. It's about expanding and responding to consumer and customer needs, and I think we have demonstrated over the last number of years that we can vibrantly grow both. And that is absolutely our strategy going forward. And that'll be good for us, and it'll be good for the bottlers.","Operator","Next we have Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Heard it down at CAGNY and then again today that you're focused on becoming even more of a total beverage company, but it seems like it will be difficult to transform your revenue mix quickly or substantially from an organic standpoint. So A, I was just hoping for any thoughts on how quickly you can shift the business mix over the next few years. Maybe what your ultimate vision is, whether that's percent of sales mix outside of sparkling or mix in low sugar products versus today?","However, you'd define it or however you think about the topic? I'll leave that up to you. And then second, how big a part do you think M&A will play? Because clearly that's a way of more rapidly shifting your portfolio? And then within that M&A theme, Coke staying within beverages I think has been sacrosanct at the company historically. How open would you be or what are your thoughts on potentially acquiring outside of beverages? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks, Dara. And I'll probably go with the M&A and then the portfolio question. Obviously we're not going to comment on our outlook on likely M&A. I think we've said three things related to M&A in the past, and I would reunderline them.","One, anything we do needs to fit strategically in where we're trying to go. Secondly, it needs to be financially attractive, and that's not always the case. And third, there is some degree of opportunism, because it takes two to tango. You need not just a willing acquirer, you need a willing seller.","So I think whilst we have an ongoing view of what assets are out there, small, medium and large that are attractive to us, of course that is something that is not predictable in time. So whilst we imagine we will continue to do bolt-on acquisitions, everything else is not \u2013 you can't predicate your strategy necessarily on that. So we focus on driving what we can organically. We have taken the rest of the portfolio, outside of sparkling, from a single digit piece of our business at the turn of \u2013 when 10, 15 years ago to over a quarter of the business.","Of course, we would love to increase the run rate at which we broaden our portfolio, and we will certainly seeking to do so. But the law of big numbers is also true. It's not going to magically change overnight. We need to build winning propositions with the consumers, with the customers, and build the physical infrastructure that economically makes that happen in a profitable way.","So yes, more acceleration outside of sparkling. While, and I turn to the answer to the previous question, it's an and (30:13), continuing to grow the revenue of the sparkling category, and therefore we will consecutively broaden out where we get to. At some point, will it be more balanced? Absolutely. Will it be broader? Absolutely. But we will look to do the right things at the right pace.","Operator","Next we have Mr. Steve Powers from UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","James, maybe you could just round that out by talking about just firstly, the cost side of that organic growth push? We talk a lot about the objective, which I think we all agree with, but what's the cost side? Will structural investments and growth in new categories have to accelerate? And if so, for how long?","But my broader question was actually with respect to the leadership appointments and really the new operating model that you've announced over the last few months. Can you talk more about just how the day-to-day work is to be impacted and improved as a result?","And specifically, what Francisco's role as Chief Growth Officer is going to look like? Maybe how large his organization is going to be? How he's going to interface with the other Group Presidents et cetera? Because I guess at some level, I have always thought of the CEO of Coke as the Chief Growth Officer. So maybe just talk about why separating that function out as a dedicated role I think at the group president level, is set up to structurally improve things? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. I'm not sure that obeys the dynamic of one question at a time, but I'll give it a go and cover off some of those pieces.","On the categories and balancing, of course, as we push into new brands or new categories in new countries, there is an investment curve as you build the brand. But this needs to be a managed portfolio. I mean one \u2013 the fact that a new brand is being launched in country X doesn't mean it's not already developed in country Y. And therefore it's already profitable and generating cash. So we need to manage the total portfolio effect, which is not just across categories, but across the life stage development of any one brand and category across the world, because they're not equally developed everywhere. So there's a portfolio management thing.","Of course our objective, whatever the category, is to build brands and positions that are inherently profitable once we get to the appropriate scale. So we're not trying to build things that will never arrive. We're trying to build brands and categories whether it's inherent in the brand or inherent in the package size that can be profitable for us and the bottling system.","In terms of the leadership appointments and how the work will be impacted. I mean we've done a number of things. I mean a lot of the impact on the work is, it's the nexus of we're about to enter the post refranchising stage. So we're going to go from well over 100,000 employees to under 40,000 employees by some point next year. There is just physically less stuff that needs to get done at the corporate center to support that organization.","Secondly, technology keeps advancing. And what is possible to anticipate and get done using technology and change the way work can be done is a lot more today than it was a number of years ago. We need to embed that in the organization.","And then the third thing is the ongoing effort to find new ways of doing the same thing with less resources, or getting more bang for the buck, because we can be innovative in the way we run our processes. So that goes across each of the corporate functions, including the enabling transactions based services. And there's a plan in each place.","Now as it relates to Francisco and that organization. I think one of the \u2013 the two points that I base our logic to. The first one is, if our principal operating model is local and geographic because it's a franchise system. I mean you've got to choose one principal avenue to organize against. Anything you organize against will have its blind spot, and then you can mitigate against that. So one of the roles of Francisco's group is to provide the global perspective and the category perspective, because it's the inverse. It's a thing that some of the field might miss. So that's part of why the corporate center exists.","The second reason to bring all the pieces together is as brands and experiences are created today and into the future, it's less cleanly delineated between a TV ad or a customer program or anything else. There's a much greater intersection and integration of how to engage your consumers and shoppers. And therefore bringing together in one group the classical marketing pieces with the customer piece, with the commercial piece and with the strategy, underpinned with a digital engagement, is what can allow us to more seamlessly operate in this new environment.","Operator","Next we have Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning. How are you?","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about Brazil. I know you've talked about addressing price pack architecture and trying to hit key price points, but it just looks like the downdraft in Latin America has significantly worsened this quarter. And I know, again, you said better by the end of the year, but are these kind of technical changes, longer term strategic changes in Brazil that you're making? And any kind of detail would really be helpful. Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. So I think the changes are structural and strategic. We need to reset the price pack architecture. We're going to use more returnables. That's an infrastructure and investment challenge. So we're resetting.","It's worth remembering that the contraction in the Brazilian economy \u2013 it's contracted more in the last few years than it contracted in the last decade of the 1980s, and more than it contracted in the depression in the 1920s last century. So Brazil has undergone a major economic contraction. So we're resetting what we're doing in Brazil around pack price architecture, how we go to the market and how we push that forward. So it will take some time to get it in place, and also, frankly, the stabilization of the Brazilian economy will continue to take time.","Now, the other thing impacting the Latin America numbers, it's worth underlining that it doesn't always hit everyone's radar screen, is Venezuela. And Venezuela is substantially negative in the first quarter, and I think that really is macroeconomic. It's not about resetting our business. It's about the country is in the state it's in.","But the Brazilian thing, just to summarize \u2013 the changes are strategic. They'll take some time. We expect that to play through this year.","Operator","Next we have Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So I do have two questions. One is on the cost savings. Excellent that it went up. I want to better understand the drivers of change, and I also want to better understand the drivers of the increase. But I also want to better understand the \"long term value creation\" that you mentioned as well as at this point we expect to \"reinvest at least half.\" Is that of the incremental? Or is that of the $3.8 billion total? Or $4.3 billion total? Is it of the $3.8 billion at least? Because you've cut about $2 billion so far, it sounds like you should be roughly on pace to that in short order at the very least, and almost all of that I think has been reinvested. So if you take almost $2 billion on a $3.8 billion, that's already $1.5 billion.","So how much of what's going to be on the come, so to speak, what's going forward, will be reinvested? Is that going to be at least half? Or is that of the total program? So very specific question on that. And then second thing is around refranchising, and if you can talk a little bit about some of the potential delays that may happen in refranchising? If you see anything going forward? Or if that's very much on plan?","And importantly, if you see the benefit so far of the refranchised territories from an improvement and performance perspective? Volumetrically, perhaps? But even just overall top line? We've heard on the order of one point as you move from company-owned to noncompany-owned, so would love some inkling of that from your own experiences. Thanks. Sorry for the two.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. So starting with the additional $800 million, the driver of the change, the principal driver, is the reorganization of the corporate center, the 1,200 positions I talked about. That's the majority of the $800 million, or a little over half the $800 million. Then there's some parts in cost of goods and a little bit in marketing.","So the majority is in operating expense and in the reorganization of the corporate organization that I just talked about. So that's what's driving it, and it's about the three things I've said. It's anticipating post refranchising, it's the impact of technology and it's the choices on what work we do and doing the work differently. That's what's driving the extra $800 million.","Now, the comment around reinvesting half was related to the $800 million very specifically. So that's that one. Obviously, we've seen some margin expansion. Implicit in our guidance this year already is some dropping of the base productivity program through into margin because you'll calculate that the revenue currency-neutral structural is at the three, and whether you take operating income is substantially higher than that. And then obviously that's offset by some negative financing leverage.","So 2014, 2015 and 2016, I think you're largely right. In 2017 you're seeing much more drop into operating leverage, and the comment is about the $800 million going forward. A little over half is reinvested.","As it relates to refranchising, we still believe we can meet the deadline and get the U.S. refranchised this year. Of course, we're not going to do the wrong deals for the sake of hitting a date, but we think the right deals are possible. And we think that we're still on track with that plan, and as you say, we're seeing benefits in the refranchised territories.","I'm not sure I would give a specific number that can be kind of inserted over the top on everything else, but clearly the idea of reorienting and rebuilding the U.S. system so that it's stronger, putting in place the different pieces, the manufacturing, the governance, the IT, the way the system works, support our long-term strategy of rational pricing and some growth for continued revenue growth in U.S. is underpinned by the success of the refranchisings in the U.S. And obviously we closed out on the 1 of April China and the merger of the Japanese bottlers.","Operator","Next we have Laurent Grandet from Credit Suisse.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone. You specified the sales growth by cluster, and that's great to give us some more granularity of where the growth is coming from. If I may, could you tell us more specifically what's your starting point by revenue, by cluster, by region? And also what are your goals by cluster? And what will be the incentive for the new Chief Growth Officer to achieve those goals?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","So firstly, Laurent, I hate to disappoint you, but we're not going to be disclosing the starting point or breakdown the geographic groups as well by cluster and have all of that laid out.","The goals by cluster \u2013 clearly, we have goals by cluster. The more they move from sparkling, the more they move from the things we've been building over the last 15 years, the faster we expect the percentage growth rate, but in absolutes, it is worth remembering that sparkling still in absolute terms provides the greatest incremental amount of revenue to the corporation of any one category.","As I said, just let me make a detailed point that growth obviously \u2013 we're not moving to an operating model where we're having global category P&Ls and running the business through global category P&Ls. The operating model is to run the business locally, to drive local entrepreneurship and empowerment of the operating unit.","But to use the growth opportunity setup to be strategic to make sure that we stay connected to what's happening when you take a top down perspective or a categories perspective and have the rights and some authority on bringing those insights and those needs and those initiatives to the table so that when we as a corporation \u2013 we're not going to try and run everything for the operating units, but we will make a few strategic bets. And some of those will be driven from the cluster approach.","Operator","Next we have Mr. Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. I'm sorry. Our next question is from Ms. Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. So one is just a quick follow-up to earlier question about reinvestment. The $800 million, half of that going back to reinvestment. How would the nature of these reinvestments differ versus sort of the prior reinvestment that Coke has made? Whether it's different categories, or different activities? Just a little bit color there would be great.","And then on the price mix in the quarter in North America sparkling up 1%, I think you called out some timing issues. So can you elaborate on how much of that was a factor? And as it relates to sort of the broader price mix question, if you look at the clusters outside of sparkling, can you just talk about how much the price mix plays a role in growing those segments' revenues?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Good morning, Judy. So I think that the principal difference on the reinvestment of the half of the $800 million is up to now, I would say the majority of what we've done has gone into the sparkling category business around the world. I think here the clear intent is that this is more directed to some of the newer categories, or some of the other categories to drive growth there. So it is principally orientated around growth of the other categories. That's the headline answer there.","Then in terms of the North American sparkling pricing. As you say, as we call that, that's principally timing and it's really related to the different channels. The price, the \u2013 obviously we have a large fountain operation which we run directly in North America, and so the timing of gallon shipments, whether they go through the bottlers or through the fountain business, can move the average price mix by North America. And it's the timing around those gallons that has created that unusually lower 1%, and that's the majority of the difference between what we would expect to happen on sparkling pricing and what actually you see in the first quarter in North America, and that should correct itself.","Operator","And next we have Mr. Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just one question. And I guess from our perspective we get a lot of questions about the total beverage company model and what it looks like going forward, and it's difficult to see with a lot of the moving parts in the business today. But I guess from our perspective, Western Europe is really the one market or is one of the markets this year where you can really see it sort of in action.","So, A, James, do you agree with that? And, B, can you maybe talk a little bit more about sort of your planning with the bottlers in Western Europe this year? And sort of how it's \u2013 this total beverage company model has really sort of been a difference in the planning process now versus maybe prior years?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yes. Look, I don't think I would say this is a kind of a night and day change for us. Look, we've been on a journey to expand our portfolio. I think this is about making a commitment to press further and faster and make the full psychological journey to. This is about a full set of categories and responding to the consumer, not a central portfolio with some periphery.","We're making good progress with the Coca-Cola European partners. Obviously there we did a lot of planning last year at the setup of the new bottler and its integration and the plans for the marketplace.","I think you've seen a number of actions, whether it's the rolling out of smartwater, the launch of Honest Tea, where we've taken some proactive steps with them in different categories. But also I would underline we've been very proactive with European partners on Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which drove a lot of growth in GB in this quarter. So we've got a great new bottler that's been stood up. We're broadening the portfolio. We're taking action across more categories, and I think that's part of the future.","Now, would I say that's the one place to look at? No. I think if you look at the U.S. or Japan, to take two other examples, you see a broader portfolio, and us continuing to invest and expand across categories and even within categories, re-segmenting each category for multiple different reasons to drive value growth for ourselves, the bottlers and collectively as a system.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Kevin Grundy from Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","James, I wanted to come back to some of the changes you put in place, specifically with the new Growth Officer and five category clusters. The first question would be, when should investors expect to see tangible benefits from the new structure? Understanding that the macro is very difficult and the company's skew towards sparkling. Or said differently, would you be disappointed if the company couldn't return to 4% core sales growth looking out to next year, even if the environment doesn't change very much, including the macro? Or is this just more of an evolution of the strategy to deliver on the company's objectives?","And then related to that, James, do you feel like the company has the right incentive structure in place internally for your leadership to balance the growth agenda with profit objectives? Or do you see any potential conflict that may exist there? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning, Kevin. I'll go in reverse order. The incentive structure is balanced between the top line and the bottom line today. Having said that, we're going to take this year to have a fundamental relook at our total compensation approach. That may result in no changes whatsoever. We may end up going, no, there's no perfect solution, and the one we've got is the right one. Or we may make some tweaks. That is yet to be determined. But it is worth noting the incentives are half top line, effectively, and half bottom line.","In terms of the tangible benefits we're obviously not going to provide guidance for 2018 and 2019 and beyond at this stage. Having said that, we've been pretty clear that we want to be in a long-term growth model in terms of the top line and have some leverage within that. So to the extent that we've guided for 3% this year, we would be disappointed if the opportunities in the marketplace and the macros offered us an opportunity to get back into our range, and we did not achieve it.","Operator","And our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","One question, James. On the larger subject of cost cutting and whether it's $800 million or some added number a year from now or three years from now, could you just characterize how far you believe the organization has gone and might yet go in the area of budgeting costs? Whether it's on a ZBB basis or some other basis to help us understand how you think about the opportunity to do what you're doing today as a habit, so to speak, versus something you do day one, so to speak, as a new CEO?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. We've been steadily learning and getting better at zero-based work over the last number of years. I think we've been getting better at doing less one-off events that then don't necessarily always stick. And getting much better at making it part of our discipline of going, how do we use the resources available to the best means possible to get the results we're after? So I think that's been a steady organizational learning process that's been going on.","And the latest changes are just another iteration. The $800 million is another iteration of that. Every year we look at it. At the back end of last year we looked at the strategy evolution coming up, imagining the post-refranchised world, the impact of technology. And we just considered what we could do and how we could do things differently, and that's reflected in the strategy. And as part of the strategy it's reflected in the organizational changes we are making and the increased productivity savings.","We will continue to run the zero-based work process, and be clear that the efficient use of resources is one of the ways to drive the top line and to enable long term value creation.","Operator","And our next question is from Amit Sharma from BMO.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning, Amit.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","A couple of quick questions. Number one, James, can you clarify your comments about M&A? You talked about bolt-ons are always in play, and then I think you didn't rule out if something larger, bigger came along, you would look at it. That's number one. And number two, from our retailers, you're hitting a lot more focus on pricing and maybe more promotion, private label. Are you hearing anything different from the retailers about price rationality that we have seen in the CSD category? Just to rule out that that's not at risk here in North America.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Well, on M&A we have a track record of doing bolt-on acquisitions over the years. I think there should be a reasonable expectation that they will continue at some sort of similar rate. Larger opportunities I think obey the logic of they have to be strategic, they have to be financially viable and they have to be available. As and when things meet those three criteria, we will look harder at them and that's as much as I can say at this stage.","In terms of retailers in the U.S. Look, I think they are looking, they have their \u2013 each one has their own strategies, their own positions slightly differently, so I don't think one can look at them in an aggregate and say they're all trying to do the same thing. I think pricing rationalization is certainly our strategy. We're engaged with customers in, you know, how it fits their strategies, each one individually. And largely I would say that you know, we're finding how to create value together. Are there risks that for comparative reasons by customers or competitive reasons by our competitors, something happens in some quarters to knock that off course. Yes. But that risk has existed, and still exists. But we're clear on where we're trying to get to.","Operator","And our next question is from Mr. Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks, guys. Two questions. Within your clusters, can you talk about where you have scale or the ability to lift and shift as sub-category from one country or region to another? Where you see the most work needed? And then maybe as a reference for us, can you talk about the evolution of profitability in juice as you built that out to a global leadership position? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. I think, look, in \u2013 we talked at CAGNY, we have about a 50% share of the sparkling category, and of all the other categories we're somewhere between a 10% and 15% share on a global basis. But even that's a very average number. You know, you can go to some parts of the world and we are clear market leaders, at the same sort of share levels that we have in sparkling, and other parts of the world, we are not present.","So there's not a short answer, except to say that we have \u2013 we are going through, and have gone through, and always update the process of looking at where are the next stages of growth both bottom up, each country going, look, I think I need to go to grow out this category or that category. And top down, both a global view and the category view saying look, if we want to progress, actually, we think we need to push out smartwater into more countries or tea, for example, Honest Tea into more countries and that's the intersection of the global growth perspective and the country perspective.","And then evolution of profitability in juice. Probably depends whether we built the business through bolt-on acquisitions or whether we did it from scratch. Either way, the evolution is as you'd expect, as we build a good either leadership position or a close number two, we tend to come into a much more attractive profitability status which is why if we have small positions in categories, we've either got to get up or have a clear path to leadership or a some number two, or not over invest because being sub scale is not a part of profitability.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for any closing remarks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you. I think James is going to do them this time. So thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, operator.

First apologizes that for the stat of my voice I have a cold, so please bear with me. I'm going to start with some highlights from our first quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions, we laid out last October to reignite growth. ","Finally, I will touch on our outlook for the remainder of the year, before I turn the call over to Cathy. To take you through more details on the financial results. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased to report early momentum in the beginning of 2015, a year of transition for the company. We delivered promising first quarter results, especially in light of the significant macroeconomic volatility in many regions around the world and the productivity and rewiring initiatives we are implementing this year.","For those of you following our Webcast, you can see our quarterly performance scorecard on Slide 4. Our performance was largely driven by the strength of our global brand portfolio and the strong distribution capabilities of our bottling partners as evidence by our continued global value share gains and NARTB, sparkling beverages as well as still beverages in the quarter. ","While certain markets face significant currency devaluation economic slowdown or political unrest, our focus on improving our execution enabled us to deliver overall solid results. We grew our top line and bottom line due to initially improvements in the underlying business, the timing of Easter and six extra days in our fiscal quarter. Importantly, net revenues grew 8% on an organic basis driven by the extra selling days and positive 3% price mix globally while it\u2019s still early in the year we are pleased with the 3% global price mix and the 2% price mix in North America both ahead of full year 2014 results. This price mix is the result of disciplined implementation of our price back channel strategies which is a key and consistent portion of our long term approach to creating value for consumers, customers, bottlers and ourselves. ","Productivity initiatives, [benign] commodity cost and favorable product mix in key markets grew gross and operating margin improvement. As we continue to invest substantially behind advertising leading to double-digit increase in marketing spend. The bottom line result was double-digit growth in comparable currency neutral income before tax. ","Now turning to the five strategic actions we laid out for this year. One of our key strategic initiatives is making disciplined brand and growth investments. As mentioned earlier we increased our media investments double-digits in the quarter as we work towards fully funded brand plan in markets around the world while at the same time enhancing the quality of our advertising. Great example of this is the new Coca-Cola marketing campaign during the Chinese New Year which helped our China business grow brand Coca-Cola volume 9% despite slowing economic conditions. ","As we\u2019ve said previous media investments take about 12 to 24 months to realize their full value. So while we are seeing initial positive results, we even more encouraged by the knowledge that is still early in the process and we have tremendous runway for continued improvement in our top-line growth. We remain resolutely focused on driving cost out of the business and embedding a culture of productivity into our DNA which is enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments. This change in culture is reflected in incorporating zero base work processes into all phases of our annual planning cycles. We remained on track across all spend areas to deliver more than $0.5 billion in savings this year and 3 billion in annualized savings by 2019. ","The difficult, but necessary changes made during the end of 2014 are now accounted for in our budgets and tied to our objectives and goals. The initial implementation of our new operating model is on track and the previously announced headcount reductions associated with this change are well underway. We\u2019re continuing to work through the rewiring of business processes within the entire organization. So for example we\u2019ve eliminated a layer in many of our functions at the group levels in different geographies and linked our corporate center directly to our business units.","In R&D this means connecting our corporate R&D efforts directly to our global development centers and linking both of these to service our business across -- business units across the world. So this allows us to scale our efforts in innovation, share new developments faster and accelerate development of new products. ","In addition, we\u2019re also rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, to drive efficiency and effectiveness. This will allow us to better leverage learnings from similar markets regardless of the geographic location and improve the quality of our advertising through our networked marketing model. Great example of this is how we are strategically leveraging the 100th anniversary of our Contour Coca-Cola bottle to drive our business forward through integrating marketing, commercial and innovation under one umbrella to reach approximately 140 markets.","This campaign centers of the magic of drinking a coke with the emphasis on the experience as much as the bottle and as such it\u2019s focused on driving profitable immediate consumption packages and purchase transactions. And as part of this campaign our system is investing in glass bottles all around the world while introducing the next generation Contour PET bottle and expanding the supply of our premium aluminum bottles in key developed markets. ","Importantly, this is not simply a global campaign, rather it\u2019s a new way of networked marketing that has led to the creation of 20 marketing assets that markets can use leverage in more cost effective modular manner. Some of our markets will leverage the campaign throughout the year while others quarter-by-quarter. As a result we have significantly been able to reduce our production and development cost per gross rating point allowing more dollars to be focused against the consumer.","We're seeing initial positive results for the marketing that have already launched the campaigns such as South Africa, Australia and Latin Center. Across the entire company our deeper markets segmentation strategy is also starting to yield early results. Two examples are North America and India here. In North America we're focused on generating revenue through a greater reliance on price realization, increased media investments coupled with our segmented price pack strategies drove revenue growth in our sparking portfolio through a strong 3% price mix and a 1% increase in transactions. Simply put more consumers are enjoying our products more often and are increasingly choosing smaller packages including our iconic Contour bottle. ","Where as in India where our revenue growth strategy is focused on expanding distribution and recruiting new consumers we drove double-digit unit case volume growth in both our sparkling as well as still portfolio. Turning to our focus on our core business model we continue to make progress on our North America refranchising efforts in the quarter. First, we remain on track with our previously announced territory transfers to existing partners. During the quarter we transitioned four territories to Coco-Cola consolidated and are on track to transfer additional territories in Kentucky and Tennessee to consolidated and current Coco-Cola client this year.","We are slightly ahead of schedule to close the previously announced transactions with new entrance into our bottling network. So territory transfers to both Troy Taylor in Central Florida and Reyes Holdings in Chicago are slated to close in the second quarter. Together the territories pending to transition to these two new partners will represent approximately 5% of U.S. bottle\\can volume. ","Finally, just this morning we announced the signing of new letters of intent with the existing bottling partners for territories covering more than 5% of bottle\\can volume. In aggregate territories transitioned to date and those covered by definitive agreements or letters of intent represent the little over 15% of total U.S. bottle\\can volume. Further as we continue to transition territories with are getting better and faster, which is why we are confident that our previously stated time line to have two thirds of bottle\\can volume distributed by our independent bottling partners by 2017 is very much on track.","Looking outside of North America, we closed our joint venture in Coco Cola Amatil, Indonesia in early April. I was in Jakarta earlier this year with the Indonesian bottler to celebrate this new venture. This investment will help us capture the growth opportunity in one of the largest and most dynamic countries in the world as we enable our system to be even more responsive to consumer and customer needs. ","So, we are off to a solid start in 2015 and we are on track to deliver against our full year of currency neutral EPS expectation of mid-single digit growth. Importantly, I'm encouraged by the progress we have made and we remain confident that we have the right strategies in place to create sustainable shareholder value.","However there is still much work ahead of us, we continue to expect that the benefits from the announce initiatives will take time to fully materialize. Further we are operating in a very challenging environment, the cautious recovery in the U.S. is offset by our relatively sluggish expansion in Europe and Japan as well as weaknesses in emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia, as well as China slowing down. Therefore we remain cautious in our outlook, so we will continue to focus on what we can control and execute against our strategic initiatives to emerge stronger and better positioned to capture growth in the global nonalcoholic beverage industry. ","I would now pass the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as update on our outlook on our business for 2015.","Kathy Waller","Thank you, Muhtar. And good morning everyone. As I'm going to spend few minutes discussing the quarter and then our outlook for 2015 as Muhtar just stated. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the quarter and encouraged by some of the early signs of success. Our positive pricing continues as we focus on driving revenue in the marketplace and our reinvestment in brand Coco Cola is staring to yield results.","Focusing on the quarter, organic revenue growth was driven by 5% growth in concentrate shipment and 3 points to positive price mix. The concentrate shipment growth benefitted from the six extra days in the period. These extra days will reverse in the fourth quarter so you will see a corresponding impact in that period. After adjusting for the six extra days in this quarter concentrate shipments lag in many cases primarily due to the timing of shipments in our international markets. For the full year we expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases.","Consolidated price mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our markets. In addition, we benefited from positive geographic mix as markets where shipments lagged recorded unit cases were in lower revenue per CSE market. As we move through the year I\u2019d like to remind you of a couple of points. ","First we will begin to cycle better underlying pricing and second as we catch up from the timing up of shipments in international markets we will see negative pressure from geographic mix at the consolidated levels. Therefore while we remain resolutely focused on driving revenue in our market we do expect price mix to moderate from the current level. Our comparable growth margins improved about 75 basis points on a consolidated basis. This increase is driven primarily by better margins in North America due to positive pricing and business mix as well as moderately lower commodity cost. ","As we think about the remainder of the year we will also expect many of these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparison. Therefore our full year outlook on gross margins has not changed from our prior guidance. ","Comparable currency neutral operating leverage came in better than anticipated in the quarter primarily due the strong growth in gross profit driven by the facts I just mentioned. Comparable currency neutral income before tax grew 13%. The combined impact of structural items and the provision in Venezuela resulted in a three point headwind on income before tax which was consistent with our previous outlook. ","Our first quarter comparable EPS was $0.48 which included a six point currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis our EPS grew 15% in the quarter. The six point currency headwind was slightly less than our original expectations primarily due to the benefit from foreign exchange gains associated with the euros denominated debt issued during the quarter. ","Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the early extinguishment of certain long-term debt, cost associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program and charges related to our Venezuelan operations. ","As many of you know the Venezuela government introduced a new floating exchange rate mechanism call SIMADI in mid-February. We re-measured our bol\u00edvar-denominated net monitory asset at the end of the first quarter using the new SIMADI floating exchange rate of approximately 193 bol\u00edvar to the dollar and translated our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars using that same rate.","We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, up 72% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital, the impact of six additional days and the timing of capital expenditure and it\u2019s partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rate. ","We returned $1.8 billion to shareholder in the form of dividend and net share repurchases during the quarter which is reflective of our commitment to return cash to shareowners. ","In 2015 we increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.32 per share and it\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019ve increased our dividend every year for more than half a country. Turning to outlook, while we are encouraged by some of the early signs of success it is still early in the year and global economic growth remains constrained by challenges in many markets as evidenced in regions like Brazil, Russia and China. Therefore we are maintaining our underlying full year currency neutral growth expectations as previously provided. However we are updating expected impacts from structural items and currency. ","During our last call we said we expected the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to close in early Q2. We now expect closing to happen in later half of the second quarter as the parties are working to satisfy contractual closing considerations. However distribution of Monster products in the U.S. has already began transition into the KO system. ","Finally, we are slightly ahead of schedule on close in the U.S. territory transfer to Troy Taylor and Reyes Holdings. We now estimate that the net impact of structural items on full year 2015 results will be a slight headwind our net revenue growth with no material change to our prior outlook on income before tax. ","Therefore consistent with what we said in February for the full year 2015 we continue to expect mid-single digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth. However, we do see a slight change in the impact from currency exchange rates.","After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates we now expect an approximately six point currency headwind on net revenue and approximate 10 point currency headwind on operating income and approximate seven point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. The currency impact on income before tax remains roughly the same as our previous outlook. As the foreign exchange gains associated with our euro denominated debt issued this quarter is offset by the effects from translating our bolivar-denominated profit as the SIMADI exchange rate as well as the continued decline in several emerging and developing market currencies.","So when modeling the second quarter there are couple of phasing items you should consider. The timing of Easter benefitted the first quarter this year, while it benefitted the second quarter of last year. We expect structural items to be roughly neutral impact on net revenue and a 1 point to 2 point headwinds of income before tax. And then finally, we currently expect currency would be an approximate 7 point headwind on net revenue and an approximate 10 point headwind on operating income and a 5 point to 6 point headwind on income before tax in the second quarter as we cycle most favorable rates from the prior year. The variance between the currency headwind and operating income and net income before tax is primarily due to that foreign exchange gains associated with our euro debt. ","In closing we are cautiously optimistic about the progress we see in the business, which gives us increased confidence that our strategies and actions of working. With that said it is still early days in a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and amid a volatile and challenging operating environment. But we absolutely believe that the Coco Cola company is best position to capture growth in nonalcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders."," Operator we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. ","Bryan Spillane","So, just I guess as we look at this quarter it just seem like some of the things that you laid out at the beginning of the year that were within your control have tracked inline maybe even a little bit better than expected, sounds like the refranchising and North America\u2019s pacing maybe a little faster, closing the Monster transaction is taking a little bit longer and it sounds like you are sort of tracking pretty well in terms of cost savings and redeploying or spending more on marketing.","I guess when we think about the factors that are outside of your control which would be I guess some of the macro factors, the change in the Venezuela exchange rates, how some of the markets are moving and not sure if you have a great sense for maybe what's worse or what's better, so if you can maybe just sort of lay out for us versus where you were earlier this year when you initially gave us guidance in kind of what's better and what's worth, specially focusing on some of the things that are outside of your control?","Muhtar Kent ","So, Bryan it's Muhtar here. Good morning again. So in North America, I\u2019ll start with North America. I would say that the outlook appears to be trending a little positive, raising hopes that potential ways growth and lower fuel prices could translate into consumer spending. In Latin America, Mexico's the best way I would say is relatively stable and continues to track closer to the Unites States because they are so closely linked.","Brazil continues to deteriorate faster than we expected, I would say that. Venezuela continues to increase as a concern given to increase -- the growing difficulty on maintaining supply in the market place. And Argentina just continues to be challenging and Columbia is again as the kind of the star in Latin America in terms of performance and macro conditions. So in Europe I think there are also some green shoots on the back of [indiscernible], but its early days, that just started.","But deflation still remains a concerned this year and overall consumer spending in Europe I would say is still sluggish as it will take time for I think monitory easing to flow to the consumer pockets and translate into increased consumer spending. And then risk to recover remains a still volatile environment and then off course you got the possible Greece exit issue still lingering on. In Eurasia and Africa, Russia continues to see significant challenges, the Russian consumer and we expected it to continue to remain challenging throughout the year this year. ","[Sub-Saharan] in Africa is a strong bright spot and we're seeing that in our results and then Middle-East we've got some pockets where it's defined geopolitical environment, but overall obviously increased geopolitical risk there. And then in Asia and Pacific-China continues it\u2019s -- the disposal incomes, consumer spending, CFE in China continues to decelerate we saw that happening in Q1 versus the stated GDP of 7%, Japan remains sluggish I'd say similar to Europe although we are starting to see some green shoots in the economy and finally in Asia-Pacific India continues to be a bright spot I\u2019d say inside the brick in markets, the four brick market.","So, though that's a sort of walk through in terms of -- and then the commodity environment again talking about what we can control and what we can\u2019t, remains fairly benign, compared to previous years, stable and benign. And so given that value growth for us is highly correlated to PCE growth and I hope I\u2019ve been able to give you a sort of quick walk through what\u2019s good and what not so good and what\u2019s more stable.","Bryan Spillane","That\u2019s very helpful Muhtar, thank you and I didn\u2019t mean to have you talk so long, your voice is definitely under some pressure this morning. Kathy, if I can just -- one follow up on the commodity piece, the comparisons were little bit better in the first quarter, just looking forward is there anything that we should be looking at that could make it maybe more favorable as the year goes on? Like how much of it is locked in I guess and how much of it might move based on commodity movements? Thank you. ","Kathy Waller ","As Muhtar just said commodities are for us will be benign this year, as we have worked in this quarter [indiscernible] recycling higher prices a little and back half -- in the first half of last year and thinking about something like oil, oil doesn\u2019t really impact us. So for our commodities, we\u2019re hedged. So we basically are not going to see specific benefits there because -- and they are going to be basically benign.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is John Faucher of JP Morgan.","John Faucher","Thank you. I wanted to follow up on two questions related with the price mix number which is I guess one, if we look at the gallon variances you mentioned it skews a little bit more towards high revenue per case. So can you give us an idea in the quarter in terms of how much of that benefit in geographic concentrate shipments, how much we\u2019ll need to take out over the balance of the year? And then going back to some of the comments that you guys made I think back in December about sort of a different global pricing strategy in terms of really trying to find the right balance region-by-region, can you talk about the outlook for pricing in Europe, it was obviously price mix was flat this quarter but that\u2019s when where it seems like there is some opportunities going forward. So what sort of the medium to longer term view on pricing in Europe? Thanks.","Kathy Waller ","Okay. John, I\u2019ll take the first part of that question. So the gallons and the cases definitely when you mix the [adjustment] for days, gallons are behind cases and we got real moderate and -- but that will be based on as you just say that is what we see in the first quarter is the high revenue for CSE and so we did benefit from positive geographic mix, in our price mix. That will moderate and we will start to see when that catches up. More of the geographies that provide a lower revenue per CSE coming through which will then give us the negative geographic mix, it\u2019s coming through as well in the balance of the year. ","And I think the second part of your question on the outlook of pricing, Sandy do you want to talk about it all in the North America price range specifically? ","Sandy Douglas","Sure Kathy. Good morning John. The North America pricing situation is really the continuation of the strategies that we\u2019ve been talking about for the last year and half. Irial and I talked about this I think six quarters ago that we were going to focus our business on the sustaining strategy of disciplined price, combine mix to maximize revenue. With an emphasis on price as a driver in the U.S. business and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing and what we continue to plan to do with a lot of discipline and focus.","As you look at the first quarter if you look at each business by themselves, we met our pricing objectives in the first quarter. We saw a little bit faster growth in our fountain business which created a little bit of negative business mix, but net-to-net the year started according to plan and we see the outlook as being rational and our strategy remains very consistent.","Ahmet, you want to talk about Europe? ","Ahmet Bozer","Thanks Sandy. Hey John. Just a couple of comments in general and then Europe, we are following exactly the same strategy of managing our product mix and price versus volume around the markets international, in fact we are getting some pretty good results in many of our big markets specifically in Europe one must remember that last year we\u2019ve had some fairly aggressive pricing which resulted in our view somewhat of an imbalanced progression of our business where we have lost some market share, but get -- got great pricing. ","So we were saying before that we would be moderating that somewhat this year so that we have a more balanced growth of volume and revenue. So what you saw in the first quarter is the result of that sort of moderation, but we do believe that we would be achieving reasonable price mix in Europe in the course of this year. ","Muhtar Kent","John this is Muhtar, I\u2019ll just add one other point which is related to what I already mentioned that we\u2019re reorganizing and we have reorganized our marketing around the different clusters of developed, emerging and developing markets. I think that\u2019s also working, beginning to yield some early results and I think our new marketing leadership is very committed and very much part of this new reorganization of our marketing around the clusters and I can say very clearly that marketing is playing an important role in how we are generating enhanced revenue in our business that\u2019s really an important takeaway, I think.","John Faucher","Great, thank you. Feel better Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thanks. I feel good, it's just my voice.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi guys. So I'll give Muhtar voice a break and maybe start with Kathy. The quarter came in better than expected from a margin perspective clearly versus consensus, but with the extra shipping days and Easter shift its kind tough to judge your margin performance. So, I was just hoping you could give us some perspective on where margins and profit came in this quarter versus your original expectations and some of the key puts and takes in the quarter again versus as original expectations. ","Kathy Waller","So, the price mix obviously is three points as I just spoke about, we did benefit from the positive geographic mix and -- in the first quarter and as we will get concentrate shipments and timing starts to catch up we will have the impact of negative geographic mix which is for us is not surprising, that it's kind of normal run rate for several of our geography. So we did get the price in the quarter and in the benefit and then we had decided that would be the cost and when you adjust for structural and you adjust the currencies, cost of goods is really in line with concentrate shipments and then the other issue would then just be commodities and then as we\u2019re said the commodities are basically going to be benign for us and in the quarter we are cycling higher cost from full last year. So that was a slight benefit and that's for the most part and as I\u2019m looking into the rest of the year commodity is still going to be benign so it\u2019s really basically the pricing that we got this quarter, offset by the cost that were better than prior year because we cycled a better cost.","Dara Mohsenian","Okay and then when you put everything together would you say from a profit standpoint or margin standpoint where did the quarter come in versus original expectations at the corporate level?","Kathy Waller","So, and also would add, one of the thing is seeing addition in North America specifically we had better mix which basically was about our food service business. So for the first quarter in our transition year we are obviously very pleased with our result and I would say that -- I would expect pricing to moderate for the back half of the year and continue with the cost commodity -- the cost of [control] continue to be in line with the concentrate shipment. So we we're -- basically given the quarter in line with our expectations and we expect to be in line with our full year expectations that we have provided. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next is Steve Powers of UBS.","Steve Powers","Thanks. Muhtar feel free to weigh in, but I'll also try to give you a break and direct questions to Sandy and Kathy. So guys on North America the price utilization was solid but was actually a little lower than I at least had expected, just based on market data and I know you were lapping some fairly intense retailer promotion, so maybe that played a role, maybe it was again negative mix from still. I know you mentioned fountain dynamics Sandy, but I was hoping if you could expand on the trends there and whether you think 2% is a representative number for the year? This in term just the way you are charging it?","And then on a related note I was wondering if you also dimension for us the profit contribution to this price mix you are getting because clearly if it was all rates, Tier rate then it would sort of flow through 100% to profit all as equal. But given that lot of what we\u2019re seeing is category mix and these are just introduction of new package types. I'm wondering how to think about that profit contribution. Should we be assuming 50% as a rule of thumb roughly or are there reasons to be more optimistic or cautious related to extrapolating price mix to profit flow through?","Muhtar Kent","Steve the comment I make about overall pricing are to reiterate what I said earlier which is that on a business by business basis our pricing results in the first quarter we're solid, you saw in the Nelson very strong price growth, some of that was driven by wholesale improvement that we were achieving with our customers, some of that was lapping some really aggressive promotional activity that happens in the end of February and early march and some it was our customers making more money in the category, so the net effect of it was a really good start to the year in line with our plan.","If you cross our business over into our chilled minute maid business, we saw price realization there. We launched some new items that drove some incremental revenue and then as I mentioned the fountain business was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year which creates a business mix drag overall. What I say from a profitability standpoint is that the combination of rate and mix was in line with our expectations, but I\u2019d also pointed out that as we get into the second half of the year you are going to see more difficult pricing comparisons and we will continue our strategy of rigorous and disciplined and focused price volume management but will be lapping our sales and we\u2019ll be continuing to do so but against the little bit tougher comparison.","So net-to-net up to the start we\u2019d hope to. Irial, any additional dimension?","Irial Finan","I think I\u2019m repeating what you said but I\u2019d go back and I\u2019d say this for six calls. We\u2019re being very disciplined and rational about our pricing and what we\u2019ve achieved in the first quarter is pretty well in line, Sandy has mentioned there is some channel mix impacts in there, but generally speaking very much in line. We intend to say disciplined and [indiscernible] ordinarily be boring in terms of how we approach the business. We wanted to remain disciplined and focused and doing the right things in the business and we believe we are on a good track. We intend to stand on track and I think as this quarter goes by you\u2019ll see positive momentum in the business.","Muhtar Kent","Can I just add one more thing there, that what Irial just said then creates the environment for our small packages to grow and the consumer is moving strongly to small packages and we\u2019re continuing to see low to mid-teens growth in those packages and all of which is supported by the impact of a step up in marketing which gives the whole thing more sustainability as we work through the more challenging comps. ","Steve Powers","Okay. Maybe just follow up sort of related to seeing in different angle, maybe this is for Kathy. I noticed you\u2019ve changed the reporting of regional profit to profit before tax, so regional operating profits or profit before tax consistent with the incentive changes you made. North American PBT was up like 100 basis points -- 180 basis points or so but I was wondering if you can comment, A; if there was any material benefit from sub-bottling payments in the quarter and B; if OI margin trends would have been sort of -- would have mirrored PBT and then assuming so, how much of that 180 basis points improvement was driven by some of the better pricing realization, the better productivity commodities that can kind of continue as a run rate versus timing benefits in the quarter related to the Easter and the calendar shifts? So if 180 is representative sort of the underlying OI trends and then what\u2019s the real run rate that we should be thinking about as sort of expecting margin improvement on the year? Thanks.","Kathy Waller ","So the expected margin improvement over the balance of the year as Sandy just said, so we\u2019ve got good pricing in the quarter and as Irial said we\u2019re very focused on continuing to be rational in price. We have higher comps in the back half of the year for pricing that we have to cycle. So as far as the franchising is concern I wouldn\u2019t expect to see much benefit at this point from the sub-bottling payments and as you know if you look at it from an external perspective, we have through structurally adjust those we\u2019ve pulled them out. We pull out the benefits so that we put it back on an apples-to-apples basis year-over-year. ","So there is not a big difference at operating versus PBT in our North American operations at this point. So the margin expansion that is basically really good pricing as we get really good pricing in the fourth quarter of last year, they are very focused on pricing that will continue, but are cycling higher prices in the back half of this year. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Bill Chappell of SunTrust. ","Bill Chappell","I guess two questions, I\u2019ll lump them together. One, on diet coke in the U.S. it did look like most recently the Nelson\u2019s looks like actually a positive number and we haven\u2019t seen that in a while, just wanted to see if maybe the trend you feel like you\u2019ve got behind that where we could see some growth going forward at least stabilization. And then the second question, on the refranchising, anything you\u2019ve seen thus far, I know it\u2019s early, where it may be accelerated even further in terms of the bottler network where it\u2019s just -- may be you have more of an update later as we move to the year?","Sandy Douglas","Bill, on diet coke I would describe diet coke still as a work in progress. We have done a number of things on the basics of marketing, graphics, adverting, packaging. We have some very advanced sort of big data driven customer relationship programs going on with consumers who love diet coke and we are seeing some improvement in the year-over-year revenue. But we\u2019re still very much focused on that as a work in progress and expect to. But I would say this, the team and I and our whole system believes that in fact we\u2019ll return diet coke to grow in the long term, but recent improvement, that still work in progress. ","On refranchising, the refranchising is going according to plan. It is a, as we said before a massive project. We are putting the entire system in the common ERP systems and refranchising the territories one sale center at a time to make sure that the capability that we build continues to grow and that our customers are well served in the process and we\u2019re pleased with the progress, We have a plan in place that we expect to meet or beat and we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to accelerate it but not at the expense of really high quality customer servicing capability.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So, throughout the press release and your commentary we pleasingly had heard and read about marketing increases so that's a good thing, that\u2019s very much on plan. However we don't really see or hear much reference to cost cutting benefit offsetting or funding some of those asset point, the only thing you said was, look we\u2019re on track for 500 million of cost savings this year. But we're not hearing or seeing a lot of that flowing through even offsetting things, I'm not saying all the way to the bottom line but at least offsetting from your investment. So when can we start hearing more about that savings offsetting your investments?","Muhtar Kent","Well Ali, this is Muhtar. First if it wasn't for the savings we would not be able to be -- to do what you see us doing, in terms of generating net increase marketing, generating all the other things that's basically are part of our five point strategy of focusing on revenue, focusing on productivity, focusing on better and more marketing rewiring the organization for better impact and focusing on our core which is the franchise that we talked about.","So I just sat to you, had is not being for the productivity we certainly would not be able to enable our organization to generate the kind of momentum that you see beginning to come back in that's clear there is no question about that. And so this is not a four or five sequential kind of compartments, these are very integrated sort of approach to how we bring more momentum into our business and everything that I mentioned is happening at the same time, better more -- better wide organization, better marketing, marketing that works around clusters, more infective marketing linked to social media as well as into a better cost per GRP.","All of that funded by incremental productivity and so I think that's how you need to see our entire sort of different bucket of our strategy coming to life.","Ali Dibadj","So, a follow up on that and separate question for Irial, just a follow up on than Muhtar if you could, is particularly in terms of the headcount reduction and the saving there off. Should we see that ramping up throughout the year and at risk of being cut off let me turn my second question here on a separate topic is, we do keep hearing Germany, India, Vietnam bottlers and BIG continue to be actually quite well and I always pause whenever I see that and I\u2019ll see that in countries, but some of those names including Germany. But when is the right time to divest those and get them out of hospital ward and what are you looking for to make sure that happens or potential buyers are looking forward at this point to commit to buying them?","Muhtar Kent","First, I mean I'll just say that I agree with you that they those bottlers are doing really well. Germany certainly is staring Europe. Southeast Asian bottlers are doing well particularly Vietnam the big one that we are running and I think it's important to keep in mind for you that Germany was not in the position to be refranchised until after 2012 because the consolidation was still taking place, so it's really being ready for the last sort of, it feels like 18 months to 24 months. And it has been the real bright spot in the Europe the last couple of years, it\u2019s profitable and we need to ensure that we get the -- find the right home and the right structure and the right value and so I could be clear with you that Germany is not a long term -- strategic long term holding and the right moment will be found. None of our, if you bike BIG operations are in a way long term strategic hold. So, that's what I would say about your question, Irial, you want to add anything to that.","Irial Finan","I guess the only add I\u2019ll give is the three markets you mentioned actually are not in the hospital ward. To move those clients actually they\u2019re all performing very well now and we've been very transparent about refranchising. I\u2019ve said this many times in conferences that we would refranchise at the right time, Germany we've clearly said is ready to [indiscernible] in the meantime it continues to perform exceptionally well.","We have a fantastic group up of associates and managements in Germany and fell very good about it. But I\u2019ve also said we expect to get a fair price, not get over paid but get fair price for territories because we owe that to our shareholder and we take it from there.","Muhtar Kent","Just to build on what Irial said, we are looking for three things. So in terms of the right partner -- description of the right partner; one, proven management team; two, a strong financial capabilities and three, willing to invest in the business and growing the business. So those are the three things and then I'm confident that we will reach that goal. On your -- finally on your question regarding head counts reduction, I think you've heard about our previously announced plan and we\u2019re sticking to that plan simply said.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Ian Shackelton of Nomura.","Ian Shackelton","You announced the deal in China last week and I was just keen to get a little bit more detail of how that fits in. It\u2019s obviously divided from the structure of what we\u2019ve seen with the more recent deals with Monster or [indiscernible].","Muhtar Kent","Ian, its Muhtar. It fits right into the strategy of what we said, is bolt on acquisition where they make sense. And we will look at them with -- and where we believe that they fit into our portfolio, where they actually add value, where we can generate value for our bottling partners through that acquisition and it fits right in there. And that\u2019s I will say about that, Ian.","Ian Shackelton","Okay. Thank you. But just follow up for Kathy, I know it can be quite volatile with equity income this time has almost come to zero, is this something specifically in there that\u2019s causing that?","Kathy Waller ","Our equity income is impacted by currency. So we actually have -- don\u2019t pull out all of the currency that\u2019s been impacted because if you think about some of our locations they have -- their geography, they have many geographies. So when we report we take the main currency and transact that into U.S. dollar that means that there is still often a lot of currency impact in those numbers. So I would read into it that is a very, very difficult currency environment out there at the moment.","Ian Shackelton","Okay. So this is not a case of it being something one-off in terms of the equity holdings there?","Kathy Waller ","No, there is nothing one-off down the way of the equity holdings.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Is there any way to sort of strip out what the benefit in the quarter was on the operating profit side from the extra days?","Kathy Waller ","So I guess the way I think about it is if you take our unit case sales of one and use that as a surrogate because that doesn\u2019t have the extra days in it and you take pricing of three in terms of pricing and then I would say that did benefit from positive geographic mix, that we\u2019ll moderate over the back half of the year. So I guess I would think of it using this price mix in average sales in unit cases.","Bill Schmitz","Except that there was no fixed cost leverage or anything with the extra days that might help the growth in operating margin?","Kathy Waller ","So the days or the operating expenses, I would say no there was nothing specific in operating expenses that would help by the six days and then the sales and distribution expenses are impacted by the six days so they kind of watch out, I would say that it\u2019s nothing there.","Bill Schmitz","Okay. Now that\u2019s very helpful. And then just on BIG, I mean the year-over-year margin expansion was awesome, I mean massive, what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable is it?","Kathy Waller ","So again [indiscernible] but then, we did benefit from the size of the geographic mix. So I think the only thing I would say in terms of this it will moderate in the back half of the year as we will get more of a normal run rate of negative geographic mix from concentrate shipment. And then Sandy talked about the impact of the business mix with the food service business in North America. So I think those are things that basically will say that that number will moderate over the back half of the year as we are still in a transition year.","Bill Schmitz","Okay, great. And then just lastly very quickly, I mean the delay in the Monster transaction, I mean -- is there any more color you can give us on why it -- and I think it supposed to close at maybe late 2014, early \u201915 and you guys said March now it\u2019s kind of towards the end of the quarter. Is there still a high probability that\u2019s going to close then?","Kathy Waller ","Yes. So there is no issue there. It\u2019s was going to close, we always expected it to close in the first quarter than basically it\u2019s just the regulatory process that we have to go through that is delaying the close. We fully anticipate that it will close.","Bill Schmitz","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much for the time.","Kathy Waller ","Certainty. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Most of my questions are answered. So just the couple of P&L questions Kathy, one just in terms of the structural items impact this year, it sounds like a quite negative on revenue now as oppose to the prior call. So just a little bit of clarification on sort of the puts and takes on the revenue impact. Sounds like the impacts on bottom line is pretty minimal. And then on the FX you have the re-measurement gain in Q1, that was about a little bit more than $0.001, is that really what\u2019s the difference in terms of your full year outlook for PBT impact being at the low end of that 7% to 8% that you had pulled out that time?","Kathy Waller ","Hi, Judy. So on the structural, the structural is impacted by the timing of the Monster transaction and then anytime we accelerate in the refranchising that is also going to impact that number. So that\u2019s why we gave you different structural guidance. And then on the re-measurement gain, yes, that\u2019s basically when we re-measure that euro debt that impacted currency positively and so that is what changed the outlook for currency over the back half of the year. I would also join in the impact of Venezuela and change using the SIMADI rate going forward.","Judy Hong","The timing of the Monster transaction though, I mean the deal itself is delayed, but you are getting the distribution into your bottling in this quarter, so that would be still a positive in terms of revenue benefit. But is the refranchising pacing really what's striking down in terms of the revenue impact?","Kathy Waller","So, the distribution is starting to transition, it has not fully transitioned, so that transition will take place over the year and so we at various turns and that's not something that's really under our control, that's really under Monster\u2019s control, as they transition that, so we can't -- we put in the estimate of how we think it's growing to transition. So it's not something that's already into our numbers, and that slower -- that's what slowing us. So, it's slower than expected because we expected it to start earlier.","Judy Hong","Nice thing. Okay, that's cool. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim. In summary we're seeing initial progress in our plan to reintegrate top line growth. However we still have much to do and the full benefits from the announced initiatives are going to take time to materialize. 2015 is a transition year as we transform our operating model for sustainable growth, amidst a challenging global consumer environment, while the macro environment remains challenging in the near term, we\u2019re confident in our ability to return to sustainable growth and the long term dynamics of our industry remain promising. Our clients and our global system are un-parallel we are fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world's leading beverage company. ","As always thank you for your interest.

Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one question, please ask your most pressing first and then return and reenter the queue.","Now, let me turn the call over to James.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying and underlining that we're winning in a dynamic and vibrant industry. The global beverage industry is growing faster than last year, driven by better results in the emerging and developing markets and also the sparkling soft drink category. We're gaining value share as we execute on the strategies we laid out for you in early 2017. And importantly, our operating performance is accelerating as a result.","So 2018, at the halfway mark of the year, we're seeing good momentum in our underlying business. Organic revenue is up 5% year-to-date, driven by a good mixture of volume and price\/mix. Global volume is up 3%, which is the strongest we've seen in five years. And comparable EPS is up 5% year-to-date, despite stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018. And, as we noted at the start of the year, we've always expected EPS growth to be back half-weighted and that has not changed.","So operationally, looking around the world, we delivered strong top line growth in the first half of the year, driven by continued strength in our international markets. In Asia-Pacific, strong performance in key emerging markets like China, India, and Vietnam drove mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment during the first half of the year. And while we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio across all of our Asian markets, our sparkling soft drink portfolio led our top line acceleration.","Turning to Latin America, even in the face of headwinds, we delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth for the first half as we focus on the fundamentals. Mexico continues to perform well, driven by solid growth across our sparkling and dairy portfolios. In Brazil, a 10-day transport strike in late May put a virtual halt to the economy. Prior to that, we were on track to deliver the third quarter of sequentially improving volume growth. Our system worked hard to recover momentum. And by the end of the quarter, we had bounced back to pre-strike growth rates.","In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 7% year to date through balanced volume and price\/mix. We see solid momentum in the emerging and developing markets, with notable strength in Central Europe and Turkey. And in the developed markets, we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio through additions like Fuze Tea, Honest Coffee, and AdeZ plant-based beverages across Europe.","In North America, we're delivering strong performance in the marketplace year to date. According to Nielsen, our U.S. retail sales are up 3% in the second quarter, driven by both volume and pricing. We are pleased with the performance of our innovation and brand-building initiatives. Our no-sugar sparkling soft drink portfolio delivered 7% retail value growth in the quarter, thanks to the recently restaged Diet Coke and strong growth of Coke Zero Sugar.","Our hydration and coffee portfolios drove strong results as well. POWERADE ZERO, DASANI Sparkling, and our coffee portfolio each grew volume double digits. These efforts combined with the improving execution from our bottling partners have enabled our system to continue capturing strong value share gains.","Now, let me turn to the pricing environment in North America. Stepping back, the overall market remains disciplined, and we remain focused on executing revenue growth management initiatives to grow our price\/mix over time. However, as you can see, reported price\/mix in North America continued to differ from market-level performance.","This was principally due to three factors. First, freight costs remain a challenge, were slightly worse than our initial forecast. And as we noted in the first quarter call, outbound freight costs are reported in price\/mix for 2018. Secondly, the timing of deductions, which net out in the year, between the second quarter and the third quarter put a point of pressure on price\/mix. Lastly, business mix put two points of pressure on reported price\/mix, as our concentrates sparkling business grew faster than our finished goods business, particularly the juice and tea.","Combined, these factors put approximately four points of pressure on the reported price\/mix, driving the vast majority of the difference you see versus the growth in scanner data. We're taking pricing actions alongside our bottlers on our sparkling beverage brands and expect to see positive price\/mix in the second half across the portfolio in aggregate, as our package downsizing and our marketplace pricing actions are fully implemented and the timing items reverse. These factors, along with the continued execution of our strategy, will result in stronger financial performance in North America in the back half.","So to summarize, our emerging and developing markets are accelerating, with double-digit organic revenue growth year to date. And our developed markets are performing well, delivering low single-digit organic revenue growth.","Now, turning and talking a little bit about how we're driving disciplined sustainable growth in the business, obviously, first, it requires a solid understanding of the consumer to build the right portfolio in each market. Over the last few calls, we've discussed how we're expanding our portfolio through innovations, acquisitions, and lifting, shifting, and sustaining successful brands across markets. But disciplined growth also requires that our existing brands retain and sharpen their edge by connecting better with consumers' needs. We're working diligently to increase our capabilities in this area because satisfying key consumption occasions allows us to attract new drinkers and ultimately achieve quality leadership.","One example of this is Georgia Coffee in Japan. Georgia has historically had a strong male consumer base in Japan. So we recently launched a new variant called Craftsman with recipes, flavors, and packaging designed to appeal more to the new consumer segments, in particular younger adults and women.","Craftsman's drinks come in premium, glass-like PET bottles that are resealable, making them portable and easier to consume. This is a change from the traditional cans, opening up new consumption occasions that were previously untapped. We're off to a good start, with our coffee portfolio in Japan reversing recent trends and growing volume mid-single digits.","This kind of discipline of taking a very tailored approach to consumption occasions and channels is also one of the ways we're attracting new sparkling drinkers. For our flagship brand Coca-Cola, we're leveraging the brand's edge, which is centered around uplift and energize, to build consumption rituals through consumers with strategic innovation.","An example, Coca-Cola with coffee, this product started as a trial in Australia. Other markets are now introducing it, but with twists based on the learning. In Vietnam, for example, the brewed coffee category is very large, so we introduced Coke Plus Coffee there with great coffee cues like aroma, with less sugar, positioning it as an alternative pick-me-up for the traditional coffee drinker. Execution was targeted and deliberate, focusing on specific occasions and channels, like the mid-afternoon pick-me-up, in coffee shops and at work. And the early results are very promising, delivering incremental growth for the Coca-Cola brand with very little cannibalization.","While this is just one specific example, it is indicative of the broader strategic approach we are taking to reinvigorate the sparking category. It's about leveraging brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by offering people what they want, when and where they want it.","Actions like this around the world have helped us accelerate the performance of Coke trademark, with global volume up 2% year-to-date. Of course, driving disciplined growth is not just about expanding our beverage portfolio. It's about shaping quality leadership for sustainable revenue profit and cash flow growth. Therefore, it is critical that we reduce complexity to ensure our system sales force is focused, our supply chain is efficient and our innovation pipeline gains more space and visibility at the point of sale.","To that end, we've been identifying and killing zombie brands and SKUs while focusing our teams on the work that matters most. Many of you have asked what we mean by zombie brands and where the opportunities are. So let me try and give a few examples.","Earlier this year, our Middle East and North Africa business unit identified more than 125 underperforming SKUs to eliminate. To-date, we've discontinued 60% of those and intend to delist the rest by the end of the year, allowing us to reallocate resources to brands and strategic initiatives that are delivering the highest return.","Given the benefits we're seeing, of course, we're embedding the elimination of zombie SKUs and brands even further into existing routines, instilling this discipline deeper into our business units. This taking a more disciplined approach to our portfolio is only one of the ways we're looking to reduce complexity in the business.","We're also constantly focusing our teams on the work that matters most, driving a productivity mindset in the business with the aim of both funding reinvestment and driving cash flow improvements. For example, after a recent review, we've significantly reduced the number of strategic projects in one of our largest business units to ensure that we are sufficiently allocating resources to the highest return on investment projects, rather than targeting too many actions at once. This is building on the previous productivity actions we've laid out and helping us to drive strong 8% underlying operating income growth for the first half of the year, while continuing to reinvest behind our brands, because ultimately it's not just about growth for the sake of growing. Growth must translate into solid returns for our investors.","So taking a step back and looking at the remainder of the year, global economic growth remains robust. Now, of course, there is some level of uncertainty from geopolitical risk and escalating trade conflicts, but our industry remains vibrant and growing. And we are winning and we have momentum in the business. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since the beginning of the year, increasing our currency headwinds in the back half. So all-in-all, with increasingly currency headwinds partially offset by momentum in the business, we remain focused on delivering the earnings guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year.","Let me now turn the call over to Kathy.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks and good morning, everyone.","As James mentioned, we saw strong underlying growth in the quarter. We delivered 5% organic revenue growth through balanced growth in our volume and price\/mix, giving us confidence in our top-line acceleration. The solid organic revenue growth, combined with our ongoing productivity measures, drove 8% underlying operating income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong, as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year and from cycling bottler refranchising activity last year.","Our comparable operating margin increased more than 300 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an almost 200 basis point impact of the new accounting standards and currency. Productivity helped to drive the underlying operating margin expansion, with actions across all of our operating segments. However, we saw a particular benefit in our corporate segment due to the Lean Center initiative we began during the second quarter of last year. The accounting impact from the change in revenue recognition was in line with our expectations.","It's important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating segment. For example, the impact to operating margins was the most extreme for North America, resulting in over 200 basis points of compression in that segment's margin. Below the line, performance was as we expected, allowing us to deliver comparable EPS growth of $0.61, up 3% in the quarter.","So as I turn to the remainder of the year, considering our strong performance in the first half of the year and for reasons James spoke to, we are taking up our guidance on organic revenue and underlying operating income growth. Specifically, we now expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and underlying operating income growth of at least 9%. At the same time, the expected currency headwinds to full year operating income is now expected to be 4%, an increase of three to four points since the beginning of the year. And, as James mentioned, we remain focused on delivering full year comparable EPS growth within our previously-provided range of 8% to 10%.","Turning to cash flow, we now expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $8 billion. This is down from our initial outlook of at least $8.5 billion, largely driven by higher than anticipated tax payment related to an amendment of the prior year's tax return and stronger currency headwinds.","And we remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We now expect to reinvest $1.7 billion in the business through capital expenditures. And we will return our free cash flow to shareowners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and an expected $1 billion in net share repurchases.","Finally, we are on track to pay down approximately $7 billion in gross debt, as previously discussed. So as you model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of savings. We expect currency headwinds to negatively impact both net revenue and operating income in the second half of the year.","We expect the change in revenue recognition to benefit operating income in the third quarter, which is a reversal of the headwind we recognized in the second quarter. And we expect structural impacts to moderate as we move through the remainder of the year.","Finally, we expect our comparable EPS growth to be higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, due to an additional day in the fourth quarter and cycling the impact from last year's natural disaster. As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more detail as you build out your models for the year.","So in summary, we delivered solid financial performance year-to-date and we remain focused on delivering full year comparable EPS growth within our previously-provided range of 8% to 10%.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Lauren.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the sports drink category because you called out POWERADE as particularly strong in the U.S. this quarter. We can see in the Nielsen, it's been gaining share. And I remember it being called out, the business in Mexico, in particular, as being called out as a case study at the Analyst Day. So I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about POWERADE's position maybe like in the rest of the markets outside the U.S., the big ones that matter, kind of market share growth trends, relative importance of the category, because it does seem that it perhaps has greater legs maybe than people tend to think. Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Yeah, I mean, as you say, firstly, we've had a very successful run with POWERADE in Mexico. We told the story about that on the Investor Day and I think it's a great example of where you can bring innovation and long-term patience to going from challenger to leader.","Clearly inspired by some of those learnings, we've been looking at that in the U. S. We've done particularly well with POWERADE ZERO as well in the quarter. We made some progress. We got a lot of opportunity ahead of us. It's a very big category in the U.S. I think whilst we're happy that we're going in the right direction, there's much work to be done.","And obviously, one of the things that's been helping drive POWERADE in the U.S. and, indeed, globally, in the second quarter was, of course, its link and the activation related to the FIFA World Cup event, where it's one of the brands that's both advertised and present, and so we did a lot of marketing programs on that. So I think part of what you're seeing is the payoff of the marketing programs and the linkage into football.","As you look at the rest of the world, POWERADE is charactering (19:33) relatively well. The sports drink category is much bigger in the Americas than it is in the rest of the world. You tend to see more everyday hydration. We have brands like Aquarius, which is big in a number of parts of Europe and does well in Japan. So the rest of the world is not as big in sports drinks as the Americas is. But we had a good quarter. Good execution, good innovation, good link to marketing, but there's a lot more opportunity for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great, thanks. So, there are, obviously, a lot of moving parts in the business with all the structural items, the accounting changes and FX. But the reported gross margin this quarter was just a little light, at least of external projections. So I was wondering if you could just get underneath all the changes and talk about how the underlying gross margin might be trending. It looks to me like maybe they're down modestly year-over-year, which would be consistent with the business mix away from CSDs and towards stills. But then again, sparkling has been kind of trending in line with the total company growth, if not a little bit ahead, year-to-date. So I'm not sure that's the full explanation. So maybe you could just talk about where gross margins have landed year-to-date versus your own internal expectations and how do you expect them to evolve from here? Thank you.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Steve. So, underlying comparable gross margins expanded about 90 basis points. That really is driven by structural. So 300 basis points is due to structural and then that's offset by some currency and about 200 basis points from the accounting changes, as you said, a lot of moving parts in the quarter.","Underlying is under pressure and it's basically it's still moderate pressure, but it's under pressure due to \u2013 we said as we're expanding into other categories and you said yourself as we go into more finished goods businesses, that we were going to have margin pressure. So it is basically within our expectations, because we always said we were going to offset that through our operating margin.","So, yes, there is margin compression, but it's very moderate, as we said, as we talked about at Investor Day. And it is within our expectations and we are managing it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So I had two questions. One is just a follow-up on the previous question on the 300 basis points of comparable operating margin expansion. Can you quantify how much of that was actually productivity in this versus structural change?","And then the other question I had, which is not a follow-up, is digging a little bit deeper into North America tea and juice. Clearly, you downsized there metro volumes down, but it didn't really seem to show any price\/mix pickup. And maybe downsizing was just commodities and it was a smaller deal, but if you contrast that to when you were chaining the pack architecture in a bigger way or downsizing in sparkling, the price\/mix elasticity was much better. You got more transactions, so the volume wasn't down as much.","So I want to understand a little bit more the strategy around downsizing. Is it purely commodities, or is there something from a pack architecture in juices and teas? And then also looking forward for that, will that continue to be a drag for the next several quarters in North America? Thanks for those two.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Okay. Let me focus in on the North American tea, juices, et cetera, et cetera, because that of course links to the price\/mix. It's probably a slightly longer answer than just tea and juice because it ladders up into the overall price\/mix question. And of course, here, there's a temptation to just look at the trees and miss the forest. But I'll try and come from the detail up to the strategic answer.","So what's happened in tea and juice, particularly juice, there's clearly some cost pressure. The cost of orange juice inputs, the cost of the packaging we use for our juice business, in particular our chilled juice business, had a lot of cost pressure. So we took, I think, the right strategic decision to try and contain the absolute level of price points in the store by downsizing some of the packages, which we did essentially at the beginning of Q2. What did that cause? It caused us to go down in volume obviously, but we actually got positive pricing in orange juice. If you go to the Nielsen numbers, you can see that pricing in orange juice is up.","And so I think what you see is volumes are down, prices are up. Competitors and the retailers, on balance, didn't follow us overnight. They probably followed us closer at the beginning of the third quarter, so that's starting to come through. So we had probably a larger volume impact, which is unfortunate, but traditional for the price leader. And so that's the story in juice. I think the juice thing will start to improve as we get into the back half. We'll do better competitively. And I think the consumer environment will adjust to the new packaging and the new price points.","Now, what's interesting as you do modeling is it's really important to remember that in our numbers, we are combining the finished product business of chilled juice with the concentrate business of sparkling. Why is that important? The finished product business has a much higher revenue per unit than the sparkling concentrate business does. So in fact, what is actually happening in North America is we have positive pricing on juice. Our pricing is up, not just the market pricing. Our pricing is up on sparkling as well as the market pricing. Then you're going to ask the question, how can the overall be down. It's because juice is declining, there's a mathematical effect where the weighting of the juice decline counts for more \u2013 the loss of the juice volume counts for more than the fact both are going up.","So you can actually have an averaging problem, whereby both categories' pricings are going up, but the average is going down, which is the 2% headwind that we talked about coming from category mix. That will normalize itself out as juice does better into the year. And obviously, it's not really an operating income problem because you're mixing apples and pears with the finished product business and the sparkling business.","That's why as you start to look through what's happening in Q2 in North America, it can be distracting to look at all these negatives. But when you layer it up to what's really going on, we're doing the right strategic actions in each category. We're downsizing the juice category. We're focusing on low and no-sugar in the sparkling. We're focusing on smaller pack sizes, all of these allowing us, with the exception of juice in the short term, to get some volume growth, definitely get some transaction growth, getting price\/mix in each category. That will layer up over time to generate value for the customers and to realize pricing in the marketplace. And so as these temporary factors play out, you'll start to see the North America business go positive in the second half.","It's all about our long-term strategy of engaging with more consumers with smaller packages, more frequency, more frequently to drive value with our customers to have a better, more valuable consumer franchise. We've been executing that with our bottlers over the last few years. We've been winning in the marketplace. We're winning in the marketplace so far this year, and our strategy is on track. And therefore, I think it's important to look at those North American effects and to see them for what they are, and they are not a deviation. They're temporal and we'll be back on track with our strategy in the second half.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","The question is on Diet Coke. Given the importance of the brand, maybe you can just give us some metrics. I mean really trying to understand the sustainability of what is happening right now. Is this just distribution pipeline fill, or are you really seeing consumer metrics, new consumers coming into the category or into the brand, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Clearly, we're doing better with Diet Coke the second quarter than the first quarter, the first half of this year than we've been doing for good number of years. And I think we were flat in the first quarter. We were minus 1% in the second quarter on volume. Clearly, Diet Coke was growing in terms of revenue second quarter and year to date, so it's materially better than we were doing before.","What's it doing? Firstly, we've got packaging innovation. We've got the marketing innovation. We've got some flavor innovation. These are both allowing existing consumers to stay and continue to enjoy the franchise, and it's getting people to try it. It's not growing in aggregate yet, so there's still work to do. But it's certainly causing a reconsideration of the Diet Coke brand, and the flavors and the packaging and the marketing are part of that.","I think as you ladder that up to the overall strategic answer, the interesting thing is that the success and the turnaround of Diet Coke or at least the work in progress of a turnaround of Diet Coke is not coming at the expense of Coke Zero Sugar. Coke Zero Sugar is also growing double digits in North America volumetrically, clearly high teens, double digits in terms of revenue, such that we're getting strong first half overall revenue growth and volume growth with our Zero Diet portfolio in the U.S., which is a part of our strategy to go forward. So, good numbers, much better than before, work left to do.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bryan.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I had just a couple of questions around cash flow. I think the cash from operations guidance for the year has come down a little bit, so just some color in terms of what's driving that. And, Kathy, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about still the commitment to paying down $7 billion of gross debt. And it looks like, at least year-to-date, there hasn't been that much done. So is there any connection between the cash flow and the ability to sort of hit that goal of paying down debt over the balance of the year?","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Bryan. The cash from operations, the reason we took the shift from $8.5 billion down to $8 billion is really based upon two things. That's one would be the worsening currency environment of about three to four points that we talked about. And the second really is basically this impact of an unanticipated cash tax payment that was related to two prior year tax returns and that's a timing. So that will not reverse in the current year, but we'll get that back in subsequent years. So that was why we changed the guidance.","The cash from operations basically is we build it up from bottoms up. So we've got the line of sight to get to our new number. And it does not impact the $7 billion that we're going to pay down on the debt. That's how we plan to come from existing cash. That paydown, so far, you're right. We paid about $2 billion down so far this year. It is basically we're going to pay it down as it matures. So we've got maturity through 2019 to get to that $7 billion. So we are continuing and we're on track to pay down the $7 billion and the tax guidance does not impact that at all.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So I guess I wanted to dig a little bit into the EMEA performance. I think the price\/mix actually was pretty strong, even though Western Europe volume was a little bit down. Obviously, the weather was positive, but you also had the UK sugar tax into France that's been kind of a tough market, so just going through maybe dissecting performance from Western Europe versus the rest of the EMEA markets and then kind of the drivers of the improved price\/mix in the quarter versus what we saw in the last quarter.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. We'll try and go through those various pieces. Look, I mean, EMEA had a pretty good quarter. We had some strong performance. Now, I mean, taking some of the various factors you called out, yeah, weather was good in some places. It was actually bad in other places. It tended to be hotter and drier in the north, but rainier in the south. So I think weather is pluses and minuses on the countries, but overall it's not the biggest driver of what's going on in EMEA.","In the second quarter, we had a number of very positive things occur. First, I would call out the broad scale launch of Fuze Tea across 37 markets in the EMEA group. As you will remember, we ended our joint venture with Nestl\u00e9 on BPW. We still have Nestea in a couple of countries, but, basically, we ended the joint venture, which, of course, meant from the beginning of the year, we have to have our own tea in EMEA or in the large majority of Europe and Russia, which we launched at the beginning of the year. It's driving strong performance and we're very pleased with the launch so far.","The other thing that's going really well across EMEA is Coke Zero Sugar getting double-digit teens volume growth and double-digit teens revenue growth.","I mean, clearly EMEA is a football part of the world. The World Cup was hosted in EMEA as well in Russia. And so we had a lot of marketing programs on Coke the trademark, which has been helping us a lot on execution behind the World Cup across EMEA, which has been helping us do well.","Clearly, some of the countries we've adjusted to the sugar taxes, like the UK, but overall, I would say it was a strong quarter for the execution of the portfolio, for execution of the marketing plans. And clearly, there was some ups and downs in terms of some of the countries.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a question on pricing in North America. I was hoping you could give us some color on your price increase that went into effect earlier this month. I know it's early, but how confident are you that this pricing will stick and that you won't need to promote much of it back? And then, I'd be curious to hear what the general response from the retailers and then your competitors has been. Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Look, I mean, it's an off-cycle price increase, but not generally popular for a whole variety of reasons. And clearly, it's disruptive for us. It's disruptive for our customers. But I think the conversations have been about how is this going to work for each and every customer. Obviously, whilst they may understand the cost pressures are out there on freight, on the increases in steel and aluminum and other input costs that affect the bottling system and affect some of our finished products, clearly, these conversations are difficult. I think it's working its way through. We're finding ways of getting it to be implemented. I think the pricing will, in large measure, go through. I think you're starting to see that come through in Q3.","And so I think it's going to be one of those things that goes through into consumer pricing. I mean, ultimately, the beverage industry is not the only industry that is facing pressure from changing imports and the need to take pricing, whatever has been the driver of those input costs. And I think that that's partly just the general environment. So it's going through. It's been difficult, but I think the systems done a good job of helping the retailers.","And in the end, we're focused on coming back to our central story, which is, okay, yeah, this is a price increase, but our focus is on helping you grow revenues and profits in your business with our brands and with the beverage categories that we often lead. And so I think it's positive.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bill.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","A quick quantification. Did you or could you quantify on the Brazil strike kind of what that impact had on the top-line in the quarter? And then on the pricing in North America, just trying to understand of the four kind of issues that hit 2Q, are you just pricing for freight? I mean, or are you pricing for more than freight? I'm just trying to understand how much you need in terms of to offset that in the back half?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Look, we're not calling out numbers on Brazil. All we said is that we were slightly negative and we would have probably been positive if it hadn't been for the strike.","So let me talk about the North American one. Bear in mind that there's multiple types of price. The price increase I just talked about on the last question is predominantly the price increase from the bottling system on the sparkling brands in particular, which faced a whole series of input costs: freight, yes; plastic resins, yes; metal in all its various forms for many reasons, including tariffs. So there is some broad-based push on input costs that have kind of come in and affected us and many other industries as well. And that's what's driving the price increase that we took in the middle of the year, which was kind of the off-cycle price increase.","When it comes to the North American business that is in our accounting, obviously, the sparkling price increase the bottlers take will eventually flow through to the concentrate business on our sparkling side. The price increases that I talk about on juice, we took that effectively in the first half of the year, which is already planned with the retailers and the change in the packaging size that came into effect around the beginning of the second quarter. So there are a lot of moving pieces here on pricing in North America and I think it's important to disaggregate them. But again, once you disaggregate them, step back and come back to the overall picture, which is the categories are getting positive pricing. We've had positive pricing in the U.S. for several years now. We're focused on pricing, growing transactions, growing revenue, helping the customers grow and winning in the marketplace with more consumers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Dara.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Kathy, just one detailed question first, can you give us a sense for how much the FX hedging from 2018 is helping offset the EPS impact from currency? I just wanted to get a sense of the potential headwind in 2019 as the hedges unwind. And then, the real question is on Latin America. The results were obviously strong in the quarter. We've seen a lot of political currency and economic volatility in the region recently. So I just want to get an update on your level of confidence if the momentum can continue in the second half and I guess your view of the potential impact on your business or any risk in that region from the external environment here.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Which one do you want? The gains?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Do you want to do the gains?","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. So, hi, Dara. The hedging gains in this year, actually we're cycling hedging gains from the prior year, which are impacting us in this year, particularly in EMEA. So they are obviously hedging gains are helping to offset to some extent. But really they're more of a cycling issue for us for this year. And so therefore, the next year, which I think was your underlying question, next year, I really don't anticipate that there will be much impact with us having to cycle hedging gains from 2018 into 2019.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and then on Latin America?","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","That sounds like a second question. We'll come back to it.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Do you want me to do that? I'm feeling benevolent.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","The first one was an easy one.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","I don't believe it.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","So you're going to answer it, wow.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Maybe I'm feeling benevolent. I don't know what's going on here. Latin America, look, I think partly \u2013 we had a good start in Latin America, no doubt about it. We did call out \u2013 Latin America is one of those places where you need to look at a few quarters averaged together because it can be volatile. And the outlook there is there are some clouds on the horizon, but you know what? The thing can also turn positive.","I think sometimes the fears of what might happen are much greater than actually what happens. That may be true of Mexico. I think the Mexican environment looks like it's going to be stable and positive. Brazil, the strike is over. Clearly, the Brazilian economy is doing better than it was doing last year and the last few years. Argentina is looking a little more tricky. But look, we've been here before in Latin America several times. I don't think there's something that says everything suddenly all going to go wrong. So I think we've got a good plan for the second half in Latin America, together with our bottling partners. We're focused on growing the business. It's a part of the world we all understand, and I think we've got great plans to engage with the customers and the consumers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Andrea.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello, how are you? So you have discussed at length how the refranchising has helped improved performance, in particular in North America. And now, as you're starting to lap more and more territories, are you seeing any signs that trends may be slowing in some of these markets? And if not, because of tough comparisons, or are you still seeing the solid momentum building? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. I think the short answer is we've got continued momentum. We have volume growth in the U.S., which we didn't have for a long time. We've got positive pricing there. So I think the execution of the bottlers continues to be strong. Our partners remain pleased, exciting. Arca announced a big investment recently. So I think there's a lot of belief that we can continue to do well in North America. We have a good strategy.","As you look around the rest of the world, we had a very good first half in China. We refranchised the system in China. We've now got two really strong partners with COFCO and with Swire. And we had a much better start to the year in China, good volume growth, good revenue growth.","And again, as you go around, look at either the refranchisings we've done or new bottler combinations that are coming to being around the world, and even honestly some of our existing bottlers who want to be part of the refranchising continue to invest and continue to grow. So the system remains strong. Of course, there are countries here and there that are challenging. The system remains strong. It's executing, and so therefore, collectively we're all doing better. I think the headline growth by the company is symbolic and a proxy for the fact the system, this bottling system is also doing better.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Aatish Shah - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Good morning. This is Aatish Shah on for Pablo. Just one question, the price\/mix in LatAm increased 12% in the quarter versus 6% in 1Q. But margins fell in 2Q after increasing in the prior quarter. Can you provide some color on that dynamic regarding that pricing cost versus margins?","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yes, so pricing was up 12% in the quarter and that was driven from strong price\/mix in Mexico, Brazil, South Latin. So operational price\/mix was up as well as then the timing of some deductions that were reversing from Q1 of last year.","So when you talk about margins, though, the operating margins are down 120 basis points. Comparable operating margins are down, but year-to-date margins are up 80 basis points. And that is driven pretty much from structural. So we had structural in this year as we are refranchising a couple of bottlers in Latin America, and that's offset by some currency and a little bit from the accounting change. But the underlying business in Latin America expanded and is doing well. So most of that 80 points of year-to-date margin expansion is due to the underlying business and the strong price\/mix.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hello.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the fact that there was a bit of over-shipment in the first quarter and continued slight over-shipment in the second quarter. Does that reverse in the back half, or what are inventories like overall? And how does more finished good product affect that, just a little discussion around timing of shipments and what to look for in the back half?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Overall concentrate CSD sales, at the headline level, in line with unit cases, and of course there's one day less in the first half, which on a straight line basis is about 0.5 point, one day in 180. So it's not a massive difference. In theory, it will reverse itself in the second half, which in a way is a small headwind in the second half. But I think I wouldn't over-engineer the thing. There's no big buildup of inventory of concentrates or finished products. It's largely a building ahead of a strong summer, a strong marketing program with FIFA. Therefore, I think it evens itself out over time. We may be fractionally ahead in the year-to-date. Maybe it'll come off in the remainder of the year, but it's always in the bounds of what we're expecting.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So we recently got the biannual use consumption data for the U.S., which, not surprisingly, showed consistent declines, which you've been seeing over the last decade, for high school past week soda consumption. But we don't, as far as I know, have this data for any international market. So, James, I was wondering. Can you just comment on what's happening on with like use soda consumption in like other developed markets? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. I mean, look, the Coca-Cola sparkling beverage category is in developed countries is in slight volume growth with positive pricing. Our strategy is to focus on transactions. We'd rather have more transactions, even if that meant flat or even slightly less volume, but more transactions with less calories and with more revenue. And we think that'll create a stronger franchise. And I think that's what you're seeing in the numbers across the developed markets.","And I think when you look at incidence rates, as we would call them, by young adults, then I think you see people starting to reengage with the category as we bring out smaller packages, as we bring out zero sugar options. And so I think we're starting to see that trend in the U.S. come to a different place and that's the strategy that we're following. We think it's going to play out over time.","Now, the reality is the reason we're doing Beverages for Life is also because it's not going to go back to what it was 40 years ago when there were relatively limited choice about the number of beverages. When you look at any consumption patent data across the developed world or, in fact, the developing or the emerging, the two biggest factors to call out is people continue to come into the commercial beverage market. Incidence rates for commercial beverages continue to go up. Yes, they're trying to have less calories, but total incidents of commercial beverages is going up. But it's more diversified.","Therefore, if we want to have and engage with the vibrant industry that's growing, we need a bigger portfolio. So we need to do justice and maintain the relevancy of the sparkling category, which is about consumer engagement, the marketing, but also smaller packages and the zero calories and some innovation, but also about winning in some of the other categories we've chosen to focus on. Consumers are buying more beverages, but they are buying it because of diversity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hey, Kevin.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","A couple, if I could slip them in, James, could we get an update on the timing for the CCBA transaction? I think last we heard, it was going to be, or at least the thinking was, end of September, which would suggest we could have heard something by now, but it's been relatively quiet. So an update there would be helpful.","And then, Kathy, a quick point of clarification on the EPS guidance, just as we sort of like tumble through the numbers that's enabled the company to maintain the 8% to 10% EPS growth. So FX, freight, commodities, it worsened. Perhaps investment levels are higher in North America to match Pepsi. You can comment on the last one, if you'd like to, but top line better. Price increases in operating leverage. What else has come in sort of a bit better? Is it on the productivity side that's enabled the company to offset the higher FX rate, et cetera, for the year? So if you could comment there, that would be helpful. Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","You want to take the last one?","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. So on the EPS guidance, obviously, the underlying business continues to perform well, as evidenced by us taking up our OI targets. I think the thing you're not focusing on is first, there's less deleveraging below the line than we previously talked about earlier in the year. So given the way currencies have moved, that impact is actually less on profit before tax than it is on operating income.","And then, we also have, as you remember, there was another accounting change that moved pension, split the pension cost, and part of it is now below the line, which also puts a little bit more volatility in other income, but that's helping some of that deleveraging below the line, so below operating income. So all-in, we feel good about the underlying business and then we've got enough other things that are helping us to stay within our guidance.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Thank you very much. And congratulations on another strong quarter.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks, Robert.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","One area that you haven't talked about too much recently is Africa. And perhaps you could give us a little bit of sense to how the business is operating in South Africa and then the rest of Africa. And then maybe touch on the CCBA situation. If there's any kind of new issues or any things that have come up that perhaps weren't expected at the beginning of the year. Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. So, I mean, Africa is doing well. We had some pretty broad-based growth in Africa in the second quarter and in the first half of the year. We've always had a good business in Africa. We're one of the biggest private businesses, ultimately, with our bottling partners, in Africa. We make a lot of investments there. We think it's got an excellent long term future. And we continue to invest. I mean, just in the second quarter, we did well in Nigeria and some of the other kind of northern and eastern countries in Africa.","As it relates to South Africa, I'll say something about South Africa and then I'll relate it to the CCBA because it's not related. In South Africa, we didn't do so well in the second quarter. That was anticipated because of the implementation of the sugar tax in South Africa in Q2. We had a reasonably good plan. I don't think we perhaps were as aggressive on the reformulations as we should have been. Competitors were more aggressive. And so we quickly course-corrected in the quarter and now we're better. So in the short term, the biggest thing that's happened in South Africa is the implementation of the sugar tax and we've adjusted and are sorting ourselves out for that. And things will get better into the second half.","Nothing that's happened in the second quarter is related to the timing on CCBA. Everyone knew that the sugar tax was going to come in. As was previously commented, we talked about trying to sort this out by the back half of the year. Clearly, the process was a little slower at the beginning for a number of regulatory and approval reasons, slow in getting started. It's up and running. We've got a number of interested parties, existing bottlers, potential new South African partners. The data rooms are up and running.","The management presentations have happened and we're expecting to get back indicative proposals in the coming months. And of course in the end, it goes back to what it always will be. Once we've got those, we'll be asking ourselves the question, do we have the right partner, with the right philosophy, with the right investment plan? And can we do this at the right price? We're looking to sell, of course, at the price that sets them up for success, but recognizes the value of the asset.","And hopefully, that will all come together in the coming months and we'll be on track, but we are going to do the right thing for the business there. Hopefully, we'll get the right answer, but we're going to focus on making sure we continue to invest for the long term in South Africa and the rest of Africa. It's a vibrant continent and we're very positive on the growth of each and every country there going forward.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","So with that, let me say thank you very much to everyone for joining the call.

Please look on our website for this information.","Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that we are pleased with our reported results today. In a year marked by further uncertainty in the global economy, once again, we delivered solid volume, solid revenue and solid profit growth. We grew our worldwide volume by 3% in the quarter and 4% for the full year. We generated, in comparable currency neutral, net revenue growth of 5% in the quarter and 6% for the full year in the process delivering net revenues over $48 billion in 2012, consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we delivered full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth of 6%. This growth also translated into our company-generating record comparable operating income of more than $11 billion for 2012. Importantly, we met our long-term volume revenue and profit targets for the full year, an accomplishment we are proud of meeting or exceeding every year since we announced our 2020 Vision.","In fact, since the first quarter of 2010, and the start of our 2020 Vision, during one of the most difficult macroeconomic environments in recent history, we have firstly grown our daily servings by more than $200 million serving more consumers daily on a global basis than at any other time in our history.","Secondly, increased our global volume and value share of both, our Spark or our core sparkling and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages to their highest levels since 2003, and thirdly we added over $30 billion to our company's market capitalization.","We are well on our way to doubling our systems' revenues by 2020 to $200 billion, reflecting the ongoing commitment of our entire global system to keep investing together for a better tomorrow, and we are crystal-clear on why we do what we do, so it is our mission to refresh the world, inspire moments of optimism and happiness and to create sustainable value while making a lasting difference.","This year, we once again led industry growth and expanded our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic, ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio was up 3% for the full year. This is the third straight year our sparkling beverages had grown by at least 550 million incremental cases. This has added more than 13 billion new servings annually to our global business for the past three. This growth of our sparkling beverages has consistently and reliably been led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew a very healthy 3% for the full year of 2012.","We also gained global share in still beverages with our portfolio growing a solid 10% for the full year. This year, this full year growth was led by POWERADE and DASANI, which were both up double digits and our Glaceau trademark brands, which were up mid-single digits. In fact, our still beverage portfolio growth was well-balanced with mid-single to double-digit growth across every single still beverage category in which we compete.","As we have shared for some time now, we recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects of a still uncertain global economy. 2012 saw the extension of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing transition of the economy in China [one] recovery in the United States and ongoing challenges for Japanese consumers.","We expect this volatility to extend through 2013. Having said, the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage category on the whole continues to be vibrant and grow in line with the levels we forecasted when we first developed our 2020 Vision. Our experience also teaches us that it is critical to seize opportunities during these uncertain times in order to lead and to succeed in any macro environment. To do so, we will together with our bottling partners keep investing in our business, so that we not only grow bigger, but also we grow better, better at collaborating, better at innovating and better at listening to our consumers and customers as well as bottling partners. And most importantly, better at executing with precision. So, while 2013 will once again be a year of challenges, we are confident that we will continue to generate consistent quality growth in this, the fourth year, of our 2020 Vision.","So now, let us review our performance results across our global markets in more detail beginning first with North America flagship market. Our business in North America delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of growth, up 1% for the quarter and 2% for the full year. As a result, our North America business achieved its best ever full-year volume sales results. In addition, we sustained 2% positive price mix in 2012, resulting in our North America beverage business generating 6% full-year comparable currency neutral net revenue growth. Importantly, we achieved this growth while also realizing full-year volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.","In fact, since we initiated our 2020 Vision back at the end of 2009, our U.S. business has seen consumer dollar spent across measured channels increase from approximately $56 to $60 per person in 2012. This represents over $1.5 billion of value created by our brand portfolio in these measured channels alone. I am personally very pleased with our ability to deliver quality results, as well as to consistently create real value across our entire North America business.","This year's growth in North America was led by our still beverage portfolio which was up 8% in both the quarter and also for the full year. This is the fifth consecutive year that our North America still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained, both volume and value share.","Our POWERADE brand grew double digits in both the quarter and for the full year making this POWERADE's third consecutive year of double-digit growth. More importantly, POWERADE is the North America sports drink category in both absolute volume and value growth for full year 2012. This was further evidenced of how today's consumers are increasingly demonstrating a growing preference for this innovative sports drinks brand.","Our premium Smartwater brand achieved a fifth straight year of double-digit growth. Our juice and juice drinks portfolio also delivered a year of positive growth with our Simply trademark up 7% on a full-year basis. As such our total juice and juice drinks portfolio gained volume and value share in both the quarter and full-year.","Finally, our tea portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up double digits while gaining volume and value share in both the quarter and full year. This result was led by Gold Peak which was up 36% in 2012 cycling 48%, making this Gold Peak's sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Our sparkling beverage business in North America delivered absolute value growth in 2012 with full year in volume down 1% offset by a positive 2% price mix. Importantly, our strategy to provide meaningful and purposeful choice to consumers continued to yield benefits.","Our core sparkling beverage immediate consumption transactions were up 1% for the full year enabling us to capture sparkling beverage volume and value share in North America in both the quarter and for the full year. Coke Zero sustained its momentum, up high single digits for the full year. We also saw accelerated growth in Fanta, which was up mid-single digits for the full-year.","As we look ahead, we remain positive that North America is the long-term growth market for our sparkling beverage business. We will keep investing in the category and in our winning sparkling portfolio and continue to promote active, healthy well-being in all the communities that we proudly serve.","Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% in the quarter and for the full year. The incremental volume we generated in Latin America this year was equivalent to adding a business the size of Canada to this region's volume base. Our total business in Latin America set a new record with volume sales exceeding 8 billion unit cases or the equivalent of 192 billion servings on a full-year basis for the first time in our company's history.","Our sparkling beverages in Latin America grew a healthy 3% in 2012 with brand Coca-Cola also up 3% both for the quarter and for the full year. Also our still beverages in Latin America delivered double-digit growth in both the quarter and for the full year. These well-balanced results translated into Latin America capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages for the eighth consecutive year.","We also saw balanced result across all four of our Latin American business units, each generating mid to high single-digit growth for the full year. Our two largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, were both up a solid 5% this quarter, while also growing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. On a full-year basis Mexico was up 4% supported by consistent brand Coca-Cola growth, up 8% in the quarter and the full year. Brazil grew 6% for the full year with sparkling beverages up mid-single digits in both, the quarter and the full year. And last December, also three of our bottling partners in Brazil, including two operated by our Bottling Investments Group, signed an agreement to combine their operations. When completed, this transaction is going to you create the second-largest Coca-Cola bottling operations in Brazil. The proposed combination with former company with a greater ability to invest in the market and accelerate growth, reflecting our franchise systems' continued evolution in our system's commitment to long-term sustainable growth in Brazil.","Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 2% in the quarter and 5% for the full year. In Japan, our full year volume grew 2% in line with the outlook we provided in our previous earnings calls. This resulted in our business in Japan delivering a third consecutive year of record high sales volumes. Our business in Japan also gained full year share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. This result was driven by volume growth across most channels, including drugstores, convenience retail outlet and supermarkets.","I am also proud to announce that Ayataka, our premium green tea brands as well as LOHAS, our innovative water brand achieved $1 billion brand status in late 2012. These are the fourth and fifth billion dollar brands we have added to our portfolio since announcing our 2020 Vision. Also, with regard to Japan, last December the four Japanese bottlers from the Greater Kanto region announced an agreement to merge into one integrated and publicly listed company called Coca-Cola East Japan.","While this agreement is still pending final approval by each of the four bottlers shareholders, once compete, Coca-Cola East Japan will become our fifth largest global bottling partners in terms of annual revenue. We support this bottler led consolidation in Japan, and see it as one example of net of the many ways our franchise system continues to evolve in full alignment with our 2020 Vision.","Moving now to China, during our last earnings call we shared our clear expectations that China's ongoing economic transition will have a short-term impact on our industry and on our business. Since then we've seen disposable consumer spending remain quite challenged in China, especially in the export-driven coastal areas where higher proportion of our beverages are proceeding. As a result, our China volume was down 4% in the fourth quarter, also impacted by unseasonably poor weather, the cycling of double-digit growth from last year and the timing of the Chinese New Year.","On a full-year basis, our volume in China grew mid-single digits, cycling double-digit growth from last year. Our strong sparkling beverage portfolio in China continued to expand our nearly 2 to 1 share advantage over our time ridge international competitor. This portfolio is very well-positioned in China with leading brands in every major sparkling flavor categories, including Sprite number one sparkling brand in China, Coca-Cola recently rated by Chinese consumers as their most favorite brand and Fanta, which registered double-digit growth in 2012 exceeding 100 million annual unit cases for the first half. And, we are committed to investing and innovating across our broader still beverage portfolio in China to strengthen our presence across all categories.","As we look ahead to 2013, we still expect the ongoing uncertainty in China to have a short-term impact on our industry and on our business, although we do expect to see improvements in consumer disposable income as the year progresses. As such from here on, we expect our business to deliver sequential improvement in 2013. As we had stated before, we have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our China business and we remain very excited about our long-term opportunities in distribution.","Across the rest of the Pacific Group, we realized several new milestone performances in fast-growing markets. South Korea was up double digits in 2012 with our business sales achieving over 200 million annual unit cases for the first half. Thailand, also delivered double-digit growth, up 22% for the full year resulting in record value share and full year unit case volume results.","Philippines also achieved strong results, growing 5% for the full year while also capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. As many of you know, we recently sold 51% of our bottling business in the Philippines to Coca-Cola FEMSA. While every bottling transaction is unique, this transaction is yet another example of our long-standing and fundamental belief in the strength of our global franchise system. We look forward to this new partnership with Coca-Cola FEMSA as we jointly invest and further strengthen our business in the Philippines to create sustainable, long-term growth and value.","Our Eurasia and Africa business also extended its strong momentum, growing a very solid 10% in the quarter and up 11% for the full year including full year double-digit growth for brand Coca-Cola. During both the quarter and the full year, our business in Eurasia and Africa grew both volume and value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.","On a country level, Russia was one of the key drivers of this group's performance up 8% in 2012 led once again by outstanding growth of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 20% for the full year. The momentum behind our Dobriy juice brand accelerated further with 13% growth for the full year. Viewed in total, we have outpaced the nonalcoholic ready-to drink-industry in Russia grew for three consecutive quarters. As a result, our business in Russia now has achieved an all-time high market share.","Our business in India, which grew 16% on a full-year basis, continued its long stretch of strong growth realizing both volume and value share gains across both sparkling and still beverage. Importantly, India has now delivered six consecutive years of double-digit volume growth starting back in 2007.","Moving now to Europe. Our business was down 5% in the quarter and was down 1% for the full year reflecting the region's ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. While we recognize the real challenges of today's European environment, it is important place our results in the proper context and to recognize the resiliency of our industry and our business in Europe. Since the start of 2009, when austerity measures, unemployment and fiscal concerns began to weigh heavily European consumer confidence, Europe has seen a GDP decline.","In contrast during the same four year period, our business in Europe has outpaced the broader industry making our company one of a select few able to deliver positive growth between 2009 and 2012. We successfully grew our business in Germany up 1% in 2012, despite cycling 6% growth in 2011, while gaining full year share in nonalcoholic beverages. This makes it three consecutive years that Germany has deliver full year volume growth. As such we remain confident that our business in Germany is in a sound position and capable of delivering long-term sustainable growth.","Looking ahead, we expect Europe's economic uncertainty to extend well into 2013. At the same time, we expect that the European economy and consumer sentiment will gradually improve that our business is well-positioned to return to volume growth as that occurs. We are also confident that our leadership team and our system will keep investing to outperform the industry in 2013 as Europe continues along the road to recovery.","Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to highlight our company's sustained efforts and result to work to find meaningful solutions to the conflict issue of obesity. There is an important conversation going on about obesity and we want to be part of the solution. Together with partners in government, civil society, our own industry and other business, I am personally committed to leveraging all our resources to lead and make a difference here. We are committed to use evidence-based science to guide the choices we offer. We are committed to investing in innovation of our sweeteners, products, packaging and equipment that fosters active, healthy living. We are committed to bringing real choice to consumers everywhere and educating them on how the choices we offer can play a role in a sensible balanced diet and active, healthy lifestyles. We are committed to transparency about the nutritional content of our products and we are committed to responsible marketing of our products.","In closing, we are pleased that our business has done so well in recent years and that we remain well on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. Together, we as a system have delivered on our priorities and we are achieving real success. With passionate commitment and our collective focus, we are propelling ourselves forward during these challenging economic and social times.","As we look back to January 2010, we began our 2020 Vision, we had reasons to be proud of our collective achievement and yet remain constructively discontent. We completed new largest transaction in our history leading to the formation of Coca-Cola Refreshments in North America. We added five new $1 billion brand our portfolio. We maintained Coca-Cola as the world's most valuable brand and distinction is earned from very Interbrand every year since 2000, and we launched multiple programs to support the global communities we serve such as our 5x20 initiative to empower 5 million women by 2020 and provide entrepreneurial training to help growth the local businesses.","All that said, we are keenly aware of how today's turbulent economic landscape is likely to extend through this year. As such, our 2013 strategic priorities remain absolutely clear. First will continue to grow sustainably and provide meaningful solutions that enhance the health and well-being of the community we proudly serve.","Second, we will win with Coca-Cola while actively promoting the brand and the category. Third, we must absolutely keep winning and executing with excellence with point-of-sale. Fourth, we need to keep maximizing the value of our global beverage portfolio. And sixth, we will encourage and inspire our system and associates to deliver our mission and our vision.","So, there is still a great runway ahead of us both, for our sparkling beverages as well as across the entire range of our broader portfolio. After all, global consumer expenditures are expected to grow strongly between 2013 and 2012, driven by further economic growth in developing emerging countries as well as expected middle class expansion in populous economies.","So, while we are proud of our strong record of delivering results through the first three years of our 2020 Vision, we know that we are really just getting started. All of us at the Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola System remain diligent about what we need to do in order to achieve our results and to effectively and efficiently manage our business for sustainable long-term success for all our stakeholders.","With that let me now turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Fayard","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to have once again delivered quality performance results in 2012, making this seventh straight year that our volume and operating income results have been in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. Achieving such consistent performance during a time of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty is a real testament to our global systems' ability to execute our strategic priorities and alignment with our 2020 Vision.","Therefore, we remain confident that we will continue to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets.","So let's review our results in more detail starting with our comparable earnings per share which came in at $0.45 this quarter, up 15% versus the prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share came in at $2.01, up 5% despite facing what we estimate was about a 4% currency headwind for the full year.","Our comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 5% in the quarter. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind. Our full year comparable currency neutral net revenue growth was up 6% in line with our long-term growth target. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on our full-year net revenue results was a 3% headwind.","Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up double digits this quarter consistent with the outlook that we shared in our earnings call last quarter. As Muhtar shared a few moments ago, on a full-year basis our comparable currency neutral operating income came in at 6% as expected and in line with our long-term growth target.","During our last few earnings call we shared a more specific full year 2012 outlook across several financial items to help those of you who model our business. I am pleased to say the results were right in line with or slightly ahead of the outlook that we provided. So I want to take a moment to recap these results and where applicable provide more and further insight into our full year 2013 outlook.","With regard to volume growth, our full year 2012 concentrate sales growth was in line with our full year unit case volume growth as per our comments last quarter. Our consolidated price mix was up 1% for the full year 2012 consistent with our prior year full year outlook. For 2013, we expect to keep earning low single-digit consolidated price mix as called for on our long-term growth model as we continue executing our occasion-based brand, price, package and channel strategies with precision around the world.","Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were up 5% on a full-year basis. This increase in SG&A reflects our ongoing commitment to keep investing for a better tomorrow as we grew our direct marketing expenses in 2012, while simultaneously capturing incremental marketing efficiencies. We also added additional feet on the street, primarily in North America, to ensure support of our growing business in this important market. Our SG&A results for the quarter and full year also included a benefit from the reversal of certain expenses related to our long-term incentive plans as well as a one point unfavorable impact of structural items primarily in our Bottling Investments Group and in North America.","Our full year comparable gross margin was roughly in line with the estimate we provided during our previous earnings calls. Our operating expense leverage was a positive nine points this quarter as we benefited from having two additional selling days. The full year operating expense leverage came in at a positive one point. For 2013, we expect our positive operating expense leverage to be even to slightly positive as we sustain our strategic investments in brand building activities around the world and efficiently manage our operating expenses.","As you as you model our 2013 operating results and our corresponding operating expense leverage, let me also remind everyone that our 2013 calendar will have one less day when compared to 2012, specifically our first quarter 2013 will have two less days when compared to the first quarter of 2012, then the fourth quarter of 2013 will have one more day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Moving now to net interest which came in at a positive $31 million in the fourth quarter. This was ahead of our initial expectations and raised our full-year net interest income to $74 million. For 2013 our best estimate is that net interest will come in as an expense ranging between $30 million and $50 million for the full year of 2013. We will update this outlook each quarter as we move through the year.","For 2012, underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24% and we expect the tax rate for 2013 to be approximately the same. Our cash flow from operations increased 12% on the full year 2012 partially benefiting from favorable timing relating to certain working capital items. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate.","Now let me take a moment to update on impact of several additional items that may help you model our business in 2013 starting with commodities. Incremental cost related to our big four commodities, which are sweeteners, metals, juices and PET came in at around $225 million for the full year 2012 in line with what we had provided previously.","Looking ahead to 2013, and after considering our hedge positions, we anticipate a more moderate year of commodity inflation with incremental related to our big four commodities coming in at closer to $100 million. As for currencies, we saw headwinds of 4% on our fourth quarter comparable operating income and 5% for the full year 2012, our comparable operating income, consistent with our previously provided an outlook.","In preparing for 2013, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling, and also have the near-term coverage in place across several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, current spot rates and last week devaluation announcement in Venezuela, we now expect currencies to be a 4% headwind on operating income for the first quarter of 2013, and at even minus 1% headwind for the full year, but it would even quarter before Venezuela maybe slightly negative with Venezuela.","We'll also report a $100 million to $225 million devaluation loss in the first quarter related to the monetary asset held in Venezuela. Our normal practice, we'll update our currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go through 2013.","Our full year share repurchases net of employee option exercises totaled $3.1 billion in 2012, just slightly above the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range we communicated at the outset of the year. In 2013, we expect our net share repurchases to range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion.","Now let me take a moment to highlight a few other items that will also inform you about our business in 2013. First, as previously announced starting this year, we will have organized our company around three major operating businesses. Coca-Cola International, consisting of Europe, the Pacific and Eurasia and Africa operations. Coca-Cola Americas, consisting of our North America and Latin American operations, and our bottling investments group, which will continue to oversee our company-owned bottling operations outside of North America.","As this organizational change does not impact our reporting segments, we'll continue to disclose of performance results for all five geographic operating groups as well as for our Bottling Investment Group. That said, starting with the first quarter 2013, we will reflect our India and Southwest Asian business results within our specific operating group instead of within our Eurasia and Africa operating groups.","Prior to our to our next earnings call, we will provide information reclassifying the last three years of our results for these two geographic operating groups to facilitate through historical comparison of our results to our future results.","Second, as previously mentioned by Muhtar, there have been several transactions announced these past few months, including bottler mergers in Japan and Brazil and the sale of 51% of our bottling business in the Philippines. To be clear, we do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results. However, these actions will generate a structural headwind on our year-over-year net revenue and operating income growth rates. As such, we anticipate these transactions to have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenue. Likewise our full year operating income results should be a 1% structural impact with this decline offset by a corresponding improvement in equity income. As I mentioned, we do not see these transactions having a material impact on 2013 earnings per share.","As a final update and as part of our previously announced global productivity and reinvestment program, we are reorganizing our Coca-Cola Refreshments business in the United States to align itself and operating functions around three geographies. Ws. We take this action as part of our consistent effort to improve our processes and systems and to ensure greater operating effectiveness and productivity across our North American operations. This new alignment is in keeping with the ongoing evolution of our North American business model as we invest even further to enhance our capabilities and deliver against our 2020 Vision.","In closing and as Muhtar said earlier, we are delivering on our strategic priorities and achieving real success. As we move into 2013, our global bottling system is healthier than ever, and our financial priorities remain clear. We will invest in our core business with plans to spend around $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2013. We will strategically invest with our global bottling system to increase our share position across key growth categories. We will pay a healthy dividend and as previously announced we will repurchase shares between $3 billion and $3.5 billion in 2013.","Our system is committed to investing together for a better tomorrow and our proven ability to achieve consistent quality results provides us with the confidence that we will continue to successfully execute our growth strategies with precision in line with our 2020 vision.","Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that Ahmet, Steve and I look forward to seeing you when we present at the upcoming CAGNY conference in Boca Raton on Friday, February 22 and Irial and I also look forward to being with you when we present together at the CAGE conference in London on Tuesday, March 19.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Muhtar, I know you have been doing a lot of globe hopping recently. So maybe you can just talk about the global macro, maybe some granularity about regional growth rates. I know you were at Sochi and Davos, just can you give us some color on how you sense things are going to trend over the next year. I know you have kind of covered this but maybe some more granularity?","Muhtar Kent","Yes, Bill, I think I have recently been to Korea, to Australia, in the last 10 days to also Southern Russia and Sochi but I think essentially in Europe there is a sentiment there that people are beginning to feel that it is not going to get any worse, that there will be some expansion happening as we move forward and sort of just purely fiscal restraint and monetary restraint. So that feeling is beginning to emerge but I think it is going to be long recovery.","Certainly in China we are seeing the transition happened from a purely export led economy to one that is more balanced with consumer spending and a combination consumer spending as well as export led, a balanced economy I think there was challenges in that transition initially where there was a divergence between GDP growth and pure disposable incomes for a while but I think, long-term that\u2019s going to be very beneficial for every one, this transition in China.","I think in general Japan is going to also, the consumer sentiment will continue to be mobile and volatile there and it is subdued. For the rest of the world, whether it's Africa, the youngest billion, Latin America, Eurasia, our Middle East, we see and of course, Asia, Southeast Asia and other parts of Asia, Indian subcontinent, we see growth, we see very disciplined, monetary policy, balanced budgets, good banking system and the consumer is more positive, and so it's modeled, and it's mixed here into United States, we see some signs of improvement.","We need to wait and evaluate the impact of the payroll taxes as well as the higher gasoline prices. It's too early to say that it's a recovery that is at best look on, but we feel that it could get better. That's how we see the world, and based on that we continue to invest for opportunity, we continue to invest based on our long-term models and plans with our bottling partners to continue to generate both, volume, top line and income growth.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks very much. Then a follow-up with the change in the structure of CCR North America, I mean, does this change your philosophy on sort of how long you are going to own the asset and maybe how it's going to be operated going forward.","Muhtar Kent","Sorry. Are you talking about just the restructuring?","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Exactly, three different regions, I guess there were seven businesses and now there is three. Does that change your view on how long that asset stays with GCC?","Muhtar Kent","Yes. It's got nothing to do with that that at all. Think if it as last year we announced a new productivity reinvestment program that includes continued synergies from our North America CCR, Coca-Cola Refreshment operations to be able to enable us to continue to invest in our brands to grow in North America, 11 consecutive quarters of growth.","When we first talked about growth in North America back in '09, people thought that we were trying to go to the moon without lighter, and now its reality 11 quarters of consecutive growth and we intend to continue that. We see this as a growth market and therefore enabled us to continue to invest in our brands. This is just ordinary course of business. Think about it exactly like that","It's not a big deal, ordinary course of business and therefore it's got nothing to do with the United States' bottling structure. It's just part of our ongoing business and I'll have Steve Cahillane is here with me on this call, as well as, Ahmet Bozer in area of finance, so I can ask Steve to also comment.","Steve Cahillane","Yes. You said it very well. This is very much an effectiveness play. Two years ago, when we put these businesses together, we had a simple mantra. First was, we're going to make it work. Then we were going to make it better than then we were going to make it best. We've learned a lot over the course of last two-and-a-half years. One of our most successful organizations is our food service organization, which is aligned around three geographic units. we're moving our national retail sales and our field sales organization also around the same two units which will really build our total efficiency and effectiveness, our ability to work together, our ability to continue to invest in this market, invest against our brands, put more feet on the street, so we are very excited about new organization in Bangalore, to get us from making it better to making it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to re-clarify one thing first Gary. Hitting the long-term FX neutral operating profit target you expect to do that in 2013 as well as in the long run. And then in with closing euro operating expense leverage guided for '13 despite the savings, you're signaling step up spending, so just want to get an idea of where you are focusing that incremental spending on. Thanks.","Gary Fayard","Thanks, Bill. Yes. And, I was trying to be pretty clear, but let me be very clear. We expect to hit our long-term growth target targets both, in 2013 and long-term. That applies to 2013 as well, so we are comfortable with that and we would expect to be able to deliver that. The second thing is, we have always had demand to invest through a crisis. We've been in a global crisis for a number of years now, but we've got history and we've seen what happens when you invest through the crisis when you come at the other end, as Muhtar says, we see things slowly improving across the globe, but we expect to come out that the other end much stronger than we were even going in. And so, we are going to continue to drive efficiencies, productivity and then reinvestment that back to grow the business and growing the brand. The brands are stronger than they have ever been but we think we can drive it even further. So we are going to continue to invest behind the brands.","Muhtar Kent","Just one point to add on that, Bill. I always say, as you go up the air gets thinner. Always remember, we are adding on top of significant increases from prior years all the time. Just on sparkling beverages alone, we have added over 0.5 billion cases each year. So we are cycling that every year and we are continuing to grow. I think that is really important and in three years, the worse that gets probably macroeconomic environment we have seen for a long time, we were able to generate volume growth in line with our growth expectations, revenue growth in line with our growth expectations and income growth and generating record revenues of $48 billion record income as well as record cash flow. So I think it needs to be taken into that context. Continue to crack the calculus for growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","So, Muhtar, I know you spoke a lot about the macro environment but maybe you can speak a little bit about the competitive environment particularly around U.S. sparkling, China and parts of Western Europe where you have seen some step up in competitive pressure and how that's affected your volume performance and how you see that trending in 2013?","Muhtar Kent","I think in the United States where, as you have heard, we continued to gain both volume and value share. All over the world, our share is at an all-time high. Everywhere across the world in NARTD as well as in the different categories that were operating in and competing in and we choose to compete in. Similarly in China in sparkling we have widened our gap to our nearest international competitor in sparkling. In Europe, I there has been a month or two where we have had some challenges but overall for the whole year, we have again gained share across the whole of broader Europe, in Western Europe as well as Eastern Europe and in Southeast Europe across the whole continent, in both volume and value share.","To be frank, we see competition is healthy and it keeps us on our toes, it keeps us executing better and being better, becoming more efficient and more productive and all we strive every single day as the business system together with our assembly by bottlers around the world as we strive to get better at making decisions, quicker so that we can be more nimble and more innovative. As you know we have launched more than 800 types of different products over the last four or five years.","Many of them are new innovative products that are gaining great traction as they are in the United States. Look at the performance of our still business. Look at the relative performance of our sparkling business. I mentioned that between 2009 and 2012, spend per person on our brands went up from $56 to $60. So transactions are up the United States.","Our brand, price, package and channel allocation architecture is working in the United States. So both in China transactions are ahead of our volume as well as in the United States immediate consumption business. So judge us not only by pure volume, judge us by the quality of our volume and transaction growth. We sell and the end-consumers buy packages and products, a combination of packages and products, each one at a time. They don\u2019t buy liters. So that is really important thing to understand and how we think about it.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then Gary just following up on currency guidance for the full year. So it seems like the first quarter guidance is actually a little bit worse than I thought. So can you just help us understand, is that based on our hedge position and with the Yen moving pretty sharply how much are you hedge spending in?","Gary Fayard","Judy, we are actually fully hedged on the Yen, Euro and Sterling. So coming back to the last Yen position that we have are actually on the money, they are in a good place. So that\u2019s not an issue. When you look at the first quarter, it was actually, I said 4%, it was pre-Venezuela, 4.5%. So the Venezuela devaluation obviously is a big one when devalued 50%. So that's number one. But number two, the real impact is not what you would expect. It's not the yen, the impact are the rates that were cycling in the emerging markets particularly, Latin America. If you look at Brazil, look at Mexico, goes look at the rate at early last year and then they started devaluing South Africa as well.","So, if you look at those you will see improving trend, so towards the latter part of 2013, based on where spot is today, we actually turned positive all with kind of even to minus 1 for the full year, but it's frontend loaded negative and then it is improving throughout the year.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","And then on Venezuela, Gary, just the impact you are purely looking at translational impact or some sort of margin impact as you have the pricing control in place?","Gary Fayard","We've got a wealth of monitor assets. That was 100 to 125, and so if you look in the Wall Street Journal article this morning, we just were on a list of other companies that have the same issue, so that's kind of a one-time items, but I am just telling you has occurred, will occur. Then the translation impact of the revenues will be about 1% drag in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Faucher with JPMC.","John Faucher - JPMC","Thank you. Just two questions here. Gary, just sort of more of a housekeeping type of thing, as you look at the commentary on the net interest line, it seems as though that can create a situation and there is probably not much leverage if any below the operating lines. If you could just sort of confirm that.","And then secondly, as we look at the organic top line growth in terms of just simply the bottler case sales, volume less price mix decelerated. It looks like to me at least every quarter this year, so can you talk about how you see that trending up as we go through the course of 2012. You got difficult comparisons in the first half of the year, and sort of how that's going to play into your comfort level of hitting that 6% to 8% currency neutral operating profit target. Thanks.","Gary Fayard","Sure, John. Yes. Let me see if I can get the first half of your question. First, the low operating income growth, you are right, because we will see net interest flow from interest income to interest expense. There are a couple of things going on in there. Primarily its rates and just rates are down, particularly in some of the emerging markets where we've got some cash, which was generating a lot of interest income. You saw that happening during the latter part of this year and all the reason that interest income was actually a lot better than in the fourth quarter than I told you to expected to be was actually we put on some interest rate swap hedges a couple of years ago. There is a small ineffectiveness piece to that hedge and ineffective piece has to go through the P&L. That was actually pretty large this quarter, positive and it gave us lot of interest income, so that's part of what you are seeing.","In equity income, you are going to get some leverage just going to be up because of structural items that talked about from some of the transactions that have occurred. Then if we go to the second half of your question was tell me again?","John Faucher - JPMC","Just looking at the deceleration in the organic top line growth and again how that maps out over the course of the year and the comfort on, let's say, the 6% there?","Gary Fayard","Well, I think there are a couple of different things. There, I think, we are going to see improving and slowly improving trends in many of the markets around the world. Europe, I think, will improve. My expectation is that Europe will improve in 2013 from well, we had pretty good improvement from the fourth quarter of 2012. So I would say, you are going to actually see sequential improvement in Europe, you are going to see sequential improvement in China for sure.","I think that U.S. is poised now also in a pretty good place. Number one, I think, volumes in 2012 dipped a little bit in the fourth quarter. Our view is that is not the start of a trend. We think that just it happened but it is not the start of a trend and we would expect volume actually to be okay in 2013 and we think it will sequentially start coming back and be better and be okay in 2013.","Irial Finan","John, just to add on that. I think very little is always said about the 120 or so countries which have a per capita around 125 in our business where volume growth for just 2012 will again 7%. These countries represented about a little more than one third of our total global volumes. Countries that we never talk about. Whether it is Sub-Sahara or whether it is in Asia or Middle East or Central Asia and so forth. But we grew in these countries 9% in 2010, 7% in 2011, 7% in 2012. We keep on growing. This is the beauty of our portfolio, in fact. So while you may have a quarter where China doesn\u2019t grow, or where Europe doesn\u2019t grow, we still continue to be able to deliver on our long-term growth model, both volume and also for revenues. Imagine what would have happened to our volume if Europe did grow this past quarter and China. So this is that the benefit of having this portfolio which is getting stronger and bigger as we continue to invest with our bottling partners in alignment.","John Faucher - JPMC","Okay, and then finally one housekeeping question. Gary you mentioned the equity income line. That\u2019s coming out of the operating profit line. So as you look at hitting your target, I am assuming that\u2019s before the bottler deconsolidation, right? So that 6% to 8%, minus one for the bottler minus one for the FX, is kind of how we should look at it?","Gary Fayard","Yes, John. That is exactly right. So when I said, hit the target, we hit the target before structural but then you would have to adjust for structural. That's with pretax or net income being sign. This is just what is the geographies within the P&L.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Can you give us a little bit more of a sense of against the go forward evolution of the brands globally and in the U.S.? If you look at Germany, that strength this quarter and you wanted to do some system changes there, Japan showing inconsistent changes and that\u2019s a struggle, China is struggling a little bit and there were competitive system changes there, also the U.S. sparkling bottling just got tough and you have got it back to a year ago. Gary has pointed volume trends are a trend or not, it just seems that given all that, you might actually for next few years with very large changes through the Coca-Cola system and the industry overall, so if you were to close your eyes and see with us, how would you see the structure of the system of the future looking versus what it is today?","Gary Fayard","Ali, I have always said that the fact that we are a total believer in the franchise system. It is a beautiful system when you get to work as we have aligned in four divisions, aligned with its goals and aligned in its ownership objectives and goals. That\u2019s what we have. Therefore we will continue to drive this bottling system with an aligned vision which we have. As I said, we have got three years that we have accomplished that and seven years to go and we are confident that we can continue to accomplish.","As we move through the system, you have already heard us talk about what we see in the business for the U.S. system where we have a role, again, for our bottling partners. We still have the same time table for that. I won't repeat that the time table was. We said about four to five years since the time that we close the transaction and you can figure we still believe that this doable.","As we move along different parts of the world, you see us creating stronger systems like Brazil, stronger systems like Kanto. That is a huge milestone in the 55 year history of our Japanese business getting the four Kanto bottlers to unite and to take cost out of it and continue to invest to drive top line growth for our system.","You will see us doing well as we move forward. Again refranchising Philippines is another example, so don't think of this as seismic changes in our bottling system. We will continue to fine-tune and evolve as needed as necessary to drive the goals that we have outlined.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","It's helpful, I guess I am still struggling with what can we look forward to changes in terms of not being as reactionary, but maybe thinking going forward and maybe if you can help me? You mentioned the U.S. you mentioned a little while ago, so it's been about two years since you closed the CCE North America transaction.","Can you give us a sense of where you think you are ahead of plan and where you are behind plan? Certainly for many investors this quarter was probably (inaudible) because operating margin starts inflect positively, but is it sustainable without any more meaningful restructuring and bigger things? How do you think about the volume trends we have been seeing so far in sparkling when that changes anything how you think not reactionarily, but going forward about the structures here. A different example of.","Gary Fayard","Well, first, let me just say everywhere we are doing, none of it is reactionary to these four, whether it's Brazil, whether it's Philippines, whether it's Japan and we've got more to talk about too, we are not in a position to talk about right now. All of that is actually prices and U.S. is all about prices. And I can tell you very clearly, once again that as I mentioned in Judy's question judges not only by the meters, judges also by the transaction, judges by how we are doing in terms of value of the business that we are creating and the consumer spend that's coming into our business into our brand and the health of our brands. This is ultimately a brand business. Our brands are healthier than they have ever been both, in sparkling as well as in still beverages.","So, I repeat, we see opportunities in the United States for us to keep growing and also for us to keep generating value in both sparkling and in still beverages, and that's how we see it and whatever it takes for us to be able to investment, proactive long-term investment is the key, whatever it takes for us to be able to continue our targeted thoughtful, purposeful investments you will see us continuing to do that, so that we our brands remain healthy, our system remains nimble and flexible as far as rest the market as far as production NSR distribution.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Hi, good morning. A kind of question on just the productivity program, just really looking for an update. First, I think if you test the two elements of it, both what was initially announced last year plus the extension of the CCR integration, your expectation was $550 million to $650 million annualized savings by the end of 2015, so is that still the same or has there been any change to what you are expecting in terms of total savings?","Gary Fayard","Bryan, this is Gary. No changes at all. You are exactly right. What we announced the beginning of last year productivity and reinvestment was $550 million to $650 million. The total company, including North America we are still on track in fact well on track on that program. It was a 2012 through 2015 program and we are continuing to execute against that.","So, we are on track. We are taking the savings and from the supply chain optimization, the marketing effectiveness, operational excellence, data and that the system standardization was area of that of that whole program in addition to what we were doing in CCR, and we have taken that and we are reinvesting behind innovation as well as marketing of or brands. And that's still working well.","What we talked about in North America just today is just a normal part in evolution of that program and we'll continue to do that around the world to drive effectiveness, because it really helps in several different ways","It's not only about saving money. It's about operating more effectively, so we can operate faster. Being more productive means we can make decisions quicker and those are things we are driving for. We want to be fast, flexible and very big.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","How much did it continue to drive? How much savings did you drive in 2012?","Gary Fayard","Outside of North America, we probably had about $40 million to $50 million in savings in 2012. Then North America continues to drive synergies and doing fairly well against their part of their targets as well.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","It is fair to say you think certainly it will be a bigger, (inaudible) you pulled the savings to spend back than you had in '12?","Gary Fayard","Yes, it will be.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Okay, and then just one last one. Just how much, in terms of charges are you expecting to take over the life of the plan relative to the savings?","Gary Fayard","Let me, Brain, answer it this way. As we continue to update you on where we are how big the plan is. So we will call it back to the 650 today but as you know, a few years ago, we had another program as well that we concluded and started this one. So we continue to look for efficiencies and effectiveness. But everything we look at when we evaluated, we would expect that the one time cost ought to be in a ratio of no more of 1 to 1.5:1 payback. So you are taking about 12 to 18 months on something that\u2019s then continuous benefit to the P&L going forward.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson. In closing, we had a strong 2012 and we once again delivered quality full-year performance results. Our business continues to grow, even in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. Our system is aligned and it is on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. Together, we are consistently investing in our brands on a global scale through world-class marketing and commercial strategies.","As we get closer to the midpoint of our 2020 Vision, our system remains resolutely focused on refreshing our achievements, creating value for our customers, maintaining strong partnerships with our bottling partners, strategically investing for the future and expanding shareholder value. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company and for joining us on this call.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call with The Coca-Cola Company.

Finally, during today's call, when our senior executives refer to comparable performance, they are referring to comparable performance from continuing operations.","Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing one first and then reenter the queue.","Now, let me turn the call over to James.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We've had another solid quarter that has included a number of notable developments, from M&A to changes in our leadership team. And I'll come to all of that shortly, but let me start by focusing on our quarter and our year to-date performance.","We are gaining share in a growing industry. Industry growth has improved from last year, driven by better results across both developed and emerging markets. Some large emerging markets like China, India and Brazil, are clearly doing better. Others like Argentina, South Africa and the Middle East, are not doing so well. But collectively, we are seeing solid results.","We've been capturing more than our fair share of growth as we've continued to execute on our transformation as a total beverage company. And notably, the industry has seen better performance within the global sparkling soft drink category, delivering both volume and value growth year-to-date.","Turning to our operational performance, we are managing our business well across key dimensions. Organic revenue is up 5% year-to-date, driven by strength across all operating segments. Unit case volume is up 2%, led by Trademark Coca-Cola, which grew 3% globally. Comparable EPS is up 8% year-to-date, in line with our guidance of 8% to 10% for the full year.","This is despite significantly stronger currency headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of 2018. We accomplished this through a combination of top-line growth and productivity initiatives as driving underline margin expansion even as we continue to invest back in the marketing and face a rising cost environment.","Finally, our top and bottom-line growth is broad-based. Developed markets have grown organic revenues low single digits year-to-date, and our emerging and developing markets have grown double digits year-to-date.","Turning to our geographic performance in the quarter, in EMEA, we grew organic revenue 9%, benefiting from solid operational price\/mix as well as from geographic mix. During the quarter, we saw strong growth across Europe, driven by Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fuze Tea and innocent, all helped by good weather.","In some of the emerging and developing markets like Turkey and the Middle East, the macroeconomic environment is tough, but ongoing packaging and pricing initiatives are helping us deliver solid revenue growth while staying affordable.","Turning to Asia Pacific, despite cycling a more difficult comparison period, strong performance in China and India drove another quarter of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment. In Japan, a solid innovation pipeline was overshadowed by natural disasters in July and September, which included a flood that destroyed a production facility for our bottler, impacting our capacity. Looking ahead, we'll continue working closely with our bottler to minimize the impact and protect our position in the market.","In Latin America, we delivered 19% organic revenue growth for the quarter as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amid a variety of macroeconomic environments. Now worth noting, 9 points of that growth is due to the timing of concentrate shipments in Brazil, which will reverse out in the fourth quarter. However, even after adjusting for this timing element, we still delivered double-digit top-line growth in the quarter.","In Brazil, our business continued its recovery, with volume growth accelerating to 3% in the quarter, driven by positive performance in all category clusters. Argentina, on the other hand, faces increasingly challenging macro conditions, so we're focusing on expanding our returnable packaging infrastructure and adjusting our price\/pack architecture to maintain key price points and affordability. It's a playbook we understand, even one I've personally managed before.","Mexico. Mexico continues to perform well, benefiting from new product launches and strong growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, supported by solid execution from our bottling system.","Finally, North America, we continue to deliver strong performance in the marketplace and gain value share. During the quarter, our system took a price increase to address pressure from higher import and transportation costs. As a result, our price\/mix improved 3 points sequentially, resulting in a slight positive price\/mix for the first quarter this year.","And we continue to deliver strong performance, especially within the Zero Sugar portfolio. This, in turn, led to accelerated organic revenue growth of 2% and comparable operating income growth of 5% in the third quarter.","Now, let's talk a bit about how we're driving disciplined growth in the business. Of course, it all starts with the consumer. Over the last few calls, we've discussed how we've been leveraging innovations, like Coke with coffee, to grow our portfolio by addressing key consumption occasions. And also how we're lifting, shifting and scaling successful brands, like Fuze Tea, across multiple markets.","However, there are times when we need or want to look externally and leverage M&A to drive our total beverage portfolio. M&A, of course, is not a strategy in of itself. It's an enabler of our strategy. And while the focus of M&A continuously evolves, what's consistent is we remain disciplined about our allocation of capital and about the mission of M&A as an enabler.","Over the last few months, we've announced quite a few acquisitions and investments. Each one is part of our larger strategy to broaden our consumer-centric portfolio, but don't read too much into the number of transactions in a single quarter and extrapolate that as the pace of activity going forward.","We, of course, use M&A for many purposes: to fill gaps in our portfolio, yes; enter emerging categories; or even obtain capabilities or platforms that complement our existing strengths. And we look for opportunity to create value by scaling brands to be bigger and better than they already are.","In North America, we invested in BODYARMOR, a premium sports performance and hydration brand that's one of the fastest-growing beverage trademarks in the United States. In Australia, we purchased Organic & Raw Trading Company, which gives us MOJO, our first company-owned kombucha brand. And we invested in the Made Group, which is known for products like cold-pressed juice and high-protein smoothies.","In Europe, we purchased Tropico, which gives our French business a strong foothold in the still fruit-flavored beverages. We believe these brands that have strong edge will eventually allow us to gain quality leadership in the respective categories.","And, of course, our biggest announcement in the quarter was our pending acquisition of Costa. What we get with Costa is more than just a brand. It's a platform that will give us the ability to scale within the $500 billion global hot beverage category. Despite the size of Costa, our approach will be similar to the other deals, like innocent and Honest. We'll aim to preserve Costa's unique capabilities, while adding the strength of the Coca-Cola system.","As with all our M&A, completing the acquisition is only the first step. What is critical is accelerating our results and executing with precision.","To ensure we properly connect and globally scale key acquisitions, investments and partnerships, we have created a new group, Global Ventures, to be led by Jennifer Mann. In this newly-created position, Jennifer and her team will focus on ensuring we get the maximum value from acquisition and investments like Costa, our partnership with Monster Beverages, et cetera. This group will also partner with colleagues around the world to identify and nurture the next series of fast-growing opportunities.","As you'll recall, this was just one of the organizational changes we announced in mid-October. Now, more than ever, we must constantly adapt our business to the changing marketplace. The leadership changes we're making over the coming months are significant, and I believe that they will set us up for success in the years to come.","Beginning January 1, Brian Smith will become our President and Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Brian will bring an accelerated focus on the execution of our initiatives in the field, while I'll focus on the overall success of the company, as well as our long-term strategic direction.","Brian is a valued business partner with tremendous experience, most recently as Group President for Europe, Middle East & Africa. At a time when our business is fast-changing and more complex than ever, it's important to have a skilled executive who can focus intently on the success of our field operations. I can't think of a better fit than Brian.","We've also announced a succession plan for our Chief Financial Officer. Kathy, who's had a tremendous 32-year career at the company, will retire as CFO in March of next year. She'll be succeeded as CFO by John Murphy, who will begin the transition to his new job by serving as Deputy CFO starting January 1. John currently leads our Asia Pacific group and is a great choice for the vital work of overseeing our Finance organization. John's extensive experience includes financial, strategy and operational roles, so he's a natural fit to step in.","And, finally, we elected Nancy Quan as Chief Technical Officer. Nancy will join my leadership team to focus on product supply, strategic sourcing and technical governance as we evolve as a total beverage company. These changes led to a number of others that we also announced. And I'm pleased that our deep bench allows us to move a group of diverse, talented and experienced leaders into new roles quickly.","So, in summary, the global economy is still growing, but remains volatile. Some markets are getting better, while others are struggling as the economic cycle moves to a different phase. Our industry is growing, driven by both developed and emerging markets. And we are winning with momentum in our business. So, despite currency moving against us, we remain focused on delivering the earnings guidance we laid out at the beginning of the year.","Finally, I'd like to thank Kathy. While Kathy will be with us through next March, I would be remiss not to take a moment to thank her and acknowledge her outstanding career. Over her 32 years here at the company, Kathy has made significant contributions to both our company and the system, working her way from Financial Analyst all the way to the most senior Finance role in the company, truly, a testament to the value she has brought through every phase of her journey.","And as CFO for the past five years, she executed the company's financials through the extremely complex refranchising process and she is leaving a strong foundation for John to build on. And, finally, she has been a critical partner to me and I have appreciated all her valuable support. Thank you, Kathy.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. It has been a tremendous honor to serve as the Chief Financial Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. During my tenure with the company, I have seen our business evolve and grow from a sparkling beverage company with three principal brands to a total beverage company with numerous billion-dollar brands that span across all beverage categories.","It has also been a pleasure working for first Muhtar and now James. I'm excited for the future of the company. We have a great leadership team that will continue to build on and execute the company's strategy. And I'm particularly excited about the incoming CFO, John Murphy. John's experience and capabilities will allow him to be a great partner to James and a great leader for the Finance organization. So, I'm looking forward to working with my team as we close out the rest of 2018, and I look forward to working with John to ensure a smooth transition as he takes over in 2019.","Now, turning to our performance in the quarter, as James mentioned, we saw strong underlying growth, building on a solid first half. We delivered 6% organic revenue growth, driven by 4% concentrate shipments and 2% price\/mix. Concentrate shipments outpaced unit case volume growth by 2 points in the quarter. This was due largely to Brazilian bottlers building inventory as a precaution to any further supply disruptions in the country around the presidential elections and ahead of changes in local tax regulation. We anticipate this inventory build will reverse in the fourth quarter, as the elections are now completed and the tax regulation has been phased-in.","So strong organic revenue growth, combined with ongoing productivity measures and the timing of expenses, drove 20% underlying operating income growth in the quarter. While the underlying results are strong, as you know, our reported financials continue to be affected by accounting changes enacted at the beginning of this year, and from cycling bottler refranchising activity from last year. Our comparable operating margin increased 575 basis points due to refranchising and strong underlying performance, partially offset by an approximate 130 basis point impact from new accounting standards and currency.","Productivity helped drive a roughly 400 basis point expansion in underlying operating margins, with actions across all of our operating segments. However, we saw a particular benefit in our North America and Corporate segment due to Lean enterprise initiatives.","The accounting impact from the change in revenue recognition was roughly in line with our expectations. It's important to note that the impact varied significantly by operating segment. For example, Latin America saw over a 400 basis points benefit in its margins, while North America's margin was impacted by roughly 250 basis points. So I recognize that there are a lot of moving parts, but if you were to neutralize each of these effects, our underlying operating margins expanded about 400 basis points in the quarter and about 200 basis points for the year-to-date period.","Below the line, we benefited from a lower tax rate. In order to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full year expectation of 20.3%, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the quarter. So all-in, good operational performance, coupled with a timing benefit and a lower effective tax rate, resulted in comparable EPS of $0.58 in the quarter, up 14%, which includes an 8% unfavorable impact from currency.","So before turning to the fourth quarter, let me provide an update on bottler transactions. I am happy to announce that with the sale of our company-owned bottler in Canada at the end of the third quarter, we have now completed our North America bottler refranchising process. We've set ourselves up for the future with an energized bottling system that is bringing a renewed focus on their local markets.","In Asia, we expect to acquire 51% of our Philippines bottler from Coca-Cola FEMSA during the fourth quarter. This will become part of our Bottling Investments Group, which is now comprised primarily of Southwest and Southeast Asian bottlers. These two transactions should roughly offset each other, resulting in a minimal structural impact in our P&L in 2019.","In Africa, we are moving forward with the sales process for our company-owned bottler, but we now expect to sell an equity stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa in 2019 rather than in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Now turning to the remainder of this year, considering our performance year-to-date and despite an increasingly challenging currency environment, we are maintaining our guidance on organic revenue and comparable EPS growth. Specifically, we continue to expect organic revenue growth of at least 4% and comparable EPS growth of 8% to 10%. However, there are two elements within that guidance that are changing and then there's a third element that impacts phasing. While these balance each other for the full year, due to the timing of each, they do result in a shift between quarters.","So first, we expect the third quarter inventory buildup in our Brazilian bottlers to reverse in the fourth quarter. Second, we now expect to sell CCBA, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, in 2019 instead of in 2018. As such, a $0.02 structural benefit that we expected to receive from this transaction will now shift from the fourth quarter 2018 into our 2019 earnings.","Third, we now expect an effective tax rate of 20.3% for the full year versus our original estimate of 21%. Now while this will be a slight benefit to our fourth quarter earnings, it was a much larger benefit to our third quarter earnings. And this was because we needed to bring our year-to-date effective tax rate in line with our revised full year expectation. So as such, we recorded an effective tax rate of 19% in the third quarter. Now, taken together, these three changes represent a $0.03 unfavorable impact to fourth quarter earnings, while the full year does not change.","As always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each element in more detail as you build out your models for the year.","Turning to cash flow, we continue to expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $8 billion. And we remain disciplined in our capital allocation. We continue to expect to reinvest $1.7 billion in the business through capital expenditures. And we will return free cash flow to shareowners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and an expected $1 billion in net share repurchase.","So in summary, we delivered solid financial performance in both the quarter and year-to-date periods, and we remain focused on delivering full year comparable EPS within our previously-provided range of 8% to 10%. So, Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

And I think in the press release, there's a write-down that's been described there. And so, I guess my question is a couple of things. One, what's driving the write-down in CCBA? And how should we think about maybe how you're thinking about structuring a deal going forward? Is that just lower the price? Or you're thinking about different types of ownership structures? Just any update there would be helpful.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, want me to start? So, yeah, so the actual write-down was a function of the impairment indicators. So for accounting purposes, we have to look at all of our investments. And we do that at a certain time of year. And based upon the indicators, what happened with the macro environment, and particularly the currency devaluation in South Africa, drove us to have an impairment that we had to write down, basically. And it's not a function of trying to change the price to sell in the future. It's merely an accounting impairment.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, and I'm not sure that that radically changes how we're thinking about structuring the deal. We've got a number of conversations ongoing with different parties about how we might create a stronger system in South and East Africa.","If you invest in the emerging markets, you don't always expect a straight line. And that's kind of what's come through in the impairment driven by the macros, and as we've adapted to the sugar tax in the second quarter.","But our view of the long-term attractiveness of Africa, or the youngest billion, remains undimmed. And we think it's a very exciting asset. And so we're working with different parties on potential setups.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, everyone, good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Congrats, Kathy, on a great career from me as well.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, James, I, too, was hoping to maybe step away from the quarter a moment and just ask a question on how new initiatives are being prioritized across the system under the total beverages company strategy. And specifically, how you've been able to streamline potential points of friction between yourselves and your bottling partners.","Over the years, I guess, it seems to me, at least, like there have been many good intentions, but oftentimes, the systems may have been bogged down in debating who should spend what portion of new initiative costs; conversely, who should reap more of the benefits. Just everyone seems to have a different definition of what equitable means.","But today, just by virtue of how fast the system is bringing new ideas to market, both organically and now, as you highlighted, through M&A, it seems like you've been able to maybe cut through some of that red tape and focus more on the end consumer.","So again, maybe just talk a little bit more, if you could, about the changes that have been made. Maybe how the new Global Ventures group may fit in going forward. And then, ultimately, how should investors, in fact, think about what portion of the costs versus what portion of the benefits accrues to KO versus the bottling partners? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Well, that is indeed a broad question. I think, firstly, it would be fair to recognize that the system is benefiting from the experiments and the things we've been doing over the last 10-plus years around the world to try and expand into a number of other categories.","So we've been experimenting and learning and identifying what's good practice and what's not so good practice for a good number of years now. And you're seeing that base of knowledge and expertise growing, that's allowing us to have a foundation to move faster.","Clearly, the end of the refranchising process and having a kind of a clear partnership network with well-funded partners who want to invest and want to win in the marketplace, combined with a greater degree of organizational clarity and focus on empowerment and accountability and getting things done on the company side, whether that be the marketing, the innovation, the M&A, whichever piece of the puzzle is required, has clearly helped.","And then, I think the Global Ventures is another step in that direction. We've had acquisitions in parts of the world. We've had venturing emerging brands units in different parts of the world.","What we've not been so successful at is tying that together across regions, across the groups, if you like, and I think that's what this represents in terms of the Global Ventures. So rather than letting something be successful in one group and it taking forever to get to another group, this unit here will be there to help push and drive the agenda for greater speed going forward.","At the end of the day, how do we get faster? We get faster not just because of all those things, but because there are exciting, interesting, financially-attractive opportunities that the system can capture.","The relative economics and the capital needed differ by category. They differ depending on the starting point of the different systems in the different part of the world, what's already been built. And, of course, what we've learned over the years with our partners is how to move quickly to a place where it's attractive for everyone.","At the end of the day, if it's not attractive for everyone, it's not going to go very far, and that's us, our bottling partners and, ultimately, the customers and down to the end consumer. So, it just needs to be organized, so the incentives are clear and attractive.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And congrats, Kathy.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, I wanted to focus on emerging markets. There's obviously been a lot of market concern over the slowing macros in China. There's been the election volatility down in Latin America. You mentioned a number of emerging markets, some of which are looking more positive. Some of which aren't looking as positive. So, I guess, James, can you just give us a bit of an update on your perspective on the macro outlook here in emerging markets as you look around the world; not so much a review of the quarter, but sort of what you saw sequentially as you moved through the quarter in October, and any forward-looking thoughts? And while we're on that subject, obviously, a stronger dollar sort of reflects those emerging markets concerns. So, any thoughts on sort of the FX pressure for 2019 earnings based on where we stand today would also be helpful. Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. Kind of in reverse order; it's a little early to provide FX guidance for 2019. But I think that, look, when you stand back, clearly, there are some emerging markets that got better. If we'd been talking two, three years ago, we were having a tougher time in China, Brazil, recently India. But those have all improved over the last 6 to 12 months. And we have good growth in all of them, including Brazil.","But in the meantime, it's got tougher in a number, whether that's Argentina, Turkey, South Africa and the Middle East. So I think there's clearly some additional volatility in the emerging markets. I think you can see that in the GDP numbers. You can see that in the GDP forecasts. At least the IMF and some of the others are coming and going, oh, okay, it's getting a little softer. And I think that's representative of the U.S. dollar's strength in recent months.","Exactly what the path forward would be is hard to predict exactly at this point in time. We're clearly moving to a slightly different phase in the economic recovery, and I think that will bring some ups and downs. But net-net, we've got a portfolio across 200-plus countries. We're seeing growth in the developed, in the developing, in the sum of the emerging.","And at the end of the day, we could do a lot of crystal ball gazing, but what's really important is we focus on what we can do, on what we can control, which is about staying close to the consumer, understanding what drinks and packages they want, working with our customers to work out how to create value for them, provide the right marketing and the right innovations, so the system can execute with excellence, and that will deliver us a winning formula in good days and in bad days.","Operator","Thank you.

So, James, I was hoping that you could expand on that comment and discuss what, if any, regulatory changes you would need to see to become more interested in the space in the U.S. and also internationally? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Well, I think that's a simple one. We don't have any plans at this stage to get into this space. So that's kind of where we are.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Bonnie, your line is now open.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning, Bonnie.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Congratulations, Kathy. I, too, wish you all the best.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a question for you guys on your marketing spend in the quarter and so far this year. In general, I'm wondering if you're seeing the lift you expected from your spending. And then, could you give us a sense of how much your spending has increased this year or not, and how we should think about that evolving in the future? I guess I'm assuming as a percentage of sales, it would likely increase, given your lower revenue base, but on an absolute dollar basis, how should we think about this going forward? Will you plan to increase spend in the future? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. I think, clearly, there are some mechanical parts to the P&L as we sell some of the bottling and refranchising has come to a close. But we have been pursuing a steadfast strategy of reinvesting in our business for a number of years. And so I think there's no big discontinuity happening or seen out there at this stage.","So I think the marketing spend, I think is producing good results. We are winning in the marketplace. We're growing the soft drink category in revenue and volume. The Coke Trademark's growing. Coke Zero Sugar's growing. We're seeing the sales and volume and transaction uplifts, engagements by the consumers with the brands, so we think we're in a good place in terms of what are marketing is delivering for us. So leaving aside the mechanical effects of refranchising to the P&L and the percentage of DME, then I think it's relatively steady as we go. So yeah, I think you can see those examples.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about competitive dynamics in North America. Latest Nielsen came out today and shows that Pepsi still does not appear to have moved on pricing. So if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing actually in the marketplace, because I know Nielsen is not always the most representative. Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. So clearly, we've taken some price increases this year in the U.S. marketplace, whether that be in the juice category by changes in the packaging, in soft drinks, in the number of channels. And, clearly, we've been pushing that through over the years under the headline of we're doing a lot of things to engage the consumer with the various categories in our portfolio from the marketing and the packaging, working with our customers to create value for them.","We think this is a strategy that has worked for us over the recent years and will continue and is continuing to work for us going forward. So, I'm not sure it makes that much sense for me to comment on short periods of competitive pricing activity. We've always said, look, we're going to follow a rational pricing approach with a few points of pricing, which is what's happening on an underlying basis. In the U.S., it won't necessarily be a straight line for all sorts of reasons, but we're going to stick to our strategy. And I think that's the one that will see us through to the right place.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning and best wishes to you, Kathy, from me as well.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, I guess my question is just on the guidance. So, one is just clarification, so for this year, if we think about all the moving parts, on the comparable EPS, really the only thing that's changing is the tax rate coming down, which is about $0.02 or $0.03 benefit to your guidance. And then, I know you're not giving 2019 guidance, but as we think about, James, your sort of commitment to continue to grow comparable EPS even with some of the FX headwinds, you've got tax rate benefit going away next year, FX probably another 2 or 3 points headwind. So maybe conceptually, what are some of the P&L levers that you can continue to focus on to really drive growth and comparable EPS? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Do you want to start with it?","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Certainly. So, yes, there's the tax benefit for this year. And given that the structural is slightly worse than we said at the beginning of the year, and then, frankly, currency is worse than we said at the beginning of the year. We are going to stick to our 8% to 10% guidance.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. And 2019, it's too early to get into 2019. But in the end, we said we're going to follow three pillars in trying to manage the business going forward. We need to grow the top line by doing the right things for the consumer in terms of the beverages, the marketing, the packaging, the innovation. Create value with our customers, have the right refranchised bottlers to execute in the marketplace. That will drive local top line in each of the 200-plus countries we operate in.","We'll focus ourselves and as a system on being efficient stewards of the P&L and the capital, such that the margins, again, locally, will be appropriate for that business and for driving growth. And then, of course, the piece that we have to bring together as the portfolio management is paying attention to what that translates to in comparable EPS earnings. How are we going to put that puzzle together for 2019, we'll come back to in a future date.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Congrats as well from me.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So, you're delivering pretty well on fanning out the portfolio to effectively to meet consumers' needs, including with M&A. Could you talk more about the pace of activity from you and I guess the size of activity we actually should extrapolate then for the company going forward?","And also, how specifically has management incentive expectations and structure kind of changed all the way throughout the organization to really make sure that these investments work and allow these brands to come in and be successful within your relatively complex ecosystem, without this, what we often see and I think what you guys have suffered for in the past, some sort of organ-rejection issues.","And then also from a strategic perspective, you've stuck to nonalcoholic ready-to-drink so far. What are your views about alcoholic right now? Clearly, there are some experimentations where your CFO is leaving \u2013 or your new CFO will be leaving from, but are you open to that world as well in the short term? Thanks a lot.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks, Ali. Look, I think the pace of M&A, clearly, the third quarter was a more active quarter than normal.","When we look at M&A opportunities, it's obviously a function of, are we seeing things that work for us in terms of a role for that in our business, whether it be a role in the portfolio, a role in the capabilities, providing us with a new entry into something? So clearly, we've got to be focused on what does it do for us. Then, of course, there's a question of price and a question of availability of the things that we want.","So I'm not sure that extrapolation does make sense. And I think that's just something we'll have to cover as we go forward. We've made a number of statements as how we want to see the total company structured in terms of growth, in terms of leverage, in terms of returns to the shareholders.","So I think it's the management of the business that will need to go forward, but we've got some guardrails on how we think about the total.","And then, as we bought in some of these companies a little, as I talked on one of the earlier questions, we've learned over the last number of years on how to bring them in and what's the best way and what are the models that best work for different categories in different situations.","And that's allowed us both to do better as we bring them in, in the place that we're buying them, whichever part of the world that is, but also then do better in lifting and shifting and scaling them to other parts of the world.","We're not as good at that as we would like to be or are perhaps as fast as we would like to be, better said, which is why we're bringing the Global Ventures organizational unit into being, to just give an extra twist to accelerating that piece of the strategy of lifting, shifting and scaling.","And we'll learn more. And we'll learn more. And that's, of course, tied back to the incentives. We have general incentives to the broad population against revenue and profits and cash flow, which obviously link back to the M&A strategy. And then, for those teams specifically doing M&As, we have deal-specific incentives.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.

Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Actually, James, wanted to talk a little bit about the management transition. Just a few things. One, why now? I mean, I guess, Muhtar, for a while, didn't have a COO. And so it seems an interesting time to add that.","And two, looking at all the hires and all the kind of leads, they all seem to date back to your time in working in Latin America. And so is this kind of a getting a band back together? And with that, are you trying to replicate something or expand something that happened in Latin America to across the company?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","So I think, the management changes, why now is, I think it's a simple function of we've ended a phase. We had some initial reinvestment going back in brand KO. We set out the refranchising. We've brought that to a conclusion. We built on our foundations of the last number of years in setting out Beverages for Life with a clear vision for where we want to go. We've added flesh and bone to that vision over the last 12, 18 months.","And what's clear is we've got a lot of things to do. And so that's why I think bringing Brian in as COO will allow us to be able to execute against the leadership agenda with speed.","Of course, we could just go slower with less people, but we need to be able to execute at speed and be able in a world that's volatile. And we're in a lot of places, we need to be able to lead the enterprise forward.","And I think Brian just brings that extra capacity with a focus on the field operations that allows me to look across the whole company, and we'll be able to work as a double act to bring a lot of that going forward. And so I think that's why it's the right time to bring Brian on.","On are we putting a band back together, I wish I was good at music. I'd love to be in a band, but there was zero chance of that happening. So here I am.","I think what you're seeing is executives being promoted across a broad section of the global talent pool. Yes, Brian spent some time in Latin America, as did John. Brian's also been in Europe. He's been in the U.S. John's been in Asia. So what I think you're seeing is people who've worked around the world coming up through the organization taking on strong roles.","Nancy, who hasn't worked in Latin America, worked in Corporate, worked in North America, she's come up. You've seen the new Group Presidents, like Nikos [Koumettis], come up through the European business, worked in Canada as well. Manolo [Arroyo], who's gone to Asia, spent most of his time between Europe and Asia. You see Jennifer Mann, who has come up through the U.S.","I think you're seeing a lot of people come up through the U.S. organization, come up through the organization and take different jobs, and the new business unit presidents, you know Galya [Molinas] has gone from Turkey to Mexico via the U.S.","So you're seeing a lot of movement. And I think it's testament to the talent pipeline around the world and our ability to have people grow by giving them different experiences in different parts of the world and different types and business situations that makes them stronger leaders, that then allows us to deploy them to the best use and the greatest opportunity for the company.","Operator","Thank you.

Good luck in the future.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you.","Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And my question is around impact cost pressures. I'm assuming they are largely in North America, and just trying to understand what your hedges look like, how much you've been affected so far by transport costs, PET, aluminum and what you're seeing in the fourth quarter, what you're expecting.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","You want me to take that?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Please.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","So on commodities, pressure on input costs, yes, we are seeing that primarily in North America, given the structure of the businesses there, the foodservice business as well as our Minute Maid business and in our BIG segment, is where we will primarily see that pressure from commodities.","For the fourth quarter, we anticipate it to be much in line with like we have seen year-to-date, with freight pressure continuing for North America into the fourth quarter.","Basically, we have hedges on our primary input costs, input commodities, but I don't anticipate the fourth quarter to be significantly different from what we've seen year-to-date.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Congratulations to you, Kathy, as well.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Question on business performance or cluster performance, right, if we look at that year-to-date or in the third quarter, the numbers don't necessarily bear out the diversification of your business. I know there's been efforts to rationalize SKUs and so forth and so on. There's pricing and mix impact, so I don't know the best way to go through it, but can you talk about how you see the business progressing year-to-date or over a longer period of time in terms of diversification that may not bear out the numbers that you report within the release? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Yeah, look, we grew. I'm just going to go through the clusters to make it easy. Sparkling did really well this quarter year-to-date. We saw strong growth around the world in all the groups. In Trademark Coke, in Diet Coke in the U.S., and actually Coke Zero Sugar had its best quarter of growth in 10 years. So clearly, a lot of what we're doing in sparkling is working, is engaging with consumers. And that's very pleasing.","As we go into the other categories, what we see in water is a change to the recent trend. So in the last number of quarters, we were actually declining or doing worse in water. And this time, we've done better because we're kind of moving out of the phase of deprioritize something in the low value water, and starting to see some of the benefits of our focus on the premium waters, whether that's China, some of the innovations in Mexico around CL, (48:35) or even North America with smartwater and with Topo Chico.","So, I think you're starting to see growth coming back into water as we've done a bit of deprioritizing and moved more into premium and innovation.","In the case of juice, the juice category, that is down this quarter. A lot of that is driven by a couple of pieces. One, we've talked about before, which is the North American resizing of the juice; and secondly, the macroeconomics in the Middle East, in particular, have hit our Aujan juice business quite hard. So, there's a clear macroeconomic impact.","So, what we're doing as, in fact, we've done across each of the categories is focus on if there is bits of the business that need to be deprioritized or rightsized or reshaped, so that we are going to drive revenue growth in an attractive business, we need to get that done, so I think you're seeing some of that adjustment still going on in the juice business.","Where there is a stronger foundation with the right structures for the business and attractive consumer propositions, you saw good growth. So, in Mexico, Western Europe, India, Brazil, we saw strong performance in the juice, dairy and plant cluster. So, it's about us still focusing on getting some bits right.","And, lastly, tea and coffee; coffee was up in the quarter, driven by growth in Japan. Coffee, at least for now, is largely a Japanese story. And we had not done as well as we had wanted recently. We've not kept up with the innovation. We brought more innovation to the table that allowed us to do better in the third quarter. Clearly, the natural disasters and the destruction of the plant is going to be a problem, but we think we're back on the right track.","And then, tea, actually we've done really well in tea with the completion of the globalization of Fuze, but we have decided to sell less of the non-ready-to-drink tea. That was a focus in Turkey. So, what you're seeing is growth in underlying businesses across all the categories, building better positions from which to go forward on. And, of course, there is some netting with things that we are deprioritizing or where macros are impacting us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.

Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","James, I wanted to drill down a bit on the sports drink strategy now for KO, following the announcement of the BODYARMOR relationship. So, specifically, maybe talk a little bit about positioning of the brand versus Powerade, any potential friction you see there, balancing investment at the BODYARMOR level versus what maybe incurred at KO or by bottlers' growth opportunities for the brand as you see it outside the U.S. And then, lastly, with respect to the path to ownership, because limited detail has been provided, anything you can share there, even sort of a rough timeline would be helpful. Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. No. So, what we've announced in terms of any future stages of timeline are not there yet. But I think the first important point is to recognize this is a minority investment for us and it's going to be run as a separate business. So, the BODYARMOR team are going to make the decisions about how to grow the brand, what innovations and formulas and packages to bring to the marketplace. We have a clear agreement on how they will go through the Coke bottling system, and that will take place. And the Powerade team will continue to focus on Powerade.","I think it's fair to say the two sit in quite different positions today. BODYARMOR is clearly coming from a more premium space with a different consumer proposition in terms of the ingredients and the setup of the drink. So, I think there's space for both. And we expect to be able to go forward, but I think it is worth noting that they are going to be run as two parallel and separate businesses at this stage. And ditto, that goes for any expansion outside the U.S. That's a decision that BODYARMOR needs to make.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.

Can you just flesh that out for us a little bit in the context of the Costa acquisition? I mean, understanding that potentially, you're not going into the retail side of the business, where else do you see opportunities? Is it RTD? Is it single-serve? And if it includes single-serve, like, where is Costa today from either a percent of sales or partnership basis?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Look, I think there's a number of exciting things that can be done as Costa becomes part of our global coffee platform and our ability to grow in coffee. Obviously, ready-to-drink is an opportunity that makes a lot of sense for us to focus on. I think the other pieces where we can for sure grow our coffee business is in being a better beverage partner to the many customers out there in the many different channels, whether that be through the use of a bean to machines relationship within their facilities, or the use of the Costa vending machines, which is a bit like our Freestyle machines on the Coke side.","There are a lot of ways to work with immediate consumption customers to bring a coffee offering from The Coca-Cola Company, whether in the brand, and the drink and the machinery. And, of course, then there's the at-home market, whether that be pods, capsules, loose beans, there is a substantive opportunity to grow that space as well.","Operator","Thank you.

And, obviously, we're not going to provide a guidance or indications on what we're going to do next year on pricing.","I think when you look at the North America pricing, of course, you look at it and then perhaps it's easier just to look at the year-to-date. You see that we're down a point in terms of price\/mix in North America year-to-date. And then, obviously, we've been taking pricing in the marketplace. And it generated the question last quarter, and whilst it's moved in the right direction this quarter, it's still the same sort of gap.","What's happening is, firstly, we had the conversation about the freight costs, which are a deduction to revenue in the way that we're looking about this. That's a point across the year-to-date. Depending on the quarter, there's been some timing of promotional items. The last quarter, it was a headwind. This quarter, it was a positive. On year-to-date, it's all in balance. So let's just ignore that for a second. Otherwise, it gets very confusing looking at the minutia of each quarter.","The big picture is it's been down one on freight. Timing and promotions is a intra-quarter issue. And then, the biggest gap between what we report as pricing and what you see in the marketplace and what the bottlers report, is the business mix of the different business models in our North American business.","Unlike the rest of the globe, the U.S. has a big portion where we have finished products, so Minute Maid, juice, the fountain business, but we also sell a lot of concentrate on sparkling to the bottlers. And, therefore, you can end up with a curious mathematical situation, where you take price increases, and prices are going up in each of those three business systems, and yet the average is going down because of the different average prices per gallon of the different business models.","And the reality is because of the rightsizing we did on juice, that which is a higher revenue per gallon business, it produces this curious mathematical effect, which is why I keep underlying that what's going on underneath is we have been taking price, given the input costs and given what's going on in the U.S. marketplace, and to support the reinvestment in the business, and that strategy remains true. And it's helped us win in the marketplace.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Okay. I think we're at the end of the questions. So thank you very much, everyone. To conclude, we had a solid quarter. We're on track to close out the year per our guidance. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us today.

Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.","In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com, under the Reports & Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconciles certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussion this morning, and from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information.","Now I'll turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that I'm pleased with our first quarter results. I've never been more excited about the prospects for our brands, as well as our system, or more proud of our people who are driving our consistent and quality performance results. We continue to deliver volume, value and profit growth as we enter the third year of our 2020 Vision, and we once again saw positive volume growth across every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. We also continue to gain volume and value share globally in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and in every sparkling and still beverage category in which we compete. We are winning with our global sparkling beverage portfolio, which was up a solid 4% this past quarter, led by the global growth of brand Coca-Cola, which was up also a healthy 4%. And we are continuing to win with our global still beverage portfolio, which grew a strong 9% this quarter. As we stand a little less than a quarter of the way into our journey towards our 2020 Vision, today's results demonstrate yet again how we are passionately and effectively refreshing a thirsty world with a capable, resilient and advantaged global bottling system. ","Before reviewing our quarterly operating results, let's take a few moments to address today's mixed global economic environment. With respect to Europe, we are observing ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty as 2012 unfolds. Austerity measures implemented across the region are weighing on consumer confidence, which recently reached its lowest level since the first quarter of 2009. Despite the challenges in Europe, we are executing on all fronts to drive performance and share gains. So while we expect the macroeconomic conditions will remain difficult in Europe throughout 2012, we remain cautiously encouraged by our performance in this market.","Turning to the United States. Despite its struggle with a sustained period of relative high unemployment, we're pleased to see some early signs of a slowly improving macroeconomic environment. We remain firmly committed to building strong brands and creating value in the United States to capture more than our fair share of the industry's profitable growth.","Finally, let me touch on recent macroeconomic developments across a couple of key BRIC markets. In China, we've all seen economists lower their 2012 GDP growth rate forecast. While we agree that there has been some moderate slowdown in China, we also believe that this is a national progression and that it is a positive for the long-term sustainable growth of the country. As we move through 2012, we anticipate that our business in China may not be immune to this cooling economy, and therefore, we may also see our volume results in China moderate to some extent. Having said that, we are confident that China will continue to serve as a double-digit growth market for our business over the long term. As for Brazil, which underwent a cooling-down period of its own in 2011, there are now signs of improving consumer sentiment. We expect this trend to hold as we move through the balance of 2012 with our business in Brazil continuing to gain market share.","In summary, we always find ourselves operating in a fast-evolving global environment, one with some economies slowing, other economies stabilizing while sustaining high unemployment and still others improving and well on their way to recovery. In all cases, we remain intently focused on realizing our 2020 Vision, and we will keep investing through these challenging times to drive long-term advantaged and sustainable growth. So if we have learned anything these past few years, it is that during times of ongoing uncertainty, consumers are even thirstier for brands that inspire real moments of optimism and happiness.","Turning now to our total company performance results. Our volume grew 5% in the quarter, ahead of our long-term target and fueled by organic volume growth in all 5 geographic operating groups. As for our financial results, we grew comparable currency-neutral net revenue by 7%, and we grew comparable currency-neutral operating income by 8% once you adjust for the cycling of lower commodity cost in the prior period. As such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year 2012 operating income results in line with our long-term targets.","Now let's review our performance results across our global markets in more detail, beginning with North America, our flagship market. Our North America business was up 2%, delivering an eighth consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, our North America system once again led the industry, capturing volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our sparkling beverages in North America were up 1% in the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola also positive in the quarter while further improving its brand health scores. The momentum behind both Coke Zero as well as Fanta continues, with these brands up 9% and 4%, respectively, this quarter, and we also earned higher pricing in North America, which enabled us to generate a positive 3% price mix for both bottled and canned sparkling beverages, as well as our total North America beverage business. Our still beverages in North America were up 6% in the quarter, gaining both volume and value share while delivering industry-leading results across many categories. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew double digits yet again this quarter while once again capturing volume and value share. Our glac\u00e9au trademark grew 9%, also capturing volume and value share, led by another quarter of double-digit growth for both smartwater and vitaminwater zero. And our key performance again accelerated this quarter, up double digits, led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 20th conservative -- consecutive quarter. And in water, DASANI also expanded double digits this quarter with the national rollout of our innovative PlantBottle that is positively impacting purchase intent and brand equity. As we've said many times before, we believe North America is a growth market for our business. Despite a challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop, our results both validate this belief and provide us with every reason to remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for America.","Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 8% in the quarter, including 6% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In China, the overall beverage industry was not immune from the impact of the economic slowdown we mentioned earlier, as well as the unseasonably cold weather that occurred during this quarter's Chinese New Year celebration. Despite this, our business in China delivered a solid 9% growth this quarter while cycling a strong first quarter last year. And importantly, our rightsizing efforts are generating strong incremental transactions in line with our expectations. Sparkling beverage transactions were up double digits this past quarter, driven by the expansion of our 300 ml package. This helped us capture both volume and value share in the sparkling beverage category this quarter.","Just a few weeks ago, I was pleased and honored to inaugurate our 42nd bottling plant in China in Yingkou. This new plant is now our largest production facility in China, with an expected annual production capacity of more than 5 billion servings of sparkling and still beverages. This new LEED-certified plant is part of our system's 3-year $4 billion China investment plan and reaffirms our strong commitment to China.","Japan's first quarter results were up 3%, building on the great work done by our system to restore and strengthen our business during a very challenging 2011. Our Japan business gained both volume and value share in the nonalcoholic beverages this quarter. And this growth in Japan was broad-based, with numerous sparkling and still beverages delivering positive results, including brand Coca-Cola up 2%, Fanta up 6%, I LOHAS water up 4% and Georgia coffee up 3%. Additionally, our Japan business grew across all channels, including convenience stores and vending. Also during the quarter, our Japan business unit was recognized with our company's highest honor, the 2011 Woodruff Cup based on the business unit's achievement of key performance metrics as set forth in our 2020 Vision.  As such, we remain confident that our system in Japan is well aligned and in strong -- in a strong position to deliver full year, low single-digit growth in 2012.","I also want to call out 2 other markets within this diverse and dynamic geographic region of the world. First, our business in the Philippines is growing again, up mid single digits this past quarter, reflecting how the hard work put in by our Bottling Investment Group keeps yielding strong results. While we believe there is still much opportunity left to be captured in the Philippines, we also believe that our business there is on the right track and that we are successfully building the capabilities needed to deliver consistent and sustainable growth. Second, our business in Thailand grew over 20% in the first quarter, and brand Coca-Cola was up over 30% as we build momentum in this market while investing for the future. We have plans in place to expand our beverage production capabilities in this fast-growing market, consistent with our system's culture of targeted investment that underpins our 2020 Vision.","Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for the quarter, including 4% growth for brand Coca-Cola. In the process, we gained additional share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverages in Latin America this quarter. Latin America's solid first quarter results were driven by our consistent growth in Mexico, improved results in Brazil, and high single-digit growth in both our Latin Center and South Latin regions. In Mexico, we delivered 3% growth, cycling 14% from last year. We captured additional nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share in Mexico, and this is a further testament to our team's ability to execute clear occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in our highest per capita market.","As for Brazil, we reiterated many times last year that as this country's economy improved, so would our results. This quarter's 4% volume growth in Brazil validates this belief, and importantly, our continued volume and value share gains in Brazil are a testament to our sustained long-term growth strategies which never wavered during last year's economic slowdown. Looking ahead, we expect our 2012 growth results in Brazil to remain steady at low to single \u2013 mid-single digits as the Brazilian economy recovers. And our commitment to the future of Brazil has never been stronger, as shown by our system's recent announcement to accelerate our investments in Brazil to nearly $8 billion through 2016.","Our Eurasia and Africa business grew a strong 9% in the quarter, including solid 9% growth for brand Coca-Cola. Our overall group results were led by robust growth across the entire region, including growth in India, Russia, South Africa, the Middle East and North Africa. Overall performance was once again led by India, which grew 20% in the quarter, delivering balanced growth across all categories. I was particularly encouraged by brand Coca-Cola's 27% growth in India this past quarter, and our still beverages in India were up over 20% in the quarter, led by Maaza up over 30%. Russia was up 3% this quarter, cycling last year's strong 27% growth. Our business in Russia continues to be led by the strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, which once again delivered double-digit growth.  Additionally, our Dobriy juice brand delivered 9% growth and as a result, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverage volume and value share. Finally, we saw positive volume across growth in every other business unit in our Eurasia and Africa group, including double-digit growth in South Africa, as well as in the Middle East and North Africa region. We are excited about the future opportunities for our business in this dynamic growing part of the world.","Moving now to Europe. Volume was up 1%, gaining share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, this is Europe's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And this growth was led by Germany, which was up 3% for the quarter, capturing, once again, share in the nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as in both sparkling and still beverage categories. Brand Coca-Cola was up 4% this quarter in Germany, benefiting from both our effective marketing campaigns and our consumer recruitment initiatives. In total, this marks Germany's fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. This consistency validates how our ongoing bottling restructuring efforts have enhanced our ability to create value during difficult economic times. Another region where our business is showing signs of moderate improvement despite challenging economic conditions is Central and Southern Europe. Most markets in this region posted positive growth, including Italy which was up 4% for the quarter. Another very important geography where we achieved positive results is Spain, up 6% for the quarter. We are closely monitoring our business in both of these markets in light of recently announced austerity measures. Importantly, we believe we have the right brands, the right strategies and the right capabilities in place to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth in Europe.","As we look ahead to this summer, both in Europe as well as across the world, we are very excited about the unique opportunity to grow the value of our brands even further through our investments in the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. For context, during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, we activated 36 markets across the globe. For this year's Summer Olympics, we plan to activate almost 100 markets, leveraging content, experiences and conversations generated through our global program. This fully integrated 2012 global Olympic marketing program will be all about recruiting teams by tapping into emotional passion points like sports and music. An early success of this program is the over 160,000 YouTube views of Mark Ronson's behind-the-scenes footage as he developed our new Olympics theme song. These views were generated without any active promotions on our part and, once again, are a clear example of how we are successfully engaging consumers with innovative, compelling and shareable social media content.","As we work to engage with our consumers, we're also committed to building a better tomorrow. Last month, we released our 2012 Global Water Stewardship and Replenishment Report, detailing our ongoing work to reduce, recycle and replenish the water we use around the world. To date, our company has launched 386 Community Water Partnership projects in 94 countries. These projects have improved water access for 1.6 million people, including more than 0.25 million women and children in Africa.  In 2011 alone, our Community Water Partnership projects replenished 35% of the water used in our finished product beverages. These projects also benefited the communities we serve by providing sustainable agriculture training and resources to more than 12,000 farmers and by supporting the reforestation of over 30,000 hectares.","As we build a better tomorrow, our efforts and performance are being recognized. This past quarter, we were humbly honored to receive several acknowledgments. Firstly, Fortune Magazine's survey of the Most Admired Companies listed us at #4 in their 2012 rankings, up from #6 in 2011 and up 20 spots from where we ranked just 5 years ago. In these same rankings, Fortune Magazine's survey once again rated us as the #1 most admired beverage company in the world. Secondly, Forbes also announced just 2 weeks ago that our company had risen to #7 on their publication's list of America's Most Reputable Companies based on a consumer survey by Reputation Institute. This ranking is up from #25 in 2011. We also saw our standing improved within the Harris Interactive reputation study, an annual survey that measures the corporate reputations of the 60 most visible companies in the U.S. In their latest survey, our company climbed to #3, up from 15th the previous year.","While all of us at The Coca-Cola Company are proud of these achievements, we understand that they only represent a snapshot of where we are today rather than where we aspire to be tomorrow. As I have stated many times before, the complexity and the challenge of today's mixed global economy also brings real opportunities and exciting growth prospects. What was true on Day 1 of our 2020 Vision is still true today. Our system has only just begun to achieve its potential. We have a clear roadmap for growth, a productivity and reinvestment program that is driving efficiencies and a global bottling system that is well aligned and poised for execution. This strong alignment has not only enabled us to effectively navigate the volatility of these past several years, it has also put us in a position of real strength. That is why we are confident that our Coca-Cola system will continue to passionately refresh a thirsty world and create value for all of our consumers, customers and shareholders.","And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Gary.","Gary P. Fayard","Thanks, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results this quarter, underscoring once again that our global system is well positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 Vision. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.89 this quarter, up 3% versus the prior year. And as Muhtar shared earlier, our earnings growth was driven by broad-based volume growth across all of our 5 operating groups. In fact, we had volume growth across nearly all of our business units within our global operations this quarter.","Comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 5% this quarter. On a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 2% headwind, in line with outlook we provided during our last earnings call in February. In addition, and also as for the outlook we provided through this quarter, we cycled lower commodity cost in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusting for the 3% impact relating to the cycling of these lower commodity cost, our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 8% in the first quarter of 2012. When you also consider that this quarter had one less selling day than the first quarter of 2011, we are very pleased with this operating income result. ","Comparable currency-neutral net revenue grew 7% this quarter, including a 3% increase in concentrate sales and 3% positive price mix. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue result was a 1% headwind. This quarter's 3% consolidated price mix is particularly encouraging, especially when considering today's challenging macroeconomic conditions. Looking ahead, we still expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2% in line with our long-term target range.","This quarter's comparable gross margin was in line with our full year 2011 gross margin, consistent with the outlook we provided earlier this quarter. As a reminder, we expect our full year 2012 consolidated comparable gross margin to remain in line with full year 2011.","Our comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses were up 4% in the quarter as we sustained our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands. As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter. For 2012, we still expect to capture low single-digit operating expense leverage as we further invest in strategic brand building initiatives around the world and effectively manage our operating expenses.","Our net interest income came in at $27 million this quarter ahead of our initial forecast, primarily due to a benefit related to our interest rate swaps. As such and based on our current best estimates of interest rates in our international operations, we now expect our full year 2012 net interest income to come in at the higher end of the $20 million to $40 million range we provided in our last earnings call. In addition, we expect our net interest to come in close to even in the second quarter. We'll continue to update you on net interest outlook on a quarterly basis.","Our underlying effective tax rate currently stands at 24.8% within the 24% to 25% range we communicated during our last earnings call. ","As for our cash flow from operations, this increased 13% year-to-date. Please note that this cash flow result is net of the approximately $130 million in incremental contributions made to our pension plans this quarter when compared to the contributions we made to our pension plans in the first quarter of last year.","With regard to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled nearly $850 million, including accruals for stock options and treasury shares that did not settle prior to the close of the quarter. This places us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 as we communicated during our last earnings call.","Now let me take a moment to remind you of our full year outlook on currencies and commodities which we provided in our last earnings call. With regard to commodities, in our last call, we said that we expected the full year 2012 incremental impact of the Big 4 commodity cost on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. And just a reminder, the Big 4 commodities are aluminum, sweetener, juice and PET. While our commodity cost outlook remains unchanged, if current trends hold, we may see this outlook slowly improve in the coming months. And we'll update you on any changes to our outlook during our next earnings call.","As for currencies, based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to have a mid single-digit negative impact on operating income for the full year. Furthermore, we expect to see this impact come in at the high end of this mid single-digit range in the second quarter.","Let me highlight one additional item for those that model our business. In light of the recent change to our global tea joint venture with Nestl\u00e9, and as a reminder, earlier this year, we announced our agreement with Nestl\u00e9 to refocus the geographic scope of this joint venture primarily to Europe and Canada while phasing out the joint venture in most other territories by the end of 2012. Accordingly, we have eliminated the joint venture volume from our reported results for both 2011 and 2012 in those territories where the joint venture is being phased out. Please note that this change did not impact the company's reported volume results this quarter on a consolidated level or for any individual operating group.","Finally, with regard to our new productivity and reinvestment program, we reconfirm our expectations to capture total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million, phased over a 4-year period, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015. As noted in our last call, these funds will serve to enhance our ongoing system-wide brand building initiatives as we reinvest in our business to drive long-term profitable growth. We're still in the initial stages of defining the total onetime cost associated with the capture of these incremental annualized savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs during our next earnings call.","In summary, as we begin the third year of our 2020 Vision, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid quarter of quality volume, value and profit results. Our system remains healthy and financially strong. We're generating cash, investing in our world-class brands and executing our consistent growth strategies from a position of real strength. And importantly, we continue to pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned leadership team and highly capable global bottling partners are taking the right actions and executing the right strategies to successfully realize our 2020 Vision. So while we're still navigating through an ongoing mixed global economic recovery, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year results in line with our long-term growth targets.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And sir, our first question comes from Bill -- from Bryan Spillane, Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had just a question. You had a very strong first quarter, and I think what was really encouraging was how broad-based your volume growth was and especially seeing markets like Japan, North America, Germany, Philippines, all sort of growing simultaneously. Think about the balance of the year. Muhtar, could you talk a little bit about how you view that performance carrying out through the balance of the year, maybe some of the factors that you've got in place or some of the activity you have in place to continue to drive that through the balance of the year? And then secondarily, maybe Gary, if you could just talk about if it's a -- given your potentially better view on cost balance of the year and the potential for some volume performance continuing to be well -- doing well this year, just better drop through profitability, I guess as we move through the year, if we can just talk a little bit about that as well.","Muhtar Kent","Bryan, good morning, thanks. This is Muhtar. I think what I'd like to just get -- the message I'd like to get across is that we leave behind the first quarter of 2012 with confidence and with momentum in our business. And I think it is broad-based growth, as you mentioned. In fact, the top 10 countries in our business generated about 65% -- a little over 65% of the total incremental growth cases -- organic unit case growth in the quarter. And that is more broad-based than in the past. And that's a good sign. And I think we've always said that there's tremendous -- I see -- everywhere I go, I see tremendous opportunity for our brands. Our system is strong. Our system -- this is the result of investments that our system continues to make every quarter and also generating revenue, and we're able to crack this calculus for growth. And everywhere we go in this difficult macroeconomic environment, it's important to note that The Coca-Cola system is one of the most important net contributors to the economy. Globally, we're one of the top 10 private employers, nongovernmental employers, and we create -- based on our vision, we will create an additional 120,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. And more and more, governments are recognizing that unemployment is the #1, #2 and #3 priority. And I think with that, with our system, we're earning our right every day in every market. And that's important. As I -- obviously, the macroeconomic conditions around the world is challenged. The recovery is slow. Unemployment remains high and is -- I believe will remain high as we go through this year. But the premise, Bryan, on which we've built our 2020 Vision holds true today. What we said is no matter how you slice and dice it, there will be about 1 billion new people coming into the middle class. We'll have about 800 million new urbanized consumers in the decade. This decade that we're talking about, 2010 to 2020. Now the quarter we just left behind, about 22 million new urbanized consumers and about 22 million to 25 million new middle class have been created in the world, and we were there to serve their needs and refresh them. So yes, challenged environment; yes, slow recovery; yes, some slowing down in emerging markets. But when we talk about slowing down, you go down from a 9% to an 8.5% or an 8.2%, I think there is still tremendous amount of growth and middle class creation around the world, whether you take Africa, Latin America, Asia, and we're there. And in the western markets, we've always said our balanced -- our vision calls for balanced growth, balanced in geographies, balanced in portfolio. And once again, we were able to validate that, that is something that we are able to execute with our -- passionately with our bottling partners. So I'll now pass it over to Gary to answer the second part of your question.","Gary P. Fayard","Bryan, I guess I'd say a couple of things. As we look, it is still a challenged economic environment across the world. We have seen -- if you think back, actually first quarter of 2010, things looked like, economically, they were getting better and then they didn't. First quarter of 2011 looked like things were getting better and then they didn't. And then we've seen the significant volatility around commodities and currencies across the world over the last several years as well. So I think -- I guess where we are is trying to be somewhat conservative and try to say we're 3 quarters -- or 3 months into the year, 1 quarter into the year, the kind of the smallest quarter in fact, and I think we need to continue to go through the year. Are things looking better? Yes, it looks like interest is a little -- interest income is going to be a little bit better. It looks like if things hold, commodities will probably be better. So things are actually looking pretty good, but I think at this point, our view was, we kind of hold with where we are. We kind of get through another quarter to kind of see how the year is going. Is the economic recovery that we're starting to slowly see in the U.S. going to continue or not? So that's kind of where we are. We're kind of being -- trying to be conservative and recognize that we are in this as a marathon and not as a sprint. This is about long-term value creation.","Muhtar Kent","Just one point I'd add to -- that to, Bryan, is that 4 years ago, we made some bets in terms of our strategy, our 2020 Vision, and I think those are now positioning us to win. And I'd say that in this volatile world environment, I think we see -- we are definitely a great hedge and a balanced hedge in what's happening in the world.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just -- Gary, just as a follow-up, if it's -- if there's upside -- or Gary and Muhtar, if there's upside, more inclined to invest some of that back particularly given the momentum you have in some of these markets, is that -- is there more room to invest if there's more funds generated?","Muhtar Kent","Well, I'm happy to say that we are investing. If you look at our marketing spend and if you look at how we're controlling all OpEx in the right way and then spending on our brands and you'll see that some of those numbers in the first quarter, too, coming to life and that's basically how we've always managed this business, investing in our brands, investing for the long term, ensuring that we -- our brands remain healthy and get healthier all the time, which they are. And that generates, again, a great system alignment, a great investment picture from our -- the total cash that we generated with our bottling partners. And I said it before, the results that you see this quarter, this past quarter, are not coming from the investments we made in this quarter. They're coming from the investments that we made 4, 5, 6, 7 quarters ago, and the same is going to be true from 4 quarters or 5 quarters from now based on investments we're making today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy, CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Muhtar, the last time we met, you said that you were headed off to Asia and you did share quite a bit of your enthusiasm with us already, but can you talk a little more in depth about the prospects for Japan, China, and what the other real big drivers of growth will be going forward, and how owning your bottlers in some key markets within China and Japan is impacting the business?","Muhtar Kent","Caroline, yes, I just spent a good bit of time in Asia a couple of weeks ago. And I think you've seen the Pacific Group's volume growth up 8%, which was broad-based in the quarter with the numbers that we've shared with you for places like -- not just China and Japan up 9% and 3%, respectively, but also for Thailand and the Philippines and so forth. And I think importantly, again, very encouraged that brand Coca-Cola is up 6% in that massive geography, and reported net revenue for the quarter up 12%. And I think -- and good price mix across. So it's important really to be able to ensure that when you have -- when we talk about sustainable growth, we mean growth not just in volume, not just in a certain category, but broad-based growth and also growth in the revenue line that can be matched or better than the volume line, and I think we've seen that. And yes, no question, everyone you talk to, whether it's the shop owner in any particular part of China or whether it's the government, or whether it's some national government, there is a little cooling down. Is that -- I think that's healthy. And I think that's healthy for the real estate market in China. That's healthy for the banking industry in China. That's healthy for the long-term sustainable growth of the economy in China, which I have no doubt is going to continue. So we see China as a fantastic opportunity. As I said, we've just opened our largest-to-date facility in China, 42nd, and the largest of them all, and LEED-certified on top of it. And that's again one sign of our commitment, many more such factories to come in our $4 billion announced investment program for China. And so I see China as certainly playing an important role for our 2020 Vision. And particularly pleased about Japan, where I met with all our bottling partners in Tokyo and presented their Woodruff Cup awards to each one of our bottling partners. And again, category by category, we see very good improvement in our business in Japan. So the terrible tragedy of 2011 allowed us to galvanize our system and strengthen our system and continue to grow our system. And importantly, every channel, important channel, like convenience, like vending, is now expected to grow in Japan. And that's a very important thing for our business -- and categories, whether it's coffee with Georgia or sparkling or tea. Again, we're generating growth. So prospects, I think overall, we've always said the picture of success in Japan is low single-digit growth. And I believe that we're poised well to achieve that target for Japan. And then I went to Thailand, where we're having, as I said, very good growth prospects and share gains, tremendous share gains in that important market, with a very healthy consumption habit for sparkling beverages. And I see -- whether it's other markets like Vietnam or Indonesia or West Asia, I see great prospects for our growth. And I'll soon be also heading towards West Asia in a couple of months. And again, you heard the results that we've been able to post this past quarter in India, continue to have very healthy brand metrics for Coca-Cola, as well as our still brands there in that incredibly prospective geography. So I think Asia, overall, little cooling, healthy and great long-term prospects for both our business, as well as I think leading the world out of some of the current global macro issues.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Muhtar -- sort of couple of questions, Muhtar or Gary, on North America. One, just in terms of the underlying industry performance and your performance in North America, obviously, the macro has been getting a little bit better but just in Q1, do you think that there was any benefit from a weather perspective, if you've seen a big shift from take-home into immediate consumption? And then talking about your performance in the context of the competitive backdrop, where, obviously, Pepsi has talked about spending more money, so what sort of impact are you seeing from a competitive perspective in North America? And then Gary, just on the profitability side in North America, if you can just walk us through the puts and takes in Q1 as it relates to cycling of the commodities and kind of for the balance of the year, how should we think about the phasing of commodities and the margins in North America as we go forward?","Muhtar Kent","Judy, let me just take the first part of the question. I think we continue to see validation, a little more validation, on what I indicated also in the previous call. There are some signs, healthier signs, from the U.S. consumer right now than it was 12 months ago at this time in terms of more travel, more mobility, more bookings. And mobility is an important factor for our business for consumer goods. And also, I think eating out, a little healthier numbers in terms of that, that we were seeing compared to, say, 12 to 16 months ago. Having said that -- and I do believe that, that trend is likely to continue, providing we can sort of keep -- have some prices on the -- at the pump for gasoline where -- about where they stay now. So I premise that with that caveat. I think for -- we have always said that United States is a growth business. Despite the current macroeconomic challenges, we've been posting growth quarter after quarter. I'm very pleased that this past quarter also that sparkling beverages was positive, brand Coca-Cola was positive. And we've started putting together the framework for our growth in North America way before the acquisition of the CCE business in North America. I want to reiterate that once again. The brand, price, pack, channel architecture, the -- beginning -- getting our brands to a healthier position than they were previously, getting the right package to be sold at the right outlet and the right channel at the right price, all of that architecture we started working on 3 to 4 years ago. And I think we are seeing some results out of all of that work. And as I've said, we believe that the positive sentiment that we see compared to a year ago of the U.S. consumer, slightly positive sentiment would probably continue is what I would estimate, providing other conditions hold, particularly the price of gasoline. Gary?","Gary P. Fayard","Yes. Judy, I'd say just a couple of things. And the first, I just want to congratulate our colleagues in North America because I think if you -- as you think about it and think about this quarter, it was sparkling plus 1, brand Coca-Cola positive growth in the quarter. And those are things that not that long ago, I think everyone listening in this call would have said it's impossible to do. And it's really working. Everything that Muhtar is talking about is actually working. And our brand score is getting better because of the things we have been doing over the last few years. But then, if you look at, \"All right, great, Gary, got that, but let's talk about the financial results and you're showing that on a comparable basis, operating income is down 9% quarter on quarter. So how do you talk about that?\" Well, on that one, that is the issue that I alerted, I think, all of you to earlier this quarter. The way the commodities hit last year, that $800 million of commodity pressure that we had last year, it all was in quarters 2, 3 and 4, basically, none of it in the numbers in Q1 in North America. So when you adjust for that for just commodities, that minus 9 actually gets to only slightly negative. And then you have to recognize that there was one less day. You adjust for that and actually, North America suddenly flips into it was actually positive. You take that then you look at remainder of year, and you recognize that we've gotten the pricing so that the commodities aren't going to be that as big an issue going forward, remainder of year. And all the other things we've been doing, we would expect to see North America in very good positive territory, remainder of year. Things are going, knock on wood, exactly the way we planned for them, too, at this point.","Muhtar Kent","Just one last quick add onto that, Judy. Importantly to note, the strategic focus in North America remains consistent on continuing to build strong brands, creating value with our customers and building our systems, continuing to build our system capability. And so the strategic focus remains in place. Secondly, in this past quarter, I'd note also that IC growth was ahead of total volume growth in North America. That also helped generate a good price mix for our total business. And also, of course, I just want to make sure I mention the share gains that are continuing across the board in North America for us.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Gary, just on -- so if I think about that 3%, the cycling of the lower commodity impact on your operating profit, that's about $75 million. And when you think about you're saying North America would have been slightly down x that cycling. So the impact on North America from that would have been about $50 million and the rest would be in BG -- BIG?","Gary P. Fayard","Yes, the rest would have been in BIG.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and the phasing of the $400 million of commodities this year is much more evenly spread out. I guess we'll see depending on the commodity cost as we go forward, but it's much more evenly spread out. So we should start to see really the much more benign impact starting in Q2.","Gary P. Fayard","Very well put. That's exactly right, exactly right. And then as I kind of mentioned when -- to Bryan's question earlier, if then commodities hold with where they are today, that actually $350 million to $450 million, so call it $400 million, actually could be coming down to the lower end and becoming more favorable versus what we've been talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to go back to a question on China. I was actually hoping you could talk about the competitive landscape given Pepsi's new strategic alliance with Tingyi and how that may impact your business and strategy. I guess thinking about it, the alliance of the 2 strong competitors, wouldn't this accelerate the pace that you execute your game plan? And also, could you give us some color on how you will allocate the $4 billion investment among your different initiatives there? For instance, will you spend more on infrastructure than brand building in the next few years?","Muhtar Kent","Okay, Bonnie. I think we have a strategy for China. That strategy is not changing with what's happening across the industry. I want to reiterate that. That strategy is valid and still in place. And obviously, it will evolve as we introduce a wider variety of packages to promote affordability, it has the consumer experience with our brands, all with a focus to drive incremental increased transactions and profitable growth. And to continue building brand equity with consumers, I think this is critical for us and that will -- you will see us continue to do that. I believe that we're confident in our ability to deliver double-digit growth over the long term, and I think continuing introduction of a wider variety of packages to promote affordability and I think immediate consumption growth. So we will continue driving all of those priorities. As far as the investments are concerned, $4 billion, that I would say probably it's -- you could allocate about 50% into infrastructure and 50% into the brand building area. That's probably a good split. And if you looked at the past 3 years, that's probably where it ended up.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Gary, just wanted to follow up on Judy's question a little bit, which was -- and I apologize if I missed this. If we strip out the commodity stuff, what have you, the revenue growth was still great but the operating profit, I think, was still down. So is that a profit mix issue? Is that simply an investment issue? And then Muhtar, I just was wondering if you could clarify something because in your comments, you guys hadn't stated explicitly that you would gain share in sparkling, but you just mentioned that you had share gains across the board. So is that a safe assumption then that you guys did in fact have share gains in North America in sparkling?","Gary P. Fayard","Yes, John. Let me start -- well, in fact, I'll go ahead and answer that last part first. We did have share gains pretty much across the board, across the world and the U.S. So we did have share gains in sparkling. On the commodity issue relative to North America, and if I don't exactly answer the question, just come back and tell me, but basically, if you strip out the commodity impact, North America's OI for the quarter instead of being down 9 would have been down 1. It's exactly what it would have been. And if then -- if you add in an extra day, it would have been positive. So what you're seeing is that 1 day, actually 1 less day, is having a huge impact on the P&L because you've got basically all of the costs going through for the full quarter with a day less sales is basically what's happening, which is why when you go to Q2 and 3, actually, it becomes much more normalized and the commodities are not an issue at all. In fact, it kind of reverses a little bit because you had more of that hitting in Q2 and 3 last year, with none of it hitting in Q1 last year. So it's kind of a cycling thing, but that's why when you adjust for all that, our view is and what we had planned and what we saw all along is that North America actually started to improve significantly after Q1 into the remainder of the year. And that's kind of what -- that's exactly what we're seeing today.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so if we look at that impact, I know you have 2 extra selling days in Q4, right?","Gary P. Fayard","Right, that's right.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if we map out the cadence over the course of the year, it seems like what we probably should see and you factor in your FX guidance, is it -- should we be looking at the numbers sort of a little more back-end loaded, a little more Q4 weighted with a little bit tougher Q2 when you put all this stuff together? Is that kind of the right cadence then?","Gary P. Fayard","Yes, John, it is. It is. Now the CFO is going to come out in me, okay, because when my own guys -- and I get a rolling estimate here. And when I see that, I say, \"Oh, you've given me a hockey stick,\" and so we're -- you try to manage against that as you're managing the business appropriately. But the cadence of the business this year actually is exactly as you just said it. That's exactly right. It is more back-end loaded because of how the commodities hit and went through the P&L last year and the 1 day less in the first quarter, 2 extra days in the fourth quarter. Some of the reason -- I have to hedge a little bit on this, is because there was 1 less day, you had a little bit of an Easter shift to help probably the first quarter slightly, but you really can't measure it. So I'd say basically, what you're saying is exactly right.","Muhtar Kent","And just to add on the North America front, John, I think it's important to note that we -- North America, I want to reiterate, had a great quarter in terms of both volume, revenue, overall NARTD share gains. And also, we see, importantly, a rational pricing environment in North America. A 3% price mix gain is very important, and I think those things should really give indication of health of the business as we move into the second and third quarters, important second and third quarters of the year. And therefore, I am pleased with the results in North America. And again, I think Gary explained the anomaly of comparability there in terms of the operating income number.","Operator","And our final question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just talk about the global competitive environment relative to what you thought it was going to be heading into the year? I know you discussed North America a little bit. Can you broaden that globally? And I have a follow-up.","Muhtar Kent","Yes, well, it's hand-to-hand combat out there every single day and everywhere -- but everywhere I go, everywhere our operators go, everywhere our leadership goes, we see opportunity. We see opportunity for our brands that are stronger. We earn our price every day. We're generating revenue growth. We're net contributors to the economies, and our brands are healthy. And our IC business is growing ahead of our total business, and that's a good thing for the world. Our IC business globally grew 6% in the world compared to 5% global volume growth. And by the way, this volume growth that we just had in the first quarter is one of the highest organic volume growths we've had in the last, say, 8 to 10 quarters that I look back, because this is all-pure organic growth and it is strong and there is momentum. And I think, as I've said, the competitive environment, I think, out in the world is obviously, consumers are reticent to go out, to spend money. The environment is not healthy, particularly in Europe in terms of consumer sentiment, but our business is able to continue to invest and also ensure that we generate value for our customers in Europe, in this case large customers, large format, small format. And one of the really important metrics that we always follow is immediate consumption, which is a healthier mix. It's growing ahead of our total business. And once again, that is a testament to the strength of our system because you can always -- it's much easier to go and gain distribution in the future consumption channel, but in order to ensure that you supply and work in partner with every single small format store takes a very strong and a very different kind of system, which is the one we have.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, and maybe just a little more granular, I mean, relative to what you expected headed into the year, because it seems like maybe in Europe, the promotional and pricing environments may be a little bit worse and then we obviously saw Pepsi show their cards, and perhaps the competitive environment in North America is a little better. Is that fair?","Muhtar Kent","I think the environment in Europe is not any better for sure. But look at some of the numbers that I shared with you earlier, up 6% in Spain, up 4% in Italy, up -- Germany continues to grow, Southeast Europe beginning to show signs. I've said before, Europe is a tale of 2, 3 cities at least. You've got Eastern Europe beginning to come out, led by Russia. You've got Southern Europe beginning to stabilize, and Central and Northern Europe is still -- and led by Germany is -- I think the sentiment is slightly improving. So overall, the Southern Europe still remains an importantly challenged area, but our business system is very strong in Southern Europe, and we're benefiting from that. In the U.S., as I said, consumer sentiment in terms of mobility, in terms of travel bookings, in terms of travel with -- on the highways, in terms of eating out, is better than it was 12 to 16 months ago.","Gary P. Fayard","This is Gary. I want to come back, John Faucher, on your question. I want to correct one thing. In North America's share, I went back and looked at the numbers as we were looking at this. We gained value and volume share in total nonalcoholic beverages. We gained significant volume and value share in still. In sparkling, it was a slight loss of share. And the reason I said that we actually gained share is internally, as I was thinking about it, I was actually taking some pipeline, filling out. That's not the way you should look at it. So there was a slight loss of share.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Gary and Jackson. In closing, this quarter's results provide yet another proof point that our company and our system are on track to deliver our 2020 Vision. The tremendous opportunity we see ahead for our company in all of our markets remain intact. As always, we thank you for your interest and investment in our company. There is no greater responsibility than earning and maintaining your trust and your confidence. You can rest assured that our entire leadership team is working diligently to protect and grow the value of your investment in our company.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors and, therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed.

Following prepared remarks this morning, we'll turn the call over for your questions.","Before we begin though, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objective and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.","In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com, under the Reports and Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconciles certain non-GAAP measures, financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussions this morning, and from time-to-time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Please look on our website for this information.","Now I will turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm pleased to share The Coca-Cola Company continues to operate from a position of real strength. Our brands continue to get stronger. Our strategies continue to be sound, and our execution continues to be focused and effective. All of this continues to drive sustainable growth and continues to bring us closer to achieving our 2020 Vision. One day, one week, one month and one quarter at a time. Thanks to the extraordinary determination and resolve of our 146,000 company associates around the world, we delivered volume and revenue growth this quarter in every one of our 5 geographic operating groups. And we achieved financial results for both the quarter and the full year in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets, making this the seventh consecutive quarter we have either met or exceeded our long-term growth targets.","Our global sparkling beverage portfolio kept growing, up 2% for the quarter and a solid 4% for the full year. Our global still beverage portfolio is also performing well, up 6% for the quarter and a strong 8% for the full year. And we gained global volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, while also gaining global share in both sparkling and still beverage categories. We achieved these results for both the quarter and the full year against the backdrop of a volatile global economic landscape. Even as we believe that the unease in the global markets will continue in the near term, the breadth of our global footprint and the strength of our brands create a business that was built for times like these, resilient and resolute to grow.","Our solid performance in 2011 reflects the consistent investments we have made over time to strengthen the health of our brands, starting with brand Coca-Cola, the very oxygen of our business, up 3% in both the quarter and the full year. In fact, brand Coca-Cola grew by at least 24 million servings in 24 different countries this past quarter. Our brand health and brand value have been created over the long-term through strong and consistent investments in our business, rather than through short-term incremental actions. And this is why we remain so committed to our long-term brand investment strategies. Our 2011 performance results underscore how our company, together with our global bottling partners, is well aligned and positioned to lead in this difficult environment.","As we enter into the third year of our 2020 Vision, our roadmap for winning together remains clear to us and our committed bottling partners. The assumptions that shaped our vision have not changed. Our expectations for strong performance have not wavered. The key to our calculus for growth and achieving our 2020 Vision will be to ensure that we keep creating balanced growth across both emerging and developed markets, as well as sparkling and still categories.","We successfully achieved this balance in 2011. For the full year, we delivered almost 1 billion unit cases of incremental organic volume growth, or the equivalent of adding another Japan to our business. And importantly, we delivered positive full year growth in key developed markets like North America, Japan and Germany, while also generating double-digit full year growth in key emerging markets like India and China. And we will continue to make significant investments in our future, all across the world.","In fact, in order to achieve our 2020 Vision, we anticipate our global system will add about 100,000 jobs in this decade as we invest to support the tremendous opportunity we see in nonalcoholic beverages, one of the fastest-growing industries in consumer packaged goods.","So let's review our fourth quarter and full year results. Worldwide, we grew volume 3% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target. For the full year, we grew worldwide volume by 5%, including the benefit of cross-licensed brands, primarily Dr. Pepper in North America. Excluding these brands, we delivered strong full year volume growth of 4%, also in line with our long-term target.","As for our profit results, we grew comparable earnings per share by 10% for both the quarter and the full year, ahead of our long-term target. As we close the second year of our 2020 Vision, this also marks the second consecutive year we've delivered double-digit comparable earnings per share growth. ","Now let's briefly review performance results across our operating groups, beginning first with North America where our team remains focused on driving profitable and sustainable growth. North America volume was up 1% in the quarter, making this North America's seventh consecutive quarter of growth. And for the full year, North America's organic volume growth was also up 1%.","The North America business gained total market volume and value share in sparkling, still and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in both the quarter and the full year. And we delivered these strong results while in the process of successfully integrating the largest acquisition in our company's history. Our sparkling beverage results in North America were even for the quarter, with brand Coca-Cola volume up 1%. We achieved these results while also earning an increase in retail pricing of 4% in sparkling beverages through the effective execution of our occasion-based brand, package, price and channel strategies.","As for Coke Zero, it was up high-single digits in North America this past quarter and up double digits for the full year, making this the fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. We also drove positive growth for Fanta, which was up 3% in 2011, its second consecutive year of positive growth.","Our still beverages in North America delivered 3% growth in the quarter and 4% growth for the full year while gaining share for the seventh consecutive quarter. POWERADE continues to be a leading driver of this solid growth, up 11% in the quarter and 12% for the full year. And POWERADE once again captured both volume and value share in the sports drinks category, both for the quarter and for the full year. Our key brands delivered double-digit growth in the quarter led by Gold Peak, which grew double digits for the 19th consecutive quarter.","As we've always said, there's no other western developed market in the world that boasts as dynamic the demographics as those present in North America between now and 2020. Young, vibrant, diverse, educated and entrepreneurial. We like these attributes and have every reason to remain excited about the long-term outlook of our flagship market.","Turning now to our Pacific Group where in 2011, our business again delivered consistent growth across a diverse set of markets. Overall, our Pacific Group volume was up 5% in both the quarter and the full year, and these results were led by China, up double digits in the quarter and for the full year, making this 9 out of the last 10 years that our business in China has delivered double-digit growth.","Our efforts to enhance the consumer experience with our sparkling beverage brands keep paying dividends, with sparkling beverages up double digits in China for both the quarter and the full year. Importantly, we're seeing strong growth across our entire sparkling portfolio, with Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta all delivering double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter as well as in the full year 2011.","At the same time, our still beverage portfolio brands are sustaining their solid momentum, also delivering double-digit growth for the full year. These results confirm that we are executing the right strategies and have the right capabilities in place in China to deliver sustainable double-digit growth over the long-term.","Japan's fourth quarter results were up 5%, resulting in slightly positive full year growth, rounding to even. This is a better-than-anticipated full year result in light of the tragic national disasters that occurred last March. This also underscores the strength and resilience of our people and brands across the entire Japanese bottling system. Notably, we realized greater momentum across several key channels in Japan this quarter, including convenience stores and vending as we further increase our focus on single-serve beverages.","Moving now to Latin America where in 2011 we once again expanded our volume and value share leadership position. Volume in this total region was up 4% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. This strong performance was once again led by Mexico, up 4% for the quarter and 9% for the full year. Our business in Mexico gained volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for both the quarter and the full year. In fact, our still beverage portfolio in Mexico reached nearly 1 billion unit cases in 2011, a short 4 years after the successful integration of Jugos Del Valle into our winning portfolio.","The rapid evolution of our brands in Mexico is a great testament to our team's ability to execute clear, occasion-based channel strategies across all beverage categories in this key market. We're also advancing our momentum in Argentina, which delivered double-digit full year growth while capturing volume and value share in both sparkling and still beverages for the 12th consecutive quarter.","And finally, Brazil, volume was up 1% for the full year. Despite a general slowdown in the economy and unfavorable weather, our business in Brazil keeps outperforming the industry, gaining share across both sparkling and still beverages in both for the quarter as well as the full year.","Let's now turn to the Eurasia and Africa Group. In 2011, we made sound progress against our goal to strategically invest for tomorrow while gaining share today. Volume in this region grew 4% in the quarter and a solid 6% for the full year. Importantly, our growth in Eurasia and Africa was driven by the continued strong momentum of brand Coca-Cola, up 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year 2011.","Our overall performance in this key region was once again led by India, which delivered 20% growth for the quarter, resulting in double-digit growth for the full year. 2011 was the fifth consecutive year that India achieved double-digit growth. And that\u2019s been the case throughout 2011, growth in India was well balanced across our entire portfolio. Sparkling beverages in India were up over 20% this quarter while brand Coca-Cola was up a strong 15%. And still beverages in India were up 16% this quarter, benefiting from a healthy growth across our juice portfolio, including Maaza, up 19%.","Russia was down low-single digits in the quarter, fourth quarter, cycling last year's very strong 31% growth. On a full year basis, our business in Russia was up mid-single digits. Our business in Russia is being led by the strong growth of brand Coca-Cola, which delivered double-digit growth in 2011. Brand Coca-Cola is now more than twice the size of our primary competitor's cola brand in Russia. Notably, our overall business in Russia keeps outperforming the rest of the industry, gaining both sparkling and still beverage volume and value share.","Turning to Turkey. We gained volume and value share this quarter in both sparkling and still beverages. For 2011, Turkey again delivered double-digit growth as it did the previous year in 2010. And despite geopolitical challenges in the region, our Middle East and North Africa business unit delivered a solid 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year.","A clear example of our commitment to invest in tomorrow in this exciting Middle East region is our recently announced agreement to acquire approximately half of the equity of Aujan Industries. Aujan holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. Their brands hold a top 3 position in every market where they compete. This strong partnership with Aujan, coupled with the strength of our bottling partners, will make the Coca-Cola system a leader in the fast-growing still beverage category in the Middle East.","Let's now turn to Europe, a region of the world that is still facing a very uncertain economic environment. Yet, for The Coca-Cola Company, it is also a region that serves as a testament to how well our system is positioned to face these serious economic challenges. Our business in Europe grew 1% in the quarter, making this Europe's sixth consecutive quarter of volume growth, resulting in a full year growth rate of 2%. We achieved these results by strategically tailoring our price and package offerings to meet the needs of each market and their varying economic conditions. Our growth in Europe was widespread, with positive fourth quarter and full year growth across several key markets in Northwest Europe and Spain. And we saw the continued growth of Innocent, supported by the successful launch of not-from-concentrate juice in Great Britain. Our growth in Europe was once again led by Germany, up a very strong 9% for the quarter and up 6% for the full year, representing our best full year growth result in Germany since 1992.","While some of this growth should be attributed to favorable weather and consumer sentiment, there's no doubt that our bottling restructuring efforts as well as effective marketing campaigns have played a key role in this improvement. We're confident that our business in Germany is in a sound position to continue delivering long-term sustainable growth.","Looking ahead to 2012 and 2013. Despite the lingering debt crisis coupled with economic and political uncertainty, we are confident that we have the right brands, the right structure, the right strategies and right capabilities in place to continue delivering profitable growth in Europe over the longer term.","Now let's turn to an overview of how we are building our brands. As we've said before, we always place our brands first in all that we do, across more than 200 countries all around the world. This is how we've built the world's most valuable beverage brand portfolio, with 15 $1 billion brands, more than any other beverage company. Our top 4 brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Diet Coke, all once again exceeded $10 billion in global retail sales in 2011. A key component of how we strengthen our global brand portfolio is through innovative consumer engagement. We continuously strive to engage with our consumers in an integrated manner across all social media platforms. A recent example of our efforts in this front was this past weekend's very successful Super Bowl campaign where we engaged fans like never before. Through a unique online viewing experience, fans got to chat with our animated polar bears and see their game reactions. And they watched the bears move from the digital realm of the TV as they starred in 3 new well-received and highly rated TV commercials. And an estimated 300,000-plus fans joined the polar bears live, far exceeding expectations. And by the second quarter, the Coca-Cola Facebook feed was receiving 3,400 hits per second. This is just one of the -- a string of marketing achievements for our company.","Recently, we were humbled by the Advertising Age naming The Coca-Cola Company as its 2011 Marketer of the Year. And it's gratifying to see our global marketing efforts recognized by this industry-leading publication as we strive to develop and deploy the world's most innovative and effective marketing.","Let me update you now on our progress around winning at the point of sale. Our system continues to develop critical capabilities to better support over 20 million customers we partner with each and every week to deliver these servings. We measure our progress against this effort by tracking our results across several high-impact, pragmatic and locally actionable metrics. One metric we have referenced several times this past year is our immediate consumption volume growth. And this metric is meaningful as it drives trial, drives recruitment and system profitability. In 2011, our immediate consumption beverages were up 4% globally, driven by focused in-store activation efforts and cold drink equipment expansion. In fact, as a global system, we've placed over 1.2 million new pieces of cold drink equipment in 2011 and have placed over 2.2 million since 2010, the first year of our 2020 Vision.","Another key metric we monitor closely is the expansion of our right execution daily, or RED program in short. Some of you may remember RED as our world-class commercial process designed to improve execution at the outlet level. Today, operations representing over 1\/3 of our global volume utilize RED. And for comparison, when we initiated our 2020 Vision just 3 years ago, less than 15% of our global volume was distributed through operations using RED. So as we move into 2012, our RED program will remain an area of increasing emphasis, focus and growth for our system.","Before concluding our operating results review, I'd like to update you on our productivity goals. A leading priority of our company is to design and implement an effective and efficient business system, with productivity as one of our core pillars of our 2020 Vision. As such, in 2012, we're implementing a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program that we will -- we expect will achieve between $550 million and $650 million of total incremental annualized savings by the end of 2015. I'm pleased and excited to announce this program from a position of continued growth and momentum towards realizing our 2020 Vision as we consistently deliver results in line with or ahead of our long-term targets. This program will further enable our efforts to strengthen our brands and reinvest our resources to drive long-term profitable growth.","We remain relentless in our efforts to become more efficient, leaner and adaptive to changing market conditions, while at the same time building a continuous improvement in cost management culture in keeping with our 2020 Vision. Gary is going to share further details about this new 4-year program in a few moments.","Finally, I also want to highlight some of the important progress we're making in the area of sustainable packaging, water stewardship and climate protection. By the end of 2011, we've shipped nearly 10 billion PlantBottle packages, helping reduce our annual emissions of carbon dioxide, while also decreasing our dependency on oil-based resin. As noted in our latest Sustainability Report, we improved our water use efficiency for the eighth consecutive year, reducing the average amount of water required to produce each beverage serving. We estimate that we replenished 35% of the water used in our finished products due to some 380-plus community water partnerships in 94 countries as we work toward our goal of water neutrality by 2020. And we increased our production volume while reducing our system-wide global carbon emissions by 2%, putting us a step closer to our goal of growing our business but not our carbon.","These are just a few examples of how we're building our business responsibly by making a positive difference in the communities that we serve -- we proudly serve. These efforts are helping us engage with consumers, reduce our cost of doing business and improve our bottom line.","We are keenly aware of how uncertain the global economic landscape remains today. That said, as we look ahead, we see a world looking for hope, for optimism and for renewal. The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system is uniquely positioned to refresh this thirsty world. We're refreshing the thirst of our investors consistently by delivering high-quality returns to shareowners, while also generating steady cash flows and paying a steady healthy dividend. We're refreshing the needs of thirsty global consumers through our diverse brand portfolio and the world's most innovative and effective marketing. We're refreshing the needs of a thirsty system by increasing our levels of global investment along with our dedicated bottling partners. We're refreshing our operations through a culture of continuous improvement. And central to this is extending and driving productivity efforts to design and implement a more effective and efficient business system. And we are refreshing the needs of our communities through global and industry sustainability leadership.","The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry grew by $35 billion in total retail value in 2011. We're pleased to say that our Coca-Cola system represented more than 40% of this total industry growth, underscoring that our 2020 Vision is working well. And while 2011 was another strong year of performance for The Coca-Cola Company, we believe we are just getting started and that our best and brightest days lie ahead.","We have a lot to be thankful for, and confident about healthy and beloved brand, a clear roadmap for continued growth, a well-aligned global bottling system, dedicated and passionate associates and strong financial results and discipline. Taking into account all of these assets to our business, we remain resolute in our desire and confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets and further enhance the value of your investment in The Coca-Cola Company.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.","Gary P. Fayard","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We once again delivered quality results this quarter and for the full year, in line with or ahead of our long-term growth targets. In fact, our full year volume and profit results were in line with or exceeded our long-term growth targets for the sixth consecutive year. We continue to achieve these consistent high-quality results during a period of still mixed economic recovery, which is a real testament to our global system's ability to execute our strategic plans in alignment with our 2020 Vision.","So let's review our earnings results in more detail. We reported comparable earnings per share of $0.79 this quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. Our full year comparable earnings per share growth also was up 10%, ahead of our long-term growth targets. For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income was up 14%, bringing our full year comparable currency neutral operating income growth to 12%, also ahead of our long-term growth target. For clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable operating income results was a 3% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year, right in line with the quarterly and full year outlook range we've provided during our last earnings call in October. Our business delivered comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 6% this quarter, in line with our long-term growth target, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales and positive price mix.","On a full year basis, our comparable currency neutral net revenue growth came in at 29%, including a 5% increase in concentrate sales, positive price mix and the impact of the CCE transaction. And again, for clarity, the impact of currency on our comparable net revenue results was a 1% headwind for the quarter and a 3% benefit for the full year.","Our combined international and bottling investments group price product mix was a positive 3% for the quarter. And our North American price product mix came in at a positive 2% in the quarter, driven by a 4% increase in our pricing to retailers for our sparkling beverages in North America.","Our consolidated geographic mix was down 1%, which resulted in a consolidated price mix at the midpoint of our long-term target range of 1% to 2%. For 2012, we anticipate our consolidated price mix results will remain in this target range of 1% to 2%.","Turning to the rest of our P&L. We expected our consolidated comparable gross revenues to decrease slightly in 2011, which they did due to increased commodity cost, as well as the impact of our acquisition of CCE's North American bottling operations. Importantly, we expect our 2012 consolidated comparable gross margins will remain in line with 2011, even after taking into consideration further commodity cost inflation, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.","Our comparable currency neutral SG&A expenses were even in the quarter and up 30% for the full year. As explained in prior quarterly calls, this full year increase reflects the impact of acquiring CCE's former North American business, which we did not fully cycle until the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in SG&A also reflects our continued investments around the world. On this front, for the full year 2011, we grew our direct marketing expenses ahead of unit case growth, sustaining our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands.","As for operating expense leverage, it came in positive this quarter for both North America and the Bottling Investments Group. As expected, operating expense leverage for our international operations came in slightly negative in the fourth quarter due to the timing of expenses. And operating expense leverage for international came in at even for the full year as planned.","For 2012, we expect to capture low-single digit operating expense leverage as we keep strategically investing in brand-building activities around the world and efficiently managing our operating expenses.","Our net interest income came in at a positive $66 million, slightly above the full year forecast we provided in our last earnings call. For 2012, our best estimate is that net interest income will come in between $20 million and $40 million, primarily due to lower interest rates in some international locations. We expect this income to be spread relatively evenly across the quarters in 2012, and we'll update you each quarter as appropriate. Finally, we closed 2011 with an underlying effective tax rate of 23.9% and expect our 2012 underlying effective tax rate to fall between 24% and 25%. ","Moving to our cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, this came in at $9.5 billion. As a reminder, this cash flow result includes $769 million contribution made to our pension plans in the first quarter of 2011. Net of these additional pension plan contributions, we grew our net cash flow from operations a positive 7% for the full year.","With regards to our share repurchase program, our net share repurchases totaled $2.9 billion in 2011, at the high end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range communicated during our last earnings call. And in 2012, we again expect to repurchase a net share amount within the same $2.5 billion to $3 billion range.","Now let me take a moment to update our outlook on several additional items that may help you model our business in 2012, starting with a quick reminder about this year's calendar. Even though 2012 is a leap year, our first quarter of 2012 will have one less day when compared to the first quarter of 2011. And the fourth quarter of 2012 will have 2 more days when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011.","Now let me come back with our outlook on commodities. As we indicated in our last earnings call, our incremental commodity costs for 2011 came in at approximately $800 million. As a reminder, these costs were related to the raw material and conversion costs associated with sweeteners, metals, juices and PET plastic.","As we look ahead to 2012, we anticipate the underlying commodities related to these inputs will remain somewhat pressured, driven primarily by increases in the cost of juices and sweeteners. As a result, we expect the full year 2012 incremental impact of commodity costs on our results to range between $350 million and $450 million. Having said that, we believe we have the right strategic plans in place to mitigate the impact of these incremental commodity costs and remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets.","Turning now to currency. These have continued to fluctuate with the dollar strengthening, although more moderately against many key currencies. We're mostly hedged for 2012 on the euro and yen, with good coverage on several other currencies. After considering these hedged positions, we currently expect currencies to have a low single-digit negative impact on operating income for the first quarter of this year and a mid-single digit negative impact for the full year. As per our normal practice, we'll update you both on our commodity and currency forecast on a quarterly basis as we go through the year.","Now let me update you on our productivity goals. As we closed 2011, we've now successfully completed our 2008 to 2011 4-year global productivity program. We completed this program on plan and with actual annualized savings of over $500 million, exceeding our initial savings target of $400 million to $500 million. As Muhtar mentioned earlier, we're now launching a new 4-year productivity and reinvestment program. In light of this, I want to take a moment and walk you through the components of the new program.","First, a new 4-year global productivity initiative starting this year. This initiative will target between $350 million and $400 million in annualized savings focused around 4 primary areas: one, global supply chain optimization; two, global marketing and innovation effectiveness; three, OpEx leverage and operational excellence; and four, data and IT systems standardization. We're in the initial stages of defining the one-time costs associated with capturing these savings, and we'll provide an update on these costs in our next earnings call.","Second, as we move through 2011, we accelerated our CCR integration efforts to support brand-building initiatives, reinvest in marketing and sales capabilities, as well as to partially offset some of last year's increasing commodity costs. As a result, we effectively realized nearly all of the $350 million in annualized savings in 2011, almost 3 years ahead of schedule. This is a testament to the great work of our CCR team and their ability to effectively realize and capture synergies while simultaneously delivering profitable growth.","Further, we have successfully identified incremental CCR integration synergies in North America, primarily in the area of our North American product supply, which will better enable us to service our customers and consumers. As such, we now believe our CCR integration efforts will capture an incremental $200 million to $250 million above our original $350 million target. And we expect to capture these incremental annualized synergies starting this year in 2012 and fully realize them by the end of 2015.","Correspondingly, we're also increasing our estimate of total one-time cost associated with the capture of CCR synergies from $425 million to $800 million as we implement new initiatives to capture these higher synergies. Therefore, combining both our new global productivity initiative and our newly expanded CCR integration efforts represents a total incremental annualized savings of $550 million to $650 million. We expect to phase in the capture of these total incremental savings over 4 years, starting in 2012 through the end of 2015.","Going forward, we'll report our progress in capturing these total incremental savings under one joint productivity and reinvestment program.","As for how we intend to invest the savings generated by this new program, first, and in line with our 2020 Vision, these funds will enhance ongoing system-wide brand-building initiatives. And second, as these savings are realized, they may also help mitigate potential incremental near-term commodity costs.","As we look back on 2011, we are greatly encouraged by our business achieving yet another solid year of quality results. There is no better proof that our 2020 Vision is working than our company's continued ability to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed our long-term growth targets even while facing volatile market conditions. And as you consider how to model our business going forward, I want to be very clear that our system remains fully committed to continuing our relative historic price premium for our brands in the marketplace. For as we have communicated several times in the past, we strongly believe and have consistently proven that the best way to drive long-term sustainable value is by earning price with our consumers in concert with a robust occasion-based brand package and channel strategy that drives profitable sustainable growth.  That is why we remain confident we can keep delivering results in line with our long-term growth targets. Our system is healthy and financially strong. We continue to generate cash, invest in our brands, execute our 2020 Vision and growth strategies and pay a healthy dividend. Our seasoned management team, over 146,000 motivated company associates and highly capable global bottling partners are making the right actions and executing the right strategies to build on our strengths, to refresh a thirsty world and to drive our 2020 Vision.","Before concluding our prepared remarks, I want to remind you that I'm looking forward to presenting at CAGNY in Boca Raton on Wednesday, February 22; as well as at the CAGE Conference in London on Wednesday, March 21. I hope to see many of you there at these great investor and analyst events.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Muhtar, I guess 2 questions on the overall growth we saw in the quarter. We had been seeing 5s and 4s in terms of unit volume growth. We saw plus 3% in the quarter. I know comparisons were a factor, but can we zero in on the emerging markets trends you're seeing? And you highlighted the emerging markets, markets were per caps or below 150. You highlighted that was a plus 4% in the quarter. It was a plus 6% for the year. So is it possible to generalize on what's going on in those less developed markets and some of the plans you have to improve on that plus 4%?","Muhtar Kent","You mentioned 2 questions. The one is on emerging markets. Is there another one?","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, and the second is -- I guess the 2 parts are, a, what's driving that slowdown from kind of a plus 6% to a plus 4%? And then b, as you think about trying to see that 4% become a better number in coming quarters, what are some of the things you think that are going to help you do that?","Muhtar Kent","Yes. I mean, I think, first, I don't think you can draw any trend. And we're pleased with our volume growth of 3%, which is in line with our long-term growth targets. And I think it's important to note the following: We're cycling an organic volume growth of 5% in the prior year, and full year volume is 4%, at organically high end of our long-term growth target for the year. And I'm really particularly pleased that all operating groups grew in the quarter. So a cornerstone of our vision is balanced growth across all geographies and balanced growth across our portfolio. We achieved that both for the quarter and for the year. And I don't think you can draw any conclusions. And also, we achieved this kind of growth in the year with not only just a very volatile economic environment, volatile commodity environment, but also one-offs like the issue in the Japan, the flooding in Thailand, rightsizing in a huge market like China where now our transactions are significantly ahead of our volume, which is a testament to the health of the business. And so yes, we've had some -- there has been some dislocations in some Middle East markets because of the volatility there, because of what's happened like Egypt and like other parts in North Africa. We believe that we see that improving. There's been -- South East Europe has been under tremendous pressure. Again, those markets are under 150 per capita because of all the volatility that's going on in Europe and around Greece. But I think we shouldn't draw any conclusions. As we look into 2012, we see healthy trends continuing in Latin America, healthy trends continuing in Eurasia and Africa -- African continent and also Middle East and Eurasia. We see healthy trends in most of the Pacific Rim and area, and we see healthy trends right here in North America. Right now, we see better trends in terms of the consumer mobility, eating out more and just less confusion of the consumer here in North America than we did 12 months ago. And we see that manifesting itself in our Foodservice business. And Europe, finally, I think, is going to be more volatile. And I think we will probably see first half of the year being more challenged in Europe than the second half of the year. That's sort of the way I would sum it. But I do -- in Europe, we have some great markets continuing to grow like Germany, like Scandinavia, like Northwest Europe. And then we still have challenging markets in the Southern Rim. Although again we had moderate growth in Spain also in the fourth quarter. So I believe that we will achieve our long-term growth targets over time in terms of volume, as well as also in terms of our ability to generate price mix across the world.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That's great. And if I could follow up, zeroing in on some of those externals that you're describing, those dislocations you mentioned in regions like the Middle East and some of the other more recently more challenging markets, when you think about what's going on in some of those markets from a broader consumer standpoint and kind of what the Coca-Cola Company can do about those things, how are your packaging initiatives changing? And how are you thinking about spending money at the pull level in terms of how you're proposing folks take an added interest in your products in those markets?","Muhtar Kent","Number one, Mark, our brands are getting stronger. We're continuing to invest, and you will see us continue to invest. And what happens in a quarter is not the result of our investment in that quarter or the previous quarter, but what are our investments 3 or 4, 5, 6 quarters ago. And we will continue to invest. Our brands continue to gain share. And if you look at our share results overall, right now, in the world, both in sparkling and in still beverages, they're all-time high. Brand metrics for sparkling as well as still beverages are trending in a very healthy manner. So brand health investments, stronger system, better alignment, all basically works in our favor even in times of volatility. And we're seeing that manifest itself.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.","William Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Question. Looking out to 2012, we're likely going to see significant stepped up competitive spending in North America, maybe in some other markets. Gary, you talked about sustaining a price premium in the market. Muhtar, you talked about the long-term brand-building strategy. So how are you thinking about balancing profit growth goals, against sacrificing any market share in the event that the stepped up spending is greater than you expected in any one market any one given year? To what extent do you use portfolio management, et cetera?","Muhtar Kent","Look, you are mostly, Bill, talking about North America here, right?","William Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Yes. I mean, there could be stepped up spending in select international markets, but it probably would be mostly in North America. It's yet to be seen.","Muhtar Kent","Yes. So let me address North America first. We've achieved a pretty healthy price mix in the fourth quarter, 2% including a rate increase in retail pricing of sparkling beverages at 4% in North America. And our brand strength continues, with brand Coca-Cola up 1% in the same quarter. And I believe -- I think it would be right to assume that this kind of rational pricing would continue in terms of rate for 2012. And that's what I would say because I think there is never room in business for irrationality over the long term. And that's how I would project. And I think we have -- we're going into this from a point of strength. Our brands are stronger. Our system is much stronger. Our metrics for customer service are much, much better, and I see us continuing with our momentum. And I think pricing actions should continue into 2012 in terms of rationality. And we anticipate taking additional pricing on key segments of the business through this year in accordance with our normal commercial practices. And we manage a very broad portfolio of our business. That's how I would reference it. In terms of international, I think you heard Gary talk about a 3% price mix in international, and I believe that, that's a testament again to the strength of our international business, which continues to be able to generate good price mix on top of good volume and still growing our market share. Those are the key metrics for international.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on -- hoping you can provide a little bit more color on the price mix globally, that you reported up 1% in the quarter considering your geography mix was negative. So I guess I'd like to hear what some of the dynamics are that drove a negative geography mix? And then also, I'd be curious to hear how your price mix was impacted by your increased effort behind your smaller packages in a few of your key markets like North America and China.","Gary P. Fayard","Sure. Bonnie, why don't I take that one, initially anyway. If you look, where we actually came out was -- on consolidated price mix, it was right at 1.5% positive. So if you take that 3% for international including BIG, 2% for North America and then put like a negative 1% on geographic, you get right at -- it's 1.5% is where it comes out. And I would characterize it this way: that is a very good thing for the long-term. And that may sound unusual for me to say. But what it means is that we are continuing to invest and grow all of the emerging markets around the world. Most of those do have margins below the U.S. or Europe, for example, the more developed markets. But we're not milking the business. We're continuing to grow the business. At the same time, get very healthy margins in the business, and you can see those coming through the bottom line. So we continue to strengthen the whole business globally. As long as we're doing the right thing, I think you're going to see a negative geographic mix for a very long time, because what you want to see is healthy growth in emerging markets. You want to see very good growth in India. You want to see very good growth in China, et cetera. And at the same time, as Muhtar said, and critically important, then growth actually across every geographic region in which we operate. But when you put all that together, you will get negative geographic growth, and I think that's a great thing. But in total, as long as it's coming out in our 1% to 2% range, in the quarter it came out right in the middle of that, we're exactly where we want to be.","Muhtar Kent","Yes, Bonnie, just to complement what Gary said, I think the key takeaways from how we think about our business and the health of our business overall is that as long as we can continue to achieve our volume targets, which we believe we can, and coupled with the kind of price mix, positive price mix that Gary talked about that we achieved for the year and for the quarter, I think -- coupled again with the investments that we are making, have been making and are continuing to make in the business, add on to that the productivity and reinvestment program, add on to that the increased weight of our total marketing, because imagine, every year in the last 3, 4 years, we've been adding more -- around 1 billion cases to our total business, that brings with it more marketing, more distribution, more production, all of that, and then the positive share gains, then we feel very confident that we can continue to deliver our long-term targets, despite all the volatility in the world.","Gary P. Fayard","And Bonnie, let me just come back to the last part of your question. I forgot to -- on rightsizing in -- I'll characterize it this way. In China, what we're able to do is actually take the entry-level pack from a 600 ml down to a 500 ml size bottle at the same price. So we actually gave the consumer something they actually preferred at the same price, which implicitly carries a price increase inside of that. So from there, we actually generated margin. For the U.S., what we're very focused on is ensuring we\u2019re giving the consumer -- this is back to that occasion-based, right package, right channel, right time, right place, giving the consumer what they want. This is the way you drive profitable, sustainable growth and deliver margins rather than just taking a couple of sizes, stacking it high and selling it cheap.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to touch on the balance comments that you made earlier. And I guess, if you look at 2011, one of the real encouraging things is that the share of incremental profit in 2011 versus 2010 was pretty broad-based. So most regions contributed to incremental profit in 2011. If you look out to 2012, is that broadly, looking at the world this year, that you'll see more incremental profit growth from more regions, and I guess that helps offset some of the volatility in Europe? And then also, just connected to that, gross profit, I guess a little surprised that you're expecting gross margins to be flat, given the moderation in input cost. So if you could talk a little bit about that as well.","Muhtar Kent","This is Muhtar. Let me just start answering your question and then Gary can come in also. But I think in terms of the overall businesses concerned, we believe that we can definitely continue to achieve a balanced portfolio and balanced geographic growth. And I think it is really critical for us to be able to do that, as we've done in '09, '10 and '11. And we have reason to believe that we can grow across Western markets, and we can grow across, certainly across at a higher rate, across our emerging markets, and that you'll see that continuing. And as we continue to gain scale in the emerging markets, you will continue to see our margins improving in those markets as they have been doing in the last 3, 4 years. So I will just say that yes, definitely balanced across geographies, North America, Japan, Europe. And then certainly, again, broad-based in the portfolio, both in sparkling and in still beverages. And still beverages growth that I mentioned in Latin America, for example, and the fact that it's an almost -- it's got to 1 billion cases in Mexico after 4 short years after Jugos Del Valle got integrated successfully into our business and now it's in many, many markets, flourishing in many markets across Latin America, is just another testament of still how much growth Latin America has still to offer. And the good news is that again, the growth -- as we build on growth on Jugos Del Valle, it hasn't stopped in any way the growth of sparkling beverages that continue to flourish and continue to prosper in Latin America.","Gary P. Fayard","So Bryan, it's Gary. Let me just add to that a couple of things. When you're talking about -- first on balanced growth, the other thing I'd say is as you think about obviously the most volatile region or economically challenged region this year will be Europe -- but also remember that this is a year where there are 2 events taking place in Europe, the Olympics and the Euro Cup are both this year and we happen to be the sponsor of both of those. And so I think it's one of those things that's going to help us in that market as well. Relative to gross margins, I'd say what you should expect to see is you should have seen increasing margins. But what's happening is with that $350 million to $450 million of commodity pressure, what we're doing is we believe we can offset that and hold our margins with the pricing actions that we're taking in the market, as well as the productivity efforts that we're taking as well. So it's really those commodity pressures that, again, granted are half of what they were in '11, but still substantial in 2012.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And Gary, I guess in terms of the gross margin, the geographic mix I guess would also be a slight drag on that as well. Is that right?","Gary P. Fayard","It actually is. Yes, it is.","Muhtar Kent","And Bryan, just to close it, don't underestimate the fact that what I mentioned about immediate consumption growth. That is a critical element that has higher margins, higher prices, and it improves the mix of our business. And that is continuing at a very healthy rate, particularly also in Western markets like North America, as well as Europe. And that is again a key testament to the strength of our system, which requires very disciplined execution in the marketplace on a day-to-day basis. And I was recently in Western Europe in the marketplace with John Brock, our partner in CCE, and we saw great examples of how both the activation has already started around the Olympics, but also great execution in the marketplace from an immediate consumption perspective, as well as the brand, price, pack, occasion, channel architecture really working in our favor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Gary, a bit of a follow-up to Bryan's question, but really drilling into North America profit number. In fourth quarter, first clean quarter in lapping CCE acquisition, your profit was up 25%. I think the benefit that you called out in Q1, the timing shift on marketing, was about 7 points. So even excluding that, it looks like the profit was up pretty nicely in fourth quarter. So maybe a little bit of color as to what drove that profit improvement in Q4. And then as you think about 2012, you've got moderating inflation, you've got pricing that went into the marketplace, you've got cost synergies and cost savings coming through, why wouldn't we expect to see a pretty healthy profit growth in North America in 2012?","Gary P. Fayard","Okay. Thanks, Judy, very insightful question. Now let me see if I can give an insightful answer. Here's what I'd tell you. Relative to the fourth quarter performance on North America, you do see very healthy increase. A lot of that is actually what we're cycling. Because a lot of the marketing in the fourth quarter in legacy CCE, when we acquired it, there was a lot of marketing that was spent in the fourth quarter of 2010 that CCE had already planned and then we executed against in that fourth quarter. This year actually got spread through the year. So it was a timing of marketing, and so there are a few of those type anomalies. If you remember, if you go back I think I said in the third quarter call, that the fourth quarter of this year will be the first quarter that's actually comparable, but there are still some unusual things in the fourth quarter of 2010 that you need to go back and make sure you look at. So I just -- I'd say, everyone on the call, if you're interested in that, go back and look at some of those things. And what you'll see, it'll actually bring that profit increase down. It's still a nice increase and profitable, but it'll bring it down some in the fourth quarter of 2011. Relative to 2012, let me just say I hear you, and we are very enthusiastic about our business in North America. It is operating well. They were able to do one of the largest vertical integrations in the history of business and do it flawlessly, get basically 4 years of synergies in the first year, increased those synergies and at the same time continue to execute and take share in the market in a very profitable way. So I feel very good about North America, I'm bullish on North America. And we've got a very capable team over there executing every day.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Gary, just a follow-up on currency. The mid-single digit impact for the full year 2012 sounds like the hedged position is a bit of a drag. If you just take the spot rates, it sort of calculates to more like a low-single digit rate for the full year. So is that the correct assumption? And then to the extent that if there is an upside to currency, is it fair to assume that, that's going to come more from the emerging market currencies that you don't really hedge?","Gary P. Fayard","Yes, Judy. Actually, the hedge positions we have are in the money today. So on the euros particularly, we're in the money on that. So better than current spot. But where the drag is coming from and what you're not seeing is that it's really all those emerging market countries. And you'd be surprised at a lot of little countries that actually can start having, you add them all up and they can have a pretty large impact, which is moving you from -- I think you're probably seeing low-single digits, and I'm seeing mid-single digits full year, even though it's low-single digits first quarter. But if you look at Brazil, which is one of the big ones, it's been a pretty big move. Brazil strengthened significantly during last year then weakened significantly, and now it's coming back some. But it's a lot of these smaller emerging market currencies that are giving that impact. Now with that said, if you -- let me just tell you, give you some idea of the volatility. The swing of currencies on our earnings in 2012 in the last month is over $100 million in the last 30 days. And that's an improvement, by the way. Because we're seeing those kind of volatilities, we're seeing a lot of those emerging market currencies starting to come back, and they're coming back as the world is starting to accept a little risk where there was total risk aversion a month -- 6 weeks ago. So is there some upside? I hope so, but I don't know today. Because of the volatility, we just don't know. But I think as we move through the year, we'll continue -- but the volatility is going to continue as well.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division","A couple of things. In Japan, you had excellent volume growth and yet margins in the Pacific region were awful. And that to me was -- and when I say awful, they were down a lot year-over-year. That to me is surprising, especially given you had single-serve growth in Japan. So if you could address that, that would be really helpful. And then 2 other markets that looked surprisingly soft, Brazil went flat, which it really had been sort of bucking difficult economic trends. Did something change in Brazil? And then finally, it looks like Philippines were down fairly close to 20%. So if you could just address those 3 markets please?","Muhtar Kent","Sure, Caroline. Let me start. I think Pacific volume grew a healthy 5% in both Q4 and the full quarter. And yes, Japan actually -- very positive in Japan, and it's a testament again to the strength of our system in Japan, to what we're doing in Japan, to the leadership of our business as well as our system in Japan. And I think that we ended up slightly positive despite all the dislocations in Japan. And that again basically bodes well going forward as to the strength of our business there. I think in terms of your question, how that relates to the Pacific, you need to look at I think the full year results of the Pacific. It was, from an income perspective, overall positive. And it's about the timing, and it's about marketing. Expenses also. How they're sort of distributed over the year. In terms of Brazil, I would say that Brazil -- I could just summarize by saying volume was up 1% for the full year. General slowdown of the economy and unfavorable weather did impact our business, but we are outperforming the industry, gaining share across all categories for the quarter and the full year. And I think you should expect sequential improvement in Brazil as we move through 2012. As far as Philippines is concerned, we've had essentially a difficult year as we continue to transform that business as it needs to be transformed into a healthy situation for the long term. And think about our German business, it took us a while to get it going again. We believe that certainly, the worst has passed us in the Philippines and that we should have -- in terms of also the tough macroeconomic environment post the elections has lingered on. But we believe that 2012 will be a better year in the Philippines than -- 2012 will be a better year than 2011. And I think Gary just wants to add something.","Gary P. Fayard","Yes, Caroline, it's Gary. I just want to correct one thing. On the Philippines, I think you said you were looking at it, you were thinking it was down 20% or so. Let me just -- Philippines in the fourth quarter and full year were down high-single digits. So high-single digits. It was not anything close to 20%.","Muhtar Kent","Good. Thank you, Gary and Jackson. So in closing, our strong 2011 performance results and our consistent belief in the solid fundamentals of this great business provide us with the confidence we need to reaffirm our belief in our 2020 Vision. We're refreshing a thirsty world with a capable, resilient and advantaged system. We're laser-focused on delivering our 2020 Vision, and we remain committed to driving shareowner value through consistent, continuous investments for growth, dividend distributions and share repurchases.

Please look on our website for this information.","Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson and good morning, everyone. Before we review this quarter's operating results, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the senseless events that took place in Boston yesterday. We were deeply saddened by this news and our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this horrible tragedy.","Now turning to this quarter's results. We are pleased with our first quarter performance. The great women and men of The Coca Cola Company, Coca Cola system delivered solid performance results in line with our expectations. On a global basis, we once again gained value share. We have now gained global value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for 23 consecutive quarters.","In spite of a challenging global economic times of the last few years, our people and our system bottling partners are executing the right strategies to advance us further towards our 2020 vision. Since the launch of our 2020 vision at the beginning of 2010, we have increased daily servings by more than 225 million, we have lifted global volume and value share to the highest levels since 2003, and more than $48 billion have been added to the Coca-Cola Company's market capitalization.","Across the system, we are continuing to invest together for a better tomorrow. In fact, we enter 2013 and the fourth year of our journey to 2020 from a position of real strength clearly focused and well on track to reach our goals and objectives and our global bottling system is healthier than ever before.","The strength of our brands and the promise of sustainable growth are fueling our bottlers' efforts to become more efficient, improve capability and further strengthen execution. We are working closely with our bottling partners around the world to rapidly realize opportunities to execute with precision and to continue winning at the point of sale.","We are innovating and investing in the health of our brand, in our capabilities and in new opportunities for growth across the entire non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage landscape. We are leading the industry dialogue around obesity and strengthening the sparkling category by bringing forward new packaging choices, transparency in labeling and new sweetener solutions while also championing energy balance and promoting physical activity.","We are working across the golden triangle of government, civil society and business to create real value and to make a lasting positive difference. And more importantly, we continue to generate shareowner value.","To that end, in the first quarter of 2013, we grew worldwide volume by 4%, cycling 5% from prior year and once again captured global non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage value share with volume and value share gains in core sparkling category.","Our global sparkling portfolio grew 3%, led by brand Coca-Cola growth of 3%, while Fanta grew 6% and Sprite grew 5%. Sparkling brands contributed nearly two-thirds of our global volume growth.","Worldwide still beverage volume grew 6% in the quarter, with growth across most still beverage categories, including ready-to-drink tea, juices and juice drinks as well as packaged water. These gains enabled us to capture global still beverage volume and value share. And, immediate consumption volume also grew 3%, with growth across both, sparkling and still beverage.","As announced during our 2012 year-end earnings call, we implemented a new organizational structure effective January 1st of this year that includes Coca-Cola Americas, which began 2013 by growing volume 3% and Coca-Cola International, which grew volume by 5%.","Moving now to operating groups, I will start with North America, where we remain resolutely focused on driving sustainable growth. We are pleased to report that North America continued to build on three successive years of growth with 1% volume growth in the first quarter, resulting in volume and value share gains. We are winning by investing in our portfolio of preferred brands by executing with excellence at the point-of-sale and by creating efficiencies and synergies across our manufacturing sales and distribution networks.","Although sparkling volume was down by 1% in the quarter, we achieved 3% sparkling price mix reflecting our focus on value creation. Importantly, brand Coca-Cola grew this quarter, aided by double-digit growth in both, mini cans and in our 1.25-liter package, underscoring the strength of our flagship brand and the success of our occasion-based package architecture. Coca-Cola also extended its favorite brand lead to over two times its closest competitor in North America.","Sparkling beverages gained volume and value share as marketing and execution are enabling us to win in the marketplace. Still beverage volume grew 6% in the quarter, cycling 6% from prior year. Our portfolio of still beverage brands has now captured volume and value share for 21 of the past 23 quarters.","Our key brands grew strong double digits and captured volume and value share of the ready-to-drink tea category. Growth was driven by Hones Tea at the premium end of the market, the ongoing rollout of Fuze which is now available in 70% of total U.S. supermarkets and continued Gold Peak growth. As you may know, we have built Gold Peak from scratch since launching it in 2006. The brand has grown by double digits for 24 consecutive quarters and is rapidly on its way to becoming a $1 billion brand.","Our juice and juice drink portfolio grew 3% in the quarter gaining volume and value share, simply was up 9% thanks to the addition of new flavors and the growth in Simply Single-Serve. Our Minute Maid trademark grew 4% due to the expansion of Minute Maid punches as well as gains in the light segment of the chilled juice drink category. North America water business grew 5% led by growth of DASANI which continues to maintain a price premium to its primary competitors. Smart water maintained its streak delivering its 20th consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Now, energy portfolio delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of volume growth and gained volume and value share.","As announced earlier today, we are taking a significant step towards our 2020 vision by commencing the implementation of a 21st century beverage partnership model in the United States. The franchise system has always been the strength of the Coca Cola business globally and today we are accelerating the transformation of our U.S. system in ways that will establish a clear path to help us achieve our 2020 vision.","In the coming months, we will be collaborating with five of our bottling partners to implement a plan which will include the granting of exclusive territory rights and the sale of distribution assets with cold drink equipment. In the near term, production assets will remain with Coca Cola Refreshments which will facilitate future implementation of a national product supply system. These actions are being taken ahead of our previously stated timeline. The result will be further progress towards a more agile, modern, customer focused franchise business model unique to the United States.","We remain confident that we have the right strategies for North America and we are optimistic about the outlook for this important critical market despite the challenging competitive environment and macroeconomic backdrop. As today's results indicate, The Coca Cola Company's brand marketing, commercial execution and category leadership efforts are all working together to enable us to sustainably win at the point of sale.","Turning now to Latin America. We are building the business from a position of real strength having realized solid 4% volume growth in the quarter, cycling 5%. Sparkling beverages in Latin America grew 2% with brand Coca-Cola also up 2% enabling us to gain both volume and value share. Still beverages across Latin America delivered double-digit growth, gaining volume and value share thanks to growth across the portfolio including double digit growth for both Del Valle juices and juice drinks as well as POWERADE.","In Mexico, brand Coca-Cola growth combined with high single-digit growth of our still brands helped drive overall volume growth of 3% in the quarter enabling us to capture volume and value share of nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.","In Brazil, where volume also grew 3%, brand Coca-Cola delivered 2% growth while Fanta grew 8% and Del Valle delivered 15% growth enabling us to gain volume and value share in this important market.","The Latin Fanta business unit, which stretches from Equador to Belize and encompasses the Caribbean grew volume by double-digits and trademark Coca-Cola expanded its leadership growing high single digits through consumer relevant propositions that include increasing availability of our 1.25 liter returnable glass bottle and expanding immediate consumption PET. We continue to see growth opportunities across Latin America which is the company's largest operating group in terms of unit case volume and where we have gained value share in 21 of the last 23 quarters.","Moving now to the Pacific group. We generated 3% overall volume growth, cycling 9% from prior year, led by high single digit growth in brand Coca-Cola. At a country level, volume in China grew by 1%, cycling strong 9% growth. Sparkling beverages grew high single digits while the juice and juice drinks business grew by double-digits following the introduction of Minute Maid Pulpy PET and Minute Maid Pulpy Mango.","This growth was partially offset by a decline in water volume as we cycled strong water growth. These results reflect sequential improvements and are in line with expectations we shared during our year end call. Importantly, we believe that we will continue to realize sequential improvements through 2013. At the same time, we also believe that it is going to take a period of time for consumption to return to the growth levels of previous years. Nevertheless, we had every confidence in the long-term resilience of our China business and we remain optimistic about our long-term opportunities to generate robust growth in this region over time.","In Japan, volume growth was 1%, in line with expectations, cycling 3% growth from prior year. Sparkling growth was up mid single-digit led by trademark Coca-Cola, and in particular, Coca-Cola Zero up double digits driven by the successful Zero Limit national promotion.","Ayataka green tea and LOHAS water our newest $1 billion-dollar brand in Japan continued their double-digit growth and contributed to solid growth in the important convenience store channel.","Turning to India, which as a reminder we are now reporting within the Pacific group, we delivered high single-digit volume growth, cycling strong double-digit growth from last year and we gained volume and value share in sparkling while also increasing our pricing. Growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which grew a strong 30% in the quarter. Thanks to a strong, robust integrated marketing and communications' campaign and strong in-market execution.","In the first quarter alone, we added over 250,000 incremental outlets in India as significant increased chilled availability for our brands. Our still beverages in India grew mid-single digits, cycling strong double-digit growth while gaining both volume and value share.","In concluding our update of the Pacific, I would also like to recognize our continued strong performance in two exciting markets, Thailand and South Korea. In Thailand, we are maintain double-digit volume growth while rapidly investing in additional two factories. We are working in close alignment with our local bottling partners to further expand our leadership position in this important market.","In South Korea, we are generating broad-based growth across a diverse portfolio of strong brands with sparkling beverages growing high-single digits in the quarter led by brand Coca-Cola up 11%.","Turning now to the Eurasia and Africa group, we once again delivered double-digit volume growth, growing 15% while maintaining share. Brand Coca-Cola grew double digits bolstered by our award-winning Crazy for Good campaign. Fanta, Sprite and Coke Zero, all generated double-digit growth as well. Our still brand delivered double-digit growth led by Fuze Tea and the acquired volume related to the Aujan partnership.","Russia continued to deliver strong results, outpacing the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry with high single-digit volume growth. Growth was led by sparkling beverages, where we gained share for the eighth consecutive quarter as brand Coca-Cola grew 15%. Our still beverage portfolio gained volume and value share and Dobry juice continue its double-digit expansion.","One highlight I would like to mentioned with regard to Russia, is our effort to deepen the emotional connection with the consumers by leveraging the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. Our sponsorship of these games and the Torch relay will combine the passion of the Olympics spirit and Coca-Cola in the minds of millions of Russians as the porch will pass through thousands of Russians house. In fact, our activation of the porch really is already driving real connections to our consumers as evidenced by the more than 77,000 Torch bearer nominations we have received during our latest consumer promotion.","Turning to our Central Asia business unit, also continued a strong performance delivering double-digit growth in the quarter. Prior to concluding my update on Eurasia and Africa, I would like to note that the Middle East and North Africa business unit was recently awarded the company's Woodruff Cup. This is our most prestigious operating award honoring the top performance business units in our worldwide business system. Among other important accomplishments, the Middle East and North Africa business unit achieve double-digit volume and operating income growth for 2012.","We celebrated an important milestone with our partners at Aujan this quarter, as we toasted the billionth can of Rani juice produced since the start of our partnership. Rani is the leading juice brand in the Middle East and a terrific compliment to our existing juices in Eurasia and Africa, including Turkey which gained volume and value share for 10th consecutive quarter.","Turning now to Europe. The economic environment clearly remains uncertain across this region as persistent high unemployment, coupled with severe austerity measures are weighing on consumer sentiment and consumer spending. In fact, Nielson's latest global survey of consumer confidence and spending intentions indicate the consumer confidence fell in 20 of the 29 European markets in the fourth quarter of last year. Nevertheless our volume was even in the quarter cycling 1% growth from prior year which is a significant sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of last year. We grew volume and value share in nonalcoholic beverages, both sparkling beverages across the region including key markets like France, Germany and Great Britain.","There were pockets of volume growth across Europe with Germany growing a healthy 3%, the Nordic countries showing improvement and Great Britain returning to growth while gaining share due to strong integrated marketing campaigns and solid execution in the market place. For the near future, as European consumers remain cautious in their spending, we will keep investing for the long-term health of our business. These results from around the world underscore the laser focus that our system has on our strategic priorities as we advance further towards our 2020 vision.","Our five core strategic priorities are as follows. First, we must continue to grow sustainably and provide meaningful solutions that enhance the health and well-being of the communities we proudly serve. Second, we will win with Coca-Cola while actively promoting the brand and the category. Third, we must absolutely keep winning and executing with excellence at the point-of-sale. Fourth, we need to keep maximizing the value of our global beverage portfolio. Sixth, we will encourage and inspire our system and associates to deliver on our mission.","Looking back at the first quarter of 2013, we were also honored and humbled to receive several recognitions. We were again ranked number four on Fortune's list of Most Admired Companies and named one of the Most Innovative Companies in the World by FastCompany.","Also one of the most meaningful recognitions for the Coca-Cola system came from Catalyst, the leading nonprofit organization with a mission to expand opportunities for women in business. We were honored to accept the 2013 Catalyst Award in recognition of our global women initiative. This important initiative is focused on fuelling the advancement of women as dynamic leaders and entrepreneurs across the organization and also in communities throughout the world where we serve our customers and consumers.","Before moving on, I want to revisit a complex societal issue that touches us all, obesity. Beginning last year, The Coca-Cola Company took new steps to give consumers even more choices in packet sizes, sweeteners and beverages, including more low and no calories production while also providing clear nutritional information and by supporting fitness programs. Coca-Cola has a rich heritage of being associated with exercise, sports and active lifestyle.","Today we are using our marketing expertise and community connections to inform consumers about energy balance and to inspire more people to get moving. We firmly believe the challenges of obesity are solvable. The Coca-Cola system together with industry partners, NGOs and government is committed to being part of the solution.","In closing, I would like to reiterate that our brands are stronger than ever before. We delivered solid performance results this quarter in line with our expectations while continuing to gain global value share. Together, with our global system bottling partners, we are working diligently to unlock value, to execute with precision and to continue gaining volume and value share. We are leading the industry dialogue about obesity by bringing forward solutions, adding transparency to dialog around calories and championing energy dollars and physical activity.","We are generating value for our shareowners as evidenced by the recently announced 10% increase in our annual dividend, which is our 51st consecutive annual dividend increase. Even so, we remain constructively discontent as we seek to make the most of the growth opportunities we continue to see around the globe.","Please note that we are working each and every day to refresh the world, inspire moments of happiness and optimism, create value and make a meaningful difference in lives of our consumers, our customers and in the communities that we proudly serve.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Fayard","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. We delivered solid results this quarter underscoring once again that our company and global system are well positioned to execute our strategic plans and alignment with our 2020 vision. Achieving such consistent performance during a time of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty is a real testament to the strength of our global system and the investments we continue to make for long-term sustainable growth.","Before we get into the financial details of the quarter, let me remind you that we closed the sale of 51% of our bottling business in the Philippines to Coca-Cola FEMSA in January of this year and therefore we no longer are consolidating the Philippines results.","We anticipate that this transaction along with the previously announced, bottling merger in Brazil will have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenues, likewise our full year operating results should see a 1% structural impact. However, there should be a corresponding improvement to equity income, to our share of the results of these operations moving forward. As I shared in our 2012 year-end call, we do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results.","Moving now to our first quarter results, our comparable earnings per share were $0.46, up 5% versus the prior year quarter despite currency headwinds of approximately 4%. Our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 5% despite the impact of two fewer selling days and the impact of certain structural items. Currency was a 3% headwind on top on comparable operating income.","Comparable currency neutral net revenue grew 1% and grew 2% after adjusting for the impact of structural items. After adjusting for the effects of two fewer selling days in the quarter, unit case sales were in line with concentrate sales.","Price mix for the quarter was even, cycling 3% in the prior year quarter, and remember in the second quarter, we will also be cycling 3% price mix. However stated in our last earnings call, we expect to earn low single-digit consolidated price mix for 2013, consistent with our long-term growth model. We continue executing our occasion-based brand, price package and channel strategies with precision around the world.","Our comparable gross margin was 61.5%. This represents a slight improvement compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of geographic mix, the consolidation of the Philippines bottler and the impact of our foreign currency hedging program. We expect the improvement in our gross margin to moderate over the remainder of the year due to a shift in geographic mix.","With regards to operating expense leverage, we achieved three points of favorable operating leverage in the quarter, despite the impact of two fewer selling days at the end of was primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Philippines bottler as well as the benefit from a reversal of expenses related to some of our long-term incentive plans. This was partially offset by sustained strategic investments in our brand building activities around the world.","As we have shared before, we continue to expect operating expense leverage to be even to slightly positive for the full year. As you model our 2013 operating results and our corresponding expense leverage, let me also remind everyone that the 2013 calendar will have one less day when compared to 2012 and based on our quarterly closing calendar, as I said, we had two less days this quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2012 and our fourth quarter of 2013 will have one more day when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.","Moving now to net interest income. We came in at $14 million of income in this quarter, ahead of our initial forecast. We now expect net interest will be event to slightly positive for the remainder of the year.","Our underlying effective tax rate is 23.5%. We expect this rate to remain unchanged through 2014.","Cash flow from operations decreased 3% primarily due to the impact of the two fewer selling days in the period and unfavorable impact from currency and an increase in the use of working capital in preparation for the peak season of our growing global business. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate.","Turning to share repurchase. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled approximately $1.1 billion. This places us well on track to achieve the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range for full year 2013 that we communicate during our last earnings call.","As for currencies, we remain fully hedged on the Euro, Yen and Sterling for 2013 and into 2014 and we also have near term coverage in place with several other currencies. After considering the hedged positions and current spot rates, we expect currencies to be a 3% headwind for the second quarter and a 2% headwind for the full year.","As you have all seen the movement of Yen in recent months, as mentioned, we have hedged our Yen exposure for this year and into next year but we do believe that the weaker Yen will ultimately be beneficial for the Japanese economy and for our business.","In closing, and as Muhtar shared earlier, we are delivering on our strategic priorities and achieving real success. We fully expect operating income to be in line with our long-term growth target for the full year. Our global system is committed to investing together for a better tomorrow and our proven ability to achieve consistent quality results provides us with a confidence that together, as a system, we will successfully crack the code to sustainable growth to meet our 2020 vision goals.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from John Faucher with JPMorgan Chase. Mr. John, you can continue with your question.","John Faucher - JPMorgan Chase","Sorry, there is a lot of static. As you look at the bottler consolidation piece, is Spanish or Japanese bottler consolidation the beginning of the next wave of let's say a bottler-driven consolidation? And how much are you pushing this as opposed to letting the bottlers lead where the system is going?","Muhtar Kent","Hi, John, good morning. This is Muhtar. First, I think, its important to realize that there is not one model for the world. There is many different models for the world. As you can see, what's happening. This has been an exciting last several months with respect to the evolution, actually continuous evolution of our franchise system. We manage our business to create sustainable long-term value and evolution of our franchise system continues to play an absolutely critical role in that process.","So what you have seen recently, the Contal merger in Japan, the Brazil merger of three bottling partners creating a large Brazilian led bottling business, the Iberian merger of seven bottling partners in Iberia, the sale of the Philippines, of the majority shares of the Philippines and the control to FEMSA, and now the U.S. the process, the journey starting in the United States are all part of our vision, our plan and to ensure that we can continue to deliver on the commitments we made for our vision.","In some cases they use, partially, our capital. In some cases whether the sale of, obviously, we bring capital back into the Coca-Cola Company, but all the time ensuring that our bottling business is fully suited with the needs of 21st century delivering what is necessary ahead of consumer expectations, customer expectations and so not one-size-fits-all.","And in the case of the United States, again, we are pleased to report today that we have reached agreement in principle to start this journey. All along since the first day we've closed the transaction of the Coca-Cola Refreshments, I have always said there will be a meaningful role to invite partners back into the business. When we were asked about the timing, we've always said around the four-to-five year timeframe from the time we've closed -  the close of Coca-Cola Refreshments was you will recall back in the latter part of 2010, and we are well within that timeline and it's a continuous evolution and sometimes it will necessitate for us to use our own capital, sometimes the mix and sometimes no capital and again not one-size-fits-all. The U.S. model is a very different, but it is again a model that invites partners to serve with us passionately, the communities that we operate in.","John Faucher - JPMorgan Chase","Great. If I could just as a follow-up on that, which would be as you look at the different options you gave for the U.S. pieces here in terms of sub-bottler agreements, asset sales, swaps, things like that, is there some way to think about the financial impact as you do this? I mean, this is a small piece of it. How long does this timeframe take out as you sort of push these U.S. pieces out? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","Yes. I think we can't comment on the timing for the end game but all I can tell you is that we are intent on creating the evolution necessary for us to be able to serve both, our large customers and small independent customers in the best possible way with our bottling partners.","Again, we have always said right from the beginning and we are consistent to that that the U.S. will be slightly different. We want to create the best-in-class production, optimum cost production system coast-to-coast from the east to the west. That will be nationally managed. We also want to create a national, we managed a larger customer, management system that will essentially have the responsibility to put together of 21st century customer plan with our large partners in the United States, or at the same time invite partners to come in and be part of this new evolution in the United States.","It will take as long as it is necessary, and that is not our focus; it's going to be about doing the right thing as quickly as possible, as efficiently as possible and as effectively as possible and that's what we are going to be doing.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Hi, good morning. A question for you, Gary, just on the on the operating leverage in the in the first quarter and maybe more specifically the gross margin. If I understood it right, this quarter would have been one of the highest in terms of the impact from commodity inflation and we also really had no positive benefit from price mix. And as we kind of look out going forward, right? We should get some benefit from price mix later in the year and maybe you some relief on commodity inflation. So, why would not there be maybe more leverage going through the year than we originally expected given the leverage you had in the first quarter?","Gary Fayard","Yes, Bryan, thanks. There are a couple of things to consider. First is, as I mentioned previously in the prepared remarks, that we reversed some compensation accruals in the first quarter. So that gave you more leverage in the quarter but you will not see that that\u2019s more of one-time impact, if you will. So its more leveraged in the quarter.","The other significant piece is, the currencies had an impact as well and currencies are moderate going out. But the biggest thing will be geographic mix. We would expect to see geographic mix changing throughout the year as we go through the year. As that happens, it will have an impact on gross margin and operating leverage.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","So the geographic mix would be more negative going through the back half of the rest of the year?","Gary Fayard","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. In fact, think about North America. Actually I would expect North America, actually, in the first quarter of this year, North America's operating income on a recurring comparable basis was down 3% and it is down 3% primarily because of two fewer selling days. So if you adjusted for those selling days it would have been positive. But I would expect North America to actually improve versus where they were, minus 3%, but as they improve because it's a finished products business, it is going to have a negative gross margin impact and there will be reduced leverage.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Okay, so more growth from lower margin geographies going forward and that will affect that margin impact?","Gary Fayard","That is what I was trying to say, more in code than the prepared remarks.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","All right, thank you.","Gary Fayard","We normally don't think North America, but that\u2019s what it was.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. I was hoping you can update on the competitive environment around the world both in China and Western Europe which have been hotspots recently. Also, just your thoughts around how you manage the pricing environment in the U.S. Sparkling business in 2013 and beyond in light of the moderate commodity pressure and if that solid 3% sparkling growth we saw in Q1 can continues in the balance of the year?","Muhtar Kent","This is Muhtar. We haven\u2019t seen anything markedly different from previous quarters as far as the competitive environment is concerned. China remains a very competitive environment. Actually the whole world, and again this is a competitive environment that is the mix of large international companies but also very much local companies in Asia, in parts of Africa, in the Middle East. We also see a somewhat more rational pricing,-particularly, in Europe as well as other parts of the world, in Latin America too. So the way we see the environment is it will continue to be challenged from a consumer perspective.","Whether you are talking about Asia coming back or whether you are talking about consumer sentiment in Europe will continue to be volatile and mixed at best, and therefore pricing is going to critical and therefore also ensuring leverage and ensuring productivity that can be generated out of operations for us to be able to continue to invest. It's going to be critical. But we are intent on continuing to invest in this environment. I will let Steve Cahillane talk a little bit about how we manage the pricing environment in the United States (inaudible) Price mix, 3%, in terms of a leverage in pricing for sparkling beverages in the past quarter.","Steve Cahillane","Thanks, Muhtar. We have seen a rational pricing environment in the United States over the course of a good period of time right now. We would expect that to continue. I have said many times that if commodities go down, don\u2019t look for us to reinvest that in price. We have worked very hard to earn the price that we take in the marketplace. We don\u2019t have an affordability problem in the United States with our sparkling beverages. We would love to continue to invest behind our brands.","We have got a terrific summer program for the Coca-Cola brand. We have got an exciting new partnership with Taylor Swift around Diet Coke. We will invest around activating those types of programs that continue to focus on one of our most important objective which is to continue to support, development and drive our sparkling category inside the United States business.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Pecoriello of Consumer Edge Research","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow up on the U.S. filing announcement. Onto the production assets for the territories the five bottlers picked up. Do you see these bottlers eventually contributing to manufacturing assets into a national production company to get at the cost savings opportunity that you talked about in the manufacturing side?","And also, would Coke be willing to let new partners bringing outside capital to help finance some of the additional territory sales given the size of the territory that Coke still holds onto in the U.S.? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","Hi, Bill. This is Muhtar. Good morning. I'd say to you that this is again, we are at the beginning of this journey. We have reached agreement in principle with these five U.S. bottling partners. It is very important that we did reach that agreement in principle and now we can actually ensure that we put all the details into motion and we can implement effectively.","We have always said production in the United States is critical to our success in achieving a optimum cost 21st century production system nationally manage, coast-to-coast. That is going to take place. We've also said that managing large, 30 or so of our largest customers in the United States as going to be done nationally. That's also going to take place.","In terms of who else would be coming in, can't comment on that in terms of what will happen and what form and architecture production is going to take place in terms of what our current bottlers own. I can't comment on that. All I can tell you and I can assure you that we are intent on ensuring that we make the necessary changes in the format and architecture production to achieve what I just said which is a coast-to-coast nationally run production system that generates the efficiencies, synergies, productivity that allow us to continue to win in the marketplace. And again, there may be a future where our partners in the United States take certain ownership in the national production.","I wouldn't rule that out also, but it will be managed nationally from one point, single point.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions on North America. First, in terms of volume performance, I think the macro data points and consumer data points have been a little bit choppy more recently. So maybe if you can give us a little bit color just in terms of category of your performance, immediate consumptions versus take home, and so do the expectation as you get out into the back half of the year lapping up some of the transitory headwinds whether it's in payroll taxes or weather related if you expect volumes performance to improve?","Then, Gary, just on the profitability in North America, I know you talked about this a little bit, but I look at first quarter, you had 1% volumes growth, 2% price mix and you did say profitability was up a little bit, but why aren't we seeing the profitability really improve more meaningfully and sort of what drives the sequential acceleration in North America profitability going forward?","Muhtar Kent","Okay. Judy, I'll have Steve answer the first part of your question before Gary comes in and sheds some light on the question on profitability. Steve?","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Thanks, Judy. First quarter clearly had a lot of a noise in it. We expected a benefit from Easter being in the first quarter. It's never as big a benefit when it comes that early in the year. Easter is always better when it comes later in April, because of the warmer weather, but obviously you referenced the weather. We saw some very dramatic changes.","Last year, we benefited from one of the hottest winters, warmest winters in the United States, and we cycled that with one of the coldest winters in the United States. So, clearly, that had an effect and we saw any benefit from Easter really being washed away, if you like, by the poor weather. There was clearly an effect in the payroll tax. It's a little bit of art and science trying to pick apart what's weather and what's payroll tax.","We would figure about two thirds is probably weather-related and one-third of the slowdown is based on the economy. We are go optimistic. Guardedly optimistic that the consumers are coming back. That the payroll tax and the economy is kind of a short-term need to get used to the discretionary impact that it has had. So we remain optimistic that we have got the right programs in place, that the economy is on the mend and we would expect continued good performance as we go out the next three quarters.","In terms of question of profitability, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Fayard","Judy, I would say a couple of things on profitability. Its really kind of repeating what Steve just said. If you take the first quarter and you throw in lousy weather, payroll tax, actually the price of gasoline, what then does to your immediate consumption versus future consumption business is going to have an impact on your profitability.","Now, if I go back to the answer I gave to Brian earlier though, when I saw that geographic mix that is North America, I would expect North America to be improving actually from the first quarter and from where we were. Then North America also has this two fewer days.","Now, I can tell you, Steve has got a number from minus 3%. I say it would have been positive. Steve has got a number but you can calculate it several different ways as to what would the impact of the two days be. We would all agree, I think, it is positive. They would have been positive as to operating income line. But you put all that together, the weather, by the way is as lousy as it has been and the impact on Steve's business has been given a lot of moisture to the Midwest for the drought for the corn crop.","So they look for commodities and we will see what happens there. Payroll taxes, consumers hopefully are starting to get used to it. Gasoline prices, looks like they are starting to trend down somewhat. So I think there is some reason to be cautiously optimistic. CCR continues to execute with excellence and continue to improve capability. So I think the there are lots of reasons to be optimistic on North America.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay, but from a profitability perspective, though, the bigger delta is really the mix shifting towards more immediate consumption as weather normalizes? Or is there a step up in cost savings or timing of marketing investments that help the profitability?","Gary Fayard","Judy, I would actually say, the biggest impact on the first quarter North America was two less selling days by far, and the whole company as well. But by far, the biggest impact was the two selling days.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Steve Cahillane","Judy, I can answer this part of your question. The secondary impact is clearly weather impacted food service and immediate consumption more than the take home channel. So we would expect as weather moderates, those profitable parts of our business will start to normalize as well. But as Gary said, two less selling days when you got the fixed cost assets that we have in the North American business is really quite significant. Those extra two days are golden cases that are going out and when you lose those two days, it obviously has a big impact.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Got it, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Good morning, Muhtar, Gary and team. I would like to just understand, Muhtar, your vision, again going back to the United States. You talked a little bit about how manufacturing is going to evolve. A little bit of understanding the benefits of margin the operations of food service, your noncarbs and your CSCs into one production facility. Just can that actually be done and are there synergies there?","Then secondly, do you feel strongly that your own people have to get the product to market from the plant or could you use a third-party, such as assister?","Muhtar Kent","Yes, Caroline, I think first in terms of our capability in our system in the United States is, I would say, the best in the consumer products world in terms of how we go to market and how we can get the product from production facilities. So I wouldn't like to comment on how we can improve that. If there is a way for us to even improve and generate more productivity we will certainly look at it.","I think the most important thing though is that there is room to generate significant further synergies in production. I think today I wouldn\u2019t say that the United States production system after three years of having integrated Coca-Cola Refreshments, it is where we needed to be and we need to continue on that roadmap to proceed towards a modern and best-in-class optimum cost production system coast-to-coast.","That will mean obviously a lot of changes, that will mean building new plants, that will mean combining some facilities, but I would like to also comment in terms of hot-fill and aseptic versus sparkling beverage plants, we will look at ensuring that we have the most modern, most productive facilities in place.","I don't believe the answer is to combine all under one roof. I think the answer is to combine many that are scattered across the country both, in terms of still and sparkling separately into some consolidation process and I can't comment any further. What I can tell you is that there is room for cost to come down, there is room for efficiencies to increase and we will achieve all of those.","This is all in line with our 2020 vision. We laid out a plan, when we took over the business of Coca-Cola Enterprises, we laid out a plan when I took over as the CEO back four and a half years ago and we are executing it meticulously and we are doing what we have said we would do and we are doing it ahead of time.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","That's excellent. I was just wondering in terms of getting shelf space, you see a big opportunity in up and down the street and to get better pricing much as you've done in Lat-Am. I'm often asked how you compete with all the new things that come in, be it, coconut water, energy drinks. I know you have some, but are you convinced you can keep or improve shelf space for your carbonated soft drinks?","Muhtar Kent","Absolutely. I think, we can improve service levels. I think, we can improve execution inside the point of sale. I think, we can improve availability. I think, we can improve availability of cold drink. I think, we can improve how we serve independent, and all of those things are going to be played out as we implement and execute this new strategy in the United States. And, I don't know, Steve, do you want to comment?","Steve Cahillane","No. I agree completely and part of what we are doing with this new bottler arrangement focuses on that up and down the street where bottlers and CCR add the most value which is not only big customer sales, but up and down the street execution and we have got also our venturing and emerging brands unit which you are familiar with which brings brands like Zico coconut water. It brought Honest Tea.","So, in that, those spaces that you are talking about we are very much innovating, we've got glaceau fruitwater which we just launched with great success a couple of weeks ago. That's being executed not only in the large stores, but importantly in the up and down the street foodservice, on-premise accounts as well, so we see that as a very important capability. We see ourselves as having a competitive advantage there when it comes to not just shelf space, but cold drink space and overall availability.","Muhtar Kent","Yes. And just to finally add on to that point, Caroline, the rest assured we are in an mode of evolution, rapid evolution, not just in the United Sates, across the whole world, and you will see us adapting, reinventing, how we go to market, how we serve customers and also how we communicate with consumers, very importantly. Our brands are at an all time high in terms of health and we will continue again to evolve and bring out the best modes of communications with our consumers as well.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes. Thanks, good morning, everyone. Also a question on the U.S. refranchising, Muhtar or Gary, you talk about this new beverage agreement being ultimately what's at Play here. Could you speak a little bit to how you are thinking about that and the role of incidence-based pricing in that?","Is it right to think that continues to have prominence in this new agreement? Any distinction you might draw between how stills and carbonates are treated as you move production more squarely to staying, if you will, at least for a little while inside Coca-Cola?","Muhtar Kent","Yes, I think Mark, we can't comment on the detail. What we can say is that it will be a model that will align us fully with our bottling partners to do what is right in the marketplace and to focus on what is right in the marketplace, a full alignment model and I think I can't just comment any further than that but you will see us executing better, serving the customers better with a better production template, as well as a customer service template.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Is it fair to think that other markets, there is a fact pattern and experience set to draw in as you implement this newer form of agreement here in the U.S.?","Muhtar Kent","I think all of that will come into play, best practices, everywhere around the world. I am certain that in four or five years' time, many people will come into the United States to see the best practices as it used to be back in the 1980s when I used to bring new bottlers from Eastern Europe to see best practices in the United States at that time.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Fair enough. Thanks, Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","In closing, I would like to thank Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson and to again say that we are pleased with our solid first quarter. We are working as a system to unlock real value, further strengthen execution and to win at the point-of-sale. We are confident that a relentless focus on growth will enable us to build capable, resilient optimized advantage and sustainable systems that are well-positioned to deliver results in 2013 and achieve our 2020 Vision. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call with The Coca-Cola Company.

Since then, our company has undergone substantial change while navigating a slowing global macroeconomic environment. Before handing the call over to James Quincey, our recently announced President and Chief Operating Officer, to review our third quarter performance results, let me recap the decisive actions we've taken over the past year, as well as highlight why we believe The Coca-Cola Company is well positioned to continue winning in the vibrant non-alcoholic beverage industry.","First, we said we would drive revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio roles across our markets. We have and will continue to do so. We segmented our markets to develop long-term revenue growth strategies based on clear volume, price investment and profit expectations, which were built into our 2015 plans and strategies going forward. Importantly, we revised our annual incentive metrics to include revenue growth, and tied them directly to these clear portfolio roles in order to drive the right behavior in each market.","Second, we said we would target disciplined brand and growth investments. Last year, we significantly increased our media investments, and we're doing so again this year. Also, under the leadership of Marcos de Quinto, who was named Chief Marketing Officer at the beginning of this year, we've improved the quality of our advertising while rewiring our marketing organization around consumer clusters to drive speed, efficiency and effectiveness, and we're seeing results, with year-to-date value share performance accelerating across several markets.","In addition, the incremental marketing is helping to accelerate revenue growth in some of our key markets, including North America. We also made investments in new growth platforms. We closed a transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation to compete more effectively in the global energy category, and just recently, our brands launched on the Keurig KOLD system in the home dispensing platform. In China, we have announced plans to expand into plant-based protein drinks through the acquisition of the beverage business of China Green Culiangwang Beverages Holdings that recently received regulatory approval. And in the United States, we invested in and signed a distribution agreement with Suja, a high growth organic cold-pressed juice company. All these are long-term investments that we believe will allow us to add profitable new transactions in the non-alcoholic beverage industry.","Third, we said we would drive efficiency through more aggressive productivity. Our current $3 billion productivity program touches every part of our business and organization, from our operating model to cost of goods sold to marketing expenses. We're driving these savings through a disciplined process that involves our entire leadership team and associates. And ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every single day and challenging every dollar we spend. We're on track against our overall goals, and importantly, have implemented a broad set of changes in 2015 that will help us continue progress into 2016 and beyond. These include the implementation of zero-based work across our entire company as well as our corporate center and operating units, a disciplined program management approach to drive cost of goods sold savings in everything from our formulas to our packaging to our day-to-day operations in our plans.","Fourth, we said we would streamline and simplify our organization. To date, we've standardized key processes, linked our business units with our corporate center and eliminated group functional roles in order to speed up decision making and enhance focus at the local level to drive growth. Our previously announced head count reductions are substantially completed, and we are operating within our new structure. Importantly, we are ahead in terms of scope and timing.","Finally, we said we would refocus on our core business model of building the world's greatest beverage brands and leading an unmatched global system. And over the past year, we've made substantial progress in evolving and strengthening our bottling landscape. Starting in North America, so far, we have transferred or signed agreements for territories covering over 30% of U.S. bottle can volume. And just recently, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System in order to align on a clear path forward for our 21st century manufacturing footprint in the United States. In Europe, we announced the creation of Coca-Cola European partners, which will transform the Western European bottling landscape. And looking outside the developed world, we've made critical changes to our bottling system in key emerging markets. At the end of last year, we entered into an agreement to re-architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long-term growth potential in Africa. Also, during the first quarter of this year, we invested in our Indonesian bottler to help our system capture the long-term opportunity in this attractive and large emerging market.","In short, our company has undergone a significant amount of streamlining and change these past 12 months. And while we are encouraged by our progress, we know we need to do more, which leads me to our most recent change. As we continue to increase our focus on improving global execution, we recently appointed James Quincey to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer. James has a deep knowledge of the global system and solid existing relationships with both bottlers and customers all around the world. He's uniquely qualified to accelerate the company's five strategic initiatives for growth in the months and years ahead.","I will now hand the call over to James, who will walk you through our quarterly performance.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone.","Let me start on this first earnings call by saying that it's a tremendous honor for me to serve as the President and Chief Operating Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. In my 19 years with the company, I've seen our business evolve and grow, while remaining strategically focused on doing the right things to drive long-term sustainable growth. As Muhtar referenced, we are resolutely focused on executing against the five strategic initiatives laid out last year. And a significant part of my role will be ensuring that we deliver.","Now, during the quarter, we made two important announcements that provide clarity on the future of our distribution and bottling structures in the United States and in Europe. First, in our flagship market, we announced the creation of the National Product Supply System, or NPSS, to strengthen and streamline U.S. production as part of our effort to refranchise bottling territories in North America. Our approach embodies the best of both worlds by encompassing a national production system that generates efficiencies and scale for our system in combination with regional production that leverages the expertise and local knowledge of our longstanding bottling partners, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Coca-Cola United and Swire Coca-Cola USA. These bottlers will continue to own and operate their own plants and, where applicable, acquire additional production assets from the company-owned Coca-Cola Refreshments. This will provide a clear profit incentive to make the local operations as efficient as possible.","However, to ensure the benefits of scale remain, the NPSS will have a governing board with the power to implement measures to ensure the production assets owned by NPSS bottlers are optimally deployed to produce the lowest cost, benefiting the entire system. This board will focus on making decisions on infrastructure planning, innovation planning, and optimal sourcing at the national level. The board will be comprised of representatives from Coca-Cola North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments and the three independent bottlers, which, together, currently represent approximately 95% of the U.S. produced volume. We believe this structure allows us to leverage our significant system scale with a unique competitive advantage of being able to act locally with speed. Together, with our focus on driving revenue, this will result in system margin expansion over the coming years.","So in addition to system-wide benefits, this approach has the additional benefit for The Coca-Cola Company in that it accelerates our return to an asset-light model, which will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital, and improved return on invested capital for our company as we transition these production assets.","We also continue to make progress on the refranchising of the U.S. distribution territories. Just this morning, we announced that we signed non-binding Letters of Intent on additional distribution territories in seven states. As Muhtar referenced, this will bring the total amount of volume in territories transitioned to date, all covered by agreements, to over 30% of U.S. bottle can volume.","Also during the quarter, we announced the merger of our company-owned German bottling operations with Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Enterprises into a new company named Coca-Cola European Partners. This will transform our Western European bottling landscape and create the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottler, based on revenue. The creation of a larger unified bottling partner in Western Europe represents an important step in our global systems evolution, as we continue to adapt our business model to innovate, invest, and grow along with the changing demands of the marketplace. This merger enhances alignment within the Coca-Cola system, enabling us to more effectively compete and drive growth across developed European markets. Importantly, the new company will position to deliver world-class execution and customer service by leveraging the best practices of each party to drive sustainable growth in multiple categories.","Now, turning to the performance in this quarter, well, the global economic environment remains challenging. As the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the lower oil prices are putting pressure on many commodity-dependent economies such as Australia, Brazil, and Russia, while volatility rippling through the Middle East causes further economic uncertainty. Despite these macroeconomic challenges, our five-point plan and our focus on execution and reinvestment drove improved results, with both unit case volume and price\/mix growing 3% each in the quarter, as outlined in our quarterly performance scorecard on slide 11. Organic revenues grew 3%, driven by the previously-mentioned strong price\/mix and slight growth in concentrate shipments.","Our top line performance was broad based, with five of the six operating segments delivering organic revenue growth. North America continued its disciplined approach to volume, price, and mix management, and I'm encouraged by the solid progress we've seen in this market over the past two years. In Europe, we drove top-line growth through strong commercial and marketing activities whilst also benefiting from some good weather in much of the region. We are seeing green shoots in Europe, and our business in Central and Southern Europe delivered a particularly strong quarter due to investments in media, changes in our price\/pack architecture, and favorable weather. In Latin America, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth despite worsening conditions in Brazil. Our Mexico business unit helped to balance the weakness in Brazil by accelerating unit case volume growth to 4% in the quarter, with growth across all the major categories. In Eurasia and Africa, deteriorating conditions in Russia and volatility in the Middle East partially offset the solid performance in the Africa businesses.","Turning finally to the Asia-Pacific group, China and India both grew unit case volume mid-single digits in the quarter. In India, this marks a return to growth for our business after a tough second quarter, with our volume growth trends improving in each month. In China, our consistent strategy and focus on execution led to continued value and volume share gains in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Notably, trademark Coca-Cola reached its highest year-to-date share levels since 2011. In Japan, volume did decline, driven by poor weather in the quarter as well as a move to focus on price realization by reducing discounting on certain low-value multi-serve packs. While this may have short-term consequences in volume and share, it is more important to improve our pricing in the marketplace.","Finally, our Bottling Investments group delivered 3% organic revenue growth, led by operations in Germany, India, and Vietnam. As a result, we once again gained global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the quarter, with gains in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide.","In summary, our third quarter performance marks another positive step towards achieving our goal of accelerating top line growth, with the company delivering both solid pricing and unit case volume growth. We are confident in our strategies and execution, and remain on track to deliver against expectations for this year.","I will now hand over to Kathy, who will provide you a more detailed look at our financial performance, as well as our outlook on our business for the rest of 2015.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone.","Organic revenue growth was driven by three points of positive price\/mix. Consolidated price\/mix in the quarter was driven by positive pricing and product mix initiatives across many of our key markets, and benefited from positive geographic mix due to the strong volume growth in our Bottling Investments group. After adjusting for the additional days in the first quarter, year-to-date concentrate shipments were slightly behind unit cases, primarily due to the timing of shipments in the prior year in our Asia-Pacific and Eurasia and Africa groups. For the full year, we continue to expect concentrate shipments to be generally in line with unit cases.","Our comparable currency neutral growth margin expanded on a consolidated basis, due to positive pricing, productivity savings, and a slightly lower commodity cost partially offset by structural changes. Positive comparable currency neutral operating leverage was driven primarily by cycling the timing of marketing expenses (19:00), the impact of which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter, as well as by a continued focus on controlling our operating costs.","For the quarter, comparable currency neutral operating income grew 8%. Below the operating line, net interest income was lower versus prior year, resulting in 7% growth in comparable currency neutral income before tax, which included a one point structural headwind. Our third quarter comparable EPS was $0.51, which included a 12-point currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis, our EPS grew 8% in the quarter. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to non-cash charges related to the announced refranchising of territories in North America. During the first nine months of the year, we generated $6.7 billion in free cash flow, up 6%, primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and the impact of six additional days, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from currency exchange rates, the impact from refranchising territories in North America and the brand transfer agreement with Monster Beverage Corporation. Our focus on improving working capital contributed an incremental $600 million of cash flow for the first nine months of 2015 versus the prior year. We returned $5.6 billion to shareowners in the form of dividends and net share repurchases during the first nine months.","Turning to outlook, we are broadly in line with our expectations for the first nine months of the year. With one quarter remaining, we expect our full year comparable currency neutral EPS to grow 5%, in line with our previous expectations. However, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now expect the currency impact to be slightly more unfavorable. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we now expect an approximate seven-point currency headwind on net revenue, 11-point headwind on operating income, and an eight-point headwind on income before tax for the full year 2015. Therefore, we expect our comparable EPS to decline 3% for the year. Our full year outlook implies that our fourth quarter comparable currency neutral EPS will decline mid- to high-single digits. There are a couple of points to consider when modeling the fourth quarter.","As we communicated at the beginning of the year, our fourth quarter will have six fewer selling days this year. Due to the timing of expenses last year, combined with the increase in media investments this year, we expect DME to increase substantially in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a slight headwind on net revenue, and a two-point headwind on both gross profit and income before tax. We currently estimate currency will be a six-point headwind on net revenues, a 12-point headwind on operating income, and a 10-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. As a reminder, these impacts are based on current spot rates, and given the volatile currency environment, these amounts are subject to change.","In summary, as you heard from Muhtar and James, our financial performance is consistent with what we discussed early in the year, and we continue to execute as we outlined. Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today's call. Our first question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may proceed.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Good morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Muhtar, it's been a year since you announced the plans to focus on greater pricing in developed markets as well as boost marketing spend starting in 2015. And I was hoping you could just take a step back and give us a more detailed review of your progress on those fronts. How much top-line growth is responding to those efforts relative to your expectations, both in terms of the market share payback from the higher marketing as well as the demand elasticity from higher pricing? And then just in terms of the quarter, on an adjusted basis ex the concentrate lag, it looks like underlying revenue results are returning to your long-term goals with 3% unit case result and 3% price\/mix. So, at this point, do you feel comfortable you can generally meet those long-term top line growth goals going forward, ex any timing issues, or with emerging markets macros still decelerating and perhaps easy comps from this quarter, it's a bit too early to call for that? Thanks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Dara, thanks for the question. What I would say in general overall is yes, we're pleased with the quarter and the progress we're making but lots of more work to do. This is a transition year. When we talked to you about 12 months ago, we outlined to you that with the changes we're going to make that our goal is to get to mid-single digit currency neutral revenue growth for the comparable revenue growth for the company overall. And I think if you look at our progress to date for the first three quarters of the year, we're at sort of the bottom end of that range, the mid-single digit, if you look at where we are in revenue in terms of currency neutral comparable, and what we have posted in this past quarter, in the third quarter, you would see us if you take those numbers that you mentioned in terms of volume growth of 3% and price\/mix of 3%, at the top end of that range.","So in essence, we're pleased with the progress that we \u2013 what all the five-point strategy and executing it diligently over the last nine months and even starting at the end of last year has brought us to where we are. And so we feel that we've always said that marketing has a lag, the incremental marketing, there's a lag in terms of when we input it and the results that we're getting, but we see that the plan is working. And we certainly see that we're taking a very strategic approach in terms of marketing spend versus optimal levels. Consistent quality investment in media continues to be one of the strongest drivers of our business, enabling us to generate those \u2013 that revenue. We look at each market. How many weeks of consumer engagement there is, the goal over time is to apply the right pressure in the right way to each of our brands and each of the segments that you mentioned, which is developed, developing and emerging. And the system alignment in our bottling system is matching our alignments with investments \u2013 I'm sorry, with capabilities, execution, output development, cooler placement, et cetera. So we're pleased with what we see there.","And of course, all of this being said, we have a volatile macroeconomic environment, which obviously is not getting any better anytime soon. We realize that. The global growth for 2015 is projected to be below last year, and even having said that, the disposable income are even lagging the growth rates that are projected. So, yeah. But, in general, that's how I would frame your question and both James and I and Kathy believe that the incremental and better marketing is certainly giving us the results in terms of the top line currency neutral comparable top line growth.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Steve Powers of UBS. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","I actually want to talk a little bit more about the National Product Supply System that James detailed. And I guess specifically, maybe Muhtar or James, could you talk more about the governance process there and the makeup of the managing board? As I understand it, there are five voting members, CCR, Coke North America and then the three bottlers Consolidated, United and Swire. And I guess I'm curious as to how you ensure that tough decisions get made in that structure and implemented in that structure. Do you need unanimous consents? Is it majority rules? And if there isn't unanimous consent or support for a given measure, what gives the NPSG the power to enforce successful implementation? Thanks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve. What we said, again, at the beginning of this journey back three years, four years ago, is that we said that we have an intention to create a system in the United States that can benefit from the local empowerment in each of the communities and the markets that have built our business so successful over the last 130 years. The franchise system, the alignment that brings, the value and trust between us and our bottling partners. But at the same time, create the mechanisms, so to speak, the processes, flexible processes in the marketplace whether it be information systems, whether it be the customer management system so that we can speak with one voice to customers coast-to-coast in the United States, and the National Product Supply System. All of those negotiations with our expanding bottlers took some time to achieve. They're all achieved. That's why we're progressing rapidly with our refranchising program, which is working very well because when we have those processes in place, we can refranchise with confidence and speed and have the business continue to generate the results and the growth that we are seeing in revenue, particularly in the United States of America. And the United States non-alcoholic beverage business is healthy. It is growing in revenues and dollars and cents, and that's the really important element that I want to leave with you. But, just to add more color and flavor to the National Product Supply System question that you had in terms of the governance model, I'll ask James to comment further and give you more insights. James?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah I think, just specifically on governance, it's not going to be around unanimity. It's going to be based on the driving of the business case. Everyone's committed to doing what is economically the most rational answer for the system. Again, this is when it comes to the national issues. It's not necessarily the management of each local plant, which will remain the job of each of the participating bottlers, or CCNA.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, does that address your question?","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Yes, sorry, I was on mute. No, thank you. That does help. But I guess, James, just to follow up. If there is friction on a given issue, right, if there's debate about what is in the best sort of economic interest of the system, what's the tiebreaker? How does the majority view get pushed through?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","We're not laying out the precise mechanic, but I can tell you that there's not going to be a full consensus required for every decision. It's going to be a large majority, and if they support the economic case, then that's what's going to move forward. So, we're not creating a system that can become blocked. We're creating a system that's going to (31:48) focus on the best economics of the system in North America, and there are mechanisms for that to go forward.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. There are mechanisms in place to break a tie.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Correct.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may proceed.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. I guess I was hoping to get a little bit more color in your performance in Europe this quarter. So, 4% volume growth, certainly an improvement there. You called out some of the factors, the green shoots in Europe. You've got the favorable weather conditions, as well as the marketing spending step-up. So, number one, can you just talk about a little bit more behind, what really drove the volume improvement? How sustainable those improvements are in terms of volume. And then, if you think about price\/mix performance in Europe, kind of flattish performance in a more developed market. So, how should we think about that number? How much was that geographic mix, and are you seeing actual price realization in some of the markets, understanding that, obviously, it's a tough deflationary market there.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah Judy, thanks. This is Muhtar. Good morning. Unit cases, as you said, did grow 4% in the quarter in Europe. They were cycling a minus 5% from prior year, and sparkling was up, as well as stills growing faster than sparkling in Western Europe. And then our concentrate sales did trail also the unit cases in Western Europe, as it did for the whole company. And we were pleased with the results. And certainly, again, some early results from the marketing, but more to come, and I'll ask James to add more color to that. James?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, thanks, Muhtar. As Muhtar referenced, we were cycling a pretty poor quarter from last year. So, I think it was a favorable comparison, and we had strong results from very favorable weather in the Southern and the Central part of Europe. So I wouldn't read too much into the one quarter. I think if you look at the longer term trends, you can see that we're getting some volume growth in the year-to-date, where the price\/mix is bouncing around flat. I think it's important to recognize two things as it comes to price\/mix in the case of Europe. One is the general deflationary nature of the European market. Retail pricing is 0% to 1% at best, in general. And then secondly, it's worth remembering that the starting point of pricing in Europe is, in comparison to the U.S., higher. So the opportunity is to drive price\/mix on a sustained long-term basis. In a sense, we've already captured some of that in Europe, and we will be chasing that in the U.S. So I don't think we'll see the same sort of price\/mix over time in Europe, given our starting point.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open. Please proceed.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Kathy, just a question for you. And just thinking about some of the, I guess, the macro drivers of the P&L as we move into the fourth quarter and maybe beyond, into 2016. Other income this quarter was an expense. Is that at all related to the euro bond gain that you had in the first half, and how we think about lapping that next year? FX, the negative effect on operating income, is greater in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter. So should we think about FX carrying into 2016?","And then, in terms of structural change, I guess with Germany now essentially being contributed to the partnership, or the new entity in Europe, that will be a structural change for next year, but just anything we should be thinking about in terms of changes in the structural change component of modeling, I guess, going into the fourth quarter, and maybe into next year, would be helpful. Thanks.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thank you, Bryan. So for foreign exchange for next year, remember, we had said that for our hard currencies, we are hedged and so our real exposure is around our emerging currencies. Now, that being said, we do have to cycle that euro debt bond offering, which impacted the first quarter and second quarter of this year and for the full year, it was about three points benefit to us. So we do have to cycle that next year on top of just a change in the rates and probably a more difficult currency environment going forward. So, we will give more color on currency in February when we give our full year results for 2016 (sic) [2015] (36:52), but our issue is really going to be around the emerging markets where we've \u2013 it's not cost effective to hedge more than about a quarter at a time.","And then in terms of the structural impact, yes, Germany will be a structural impact next year. Obviously, we continue with the North America refranchising, so that will still have a significant impact in North America, and there may be some slight impacts from whenever the Africa transaction closes, but the majority of it will be the Germany transaction and the North America refranchising.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. And just with the Africa JV, do we still expect that that will close before the end of the year, or is there any update on timing there?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Bryan, this is Muhtar. What I would say is that it's in the regulatory approval process, and that's all I would say right now, and then we expect it to close some time over the next three months to four months. That's what I would say.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is open. You may proceed.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just a few things. One is I was hoping you could set people just more at ease around the closure of the gap in unit case volume to concentrate sales. I'm getting a lot of questions there. And if that \u2013 look, if you're real comfortable with that and if that's the case that that closes for all the regions in the world, it certainly does look like there's an inflection point on top line. But are we now comfortable enough to also start talking a little bit about, perhaps, a crossover point or an inflection point in the productivity savings being higher than reinvestment rate as well so margins can also look like they're expanding? It looks like you had flat operating margins here, including the FX effects there. But that's better than it's been in a little while as well. So can we clarify, and give us a sense on the margin inflection potential as well?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So the unit cases to concentrate shipment, they're really impacted by Asia-Pacific and Latin America. And if you look at Latin America on a year-to-date basis, they're absolutely in line, and with Asia-Pacific on a year-to-date basis we expect them to be generally in line. So there's really no story there in terms of that gap.","When you \u2013 and moving on to productivity, so productivity initiatives, yeah, obviously, we are seeing some benefit from productivity. In our margins, there is an impact in our margins from basically the structural changes. So, if you were to exclude structural changes, gross margins and operating margins would be higher and you would see margin expansion. And when you look at the third quarter, when you look at the leverage \u2013 so we are getting some productivity, but we also have an impact from timing of the DME from \u2013 basically from prior year that's impacting that timing from this year. That, by the way, turns around in the fourth quarter. So I think there are a lot of puts and takes going on around productivity. You are seeing some productivity coming through. We are continuing to reinvest behind our brands, though, but our margin expansion is masked right now by currency and structural, so if you pull those two things out, you'd see very good margin expansion.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I would just add one point, Ali. I think what we saw in this past quarter in terms of operating margin expansion on a currency neutral comparable basis of about 100 basis points, we were pleased with that expansion. Now, the key is to do everything we can to continue and ensure that we execute fully on the five strategic points going forward so that we can continue to improve our trajectory.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, okay. That's helpful. Just from a structural perspective, as you mentioned it, one of the big changes obviously in the marketplace is the ABI-SAB deal, which is agreed upon, I guess. Can you talk a little bit about any of the deal implications to you structurally in that context? For instance, would you let them produce both for you and the blue system? Is that something you can shed a little bit of light on as now it's an agreed upon deal, it sounds like?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Ali, we will not comment on any specific matters related to our customers, bottlers or any M&A matters, so I'll just leave it at that.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks anyway.","Operator","Our next question is from John Faucher of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. Please proceed.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Want to go back as sort of a little bit of a follow-up to Steve's question. If I look at slide 10 in the handouts, if I look at North America, you guys are fragmenting that sort of last piece to market, that last piece of the route-to-market, and then also to some extent the manufacturing piece. Yet you're telling us, on the flip side, as we look at Europe, as you create this sort of wall that goes across Europe of all one big bottler, the consolidation is something that seems to be the right thing for Europe. So, can you talk a little bit about why fragmenting North America yet consolidating Europe at the same time, those are both the right strategies when they \u2013 I don't want to say they're diametrically opposed, but at least they appear to be somewhat in conflict with each other. Thank you.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","John, this is Muhtar. Actually, they're not in conflict at all. They're basically very complementary to our strategy, which is to ensure that we have the local touch, and we have also the scale, and we have the processes to meet customer demands and customer partnerships. And in the United States, we've actually not \u2013 you mentioned the word fragmented. We have a national customer management system. We have a national production system. We have a national information system that is basically all with their own governance models, and they're very fluid and very flexible to suit the needs of the business today.","And then at the same time, every piece of the United States that has those elements really have enough size for scale. And then we have the much smaller, the smaller distributor bottling system that also the smaller guys are doing a great job in growing the business for us. And then in Europe, basically what we have is, the customer landscape in Europe is much, much more concentrated in Western Europe where just a handful of customers account for a very large portion of the total future consumption, the retail business in Europe. And therefore, when you look at what we have created in Western Europe, it basically suits our future needs in terms of working proactively with our customer partners, and also it gives the scale and also it give the local touch in each of the markets. So, from that perspective, just like what we have done in Japan, just like what we have done in South Africa, and large markets I'm talking about, it basically very much aligns to our strategy in how you think about what we're doing in the marketplace.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And if I can just ask a follow-up. I guess you talked about local touch with the smaller local bottlers in the U.S., and then you also talked about local touch in Europe. And I guess, again, just to play devil's advocate here, aren't you moving away from the local \u2013 I realize you're going to try and keep some of the local pieces through the new bottling entity, but it seems to me that's moving less local.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Where? In Europe? (45:20)","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So I guess it sounds like you're trying to have it both ways, and I guess I'm just not following why one is so dramatically better than the other. Is it just simply sort of the smaller account piece on the U.S. side that creates the difference here?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the customer base in the United States and Western Europe is very, very different in terms of how it's structured. And so, we follow the customer, the needs of the customer, what matters. We follow the scale. We follow the necessity for speed. And we feel that the model that is being created in Western Europe will serve us very well for the next decade and beyond, and the same thing goes for the United States. It is proving that it is serving us very well in terms of getting us the scale, in terms of getting us the costs in production and cost of goods sold. But at the same time, retaining the local touch and retaining the local element that is really important in our business. Both of those are valid for Europe, and for Western Europe and for Japan and for South Africa, and for the United States, or wherever else you're seeing us create a better bottling system.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. You may proceed.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Muhtar, I wanted to circle back on the comment that you made about the health of the U.S. LRB category. I mean, clearly, that's apparent on the still side of the business. But as I look at the syndicated data for carbonated beverages in the United States, it does look like the category is softening a bit, and I think your revenues were down three out of the last four months. So, I was hoping you could comment on the evolution of the U.S. CSD side, and the demand elasticities and how they're evolving, please. Thank you.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, based on what we are seeing is, we're able to generate revenue growth, both in the sparkling category, very much so, as well as in the still side. And therefore, that's what my comment referred to. This is not just one quarter. This is multiple quarters. And at the same time, inside that LRB category that is showing very good resilience in terms of both price elasticity, price discipline, approach with customers, generating value for our customers, both on the sparkling side as well as in large and small customers in the still side, we are also seeing that we gain \u2013 and this is the 22nd consecutive quarter of us gaining value share in the marketplace in North America. And then the mix is really working for us, in terms of generating the marketing, where the North American market is the first market where we've started employing incremental marketing, better marketing, is generating also positive results for us in terms of the revenue growth, purely from sparkling as well as from the still side of the business. And, James, do you want to add any color to that?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I mean, if you take a look at how we're driving the sparkling business, you can look at the transaction packages, which represent about 15% of the volume, and they're growing still again this quarter into double digits. So, we're very pleased with the marketing and the OBPC approach is driving positive revenue growth for sparkling on a consistent basis.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bill Marshall of Barclays. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you very much. I was wondering if I could ask you about the recent vote in Mexico. It looks like there's a proposal to reduce the tax on soda by about half on products with five grams of sugar or less per 100 milliliters. So, first, I was just wondering what you thought about the prospects of that, if you could give us any clarity on what percentage of your portfolio that would cover?","And then, if we just think about it from a high level, and maybe, James, you could give us some color in a number of these markets. If we look at the Mexican soda tax as a template for the rest of the world, does this suggest any tempering of how some of the regulatory authorities are looking at the category, broadly speaking? Thank you.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","So, of course, we need to wait and see whether the recent vote produces the act of (50:01) law by the end of the process. It's only gone through one of the stages. So, we'll see where that ends up. Obviously, we are in favor of reductions in discriminatory taxes. I think, as we look out on how that has impacted the world and how that's being viewed, and it will be used as a case study around the world, the data we have so far is the impact of the tax was to bring down about six calories from the Mexican diet by the end of the process. So, we're conscious that obesity is a crisis. We know we need to play a role. We don't think that this is the silver bullet that anyone was looking for, and we think that much more work needs to be done if indeed a solution is to be brought to bear on the whole obesity crisis, of which over-consumption of anything, including soft drinks, would be a contributor and a part of the problem. So, we'll see where this tax ends up. Clearly, taxing diets and lights doesn't seem to be the right way forward, and therefore, if this measure goes through, I think it would be positive.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And the last question is from Nik Modi of RBC. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just a quick question on Asia. Perhaps you can provide a little bit of context. It looks like that business may not be performing as well as you would like, broadly speaking. Is this a portfolio issue? I mean, can you just talk a little bit about what's going on across that region, so we can just think about that as we go into 2016?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Nik, I'll just say very, very broadly, at a high level. We're pleased with our performance in China. Obviously, a lot of noise around China these days, but we have \u2013 as mentioned earlier in the script, we have an all-time high share for brand Coke in China. And we're growing in China, and we're gaining share in China, and we're investing in China and the same goes for India, two of the very large markets in Asia, certainly pleased with the results there. We had some weather-related issues in the quarter before, but we're coming back, and the business is really coming back and performing much better in India. And so, overall, I think \u2013 and then in Japan, we're seeing some green shoots in terms of disposable incomes. We're very early still in terms \u2013 to call it any color, but overall, I'd say \u2013 and then, obviously back in south \u2013 Australasia, the economy was very much related to commodities and it has suffered, and we're seeing the macro spillover from that. But I would say overall, up from this past quarter. We're happy with the results in the big economies, and then realizing \u2013 recognizing that we have got more work to do. And that's how I would leave it.","Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you James, Kathy and Tim. So in summary, our company has undergone a substantial amount of change over the past 10 months to 12 months, and our third quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our five strategic initiatives. The long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising, and we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company and the Coca-Cola system is best positioned to capture that growth in non-alcoholic beverages, and to deliver long-term value to our shareowners.

Please look on our website for this information.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for an update on our first quarter performance. As you know, we started 2014 with a clear objective of restoring the momentum of our global business.","This morning, I\u2019m pleased to report that our growth momentum is improving in line with our expectations. In the midst of continued headwinds, we achieved sequentially stronger 2% volume cycling 4% volume growth in the prior year quarter, despite the shift of the Easter holiday into the second quarter of this year.","Comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 2% after excluding the impact of structural items, growth of an incremental 100 million unit cases or the equivalent of 27 million incremental servings per each day and both volume and value share gains in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages with value share gains ahead of volume share gains. These topline results underscore our system\u2019s ability to leverage our occasion, brand, price, pack, channel architecture across our entire portfolio of leading brands.","They are also a reflection of our ability to drive performance, improve incidents and simultaneously enhance price mix which increased 2% globally in the quarter and we increased our marketing investments, while decreasing other SG&A costs consistent with our commitment to identify savings opportunities and to increase support for our brands.","From a geographic perspective, volume in our developed markets was down 1%. However, volume grew in key developed markets including Japan and Australia, while volume in North America was even.","Importantly, volume grew 3% in our developing and emerging markets with China up 12% and Brazil up 4%. Both India and Russia also grew volume in the mid single-digit range while gaining nonalcoholic ready-to-drink volume and value share.","We remained steadfastly focused on the five strategic priorities we announced on our fourth quarter earnings call and later, which I outlined at CAGNY. As a reminder, those five strategic priorities are as follows.","Firstly to accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola, strategically expand our portfolio -- profitable sales portfolio, thirdly, increase brand investments by maximizing productivity, fourth, win at the point-of-sale by unlocking the power of our system and last but not least, invest in our next-generation of leaders.","I\u2019ll devote the majority of my remarks today to talking about these strategies and the progress we\u2019re making in restoring our momentum. As usual, you\u2019ll find further operating group performance details in our earnings press release issued earlier this morning. These five important strategic priorities serve as a means to further sharpen our focus. They also serve as beacons to collectively align the efforts of our more than 700,000 system associates all around the world.","Now beginning with our first priority, we are determined to accelerate sparkling beverage growth led by Coca-Cola and we\u2019ve established comprehensive strategies to do so. The foundation of this plan is to invest in and deliver great marketing to support our sparking brand.","We\u2019re adding a sharpened focus with our bottling partners to increase sparkling brand penetration, as well as cold drink availability. We\u2019re overlaying disciplined occasion, brand, price, packed channel strategies, supported by revenue growth management capabilities to drive sustained value growth.","We\u2019re continuously innovating to meet evolving consumer needs and also we\u2019re engaging with partners and stakeholders to promote trust and to address category misperception. These strategies to accelerate sparkling growth are solid and we expect to see improving results throughout the year.","Highlights of actions we took in this past quarter included terrific Sochi Olympics Campaign executed across all over Russia supported by solid trade activations that resulted in 7% sparkling volume growth and 9% brand Coca-Cola growth, the 17th consecutive quarter of growth for brand Coke.","A successful recruitment strategy in China where immediate consumption tax grow sparkling volume growth of 6%, brand Coke growth of 3% and transaction growth of 10% and ongoing sparking innovation in Japan that contributed to 3% sparkling growth in the first quarter.","We clearly see growth potential in the sparkling category and along with our system partners we are investing in the wide-ranging sparkling innovation, world-class marketing and unparalleled local execution to satisfy our consumers thrust for refreshment. It is still early in our journey to restore sparkling momentum, yet we are tenaciously focused on building and improving upon this quarter\u2019s performance.","This is underscored by the programs and the marketing campaigns that are already underway in the second quarter like our FIFA World Cup Campaign that has 175 countries participating, the broadest reach of any campaign in Coca-Cola\u2019s history.","We\u2019re happy to share that the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is visiting the United States this week with stops in Washington D.C. yesterday, Miami today and Atlanta and LA later in the week, from here, the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is heading to Brazil on the final leg of its 90-country journey.","The activation of this exciting global property coupled with initiatives such as our Share a Coke program with individualized personalized Coca-Cola bottles and cans continue support and innovation on Sprite and Fanta, and a wide range of new package introductions across our entire sparkling portfolio is going to bring excitement and engagement to our sparkling brands all around the world.","Moving now to our second priority to strategically expand our profitable still beverage portfolio. Our still beverage brands account for approximately a quarter of our total global volume currently.","Today, we are the global value leader in still beverages with $11 billion still brands more than any of our competitors. In the first quarter of this year, our still beverage volume grew 8%, while gaining both volume and value share.","Given our leadership position in the industry, we are keenly focused on working with our global system partners to build strong profitable and competitively advantaged brands in fast growing and profitable still beverage category.","We\u2019re building on our leading juices and juice drinks portfolio growing volume 3% in the quarter. This was fueled by exceptional brands like Simply which grew double digits in North America and Minute Maid Pulpy which grew 8% in China. This also marks our 9th consecutive quarter of value share gains in juices and juice drinks.","Our growth global still -- global tea portfolio grew 4% as we delivered double-digit growth across Honest and Gold Peak in North America, as well as Ayataka and Sokenbicha in China -- in Japan, I beg your pardon. This resulted in the 10th consecutive quarter of global ready-to-drink value share gains in tea.","We are leveraging our packaging leadership to expand our PlantBottle and crushable bottle packaging, creating an important point of value differentiation for brands ranging from Dasani, North America to I Lohas in Japan and we are developing a new profit enhancing beverage drop platform that now includes the Dasani, Powerade, Minute Maid and VitaminWater brands. As you will note, we continue to innovate across our still portfolio to further drive and enhance our leading position.","Our third strategic priority is to increase brand investments by maximizing productivity. On the brand side and as announced earlier this year, we will grow our investments by $400 million in 2014 and by $1 billion by 2016.","We began to ramp up our investments in the first quarter to support robust marketing programs like our Sochi Winter Olympics campaign across multiple markets. We\u2019re also increasing our media investments and quality in North America as evidenced by our Super Bowl ads. It\u2019s beautiful and going all the way.","In Latin America, the first of our operating groups to launch the FIFA World Cup activation, viral marketing efforts targeting Millennials included short films that have already exceeded 10 million views on YouTube. And also, our worldwide marketing team is collaborating with our partners to deliver enhanced consumer experiences. A couple of examples that leveraged new technology platforms include Misfit Wearables which produces the Shine fitness tracker and Spotify, the world\u2019s leading on-demand music streaming service.","Our strategic partnerships with these two companies in which we\u2019ve made minority equity investments will enable us to forge even more meaningful connections with our consumers. While it\u2019s too early to speak to results from our increased level of investments, we are confident in our plans and approach, which is based on robust analytics across our top markets. The insights from this analysis have equipped us with necessary information to prioritize both the quantity and quality of our investments across markets, across brands and across media channels.","With regards to productivity, we are diligently seeking, identifying and securing efficiencies across all parts of the business. This effort is focused on standardizing and streamlining our processes, while also clarifying roles and accountabilities.","Let me just provide you with three examples of how we\u2019re doing this across North America. We\u2019ve instituted an ownership cost management focus, thanks to which our associates are identifying and delivering significant savings.","Second, about 50% of our plants in North America have completed an operational excellence diagnostic with the remainder scheduled to do so by 2015. This is resulting in savings of approximately $1 million for each location and following each implementation to focus on year-over-year productivity continues.","And third, in our warehouse and delivery operations, we\u2019ve focused on our layout and process standardization. Thanks to initiatives ranging from real-time data transfer to smart selling, we can now optimize warehouse capacity, work more efficiently and reduce out-of-stocks. These are just a few examples of the productivity work that we\u2019re doing to identify and extract savings that will be redeployed and reinvested to drive long-term growth.","We\u2019ve also made progress on our fourth priority, which is to win at the point-of-sale by unlocking the power of our system. Our focus on winning at the point-of-sale is not new. What is new is the increased emphasis on flawless execution across our system.","This includes an accelerated focus on capturing new outlook and greater alignment in the execution of new brand and packaged launches. We\u2019re also intent on exceeding our Right Execution Daily or RED targets and ensuring that our products are well placed as well as merchandized to optimize our sales.","This fourth priority emphasizes the importance of capability building and collaboration on all frontlines where our sales associates, drivers, merchandisers are often the final link in ensuring that our Coca-Cola and all our brands are always within an arm\u2019s reach of desire.","The first quarter, we saw many concrete examples of how together with our bottling partners, we are winning at the point-of-sale, including excellent execution of our Sochi marketing campaign leading to significant share gains across almost all beverage categories in Russia, occasion, brand, price, pack, channel, architecture changes in many countries, including a significant focus on immediate consumption package reductions leading to immediate consumption volume growth ahead of future consumption growth and an improved RED penetration and scores. Right Execution Daily now covers approximately 40% of our volume, an increase of about three points over the past year.","And our FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour program has now reached 90 countries, where our bottling partners have activated the program in 400,000 retail outlets. Importantly, the partnership required to win at the point-of-sale extends beyond our bottling partners to include our customers, the more than 24 million retail outlets that we proudly visit on a weekly basis. We are continuously collaborating with our customers to identify ways to add value to their business.","Our fifth and final priority is to invest in our next generation of leaders both here in the U.S. and all across the world. In this context, I want to remind everyone that today is Gary\u2019s last quarterly earnings call and I want to commend and acknowledge him on an outstanding 14 years as the Coca-Cola Company\u2019s CFO. ","e sincerely thank Gary for his many years of outstanding leadership service, his steady focus, countless insights and the enormous value he has helped to generate for our company and all of our shareowners. Collectively, he and his finance leadership team have carried out a thoughtful and purposeful transition.","I\u2019m going to recommend that our Board elect Kathy Waller as our new CFO next week. And this is a great example of the talented and experienced bench strength that we are building with our next generation of talented leaders. I hope all of you welcome Kathy to the role of Chief Financial Officer.","As our fifth priority outlines, we\u2019re committed to investing in our next generation of leaders across all levels of the Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola system. So as you can see, we\u2019re making progress across each of these clinical strategic priorities and look forward to providing you with further update as we progress throughout this year.","Now, let me address a couple of other topics across our operating groups. First, there is the question of profitability in North America, where comparable currency neutral operating income declined 8% in the quarter. This decline was largely due to the impact of one less selling day and the shift of Easter into the second quarter.","We\u2019ve been encouraged by the results of targeted marketing efforts in several North American markets in recent months. And we\u2019re excited about the trends that we are seeing.","Enhanced marketing and disciplined retail pricing strategies in North America resulted in volume that was even to brand Coca-Cola. At the same time, we achieved a 2% increase in sparkling price\/mix. We also gained sparkling value share ahead of volume share making this our 16th consecutive quarter of value share gain.","Our priorities in North Americas remain very clear. As we shared in our year end call, our focus remains on building strong brands, creating customer value and enhancing our capabilities. We\u2019re streamlining the way we work and identifying ways to operate more effectively and efficiently in our sales warehouse and delivery operations.","I also want to speak to our results in Europe, where our volume was down 4% as our business was adversely impacted due to the Easter shift and by ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Volume in France increased 4% and volume in Germany was even with prior year.","During the quarter, our Europe group realized 10 points of price\/mix, thanks to the consolidation of Innocent and to a broad focus on earnings price -- earning price across our business units in Europe. We seek to continuously earn price\/mix by balancing disciplined pricing with packaging changes. A recent example of this is the transition from a straight-wall 2-liter to a contour 1.75-liter at the same price in Great Britain at the end of the first quarter.","As we look ahead, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about our outlook in Europe despite the continuing volatile operating environment. The strong and integrated programs that we have developed together with our bottling partners fuel this optimism. These initiatives will help us leverage our marketing assets, implement critical and innovative packaging and dispensing initiatives and execute impactful marketing programs during the year to come.","Number of these initiatives in Europe began in the first quarter, including the FIFA World Cup promotions and three-time World Cup winner Germany offering our Coke Zero consumers a chance to win one of the 200 tickets to Brazil, a new Fanta marketing campaign and in-and-out flavors successfully launched in Austria, Switzerland, Romania and Hungary, as well as Cappy Pulpy\u2019s geographical expansion in the southern European belt.","However, we\u2019re seeing most of the benefit coming during the remainder of the year due to various factors such as the timing of Easter, a ramp-up in World Cup activations as well as the timing and intensity of our marketing programs.","Before handing over the call to Gary, I want to also remind you about our recently announced partnership with Keurig Green Mountain which closed in the first quarter. We believe Keurig Green Mountain is the perfect strategic partner to collaborate with, to capitalize on the many opportunities we see available in the market and we look forward to providing you with further updates later in the year.","As I complete my prepared remarks, I want to reinforce that there is so much runway ahead of us and the Coca-Cola system is well positioned to capture more than our fair share of growth. This is a business that has barely tapped into its full potential.","Globally, consumer populations are growing, purchasing power is increasing and spreading to a new middle class. Urbanization continues to intensify and lifestyles and consumer preferences are changing in ways that significantly favor our expanding and evolving beverage portfolio. We have an unparalleled reach with leading global brands and a bottling system that is investing for sustainable growth.","Having said that, we do not take anything for granted. We fully understand that attaining our 2020 Vision will require more than just counting on industry growth. Indeed, it is up to all of us, up to our global system leaders and up to each of our associates to make the right decisions and to take the right actions that are going to enable us to seize the abundant opportunities that are before us.","Gary will now provide you with some additional details on our first quarter financial performance.","Gary Fayard","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. In the first quarter of this year, we began executing and delivering the strategic plan that we outlined and shared with you on our 2013 year end call and at the CAGNY and CAGE Investor Conferences earlier this year. Our clear and focused commitment remains a long-term value creation and the strategic priorities, which Muhtar just outlined today and they are tailored to do just that.","While much work remains to be done, we\u2019re confident in our strategies and are fully committed to this plan, as we firmly believe that the Coca-Cola Company is a sustainable and great long-term growth business. As mentioned, we grew unit case volume 2%, a sequential improvement from last quarter and cycling 4% growth in the prior year.","Global price mix increased by 2% and we gained both volume and value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages in the first quarter, a constructive start towards restoring our momentum in 2014.","Comparable currency neutral net revenue grew 2% after excluding structural items, while concentrate sales were even with the prior year. We do expect concentrate sales and unit case sales to be in line for the full year. Comparable currency neutral operating income grew a solid 7% after excluding structural items, while also including an increase in marketing investments in support of our brands.","Comparable currency neutral earnings per share grew 5% with currency creating a 10 point headwind on comparable EPS. And for the math people in the room, you\u2019ll notice that comparable EPS declined 4%, implying a 9 point headwind. So, I just wanted to point out that the 10 point headwind is in the rounding.","We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and our net share repurchases through the first quarter were $713 million. Our cash from operations increased significantly versus the prior year quarter, primarily because we made a large contribution to our pension plan in the first quarter of last year.","Cash from operations also benefited from efficient management of working capital and these benefits were partially offset by unfavorable exchange. Because our largest pension plan is currently fully funded, I do not foresee any significant cash contributions to our pension plan in the near term. As it relates to overall cash management, as we have discussed in the past, we follow disciplined guidelines for how we use our cash to create sustainable shareowner value.","First, we\u2019re reinvesting in the business to further strengthen the equity of our brands and to accelerate growth. This includes capital investments and new cooler placements, route-to-market enhancements, brand and packaging innovations and marketing investments that include not only more marketing but better quality marketing as well.","Importantly, along with our increased investments, our bottling partners are also stepping up their investments, thus further enhancing growth for the overall system. Second, we continue to reward shareowners by paying a healthy dividend, which is $1.22 per share this year, a 9% increase over last year. It\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019ve increased our dividend every year for more than half a century.","Third, we evaluate opportunities to grow through bolt-on acquisitions, strategic partnerships and value-added joint ventures when appropriate. Recent examples include the Keurig Green Mountain partnership, which opens up an exciting new packaging format for our brands, investments to further enhance our leading juice portfolio like Innocent and Rani and investments that allow us to broaden our reach like ZICO and Core Power. And finally we conduct meaningful regular share repurchase.","As we look to the second quarter of 2014, we plan on continuing to execute our five strategic priorities and our full year plan remains firmly intact. First, let me address operating leverage. As you can see in our release, we achieved four points of operating expense leverage in the quarter as we benefited from the timing of year-over-year expenses.","Consistent with what we shared with you on our year end 2013 call, our outlook for operating expense leverage for the full year 2014 has not changed. We expect to achieve even the slightly positive operating expense leverage for the full year as we increase brand investments.","Secondly, let me address the outlook for currency. We now estimate based on current spot rates and hedging that currencies will have a seven point headwind on operating income both in the second quarter and for the full year. Our analysis reflects and includes the negative impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation, partly offset by improvements in other currencies as compared to the outlook we provided at the time of our year end earnings release.","While we are very cautious in forecasting currency movements, we have managed through more than $2 billion of currency headwinds at the topline in the last two years. And as you know, we anticipate significant currency headwinds for the remainder of this year. As we look further into the future, we think it is unlikely that we\u2019ll have the same level of headwinds going forward.","Third, I would like to comment on structural change. As we previously disclosed, the bottling transactions completed in 2013 are anticipated to have an unfavorable 1% structural impact on both our full year 2014 revenues and operating income. As a reminder, this impact hits the first and second quarter results as the Brazilian bottler transaction took place on July 3rd of last year.","As Muhtar noted earlier, I have elected to retire next month after a very special and memorable 20 years at the Coca-Cola Company. And I want to congratulate Kathy Waller on being recommended to the Board for election as the company\u2019s new CFO and to reinforce my full confidence in her leadership in this position given her 25 years at the company.","I have to say, as a retiring officer with this company, it is comforting to know that I leave the CFO office in great hands and that we have built a talented and deep finance leadership organization that will support both Kathy and Muhtar. It also gives me great comfort to look around this room this morning during our conference call with Muhtar, Irial, Ahmet, Sandy, Kathy and Jackson and to think about the experience, focus and dedication of this company\u2019s senior leadership.","It\u2019s been a tremendous honor to serve as CFO of the Coca-Cola Company over the past 14 years and I have greatly enjoyed building long lasting relationships with all of you across our investment community.","In closing, I\u2019ll also leave you with a few thoughts. First, I have every confidence that our ability to reignite sparkling growth beginning with brand Coca-Cola. Second, we are continuing to build leadership positions in still beverages, much like we have done in the sparkling category since 1886.","And third, our franchise system is not only the strongest it has ever been but it also provides us with a global footprint and an invaluable local resource, all at the heart of a real value creation model. And lastly, there is nothing quite as refreshing as an ice cold Coca-Cola.","So to all of you on this call, I sincerely thank you for your candor, your partnership and your thoughtful questions over the last 14 years. And I encourage you to continue to reach out to the senior leadership team for meaningful dialogue, or ways to further enhance our business and to build long-term value for you and all of our shareowners.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question today is from Bill Pecoriello with Consumer Edge Research.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Good morning and congratulations again Gary and Kathy.","Gary Fayard","Thank you, Bill.","Kathy Waller","Thanks, Bill.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Muhtar, if you could talk about what gives you the confidence that Coke can hit its long-term growth algorithm in 2014 specifically? And also, when you look at the improving momentum during the first quarter, how much would you attribute to any relief you are seeing in external headwinds versus the impact of the internal actions that you are taking? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","Thanks, Bill. Good morning. First, let me say again that I am pleased to report that our growth momentum is improving in line with our expectations. And in the midst of still continued volatility headwinds, achieving sequentially stronger 2% volume growth, that means delivering an incremental 100 million unit cases in the past 90 days or so, that means incrementally every single day, an additional 27 million actual servings for each day.","As the base grows, we are still very proud that we can continue to drive growth. And this is a quarter that\u2019s where Easter has shifted, where we\u2019re cycling 4% from prior year, whereas as I said, macro volatility continued and where we had the harshest winter in the northern hemisphere, particularly in the U.S. We don\u2019t think this is a great result but satisfying as one step in the right direction to restore momentum.","Germany, U.S. was flat in the past quarter. We think given what we went through and what economies and consumer and climate. Turkey was up 2%, Japan was up 3%, France was up 4%, Brazil was up 4%, India and Russia was up 6%, China was up 12%. These show and give us the proof points that our actions are working. And I think this is the quarter again, where only a small fraction of our incremental marketing was deployed.","I would say probably around -- so 5% of our total incremental marketing for the year was deployed in this first -- in this quarter. As we ramp up the quality and also quantity of our marketing, I believe that certainly we are going to drive better alignment. We have really good plans in place fully aligned with our bottling partners and I would be disappointed as would be all my colleagues and associates if we don\u2019t go back into the corridor of our long-term growth algorithm for volume growth.","But also importantly, we are driving not just volume growth but we are driving immediate consumption growth, which is really important for our business. When you look at say in this past quarter, our top five countries growing, as China up 18% in IC growth, Indonesia up 9% in IC growth, Vietnam up 8%, Brazil up 5%. These are really important numbers because it\u2019s sustainable growth, it\u2019s profitable growth and it\u2019s growth in transactions, which is directly married to the health of the brands and health of our portfolio.","So from that perspective again, I want to just register a cautious optimism that I feel we would be disappointed if we do not fall back into the corridor of our long-term growth algorithm for the remainder of the year in terms of the volume growth picture and also the other key metrics that follow on from there.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. And Gary and Kathy both -- congratulations to both of you.","Gary Fayard","Thanks, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to drill in a little bit further on Latin America and I guess sort of three topics. One in Mexico with volumes -- the volume decline was a little bit less than we thought, so if you could just talk about whether -- what we are seeing now is sort of the expected elasticity, or if there is something else in the future that might change the elasticity, so has the consumer really seen the full effect of the pricing?","And then second, if you could just talk a little bit about some of the drivers of price-mix in the Latin America segment in the quarter, how much of it was driven by Venezuela? And then finally, just in terms of the Brazil comp being better sequentially, how much of that do you think is just that, maybe the consumer is a little bit better, was there anything specific that Coke did in the first quarter to drive the better performance in Brazil?","Muhtar Kent","Bryan, good morning. Last question first, on Brazil. I think Brazil was out the gate first in terms of the FIFA World Cup activation, a lot of noise around that, lot of activation in stores. And I think that certainly we also see a little less malaise in terms of the macro environment. And again, in terms of also the relationship between durables and non-durable consumer goods was a little bit more in favor for us. So we feel that\u2019s going to continue and that Brazil will have a better year and I think the government is also aware of what they need to do, as they lead into one of the biggest events in their history, which is hosting a memorable event like the World Cup.","As far as Mexico is concerned, I think sparkling volume for us was sort of in the mid-single digits decline for the first quarter. The important thing here is that because of the strength of our brands, because of also the incredible richness of our package portfolio and our occasion, brand, price, pack, channel architecture, the strength of that in Mexico, we are seeing that we are gaining market share versus both local competitors and our international competitor in Mexico as well. And again, we could start -- till early days related to Mexico but I would say that we are again executing with great precision and passion in Mexico with our great bottling partners.","And then in terms of price-mix, including that favorable geographic mix, other points came as a result of high inflation in local markets. And again, I\u2019ll ask Gary to comment related to the Venezuela piece.","Gary Fayard","Bryan, Venezuela definitely contributed positively in the quarter to positive price-mix. Now with going forward, that will no longer really be the case because we have adjusted the -- as of the end of the quarter, we have adjusted the exchange rate that will be using the 10.8 exchange rate going forward for most of our revenues, a large part of the revenues in Venezuela. So that will come down but that impact is included in the latest currency forecast that I gave you. So again, some of the other currencies actually have improved from what we talked about in the February call that offset now by Venezuela. So still at the same 7% impact.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","As we are modeling price-mix in Latin America, just going forward, there is some price-mix in there that is positive, excluding Venezuela, I guess, that was what I was after?","Gary Fayard","Yes, there\u2019s definitely positive price-mix going in there. And I think the other thing to point out and Muhtar said it, I said it, but I think it\u2019s really important as you look at this quarter how we drove value share ahead of volume share. So we are definitely focused on rational pricing across the world and getting our earning price.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Gary Fayard","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from John Faucher with JPMC.","John Faucher - JPMC","Thank you very much. And Gary, it\u2019s been great over the last 14 years, so best of luck as you move forward and Kathy looking forward to working with you as well.","Gary Fayard","Thanks, John.","John Faucher - JPMC","Gary, I had to finish off with sort of one accounting question here, so you guys drove tremendous SG&A leverage in the quarter and you talked a little bit about sort of how you haven\u2019t put a whole lot of marketing spend to work yet. So, can you walk us through may be how we should think about the sales curve over the next couple of quarters and what we should look for on the SG&A line, as we look to model out the balance of the year? Thanks.","Gary Fayard","I\u2019ll try John and we\u2019ll see how this goes. But basically there, let\u2019s go to marketing first and let\u2019s talk about it in two different ways. One is, how much of the marketing is actually in the market and that\u2019s what Muhtar was referring to, how much of the marketing is actually hitting the consumer and a lot of our incremental spend actually has not hit the consumer yet, it\u2019s much more weighted starting in the second quarter on through Q4. A lot of the first quarter really focused on getting the quality of our marketing up and that\u2019s what we think.","That is different from the way we account for marketing and marketing as you reference is on the sales curve. So on the sales curve, that incremental marketing is included in what we expensed in the first quarter. Now, then, we get into the marketing that we are cycling quarter by quarter from last year. And so, it was an increase in marketing in the first quarter, the increase will significantly grow during the year based on what we are cycling. That is part of what I said, that 4 points of operating leverage will go to even the slightly positive and we are also benefiting from some other timing in the first quarter in just some of the OpEx expenses as well.","John Faucher - JPMC","Okay. And then Muhtar, if I could ask you a follow-up question on, you talked about the strength of the bottling systems and obviously the equity income line is getting hit by FX but we have seen some comments from Amatil in terms of what\u2019s going on there and then also SAB talked about cutting some positions in their soft drink business. Can you just talk a little bit about the mood of the bottlers and what they\u2019re seeing now and how we should look at some of the headwinds they\u2019re facing in the shorter term and how that may be will differ with what happens in the longer term there? Thank you.","Muhtar Kent","Yes. I would say the mood is positive in terms of their willingness to invest, their appetite for new territories. I\u2019ve always -- you\u2019ve heard me say this before in terms of litmus test for the health of the business. There is a lot of appetite for growing horizontally in territory and trying to get expand. And I think in terms of the quality of our marketing, in terms of the quantity of our marketing, I feel that based on all the bottlers that I have questioned in this past quarter, I feel good, I feel positive about the sentiment both here in the United States, as we start our path to franchising and as we look at how we expand and how we hasten the pace of franchising but also across the world.","I\u2019ve recently been with many bottling leaders and talked to many of them. We have a global system meeting next month also where about 50 of the top bottlers get together with their CEOs and Chairman. And we are there to further align our plans for 2015 and beyond but I feel good related to the plans in place, related to everyone\u2019s desire to execute better and to invest more into the future.","And again, based on the investments that have gone into the marketplace in the third and fourth quarter of last year, I feel -- that\u2019s why I feel confident that you are going to see us back into the corridor of the 3% to 4% long-term growth algorithm for the balance of the year, as we keep restoring momentum. So that\u2019s what I would say. Do we have some pockets of challenges? You mentioned them Coca-Cola Amatil. I feel again very cautiously optimistic as Alison Watkins assumes a new role there and we are working very closely with her and her team. And again, we are very much aligned to how we move forward with SABMiller and their management team related to their non-alcoholic beverage business.","John Faucher - JPMC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And I also echo my congratulations to Kathy and Gary, it\u2019s been great, we will miss you.","Gary Fayard","Thank you, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Thank you. So just wanted to may be delve a little bit into Europe in the quarter and the question number one, just relating to Great Britain, obviously sparkling being down double-digits. If you can give us some context of trends that you\u2019ve seen throughout the quarter and sort of strip out some of the one-off factors with respect to the Easter timing as well as some of the transition into the 1.75 liter packaging and whether you\u2019re seeing some improvement there.","And then just in terms of Southern Europe, we are hearing more from some of the consumer companies that things are trending a little bit better in markets like Spain and Portugal. So may be you can also just give us whether we are seeing a similar improvement for your business in that part of Europe?","Gary Fayard","Thanks, Judy. I will ask Ahmet to give you a response on to your question. Ahmet?","Ahmet Bozer","Thanks Judy. Yeah, the results obviously for Europe for the first quarter was less than what we would have desired with minus 4%. A lot of things came into play with that. You mentioned, the Easter obviously that was definitely a factor and Muhtar has mentioned the transition into a new future consumption back in GB. I would add to that that there was sort of a pricing activity in the marketplace on future consumption facts that had also had some impact and we are in very close discussion on alignments with our bottlers to make sure that we actually sort of respond in a way that we maintain rational pricing in the marketplace but also balance volume growth and value growth at the same time, so that was one.","You\u2019ve mentioned Southern Europe, the slight improvement that everybody sees in Iberia and Spain that we see as well. Our numbers had a bit of noise and it\u2019s with regards to the strike in our Iberian bottling partners that you all have heard about before. We\u2019ve had great mitigation plans in place and executed them and the negotiations at all the sites, the restructuring is expected to end in May and we will continue to see improvements in our Iberian business as well. So we expect, as we move into quarter two, remove the effect of Easter, fully implement OBPPC in GB and continue to finish our restructuring in Spain. We expect to see improvements in Europe over the next quarter and the rest of the year.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. And then if I can just follow-up on North American just on the pricing side. So sparkling up 2% seems encouraging but the broader North American pricing kind of being flattish. How should we think about that going forward? Do you expect to see the still pricing being a little bit more pressured or do we see improvements there going forward for the broader North American pricing turning positive?","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. Judy, this is Muhtar. Let me just frame again. Just a couple of important takeaways for Britain\u2019s rational pricing. It was really the theme for us in Q1 and the strength of our marketing program, the strength of our commercial program leaves us to believe that we will see improvement as we go into Q2 and Q3 and Q4 in Britain. That will take a while I would say. Again, the same phrase and motto for our U.S. business, rational pricing that\u2019s the takeaway and we had 2% to 3% price mix in our sparkling portfolio in the U.S. and you\u2019ll see that continuing. And I will ask Sandy to -- and Irial to reflect on our further details on that.","Sandy Douglas","Thanks, Muhtar. The pricing, we expect pricing for the full year in sparkling to actually improve from the first quarter. Our plans are in place with our customers, the market is rationale, our focus on immediate consumption growth will drive mix and our rate should continue to be healthy and even improved as we move through the second quarter and into the third quarter where we\u2019re lapping some promotional activity.","So that\u2019s point one. Point two is on still, the case packed water business continues to grow, so it pulls down mix. We see opportunities however on a targeted basis in our can sales and improved pricing and we\u2019ll take action to do that. Paul, Irial and I see opportunities on a category-by-category basis.","And then finally in our chilled juice business, we\u2019ve just fielded an increase to respond to the commodity issues with orange juice in Florida and that\u2019s taking root and our juice business continues to be advantage from a share perspective. And I think all of that wraps up from the pricing standpoint to a much more favorable profit outlook for the full year.","I mean we saw some timing related issues. And obviously we\u2019ve talked about having one last selling day in the first quarter but all of that\u2019s going to come together with our price and volume plan for the year to produce profit growth for the full year. Irial?","Irial Finan","Good. The only add I\u2019d give is we\u2019re about building a long-term sustainable, profitable business in the U.S. And to do that with most of the balance of pricing and volume growth and pricing is a really critical part of that. And we will, in this year, end up with sparkling to 2% to 3% range in pricing or price\/mix I should say. And that\u2019s really is and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, that\u2019s what Sandy and the team, Paul and the team, all of us together are focused on delivering that, delivering a healthy business that\u2019s going back to growth as well.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment on the performance of your key markets in Asia and particularly, China and Indonesia. The China volumes have rebounded quite strongly now for two or three quarters and I was just hoping you could shed some light on what\u2019s being driving that? Whether the new strategy, the new team that\u2019s being put in place there, whether that\u2019s all paying off or whether it\u2019s really mostly due to relatively low comparison basis still. And then similar question on Indonesia, volumes continue to be strong there, just wondering what\u2019s driving that?","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. Michael that\u2019s Muhtar. I\u2019ll say just a couple of top line and then ask again, Ahmet to contribute. But yeah, I\u2019ll repeat what I said about IC, particularly, pleasing was China, IC was up 18%, Indonesia IC was up 9%, Vietnam up 8%. These are really important for us as we drive profitable growth in our business.","And again, our newly architected packaging, our portfolio in China is really working with the smaller packs and the new price points. And I think also the new team certainly is really delivering what we expect of them as well as our bottlers with renewed focus. Both our bottling investments group but also Swire as well as Copco really doing a good job in the first quarter. And I think lot of really good investments and activity and commercial leadership is in place to continue to drive that momentum both in the stills as well as in the sparkling portfolio in China. And so again Ahmet, if you want to just highlight\u2026","Ahmet Bozer","Yeah. I think Michael you listed a lot of reasons that my headline will be as all of the above but let me color it a little bit. Certainly the new team and the new strategy that we covered with you last year is really coming together nicely. And we\u2019re happy with the quality of the growth, sparkling\u2019s growing, juices are growing and those are the category that we told you that we were betting on for our growth in China.","You might see growth in waters that is an important category. But we\u2019ve just had some recent launches into a 2RMB water, which improves the profitability of that very, very early days and it\u2019s doing well. Also we\u2019re quite encouraged with again very early results on some of our innovation which Schweppes be plus and just couple of weeks out, the plant is our isotonic.","So we\u2019re getting that good mix of sparkling juices and innovations that is beginning to work for us. I would just caution us though, you did mention the easier cycle race from last year, that is definitely the case and 12% growth we\u2019re very happy with. But we would expect to see growth in China, continued growth in China, probably in the range of mid-to-high single-digit that we could expect over time. So that\u2019s basically I think covers everything.","Muhtar Kent","","And just one other point I\u2019d highlight Michael is Japan is very pleasing that it grew 3% in sparkling and stills grew 4% in Japan in the quarter. And again, despite the longest monsoon that I have ever experienced in terms of season and how long it took, India grew 6% and should do much better going forward. And so again, I\u2019m certainly very proud that this is the 31st consecutive quarter of growth in India for us and including continued share gain.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then Indonesia, could you just comment similarly?","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. And again that\u2019s -- Michael that\u2019s a very important market for us and we have been focused on aligning with our bottling partner, Amatil there on a new plant or let\u2019s say, an evolved plant as was the case in China. It was the revised OBPPC investments in sparkling and still beverages. There\u2019s been a recent change in management on the ground. And all of that again, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the progress we\u2019re making in Indonesia, are beginning to deliver good results. Certainly, that market has so much more opportunity to grow in the coming years.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. First, Gary congrats on a great run and best wishes on the firm and congrats there Kathy also.","Gary Fayard","Thank you ","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","And Muhtar, I was hoping to discuss if your expectations have changed at all here over the last year just regarding the long-term growth potential of the sparkling category. So not necessarily from a market share front but more just in terms of category growth and if one looks at industry data, it looks like sparkling trend slowed more in 2013 than we\u2019ve seen in other CPG categories. So, I was just hoping for some perspective on that, the drivers behind it and expectations going forward?","Muhtar Kent","Yeah, no changes as far as my perspective is concerned. I can confirm that both, our entire team and as well as our bottling partners feel the same way as the system. We are blessed to be in a great business, both in the sparkling area as well as in the stills. We continue to innovate. I believe that we have a great future where so many -- hundreds of millions of people in so many large markets haven\u2019t tasted a Coca-Cola in the last month or in the last six months or in the last year.","We have tremendous opportunity going forward and I believe that through innovation, packaging, equipment and great marketing, we will continue to grow our business going forward both in sparkling and in stills. And I feel confident that we will go back into the corridors of our long-term growth algorithm this year and years to follow. And with new innovations like creating new paths to consumptions, creating new consumption occasions like the Keurig Green Mountain innovation, like Freestyle that is driving, we know everywhere, every time it\u2019s actually installed in an outlet it drives traffic, it drives incidents, it drives increased sales and it drives excitement for the consumer.","And at the same time, our contour packages, you will see us being focused much more on the contour. Next year is the 100th anniversary of the contour bottle, the iconic contour bottle. You\u2019ll see a lot of activity around that also. But we feel, we have a lot of work to do, so we feel that isn\u2019t that a great place where you have a lot of work to do and you believe in your future.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And on the innovation front in the U.S., can you give us a bit more detail in terms of maybe potential timing of sweetener innovation and how impactful you think natural sweeteners could be to your topline results eventually?","Muhtar Kent","I think they will. I\u2019m certain innovation is going to be impactful and I can\u2019t give you any more details on the timing.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. Sure. So, just thank you again, Gary, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial, Jackson. We\u2019re just once again, firmly committed to advancing our growth trajectory in 2014. Our strategic priorities are yielding tangible and measurable results and they are consistent with our long-term goals and our overarching business strategy.","Increased marketing investments and a focus, a relentless focus on execution underscore the confidence we have in our systems alignment as we seek to execute these strategies, while we further strengthen the foundation for profitable and sustainable long-term growth.","Our 2020 Vision calls for a well balanced growth, that is growth in sparkling beverages and also growth in still beverages across more than 200 markets countries and in revenues and margins. And thanks to this balanced growth in both portfolio as well as geographic mix, we see a path that leads to global volume, revenue and profit growth in line with our long-term target. Our focus is unwavering and our execution of our five strategic priorities is going to enable us to restore momentum to growth to our business.","Thank you for your time this morning and for your continued interest and trust in our company.","Operator","Thank you.

Today, I'll touch briefly on a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. I'm pleased to report that we delivered third quarter results in line with our expectations, and we're on track to deliver against our full-year expectations.","Our continued focus on our five strategic initiatives enabled us to report another quarter of global value share gains, with 3% organic revenue growth and over 50 basis points of comparable currency neutral operating margin expansion. Our core business continued to perform well, delivering 4% organic revenue growth year-to-date, in line with our long-term target, driven by our segmented revenue growth strategies, improving marketing and portfolio diversification. Within our core business, developed markets performed well, delivering solid revenue results with 2% unit case volume growth year-to-date and a continued focus on price realization.","While we continue to see challenges in many emerging and developing markets, we're taking action to improve our performance. Importantly, we're delivering the profit target we laid out at the beginning of the year. Excluding the impact of structural items, comparable currency neutral income before tax grew 7% year-to-date. And we're confident we will deliver our full-year profit outlook of 6% to 8% growth, excluding these same items.","We continue our journey of transforming our company to a higher margin and higher return business, focused on building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading a strong, dedicated global franchise system. This quarter, we continued to make solid progress to strengthen and evolve our global system. In North America, we signed definitive agreements on six territories and closed transactions on four territories, thereby remaining on track to complete our refranchising efforts in our flagship market by the end of 2017.","In Japan, our two largest bottlers, Coca-Cola West and Coca-Cola East Japan, reached a definitive agreement to merge their operations and create a strong consolidated bottler, representing over 85% of our system volume in Japan. In Latin America, we reached a long-term comprehensive agreement with Arca Continental regarding joint value creation in Mexico, along with a similar agreement with FEMSA in July.","Separately, Coca-Cola FEMSA reached agreement to acquire Vonpar, one of the largest privately-owned bottlers in the Brazilian Coca-Cola system, increasing its scale and leveraging FEMSA's strong commercial capabilities.","In Europe, Coca-Cola European Partners finished its full quarter of operations as a combined company and we're executing an aligned plan. And finally in Africa, we recently exercised our call option to acquire ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. We have a number of partners who are highly interested in and qualified for these bottling territories, and we intend to implement our long-term strategic plan for these markets.","Over the coming months, we will negotiate the terms of the transaction with ABI, followed by a regulatory approval process. Simultaneously, we have commenced discussions with potential partners and plan to complete this important process as soon as feasible.","When I take a step back and think about the magnitude of change we have implemented over the past couple of years, I am truly encouraged. We've implemented segmented revenue growth strategies for our markets, invested in capabilities and created clear incentives for the entire organization to drive revenue growth rather than volume only. We're shaping our plan portfolio across the full range of sparkling and still beverage categories to meet changing consumer needs through leading marketing, innovation and targeted M&A, which James will discuss in more detail.","We launched Taste the Feeling, a new marketing campaign for Trademark Coca-Cola at the beginning of the year and are seeing positive response from our consumers and customers. And through our ongoing $3 billion productivity initiative, we're taking cost out to both reinvest in the business and drive margin expansion. And, as I've discussed, we are re-architecting the bottling system in key geographies and regions to better capture growth. To put it in perspective, these affected regions account for almost half of our global volume. So the actions we're taking today are going to have significant impact on our system's future performance.","Through these actions, we're becoming a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets.","I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed outlook at our operating performance.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, we continue to implement our five strategic actions for growth and we're making the necessary changes to have the speed, agility and the focused leadership needed to win today and into the future. So before I jump into the results, as you know, we made a number of changes to our operating leadership structure during the quarter. I'd like to say these transitions occurred seamlessly, are a testament to our leaders and associates, and these new leaders are bringing a fresh perspective and are working diligently to identify opportunities to accelerate our performance around the world.","Now, let me turn to the results. I'd like to talk to you about these through two lenses: firstly, the traditional operating results in the quarter, somewhat seen by geography; and second, how we continue to evolve our brand marketing and portfolio to stay relevant and meet consumer preferences.","So, our performance in the quarter; our results were in line with our expectations, with 3% organic revenue growth and 2% underlying income before tax growth. Our core business grew organic revenue 3% in the quarter and, as we expected given the strong growth we were cycling from the third quarter last year, it's important to note that year-to-date, our core operations continue to grow organic revenue 4% and we remain on track to deliver this performance for the full year.","Our company-owned bottling operations grew organic revenue 2% in the quarter, an acceleration from the first half of the year, driven by North American bottling and an improvement in China. Unit case volume grew 1%, cycling a pretty strong 3% from last year and an acceleration from last quarter, due largely in part to the return to growth in China and a stronger performance in our Western European business. It's worth saying that the macro challenges persist in certain emerging markets, particularly, for example, Argentina and Venezuela, negatively impacting consolidated unit case volume growth by 1 point.","So, turning and looking around the world, we continue to push hard where we have momentum, take action where needed and manage through some of the difficult operating conditions. So, we continue to do well in a number of key markets with momentum, including places like North America, Mexico and Japan and so seek to further advance our strategies. For example, North America, we grew organic revenue 3% as we continue to successfully implement both our accelerated refranchising program while delivering top-tier growth among FMCG companies in the U.S. The strength and breadth of our full brand portfolio led to value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. So that actually overall, we captured 40% of NARTD beverage retail sales growth year-to-date.","Also, as I said, we did well in Japan and Mexico, and both benefited from strong marketing and innovation, as the combination of the One Brand strategy and new product launches drove continued solid performance.","Turning to some of the other key markets, we saw improved performance in the quarter. Our actions are starting to bear fruit, but we still have more to do. In China, we returned to growth, driven by strong activation of our Olympic campaign, improved execution and, frankly, better weather. Our system has largely worked through the wholesale inventory issue. And we are continuing to innovate across the business towards the premium segment with examples like the launch of ZICO Coconut Water through the e-commerce channel, but also, at the same time, we're paying proper attention to the mass consumer segment. There, we're driving the availability of entry-level small packs, such as the 300-milliliter bottle, to address affordability issues, as the economy remains challenging and we expect continued near-term volatility.","Another key market that got better, Western Europe; solid marketing, innovation and commercial plans with the increased alignment with the new CCEP in its first full quarter as a new company and, again, a little bit of good weather resulted in strong performance in the quarter with our system gaining both value and volume share.","Now, while we're moving quickly in several markets and seeing success, it's true that we still compete in a number of markets with challenging macroeconomic conditions. The economic environment in Russia is improving slightly as the price of oil stabilizes; however, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela all remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies.","Therefore, we will continue to concentrate on what we can control. In Brazil and Argentina, we're focused on affordability by maintaining key consumer price points while evolving our price\/pack architecture to protect our market share. And in Venezuela, we are addressing raw material shortages by rapidly scaling the availability of our Zero Sugar portfolio.","Now, as we look at this quarter but also at the future, I'd like to build on what I've shared in the past about our productivity efforts and evolving revenue growth strategies with an update on our growing and evolving brand portfolio. Of course, we recognize the consumer tastes and preferences change and are changing, and we are building a strong, diversified brand portfolio across sparkling and the stills categories to meet these needs, including through internal innovation, bolt-on acquisitions and a lift-and-shift geographic expansion model.","If you look at our still portfolio today, it includes 14 of our 20 billion-dollar brands, with number one or number two positions in juice, coffee, water, tea and sports drinks categories. Year-to-date, our system sold 5.8 billion incremental servings of our stills brands, capturing over 25% of the value growth in stills globally.","This performance has been driven by action around the world to expand our stills businesses. For example, take our Japan business, which has one of our most diversified portfolios. On top of good growth in our sparkling brands, we continue to drive strong performance across multiple categories through innovations like new premium packaging for our Georgia coffee brand, a new line extension of our Ayataka tea brand and new flavors of our premium I LOHAS water brand.","In the U.S., we extended smartwater into sparkling water. We revamped the packaging graphics on DASANI Sparkling, resulting in retail value growth of over 80% in the quarter for these two products. We expanded the Honest Tea trademark into juice drinks, with Honest Kids becoming the number one organic juice drink chosen for kids.","We see ready-to-drink coffee as an important growth category in the U.S. Today, we are the global leader in ready-to-drink coffee category with strong positions in Japan and Korea, so we are leveraging on this strength and launching Gold Peak ready-to-drink cold brew coffee and Dunkin' Donuts branded ready-to-drink coffee to begin capturing this opportunity in our flagship markets.","In Europe, we're expanding our stills portfolio by lifting our smartwater and Honest Tea brands from the U.S. and shifting them to Europe. We are also leveraging strong existing brands. For example, we're expanding geographically Innocent, our very successful premium juice and smoothie business, into a strong regional brand, but also extending ViO, our popular water brand in Germany, into juice drinks and sparkling lemonades. This has resulted in strong double-digit volume growth year-to-date for both brands.","And finally, bolt-on M&A and investments, when available, will continue to be a part of our portfolio expansion strategy, particularly in the value-added dairy and plant protein beverage spaces. We are pleased by the early results of fairlife in the U.S. and Santa Clara in Mexico and we look forward to closing our acquisition of plant-based brand AdeS in Latin America in early 2017.","Now, turning to our sparkling business, I'd like to talk a little bit about how we're doing things differently. We are bolding our sparkling portfolio strategy so that we can grow while reducing sugar consumption. Through these actions, we've been able to outpace a category that is growing retail value by 3% for the first nine months of the year. So let me give you a few examples of how we're doing this.","First, our Taste the Feeling marketing campaign is engaging consumers with better advertising around both the extrinsics and intrinsics of the brand. Second, we are also providing more sugar-free options. In several markets around the world, we have launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, with a new and improved taste as well as a new visual identity system under our One Brand strategy. And this is contributing high single-digit volume growth for this brand globally in the quarter.","Take GB, for example. While we're only 12 weeks in, we've seen a significant expansion in the consumption versus the former Coke Zero product, resulting in strong double-digit volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar during the quarter. And we are rolling this out, this new and improved product out across other European markets.","More broadly, we've been taking multiple actions to shape choice, to address changing consumer preferences around added sugar while working proactively with governments to provide positive solutions. We've been driving a systematic reformulation effort across our portfolio to reduce added sugar while delivering superior consumer taste and improving margins.","For example, we currently have over 200 reformulation initiatives underway to reduce added sugar. And so an example of where that might take us as a step forward in GB, for example, we reduced the sugar and the calories in brands such as Sprite and Fanta by 30%. In our Latin Center business unit, we reduced the sugar content in almost two-thirds of our flavored sparkling beverages.","And then in combination with this reformulation and innovation effort, we have also focused on small pack sizes: a great way to enjoy a drink with less calories. These packs can provide both a premium experience as well as being affordable, yet profitable, way to bring people into the franchise.","In Mexico, for example, small packs such as our sleek can and 8-ounce glass bottle are growing rapidly through both increased distribution and higher velocity per outlet. In China, our premium-priced fleet count for Diet Coke and Coke Zero is growing strongly. And in India, where we recently launched our new lightweight, affordable PET bottle in just a few territories, we have already sold over 20 million servings.","These actions and the results we are seeing give us confidence that we can further accelerate our sparkling business. So looking forward, we're working to grow by ensuring ongoing relevance and engagement with our existing brands, while also expanding our brand portfolio so that we can meet consumer preferences.","So, as I think about the rest of the year, from an operationals perspective, I, like Muhtar, am confident we will achieve our full-year outlook.","So with that, let me turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full-year outlook.","Starting at the top line, organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price\/mix. Consolidated price\/mix in the quarter was driven both by rate and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by 1 point of segment mix, due to slower growth in our Bottling Investments Group than in our core concentrate operations.","At gross profit, our comparable margin increased about 45 basis points, as solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment and productivity was partially offset by about an 80 basis point currency headwind. Our North America refranchising roughly offset the benefit from deconsolidating our German and South Africa bottling operations, resulting in a slight structural benefit to margins.","Excluding the effect of currency and structural items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points. Our comparable operating margin declined about 35 basis points. Similar to gross margin, currency headwinds impacted our operating margins by about 90 basis points, while structural items, primarily the deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations, positively impacted our operating margins.","Turning to the cash flow, we continue to exercise strong cash flow management. Year-to-date, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations. And we have returned $5.7 billion to shareowners through a combination of net share repurchases and $4.5 billion of dividends paid year-to-date, and that includes our third quarter dividend that was paid on October 3, right after our quarter closed.","Net share repurchases year-to-date were $1.2 billion, and we continue to expect them to be $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the full year, in line with our initial guidance.","Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, with one quarter remaining, we continue to expect our full-year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%, in line with our previously-communicated expectations. However, we now expect to spend slightly less than $2.5 billion on capital expenditures for the full year, down from our initial expectations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.","As you construct your models, there are a few items to consider for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter has two additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top-line growth than we saw in the third quarter. We expect structural items to be an 11-point headwind on net revenue and a 6-point to 7-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect currency to be a 1-point to 2-point headwind on net revenue and an 8-point to 9-point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter.","So, in closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year, and we remain confident in our abilities to deliver our profit targets this year.","So with that, Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question is from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just a quick question for me on the refranchising, now that you've kind of gone through the process and we're getting towards the end of getting all of the announcements out of the way, can you give us any early indications on kind of what the growth delta has been in the markets that have been refranchises versus not? And then, also wanted to get some context of what's going on in Western Europe, obviously, with the CCE integration going on there, have you seen any disruption, and if you think that'll start to phase out over the coming quarters. Thanks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Nik, good morning. This is Muhtar. Thanks for your question. Look, I think first, once again, I want to reiterate the scale of what is being done here on a global basis. As I mentioned in my remarks, the geographies and the regions impacted by this refranchising, massive refranchising, is really when you aggregate it all, will impact 50% of our global volume. So this is really, really big, number one. Number two, the early indications that we have from both the U.S. refranchising efforts, which is the largest one, but also the European restructuring under the Coca-Cola European Partners umbrella, which was the biggest refranchising in Europe in history in its structure, essentially early indications have been positive.","In the United States, if you look at it, the last six quarters, consecutively, we've had volume growth and very encouraging price\/mix in the United States continued. And the last sort of year, four quarters have been the highest in terms of refranchising activity, so early indications are positive. Europe, the same; James mentioned the positive numbers coming out of the last quarter. Yes, helped by many other things other than just refranchising, but the impact is that there hasn't been the disruption. It's been going on very smoothly. And when you look at it going forward, we've got four to five quarters of intense refranchising remaining, as we bring out the other end of the tunnel another a company that is going to be totally transformed, revitalized in terms of its organizational capability, leadership structure, revitalization of the brands also with the investment in our brands and the new marketing, revitalization of our portfolio, of our bottling system as well as our cost base.","So we're encouraged with what we see as the transformed Coca-Cola Company coming out and also the integrity of the refranchising, as evidenced by the continued good results in North America and in Europe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now opened.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Dara.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So developed market volume growth obviously outperformed emerging markets in the quarter. That's fairly unusual. So I was hoping you could give us a bit of a review in the emerging markets. You obviously had a number of cautionary notes in the prepared remarks, but are you seeing any signs that the macros may be close to bottoming here or are things pretty tenuous? And, more importantly, as we look out to 2017 and beyond, do you think the year-to-date trends are more of a new normal or is there hope that with easier comparisons, that some of the strategy adjustments you've made, we can start to see emerging markets rebound closer to historical levels?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Dara, it's Muhtar here. I'll just mention very briefly, and then pass it over to James, that it is unusual. What you've just said is definitely \u2013 the fact that developed markets are growing at a higher pace than the developing and emerging markets, but it's not a surprise given the volatility that we all know that is taking place. But it is a mixed bag. It's not just a uniform, all emerging markets. Africa, for example, continues to be a very strong performer, both West Africa, led by Nigeria, but also other markets in Africa. Mexico, to name another one, so it is a mixed bag, but let me ask James to comment in more detail on how we see the future also in terms of the balance between emerging and developing versus developed markets.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, I think it is worth, as \u2013 morning, Dara \u2013 it is worth as we go into this, just underlining the collection of the developed markets are growing volume, growing price, strong revenue growth. We think we're taking actions to sustain that. The emerging markets, I think it's going to be a combination here of doing the things that we know we need to do and can control; and then, of course, is a question of what do the macroeconomics do and what actions do each country's governments take to put them on a better course or not? So that's part of the unknown going forward at this stage and the uncertainty.","But I think quite clearly, you see, as Muhtar commented, is a mixed bag. Across the world, you see those markets that are doing well sustain growth. He called out Nigeria, South Africa, the Philippines, other parts of the emerging markets. So it's good. But it's a mixed bag, and I think the actions are underway in a number of these countries to stabilize them where they're a little tougher, like Brazil, like Argentina, which I called out on the call earlier.","And we'll have to see how long it takes for this to take hold in the countries from a macro view. We don't have a clear sight on that. But what we do know is we need to focus on what we can control in those countries, go back to affordability, go back to execution, go back to the basics and build ourselves a better position with more market share, so that when it does turn and that combines with the growth in developed markets, we can be solidly in growth rates for our long term model.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","A couple of quick questions; the first one is how do you get to 3% organic in the quarter from 1% and 1%? (30:44) So was volume better or price\/mix better? I know they both probably rounded. I was just curious there. And then, the second question is the inflationary pricing in Latin America, is that mostly currency pass-through or is there sort of real price realization in the market? And kind of what happens into next year if these spot rates hold when some of the currency cross-rates starts to ease a little bit? Thanks.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Bill. So on your first question about the 3%. Yes, we did find another way to make 1.1 equal 3. It is rounding, and it's really balanced. So it was in the rounding, but it was a balanced impact from volume as well as a balanced impact from pricing.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","On your second question, Bill, James here, I think what's worth remembering is essentially, we are not trying to pass through the devaluation. We focus on being competitive in each local market beverage and fast-moving consumer goods industry, and especially when the economies are in tough times focusing on staying competitive and gaining share for the long term. The net of all of that means we are much more likely to follow or be close to local inflation rates rather than adopt the strategy of a full pass-through of the devaluation of the dollar. So obviously, if the exchange rates change, that'll mean different dollar numbers for the corporation. But the local strategy remains stay competitive in the marketplace, and it looks more like local inflation. Does that answer your question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steve Powers from UBS. Your line is now open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping actually to go back and focus on the stills versus sparkling portfolio, changes that, James, you referenced in your prepared remarks. Today, correctly me if I'm wrong, but I think your global portfolio still skews at least 70%-30% towards sparkling. But as you look forward, I'm curious as to what percentage of your growth you expect will come from traditional sparkling versus stills. I'm guessing it's probably not 70%-30%, but is it 50%-50% or is it some other split you could frame for us? And then, more importantly, do you think your growth investments today are aligned with that distribution?","In other words, if it is 50%-50%, for example, are your incremental growth investments aligned with that or is there still a legacy skew towards sparkling that might need to be rethought? Because I think from the outside, there's still a perception, right or wrong, that your incremental investments are a bit over-indexed towards core CSDs versus their future value contribution. And I was just hoping you could help clarify at least your thinking around that. Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. I mean, let me start by saying you're approximately right in volume terms on the current split between sparkling and stills, about 70%-30%. I think it's worth noting that that split has been moving in the favor of stills by about 1 point a year. At the turn of the century, 10, 15 years ago, it was a single digit percent of the mix, so it's going up at about 1% a year. Now, part of that organic on the things we're doing and part of that is the net of some of the bolt-on acquisitions. But it's going up about 1% a year of mix.","I think as you look forward, clearly, given that we have 50% of the sparkling industry value share and 15% of the sum of all the stills categories value share, we fully expect to be able to grow faster in the stills categories because it will be the combination of the category growth rate but plus our ability to gain share, which then feeds into your third question, which is how are the investments aligned? I feel they're aligned. Obviously, it's an ongoing process. Each year, we look at it in the business planning process and we'll be doing that again this year. But I would not characterize it as we are over-invested in sparkling and under-invested in stills. We are invested behind what's growing.","And actually, just to add a little more texture to it, we're doing the right things on sparkling. We tend to be pushing more money towards driving the zeros, the lights, the smaller packages in the sparkling business. In the stills, it's not a one-size-fits-all category. It's actually a noteable (35:07) category. And there, we're selective on which ones have \u2013 are most on-trends with the consumers, which one have more premium pricing. And therefore, we're very selective about where we funnel the dollars and invest ahead of the curve or in line with the growth rates we're expecting.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Andrew Holland from Soc G\u00e9n. Your line is now open.","Andrew Holland - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA (Broker)","Yeah, hi. Could I just ask you something \u2013 whether you could talk a little bit about the key qualities that you're looking for in a new bottler partner in Africa; any particular experiences or qualities that you're looking for?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, Andrew, good morning. This is Muhtar. I think you would expect us to be looking for proven capability, alignment and bottlers that have already got a track record in our system and that we have actually delivered together in alignment, and we have good examples of that, that we can refer to. That's basically it in a nutshell. And I think I know you probably have a loaded question but, in answer to your actual question, that's what I would say.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bonnie.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bonnie.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was actually hoping you could give us a little more detail on your stills portfolio in North America. You reported high single-digit growth in vitaminwater and then solid results in smartwater, but your still portfolio only grew 2%. So curious what's been the drag there? And then do you expect some of the innovations that you mentioned to drive growth in your stills portfolio back up towards the mid or even high single-digit range?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. Bonnie, yeah, we certainly did well in a number of the categories, particularly some of the premium categories. What was a little weaker in this quarter were some of the juice businesses and some of the tea businesses, which are not as high value to us, so that's what netted out on the 2%. What I think you see is over the year, you see very strong growth in vitaminwater, in sports drinks, in some of the other categories as well. So I think it's a broadening of the portfolio, a focus on innovation, but yet there's some headwinds on juice linked somewhat to commodities.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Would just like...","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Ali.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Ali.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","...a little bit of your perspective on two markets, kind at the extremes of maturity right now for you guys. So first on North America, which obviously remains a key concern when I talk to investors, just given the views of consumer preferences. But North America's doing pretty well, right? Pretty robust, stable growth, 3% organic sales growth, relatively good volume, relatively good price\/mix. What's working well for you in that market? Is it price\/pack architecture or stills, just better marketing? I'm assuming it's all that stuff.","And what are you learning from that that might work for similar geographies, like Western Europe or Japan? And so should we expect kind of in those markets a little bit of a similar ramp up as we're seeing in North America?","And then at the other extreme, can you tell us a little bit more about the China rebound, so to speak. I know you mentioned weather there; clearly, weather must have helped. Could you give us a sense of what you think the underlying growth is? Has the market gotten any better? Clearly, you've worked through, thanks to weather, some of your destocking issues, but want to get a better sense of China at the other extreme. Thanks for those two.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Morning, Ali; James here. Look, North America, I think is a combination of many, many things. I mean it's, I think, been the result of a number of years working on multiple fronts: working on innovation across the portfolio, getting into categories, refining the propositions, learning, refining the propositions. It's about, in the sparkling business, the better marketing, the more media spend. It's about the focus on the pricing and packaging architect. There will be more smaller packages. It's about getting the execution right. It's the refranchising, bringing new excited bottlers.","In the end, this is a result that has been built by a great team of people who have been very focused over a number of years about regenerating growth in the North American business. As Muhtar said, they've had six very solid quarters of volume and revenue growth. And I think there are a lot of learnings. There's no silver bullet, but there are a lot of learnings.","Now having said that, actually, Japan has also been on a good run. I mean, it's had three quarters of very good volume growth, doing well on offsetting deflationary pressure. Again, it's a similar story. The team is very focused on a multiple category approach, innovation in the products, increasing the quality and quantity of the marketing, but always in parallel and in alignment with the bottler, where you've got to get better execution. Good marketing on its own is not going to get you the answers. It's got to be more and better marketing, along with more and better execution, and I think that's what you see.","And to some extent, Western Europe, they kind of came new Coca-Cola European Partners came well out of the stables on the first quarter. I think the formula is going to be the same. More and better marketing, more and better execution and a multi-lane focus on categories and cranking out the learning, the trying stuff, the innovation and pushing ahead. And I think that's going to be something we'll continue to press across the developed markets.","Now, turning to China, I think China, again, if I gave the impression it was all weather, that would unfair to the team on the ground in China and the system there. They've done a lot of work to address the big change in how the consumer responded to the economic circumstances in China.","I think part of it is you know, it's a part of the world that's had such consistent growth rates over the last decade, but a little bit of a slowdown maybe caused some exaggerated pull-back on spending, so I think there is a little bit of stabilization coming through in the macros. We saw that.","We've definitely taken action in the things we can control, not just in the commercial policies to strengthen the wholesaler and distributor network and working through the inventory problems, but also on the pricing and packaging. To give you one example, a very small example, but it's symptomatic of how fast China can change. If you go to the cafe channel in China, there are all the noodle shops up and down the streets. People go there at lunchtime.","Last year, they were packed with people. This year, you go, they're a third empty. You go, okay, maybe the economy has slowed down. No, that's not what's happening. The explosion of online to offline ordering and the availability of lots of people on motorbikes to deliver stuff, and the apps and the aggregator apps to buy food has seen an explosion of ordering of online and delivery food, such that there is just as many people buying from these cafes, but sometimes in some parts of China, a third of it's being delivered to people, whether they be at work or as students.","And so we've had to adapt our packaging. Having a returnable glass bottle in that cafe doesn't help you with off-line delivery. So we've had to revamp the packaging offer so that we're there with the right package to go where the consumer is going.","And that's a micro example of the sorts of things we have to do China to adapt to how the market is changing and is contributing to stabilization. But it is, again, as I said, a country undergoing change in its economic model and that'll throw up new and different consumer behaviors to which we'll have to adapt.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Could you give us an update on the Philippines? You know, in listening to the Coca-Cola FEMSA results last night, it sounds like volumes were up there, margins are improving. It's one of those markets where it's been sort of a long-term project to get that turned around. Could you just give us a sense of sort of where you feel the Philippines are at this point and maybe what you've done to improve things there? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Hi, Bryan. It's James. Yeah, I mean, look, we've had a much better run in the Philippines in the last few quarters, actually, strong numbers the first three quarters of this year. Actually, last year was three very strong quarters as well. So I think since FEMSA's been in there, they've built on the work that BIG did. They've gone about fixing the fundamentals There were some fundamental structural stuff that still needed to be improved and I think they grasped the nettle in the early days. And we're starting to see the benefits of that coming through in the last six quarters.","Again, it's not silver bullet stuff. Is not too complicated in the sense of it's been about adapting the price\/package architecture. It's about some of the emphasis on some of the sparkling brands in the Philippines. There were some of the local brands that we de-emphasized and re-emphasized some of the more global brands and the stronger local brands, rebuilding and continuing to construct a more solid distributor network. Obviously, Philippines is complicated, given all the islands and the issue in moving product around, but I think they've kind of worked the system in terms of getting the thing nicely oiled in terms of the cogs so the product can get everywhere, backed up with a little more marketing and a little sharper focus on certain categories. And I think that's played through and I think the team on the ground has done a good job of taking the performance to a higher level.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Brett.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Brett.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning, Brett.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","If we look back, we've seen you implement a pretty significant cost savings program, what I think we would describe as accelerated or accelerating M&A activity in your bottling system, yielding synergies. And now, there's talk in the system looking outside in seeking efficiencies in Japan. Are there more innovative ways that you're open to to help the system find funds to be more competitive?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Brett. This is Muhtar. First, let me just say that over the last four, five years, we've been actually working really, really hard to reconfigure the Japanese bottling system. We had 13 bottlers, what, back five years, six years ago. And now, we're moving towards having 85% of the total business in Japan, which is, as you know, a very large business for us, under one roof. And I think that in itself first, without looking outside, without looking anywhere, is a huge re-architecture that is yielding substantial savings that we can re-deploy that into the route to market, into ways we actually get our products the most effective, efficient way to the customer and through the customer to the consumer in Japan.","So regardless of any encouragement from the outside, we are on a track to end up in a very efficient, very 21st century bottling system, a consumer goods delivery system in Japan that is working well. Now, are there are other opportunities? And that is not just related to cost saving, and yes, there has been early, very early, discussions in Japan, can't say any more than that. And we will continue to look at opportunities to see if we could even make our Japanese system even stronger. But that's very early days, again, in terms of the level of discussions that have taken place.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Bill Chappell from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bill.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bill.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Just wanted to follow-up back on Steve Powers' question. I mean, there's definitely a noticeable kind of increase in talk about the still growth and investment at the last conference and on the call today. And just trying to understand, I mean, certainly understand there's an opportunity, but what that means for margins as we move, especially gross margins, going forward? Because I think it's still much lower gross margin and so do you expect margin degradation or has the mix of business, with tea or higher end-type products offset that so as we can look to kind of 2018, 2019, we don't see that kind of margin degradation?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Let me say a couple of thoughts and then Kathy will give you some comments on the margin. Look, the stills, I think if I could say one thing, which is the stills is not a category. It's a combination of many different categories. And even those categories re-segment between premium, mainstream and more affordable. And so, what we are focused on doing as we invest in the stills business is, yes, growing in aggregate and top-line numbers, but we are being selective on focusing on those places where we think we can generate a better return in the long term.","It's not a growth of bulk water. It's focused on where is the consumer demand, what's on-trend. And if you just pick out a couple of things that are on-trend, things like coconut waters of premium juices or premium ready-to-drink coffees, these are all very high revenue products.","Kathy, do you want to say something about the margins?","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. So, hi, Bill. You are going to see some impact on margins, but mostly initially, because as we are going into these businesses, whether we are developing them internally or whether they're through bolt-on acquisitions, they do have a margin impact, but then as we get scale, as we continue to work on the supply chain, et cetera, we do start to improve the margin. So I would say it's an initial issue for margins. And then, over time, we are able to do things that will improve the margin impact. But initially, yes, as a category itself, a lot of these stills have higher cost of goods. They have higher revenue, but higher cost of goods, so that does impact margins.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to go back to China and ask a couple of follow-ups. So one is within the 2% growth in China, can you talk about sparkling versus still? And then, I think, James, we've seen certainly in that market, the premiumization is one of the key trends and just wanted to get a sense of how big you think that premium segment within NARTD in China is and what the growth rate is and kind of what you're doing to sort of tackle that consumer preference. And then separately, Kathy, the structural impact; obviously, fourth quarter is still a pretty big headwind. Is there any color you can give us as we think about 2017, sort of how much of the structural impact kind of lingers into 2017 and maybe even 2018? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. James here. Look, I think it's important to say that the premium opportunity in China is big, but it's not as big as the mainstream opportunity. We are absolutely going to focus on investing in that premium opportunity. It's very much about the big cities, the white-collar. It's going to be also about some of the premium parts of the stills categories, and we're going to go after that. But in the end, the biggest mass of consumers, the biggest mass of disposable income will be in the mainstream. So it will have to be a combination of, yes, addressing the premiums, but also going after the mainstream with a greater affordability, expanding the distribution reach, upgrading the execution into the third tier cities in the rural areas. That is also going to be a big driver of our revenue.","In terms of the categories, I think what has been going really well, by example, is we've taken an approach of premiumizing our water business in China. One of our most recent billion-dollar brands, (52:43) comes out of China effectively. And we're driving the business from a \u2013 in the end a 1 RMB price point to a 2 RMB price point. That's one of the biggest drivers of growth is the water at the 2 RMB. The places where we have a little tougher time is perhaps in the juice category, with sparkling in the middle.","Again, when you look at what's growing in terms of the categories, what you do see is it maps quite closely to the consumer segments in terms of who's suffering and who's not suffering in terms of disposable income. The juices, that were kind of ambient, that were more going to the rural areas, are being hit a little harder. The premium waters, which are perhaps more the cities, have been doing well.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Judy. On your second question about the structural impact, so we will obviously give more guidance on 2017 later as we get closer to the beginning of the year, but I will say that, particularly in North America refranchising, the impact will be significant in 2017, because as we are moving to get all of the refranchising completed in 2017, we will be moving more than we have moved in all of 2015 and 2016 combined. So it will be a large impact in 2017. And we will work to give you all more color on that later in the year or early 2017.","As far as 2018 is concerned, the refranchising will be done, but the impact will be basically the cycling of it, because, obviously, the timing of these transitions will be significant, not only to 2017, but also the impact it will have on 2018.","And then, we have some costs that we have to get out in 2018 that we will be working to get out in early 2018 that would be basically a function of the refranchising as well. So we'll give you more color as time passes.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thank you, James, Kathy and Tim. We're working aggressively to evolve our sparkling strategy and expand our brand portfolio in order to address changing consumer preferences. And we're on track with transforming our company to a higher margin, higher return business, focused on building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading a strong, dedicated global franchise system.","Looking forward, we remain confident that the long-term dynamics of our industry are promising.

Please look on our website for this information.","Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter volume performance came in below our expectations. There was a confluence of factors that negatively lead to unusually weak second quarter volume results. We continue to see further [unrest] in Europe slowing economic conditions across markets like Asia and Latin and social unrest in South East Europe, Middle East and Brazil.","On top of this we were faced with unusually widespread wet and cold weather conditions across the multiple regions, including North America and across Northern Europe and India all of which impacted the entire industry.","Consequently we grew global volume 1% in the second quarter leading to year to date volume growth of 3%. Our comparable currency neutral operating income excluding structural grew 5% year to date. And both in the quarter and year to date we gained global volume and value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages as well as in both sparkling and still beverages. These gains included volume and value share increases in corresponding juice, tea and water all of which underscored the real strength of our brands and the global reach of our system.","While we are not happy with our second quarter volume performance, I can ensure you that we are intensely focused on improving those areas we can control to ensure better performance in the second half of the year. Looking forward, we remain absolutely confident in our 2020 vision and in our system\u2019s ability to execute to grow and to create value all across the world.","As we\u2019ve also said during these challenging global economic times there will occasionally be a bump in the road and the real strength of a business is how you deal with that bump. In that respect together with our system bottling partners we continue to invest in our brand to strengthen our system for the future and to achieve our long term growth target. The fact that we\u2019ve outperformed the industry in this most recent quarter reinforces our belief that we are navigating these circumstances in a way that further strengthens our position of leadership within this extremely vibrant and resilient beverage industry.","Let me now provide you with an overview of our business performance by operating group starting with North America. In North America, volume declined 1% in the quarter as a 4% decline in sparkling beverages offset 5% volume growth in our still beverage portfolio. Year-to-date volume in North America was even. Prior to this quarter we consistently grew our business in North America for 12 consecutive quarters. Unfortunately, we experienced an extremely wet and cold second quarter with more rain in the US in June than we\u2019ve seen in 50 years and 44% more precipitation than in June of last year. This weather clearly impacted our entire industry\u2019s volume growth. Nevertheless we gained sparkling volume and value share both in the quarter and year to date reflecting the strength of our brand, and we have robust marketing plans in place for the balance of 2013.","Still beverages gained volume and value share in the quarter making this the 24th consecutive quarter that our still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained value share. Our growth in still beverages this quarter was led by strong performance across the ready to drink tea and packaged water categories with brands such as Gold Peak, smartwater and Dasani leading the way. Further, our volume and value share gains in the juices and juice drinks category were driven by solid growth for Simply and Minute Maid.","We are confident that we are on the right track in North America and we continue to work diligently with our bottlers as we advance our refranchising plan. Indeed, we saw a sequential improvement across the quarter in both the convenience retailer and quick service restaurant channel suggesting that the category trends are beginning to improve. While we do recognize that we still have work to do in North America, we remain laser focused on the strategy that we have shared with you.","First, we are building a balanced portfolio of strong brands led by Coca-Cola and ensuring that our portfolio remains relevant to all generations of consumers and across all beverage occasions. Second, we are focused on translating this brand value into unsurpassed customer value by delivering best in class customer service each and every single day. And third, we\u2019re continuously investing to build the capabilities we will need to sustain and to repeat our success. These strategies are taking a real hold and we are building on them with the evolution of the United States franchise system announced earlier this year. We therefore believe we are well positioned to continue outperforming the non-alcoholic ready to drink beverage industry for the balance of the year.","Turning now to Latin America, we grew volume 2% in the quarter and 3% year to date. Volume growth was a little softer in the quarter due to macroeconomic challenges in the few major markets, specifically increase in consumer debt levels and higher food inflations along with concern over transportation fees contributed to some civil unrest and softer consumer spending in Brazil. In Mexico, weaker job creation and higher inflation impacted disposable income resulting in reduced retail sales.","These macro factors led to low single digit volume growth in Mexico while volume results in Brazil were even. Given slower growth rate in personal consumption across the region, we estimate that year-to-date beverage industry growth rates are currently 1.5 to 2 percentage points lower than the average of the last four years in Latin America.","In the second quarter, we again gained volume share in Latin America in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages including both volume share gains in both sparkling and still beverages.","Moving to brand performance, trademark Coca-Cola grew 1% during the quarter and maintained volume share within the sparkling beverages category. These results reflect sustained marketing across the brand and the category. Our other sparkling brands grew volume and value share in the quarter as we expanded Mundet in Mexico and Fanta in Colombia while reigniting marketing behind Schweppes in both Brazil and Argentina.","High single digit growth in still beverages led to volume share gains in the quarter. These results were driven by the expansion of Fuze Tea, continued strong performance of Del Valle portfolio and strong share gains in POWERADE, thanks to superior execution of our programs. We expect that our Latin America group will return to rates of volume growth that we have been more accustomed to in the last few years given current dynamics.","Continued marketing and bottling investments along with solid execution plans for the second half of the year will also contribute to this improvement. I will bring my America\u2019s update to close by congratulating the associates of Solar, our new bottling partner in Brazil. With the close of this transaction, Solar forms the second largest operation in the Coca-Cola Brazil system serving over 70 million consumers.","Now, turning to Coca-Cola International starting with Europe. The weak economy continues to be a key factor affecting our performance in Europe especially in the southern regions where unemployment remains high while consumer confidence and expenditures remain low.","We\u2019re seeing this continue to play out across most fast moving consumer goods category with several of those slowing between the first and second quarter. Additionally, historically wet and cold conditions across Europe including the coldest spring for Germany in 40 years further dampens already weak consumer sentiment and industry trends and contributed to volume declining 3% in Germany in the quarter.","While our European volume fell 4% in the quarter and then down 2% year-to-date, we maintained the positive share momentum of the first quarter growing volume and value share across total nonalcoholic beverages and core sparkling beverages. Across the continent, our team and bottling partners are activating a number of marketing and trade execution program. Among them is our new Share a Coke, summer campaign launched across Europe in May and early signs are very positive.","In fact, excitement surrounding the launch helps to partially offset the impact to weather on immediate consumption. Our current European outlook remains cautious for the time being given ongoing macroeconomic conditions. However, we believe with our commitment to our brands and execution, we should continue to gain share through the remainder of the year.","Moving on to our Eurasia and Africa group, we achieved 9% volume growth in the quarter, up double digits year-to-date. All business units grew in the quarter with our Middle East and North Africa business unit as well as our Central, East and West Africa business unit delivering double-digit growth.","For the quarter, we strengthened our competitive position as we gain volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Local execution of our global marketing campaign along with continued highest pack innovation feels as good which was led by brand Coca-Cola up 7% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date.","Fanta and Sprite further contributed to core sparkling growth while our still brands grew double digits led by Rani, Crystal and Fuze Tea. Volume in Russia grew 3% with trademark Coca-Cola up double digits. The successful sparkling promotion fueled Coca-Cola Fanta and Sprite growth as consumers collected under the cap points to obtain a limited edition set of limited Winter Olympic glassware. In Spain and Portugal we are encouraged by the early integration efforts underway at efforts underway at Coca-Cola Iberian partners of Spain and Portugal. We now have eight bottlers in those markets now operating as a single entity.","Shifting to our Pacific group, we saw a volume growth of 2% and we maintained on our alcoholic ready to drink value share. As is well publicized, China\u2019s economy has been slowed as this is now being soft consumer spending. China\u2019s first half retail sales was the slowest in 10 years while much of the growth in the non-alcoholic ready to drink beverage industry in the second quarter came from the value oriented water category. As a result, our volume performance in China remains softened with even for the quarter cycling 7% growth from prior year. We command a leadership position in China in those (inaudible) and market share in sparkling as well as in juices and juice drink.","Sparkling volume grew 2% and our juices and juice drinks volume grew 7% year to date. This is driven by a solid execution of key consumer and commercial initiatives and continue our new product innovation. Looking forward, we are keenly focused on adjusting our strategies and improving our business in China. We recently strengthened our management team in that region adding to the already strong talents that we have in China and we are evolving our strategy, reallocating resources across our brand portfolio and strengthening our consumer communication. We anticipate a return to growth in our China business in the second half of the year.","In India, volume grew low single digits in the quarter cycling 20% growth last year and importantly we again improved our volume and value share of total non-alcoholic beverages as well as sparkling and still beverages further strengthening our competitive position as trademark Coca-Cola grew by double digit.","Our business in Japan delivered 1% volume growth while approximately 4% growth last year and we are seeing sequential improvements on share trends as we are moving through the year. Japan sparkling beverage volume grew 1% in the quarter supported by music team integrated marketing campaign such as the Zero Limit Campaign for Coca-Cola Zero up 13%.","Solid growth in tea and sport drinks of 3% and 7% respectively also contributed to this momentum. Our juice and coffee performance was below our expectation and we are keenly focused on strategies as new launches to improve performance in the second half of the year. I do want to acknowledge and congratulate our Coca-Cola East Japan associates on the successful completion of their merger and the launch of their company on July 1. With this merger our system is building on a deep root and 50 year history of strong partnerships in Japan. Coca-Cola East Japan will be well positioned to meet the business growth needs of our customers while also engaging and refreshing consumers of all ages and lifestyle.","Lastly our Asia\u2019s business unit delivered results with 10% volume growth cycling double digit growth from the previous year as Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam all delivered strong double digit growth. Going forward we expect to see an improvements in our Pacific group\u2019s performance in the second half of the year.","On a global scale, we were recently humbled by several accolades, including rising to number five on Behrens list both world\u2019s most respected companies and receiving the 2013 Creative Marketer of the Year Award at the Cannes Lions International Festival.","In my 35 years of experience in the Coca-Cola system, I\u2019ve learnt that we -- how we participate in one of the fastest growing and most dynamic industries in the world. As I think about the second quarter, nothing has changed in our ability to continue winning in this industry. There is no question. There are systems commitment to superior execution with stronger than ever before and our business fundamentals remain firmly intact.","Our leadership team is firmly in place and I am confident in our ability to capitalize on the abundant opportunities that lie ahead. Given this we\u2019re confident that we have the right strategy, we have the right vision and the right initiatives to drive long-term sustainable growth and value.","And our focus on achieving our 2020 Vision is unwavering with current dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be better in the back half of the year. Why? Quite simply a few important reasons. First, our global brands are stronger than ever and we will continue to invest in them to capture long-term volume and value share.","Second, we have an unparallel global business system focused on delivering on our 2020 Vision.","And third, we have great confidence in our plans and we will sharpen our focus to ensure our resources are directed to those strategic priorities that will drive our business and strengthen key markets will return to grow.","The nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry is and has always -- and always will be a terrific, terrific business. We will continue to capitalize on our unprecedented global reach, a broad portfolio of preferred premium brands and superior system execution.","And we continue to invest alongside our global bottling partners. And we are well positioned to effectively manage our business for long-term profitable growth both in today\u2019s economic environments and also as we look forward to our future.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Fayard","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. As Muhtar has shared, the industry clearly slowed a little due a number of factors that impacted various markets around the world. The combination of these factors resulted in weaker volume performance in the second quarter than we expected. At the same time we recognize the need for improved performance in certain markets.","Having said that, we remain absolutely focused on doing the right things for the long-term health of the business and investing for long-term sustainable growth. Increasing share during times like this further strengthens our position and can ultimately lead to accelerated growth as market conditions normalize. And we continue to win on this front gaining both global volume and value share in both total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, as well as volume and value share in global sparkling and still beverages.","So, let\u2019s review our results in more detail, starting with the review of the key drivers of our financial performance. Our second quarter and year-to-date financial performance reflects concentrate sales growth in line with unit case, volume growth, as well as a strong increase in direct marketing expenses, as we sustain our commitment to invest in the health and the strength of our brands.","From an operating segment standpoint, our operating income growth this quarter reflected strong profit growth in Latin America and Eurasia, and Africa, as well as the continued solid financial performance of the Bottling Investments Group. Operating income in North America and Pacific was even while Europe experienced a slight decline in profit.","Comparable currency neutral net revenue declined 1% this quarter and we were even year-to-date. However, excluding the impact of structural items, primarily the sale of the Philippines bottler, net revenues increased 2% both for the quarter and year-to-date.","We continue to earn pricing in the marketplace, but at a consolidated level the positive pricing was offset by the impact of geographic mix, resulting in even price mix for both the quarter and year-to-date.","Although geographic mix unfavorably impacted price mix at the consolidated level, it contributed to the improvement of our gross margin in the quarter and year-to-date. Our comparable gross margin was 61.2%. This represents a slight improvement compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of geographic mix, structural items and our foreign currency hedging program. As we shared in our first-quarter earnings call we expect our gross margin to moderate somewhat over the remainder of this year, primarily due to a shift in geographic mix.","Excluding the impact of structural items, we achieved 2 points of favorable operating expense leverage for both the quarter and year-to-date and we now expect to achieve low single-digit operating expense leverage for the full year. On comparable currency neutral operating income, it was up 4% this quarter and year-to-date. Excluding the impact of structural items, operating income grew 5% year to date.","On a comparable basis, the impact of currency was a 3% headwind on this quarter\u2019s operating income results. And based on our hedge positions, current spot rate and the cycling of our prior year rates, we expect currencies to be a 4% headwind on our operating income for the third quarter and full year. Below the line, we benefited from an increase in net interest income and improved tax rate and fewer shares outstanding due to our continued share repurchase program.","We expect net interest income in the second half of the year to be relatively in line with comparable net interest income year-to-date. Additionally, we now expect our full year tax rate to be 23% and we expect to hold this rate through 2014.","Comparable earnings-per-share grew 4% in the second quarter despite currency headwinds of approximately 2%. Year-to-date comparable earnings-per-share also grew 4% despite currency headwinds of approximately 4% as well as the impact of two fewer selling days. We continue to generate a strong 4 billion from cash from operations year-to-date providing a significant financial flexibility. As I have shared with you over the years we redeploy our cash flows utilizing a consistent and disciplined framework.","First is to reinvest back into the business and to strengthen our global system. Secondly to continue to expand our portfolio and capabilities through bolt-on acquisitions and partnerships. Third, continue to return cash to shareholders through our dividends and we increased our dividend 10% in 2013, our 51st consecutive year of dividend increases. And lastly, repurchase shares, year-to-date our net share repurchases totaled $2 billion and we continue to expect full year share repurchase to be between 3 billion and 3.5 billion.","As you model our 2013 operating results, let me again remind you that the steps we\u2019ve taken along with our bottling partners to strengthen our global system will have a structural impact on our operating results over the remainder of the year. As you are aware, we closed the transaction in the Philippines earlier this year and the merger of our bottling partners in Brazil and Japan recently closed.","As I have shared in our 2012 year-end call, we do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on our 2013 earnings results. However these transactions will impact various line items within our P&L. We anticipate that these transactions will have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenues. Likewise our full year operating income results should see a 1% structural impact. However there should be a corresponding improvement in our equity income to account for our share of the results of these operations moving forward. Additionally, the structural impact from these transactions will be larger in the second half due to the impact of the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations beginning in the third quarter.","In closing, we delivered solid financial performance for the first two quarters of 2013, and we expect to continue our solid financial performance during the second half of this year. Our company and our system are well-positioned to capitalize on the real opportunities for growth. We remain very confident as we continue to win in the marketplace with volume and value share. We continue to deliver solid financial results. We continue to innovate and invest in our brands. Our global system continues to get stronger. And we are best positioned to continue factoring growth in the dynamic nonalcoholic ready-to-drink industry.","Operator, we are now ready for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question today is from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Good morning, everybody. Muhtar, I was hoping if you could step around the world and dive a little bit deeper in the certain markets and regions to help us separate out the impact of non-recurring factors that hit your second quarter versus any macro-related factors that can continue to pressure the business in the second half.","You had mentioned macro factors in Brazil, Mexico, Europe and China. Will those continue to be as big an impact in the second half of the second quarter and if not, why and then maybe you can help quantify maybe what you think the weather-related impact was in the second quarter?","Muhtar Kent","Hi Bill. Thanks. I think overall both from in Europe, United States, India and some other parts we did have a pretty significant impact from weather, unusual weather, monsoons coming very early in India, as you probably all read, many thousands missing in flooding, worst flooding since the Tsunami back 10 years ago. And in Europe also, Central Europe, Germany, all the issues around the river beds rising and flooding and very heavy wet conditions.","So we did, yeah, have impact both from a consumer sentiment, both from a mobility sentiment in the United States also, and both also from just pure in some cases distribution issues that hindered our performance. And as you know, when we lose a sale that does not recur any more we lost it that day.","And so and also in some cases, we were cycling very unusually warm and favorable weather conditions from prior years in some cases. Like India last year, the monsoons actually started later that gave us a 20% growth in India unusual for the second quarter in India, usually the first half in India is always less than the second half in India because of the anomalies of the weather.","So, yeah and then macro conditions, we all have felt it in social issues in Southeast Europe, the demonstrations across the Middle East and then more recently in Brazil. But we feel confident both in terms of looking at our plans in place, looking at current dynamics at both Brazil will have a better second half. China will have a better second half, Russia will have a better second half and certainly better quarters than this last quarter where we grew volume 3% overall, Mexico as well as India.","So while we continue to invest in our brands, our brands are stronger than ever before. We have taken market share, our system is stronger. Hence all these key markets we believe will perform better in the second half. In fact, as I said, we have seen this -- we always know that the second half in a country like India is significantly better than the first half. In any case, if you look back at our performance over last few years.","So, and then in the United States, I think we\u2019ve got very robust plans to return back to growth. So I -- we feel pretty confident that this was a confluence of events that happened all at the same time, the portfolio effect of our global business did not work in our favor in this particular case in the second quarter. And I feel -- and my colleagues feel and our bottlers feel very confident.","I have been across many markets recently. I have traveled to China, Japan, Thailand, Myanmar, many other parts of Asia. I have been in the Southeast Europe. I have been in France and all in the last sort of four-five weeks. And I feel that we will look towards definitely a better quarter volumetrically. And again, we can talk to you about how we feel about the financial numbers too later in the call. And I can ask Gary to reflect on that too in terms of the second half. You want to -- Gary?","Gary Fayard","Sure. Well, let me continue on then, versus the volume. On the second half, on the P&L, I think we had a very solid first half. We would expect to have a solid second half of the year as well. We have said there\u2019d bumps along the road, the industry had one and obviously it slowed but we continue to take share and we feel very confident about the second half. As we look at the second half financial results I think we will be very close to our long-term growth targets, particularly in volume and earnings per share should be coming back in line with what we would all have been expecting at the first of this year.","Muhtar Kent","I\u2019d just add, Bill, that I think this is more an anomaly. We should not see this as a trend or a systemic issue and that is simply how I believe one should think about it. And again, I can ask Steve and Ahmet to reflect upon how they see the second half from their vantage point in both Americas and international maybe Steve, you can start.","Steve Cahillane ","Sure, thanks Muhtar. Starting with Latin America, Muhtar said it well, we saw things in Brazil that we hadn\u2019t seen before, the economy slowed, there were social unrest. It didn\u2019t last very long, things are slowly getting back to normal and we expect a better performance sequentially as we progress through the year in Brazil and in Mexico. In Latin center and south Latin we\u2019ve seen very good results, high single digit result continues. So there is a lot still going very well that continue to go well in Latin America and Brazil and Mexico getting back to what we would expect to see on a normal basis.","In North America, Muhtar said it, we don't like to talk about the weather but the first half of last year saw unusually good weather conditions. We had a warm weather, we had dry weather coming out of winter and going into spring. This year in North America we had some of the worst weather and you\u2019ve all seen it, it\u2019s been very wet, it's been very cold, it\u2019s been historically wet and cold which obviously impacts our business. On top of that, we had the payroll tax effects which started at the beginning of the year which affects lower income households obviously much more, affects their disposable income, their ability to spend, we saw late payroll tax -- late payroll or tax refund coming into the marketplace. But as we look forward we expect the weather patterns to obviously normalize. The weather will not continue to be a factor in a country as big as the United States like it\u2019s been and from an economic standpoint, people are used to the payroll tax now. They\u2019ve had four to five months to moderate their household budget to get used to it. The refunds, obviously is back in the marketplace and we\u2019re already starting to see better trends in QSR, better trends in convenience retail, better trends across our business.","So we look forward to the second half of the year across the Americas much more favorably than the first half, Muhtar used the word anomaly, I think especially an anomaly in North America and we see ourselves coming out of that.","Ahmet Bozer","Thanks, Steve, thanks Muhtar. Yeah just to build further on Muhtar\u2019s comments, I will start with India, that\u2019s definitely completely weather-related. All our investments in the route to market, coolers and capabilities will continue to deliver the kind of levels that we\u2019re used to having from India in the rest of the year. So we\u2019re quite comfortable on that.","On China, there were probably impacts of -- as you hear the continuing slowdown in macro levels as well as there were some weather impacts. But we do expect volume to return for a number of reasons. First of all, China is a country with very, very low per capitas. I have been there a number of times in the last three, four months and we have been working on evolving our strategy with better OBPPC, more price points and more packs as well as improving our capability. As Muhtar mentioned, we have recently strengthened our management team there and I am very confident that in the second half of the year we\u2019re going to start returning to growth in China, maybe not at the levels of double-digit that you might have been seeing but we\u2019ll certainly be looking to returning to growth in China.","Now the other anomaly in the international results was Europe. I can comfortably say that a very, very big part of that 4% decline was driven by unseasonable weather as it has already been mentioned. It shows the strength of our system that we were able to gain volume and value share in both sparkling and NARTD and as we see whether normalizing, we again look forward to coming back to our normal range of growth in Europe. The rest of international territories such as EAG continue to deliver the historical growth rate.","Gary Fayard","And Bill, this is Gary. Just add one or two other quick data points as well. When we talk about 1% volume, I think you have to wonder, is that a weak one or a strong one. Let me just assure you it\u2019s as strong as it can be and still be 1%. So that\u2019s number one.","The other thing is we talk about some of these anomalies in some of these markets. One other things that give me some confidence as well, because there has been a lot of discussion about what\u2019s happening with the emerging markets and all around the world with the slowdown from China, et cetera. But we\u2019ve always talked about the markets where the per capita consumption is less than $150 has always been a real strength of ours.","Well, again, even in the second quarter, if you look at those markets under $150 and exclude China and India, which we\u2019ve just discussed separately, if you excluded those, our volume in those markets was plus 7% in the second quarter, so it still shows underlying strength of the market in those emerging markets.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Great. Thanks for the comprehensive answers.","Gary Fayard","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Gary, I just want to ask a clarification about the back half of the year. Your commentary on the financials, it sounds like you are saying, you are going to get to that level in the back half of the year not the back half of the year will get you to the long-term algorithm for the full year. At least that\u2019s how I interpreted it, can you just sort of clarify that?","Gary Fayard","Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. Here is how we\u2019d say, we are actually very close in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, if you look at operating income, I think, year-to-date, ex-structural currency neutral is plus 5% and our volume is plus 3%. So we are not that far away. So our view would be that we should be and that in fact, year-to-date earnings per share ex-currency is 8%, rounds up to 8%. So we\u2019re not that far away in the first half.","That\u2019s why I was saying solid results and when I say solid, I think you followed us long enough. We like to be at the top end of ranges and not at the bottom end of ranges. Unfortunately, we are at bottom end right now, but that\u2019s the world we are dealing with. But we feel very good about the second half.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Okay.","Muhtar Kent","John, this is Muhtar. Just one point that I can add to that is the following. It\u2019s customary sometimes that when in the kind of businesses that we are in, when you have a blip in your volume because of a confluence of events some of which are -- was not in your control. The first thing you do is go out and cut marketing, and I think if you look at our numbers, we have continued to invest aggressively in our brand through the second quarter, through the first -- in the first half and as you know every investment and marketing does not pay back in that quarter, it pays back in future quarters.","And therefore we are confident there was a share gain. We are confident with the strength of our brands, we are confident about the metrics on our brands, both sparkling and stills across the world.","We are confident in our bottling partners\u2019 investment plan that are taking place in the second quarter that we can continue our momentum going into the second half of the year and also improve on it volumetrically, but also continue with our mission to achieve our 2020 Vision through the next years ahead.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Got it. Okay. Thanks. Then my actual question here was, Gary, you\u2019ve got positive price mix in the vast, I think in every region this quarter, with the exception of specific I think in, yet it\u2019s not sort of going up to full positive price mix here. How do we view the regional price mix versus the geographic offset and how does this fit into your long-term algorithm, because it\u2019s seems like this is something that\u2019s most likely going to continue to be a notable overhang? Thanks.","Gary Fayard","Okay. John, first, I want to compliment on your creativity with that first question and here is a real question, anyway. It\u2019s great question actually. And the first thing I would say around pricing is, we believe strongly that we have premium brands and our brand should commend a premium in the market and they do commend a premium across the world. Number one, we're seeing pricing is rational and within the industry we think pricing is rational particularly in the United States.","But if you look at price mix and I am going to go year to date, but the second quarter is essentially the same thing. If you look at price mix, price mix year-to-date is even but within that, you've got positive pricing and you\u2019ve got negative geographic mix. So year to date consolidated we actually have positive 1% pricing. If you look at it by region, year-to-date North America has positive pricing up 1%. Eurasia and Africa have positive piping up 8%, Europe has -- looks like positive pricing up 2% although I will tell you a lot of that is because of Innocent and our acquisition of the Innocent, so absent Innocent, Europe is closer to flat. Latin America is positive 8 points of pricing year to date. Pacific is even and Bottling Investments group is plus 2 as well.","So we\u2019re actually getting very nice positive pricing as well as category mix, brand mix, channel mix. All of those things are working. What\u2019s happening to us and where the dent comes in, if you will, is that we got negative geographic mix. So we\u2019ve got significant negative geographic mix across many of those regions which brings us back to even when you put price and geography together overall at the consolidated level. As I have often said, geographic mix would -- is always going to be probably negative because you're going to expect those emerging market countries to be growing faster than the developed market countries and you got better pricing in the developed market countries. What amplified a little bit this quarter particularly perfectly was the result in Europe that we talked about and North America being coming at even where they were. So you put all that together, we\u2019re actually getting the kind of pricing, we would expect to be getting in the market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","I just wanted to go back to the second half expectations and clearly you can\u2019t control the macros and the weather. But I just like to hear a little bit more specifically on some of the actions that you're doing to improve the volume performance, particularly markets like China where there is the macro issue but there is also competitive issue, there\u2019s also portfolio issues just in terms of not participating in some of the fast growth segments. So can you just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about marketing investments, how you\u2019re thinking about your portfolio? Can you accelerate price pack architecture strategy more aggressively to really get the volume performance even if the macros don\u2019t come back and the weather continues to be challenging?","Muhtar Kent","Judy, let me just take on that and I will ask Ahmet Bozer to comment. But I think what we have said again is that it was a coming together of many events that usually don\u2019t come together all the time. I mean -- we have performed overall globally at rates that are much more commensurate to what you have been used to in the last three, four years. Despite the fact that we\u2019ve had issues, some of these issues happening to us from quarter to quarter. But you haven\u2019t felt them because -- because of the fact that the portfolio works. In this time, you have the issues in Latin America, in the two key markets Brazil and Mexico on slowing down and also consumer spending being impacted because of the Brazilian crunch in consumer credit that was taken away from the consumers. And generally the consumer spending went away and then you also had China -- the issues in China that was -- consumer spending is actually much below GDP levels and that\u2019s documented across the macro numbers in China as well as the weather issues related to India and also other issues coming together in North America where it went for the first time in 12 quarters from a plus to a negative, which we don't expect. All of these things we don't expect to continue at the same time. Some of these things may still continue to impact them. Therefore the portfolio will work.","Now related -- specific to the China. We are participating in two great categories in China and where the leaders which is sparkling and juices, those categories we\u2019ve grown in. And they are adding tremendous value to our portfolio and to our business in China.","We have also as we said retargeting all our efforts in China, refocusing all our efforts. Yeah, there is a different competitive landscape. We feel that actually that has not been the issue for us.","The main issue for us is to ensure that we can continue to distribute in outlying areas in China that we have had some issues and we\u2019re correcting those and also that our marketing and working which we feel definitely our brands are stronger. Our innovation pipeline is working in terms of what we are providing to the consumer, also in terms of packaging. And we feel that our confidence that those two categories -- playing in those two categories and then also innovating across some other categories like dairy is going to create the growth and the value for us starting in the second quarter but also continuing.","And we also feel confident that the Chinese leadership, the new Chinese leadership are going to ensure that they take the right actions and we\u2019re seeing that to reposition and transform the economy without creating a major bump as they transform the economy from a purely export economy to a more balanced economy with also consumer spending. And both deputy prime -- Vice Premier Yang in charge of the economy as well as the new team, we feel confident have the plans in place to ensure that that takes place. So again, Ahmet, you can reflect more on that as well as any other markets you want to.","Ahmet Bozer","Yeah. Thanks Muhtar. Thanks Judy for the question. A couple of messages here Judy, message number one is that economy may be down but the globe prospects in China even in the short term is there simply because of the very low level of capitals and strength of our system. Plan number two, if you look at all the competitors in China, nobody really participate in all the categories. All the players have one or two categories that they are strong in. And then they drive their businesses through those categories and maybe expand into others.","Our position is the same. So our strategy basically, first of all, we definitely can do better in the categories that we already exist such as sparkling. So to give you some specific actions, we\u2019re taking to do that. I have highlighted the [LBTC] and that\u2019s actually accelerated. We have pilots running on various multi-serve and single serve packages for different price points in different parts of China. And as those things roll out of the pilot, we\u2019ll be rolling some of them nationally. So those are already in a way in the market and they will be accelerated into the second quarter.","We\u2019ve also re-looked at our communication strategies and we\u2019re going to be communicating more intensely on the intrinsics of our products as well as extrinsics. You might have heard about our nickname promotions that the similar promotion to the Share a Coke promotion around the world outset which is getting incredibly positive reaction from the consumer. And all the other things of improving our route to markets et cetera, those are all under way and we\u2019re very confident that that\u2019s going to give us our strength in sparkling.","Now, we also play in juices as you know and as Muhtar mentioned, we\u2019re the number one player there. We are refocusing our efforts back around Pulpy. And we\u2019re just looking at an extension of that into mango which is getting very strong consumer reaction. So as we consolidate our efforts behind that, you would see a continued increase.","Now, obviously, we\u2019re not only focused on just our existing categories, we have a pretty successful brand in Super Milky Pulpy which is a value-added dairy. And we\u2019re beginning to increase our focus on that. And we\u2019re getting high single digits growth of that brand. And we are building our innovation pipeline for the future.","So it\u2019s a fairly robust strategy and yeah, under lower economic environment, we might have lower growth rates than what you\u2019re used to. But we are ever strengthening our position in China to capitalize on this market for not just immediate future but to very long term.","Muhtar Kent","We have Irial also, which oversees bottling investment group. And as you know, we are one of the three system players in China in terms of bottling maybe Irial you can comment on what you are seeing down very close to the ground.","Irial Finan","Yeah. Judy, good morning. And just to build on something Muhtar said earlier which is around investment and I will tell you from a bottling perspective that we continue to invest heavily in the market, and particularly in our execution capability and route to market capability and critically in developing the talent to be successful in the next years ahead. So when you [ask all] today, we vitalize marketing strategies, OBPPC, I actually feel very confident about the future. Yes, Yes, we may have bumps along the way but our business is growing -- our challenge is to grow healthy long term business and I think from a bottling perspective, we\u2019re really putting in place the infrastructure and capability to really drive a success for the future and -- that\u2019s basically where I leave at.","Muhtar Kent","Yeah, what I would just say finally is I wouldn\u2019t read anything more in this than what it is. As Gary said earlier, we were fractionally away from rounding up to 2 and we could -- it would not have been hard for us to do something which would not be right for this business and take the volume up to 3 and selling low cheap product. That is not what we are about. We are about investing, we are about doing the right things for this business and we are about -- and I have always said, there may be bump along the road, and at one bump along that we have grown this business consistently in line every year on an annual basis since 2008 on our way to our 2020 vision in the range and the upper range of our long-term growth plan despite very, very challenging macroeconomic conditions and that is going to happen in 2013 also.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Just two quick questions, what are the trends like recently? It seems like you\u2019re pretty bullish in the back half. So as you exited June and got into July, it looks like some of the weather normalized. So what are you seeing more recently? And then kind of minutia but the big margin decline percentage year over year in Europe, what\u2019s the primary driver of that?","Muhtar Kent","Yeah let me just comment on what you just said. We are not -- this is not about managing on a day -- yet we manage this business on an hourly basis, so it\u2019s not I think healthy to comment on what has happened in the last two weeks. Yes, of course, we expect the weather to normalize. As you -- or whoever is in the Northeast now, and whoever was in the West Coast of the United States in the last 10 days, you know that weather -- it has -- it does normalize. Matter of fact, that\u2019s the probability and statistics. So it just happened all in a very short period of time where everything was negative in many major markets. And it will normalize and that\u2019s what we are saying, part of what we are saying. So I have every confidence that -- the normalized conditions as I said we will again -- 2013 will be another year when volume will grow at the range of the long term growth model.","As far as the margins are concerned, I will turn it over to Gary in terms of the margin is concerned, what you mentioned in terms of the margin numbers in Europe.","Gary Fayard","Yeah, in Europe its structural anomaly, it\u2019s actually Innocent. So when the juice business, juice having lower margin when it came in, that\u2019s what changed the margin. Just nothing more than that.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","I got you. But so they should be down going forward though because of that -- because of Innocent is now fully consolidated?","Gary Fayard","Yes. And that\u2019s actually the flip side, if you will, of what I said when I was answering John\u2019s question that if you look at the price inside of price mix in Europe it\u2019s actually plus two but it\u2019s really Innocent giving us a lift on price but it gives us opposite effect on the margin.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","So it\u2019s something like a dollar margin perspective, it\u2019s almost neutral but the percentage has changed because of the price?","Gary Fayard","Yes, exactly right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Gary, just a question for you related to share repurchases. With the stock the way it's performed in the second quarter, did you accelerate or do anything different in terms of timing of maybe pulling forward share repurchases? And then I mean the business right now is kind of bouncing around the low end of your algorithm and the stock is kind of bouncing around in a pretty tight range here recently. So is there any consideration to maybe even buying back more stock than you originally planned just because you\u2019ve got an opportunity to buy it here at around the $40 level?","Gary Fayard","Yeah. Great question, Bryan. Well, first you\u2019ll see that we did accelerate purchases in the first half of the year. As I said, if our annual target was in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range and we actually have repurchased $2 billion in the first half, we did exactly what you said and we accelerated in the first half of the year. Where we are right now is we\u2019re sticking with the annual target which we originally set at $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And I just tell you we\u2019ll give you an update on that at the end of the third quarter.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Okay. But not out of the realm of possibility that you could go higher if you chose to\u2026","Gary Fayard","I have learnt to never say never to anything.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","All right. Thank you.","Gary Fayard","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Yeah. Good morning everyone. Muhtar or Gary, question on the gross margin evolution. I think I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like one of the silver linings here is that the price pack architecture work you\u2019ve been doing over several years has allowed you to put up a pretty decent gross margin number and offset some of the corresponding earnings discipline that comes from the revenues being what they were in the quarter.","If that is a fair assessment, can you give us a bit of an update on what\u2019s going on in terms of innovation, not in terms of the price, the pack but in terms of what\u2019s really in the bottle, because that seems to be one of the problems you are facing kind of from a larger share performance absolute NARTD performance perspective?","Gary Fayard","Okay. Perhaps Mark, let me take the margin question and then we can come back to the innovation question. But this is actually -- let me get back into actually what I talked about price mix and margins when I was talking about (inaudible). The same thing applies actually at a higher level for the total company. So what we\u2019ve got is very positive pricing and you\u2019re seeing that and that being offset by geographic mix.","But what you\u2019re seeing is when an operation like North America is minus one in the quarter that actually -- this is counter intuitive but it actually improves margins, okay, because North America having the finished product business has lower margins. So our expectation is, number one, to continue to get positive pricing and we\u2019re going to be rational in pricing and we intend to say premium, as I said earlier.","But in addition to that, we expect North America\u2019s performance to improve in the second half of the year which will actually put pressure on margins which is why we said earlier that we would expect gross margins to moderate over the second half of the year. And it\u2019s really the geographic mix of where the income is coming from. Does that \u2026","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","It does, yeah, but absolutely the geographic headwind is where at it is.","Gary Fayard","Yeah.","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. I mean also on innovation I think, as we\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t look at innovation only as ingredients. We look at it as packaging ingredients, equipment, even in terms of marketing social media, the brand price pack channel, architecture, occasion architecture. All of that is working for us and also in terms of our new campaign to be part of the solution around the world working closely with local governments, national governments, working with Government of Mexico, working with Mayors in Chicago and San Antonio, other parts of the United States in different states in Atlanta.","You can look at the patents that we\u2019ve been filing off recent. So we are working and freestyle and the next generation of what is behind -- what\u2019s coming next after that. We are working on a host of new innovation. So also ingredients, continue to work with our partnerships across the world in different incubators around the world. The best we always believe here in the Coca-Cola Company, the best ideas are outside.","So, the plant bottle came from the outside from one of the incubators in India. Many new ideas are coming from different incubators in Israel or in China or in Japan or in Latin America. We have many -- we have substantial partnerships from here with the University of Georgia to across many institutions around the world in Techno Parks. So, yeah, we are very active and we are content that we have the right pipeline and maybe I can ask Steve to reflect on from just a sort of North America and Americas perspective.","Steve Cahillane","Yeah. Thanks, Muhtar. From a -- starting with the Latin America perspective, we have got Coca-Cola Light which we are picking up in Argentina, which we\u2019re excited about watching the prospects of that. We are doing some terrific innovation around our I Lohas platform in juices in Latin American, as well as in North America, we have launched Fruitwater, brand new product off to a very good start. Powerade Zero drops have joined Dasani drops is a very exciting innovation. (Inaudible) active which is a fusion between sports drink and energy kicked off in April, again off to a very good start.","From a packaging perspective, we continue to innovate around our price-package architecture. We\u2019ve just launched 16 ounce sparkling IT cans in our major packages. We have got Taylor Swift slim cans coming into the marketplace. We have got 19.2 ounce sparkling cans coming into the marketplace, again lots of excitement around the packaging innovation.","In terms of some marketing innovation, we have got Coke Zero which is going to be launched in college game day this fall which we are very excited about. We have got Cappy Free, Coke Zero coming into the marketplace. We feel very good about that, really building out the Coke Zero platform as an all-day brand.","So we have got lots in the marketplace and lots more coming into the marketplace, and it builds on one of Muhtar's earlier points that throughout this rough period of time, we have continued our marketing pressure. We continued our marketing investment. We have not cut it, we have increased it and it allows us to continue to innovate and bring new innovation into the marketplace.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","That's helpful. If I could simply follow up on the subject of a stevia-based sweetener in the brand on the door so to speak, Coca-Cola we have seen what you have said recently about globally ticking down, the portion of your volume that is in the full cal portion of your business. Should we infer here that there is an increased resolve to use organic sweeteners against the main brand here and there is some optimism globally for that potential?","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. I\u2019ll just comment on that that I think, it is all about ensuring that you provide the right portions at the right time for the right consumers in the right environment. And we -- I think that you should read that we have an increased resolve to use any specific ingredient. It is all about ensuring that we do have viable light and low-calorie versions for everyone of our major brands available to the consumer, ensure that we pack label transparently, ensure that we have active lifestyle programs as per all our global commitments and ensure that we have a responsible marketing. That's our -- those are full commitment.","And our business, we have said many times, is about brand. Today, we have $16 billion brands, they are growing. We have in the pipeline another 19 brands that are bigger than $750 million in revenue and less than a $1 billion. Those all are going to become billion dollar brands in the next increment of time because they are growing and we are confident that we will have multiple billion -- more billion dollar brands than we have today. And I think that is what this business is all about, adding value through brands to our system and I\u2019m confident that you will see us add many more billion dollar brands to our roster in the near future.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus","Great. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Hi, guys. So I think the general theme of my couple of question is really we are all trying to figure out, which is what's going to get better from here and why, and not only in terms of volume but also in terms of some of the other key drivers of profitability.","So, if I may, my first question is around North America, and although you say in the press release you remain committed to rationale pricing, price mix is only at 1% and I guess, you think volumes would have been down more than negative 4%, if you have taken more than 1% pricing.","So taking 2% to 3% pricing or can we hope for that part of the business, the pricing in North America improving going forward? And as a follow up to that and a completely different per cap market like China, moving up to Ahmet point second ago. I just want to get a better sense of if evolving a strategy has anything to do with increased price promotion as well as it sometimes does with some companies?","Muhtar Kent","Steve do you want\u2026","Steve Cahillane","Yeah. Thanks, Ali. I\u2019ll start. In terms of pricing, we\u2019ve always said that our pricing strategy in North America is consumer based and it continues to be consumer based. We captured, if you look at Nielsen, we captured very good pricing across our portfolio in North America. We think it was an appropriate amount of pricing by channel.","The unfortunate 4% volume decline was, as we said, had a lot more to do with weather and the economy, at least 60% to 70% having to do with a one-time really poor weather events. So, we didn\u2019t put more price in the marketplace to try and chase volume that wasn\u2019t there. We put appropriate price increases in the marketplace and we maintained our margins and we maintained our price strategy going forward.","And we continue to bring new products and new packages into the marketplace to help our whole architecture achieve the type of pricing that we deserve. And we have given some examples of this in the past and a good one is our 1.25 liter which continues to be very successful, a third of the 1.25 liter volume is in fact incremental volumes.","So it's good in of itself, but it has also allowed us, if you look at our 2 liter pricing over the course of the past 12, 15 months, we are out of the $0.99 price promotion for 2 liter and has been for quite some time.","So, we are not going to, we are not going to put too much price in the marketplace. We take appropriate price based on what the consumer and what is right for the consumer and what is right for the customer, and we fully expect that based on the price plans we have in place for the back half of the year, based on the innovations we have on the back half of the year that\u2019s sparkling volume will in fact improve from what happened in the second quarter.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Okay.","Gary Fayard","Yeah. Ali, I\u2019d move on to your question on China. The answer is, there is absolutely no plans for increased price promotion. In fact, the reason for having an evolving OBPPC is to have more sustained volumes at the right price point and the right tax for all the consumers.","Now, to give you an example, you might be familiar that there has been a lot of upsizing going on in China and we have launched our 300 ml package last year. Now, we will tactically respond to such upsizing to be able to balance our volume and share performance. But that\u2019s a -- those are limited practical moves rather than a strategy to have increased price promotions. So, that's not really in the cards.","Now, to maybe build on this a little bit and also to address some of innovation questions, I didn\u2019t have a chance to share, is that, we have small can, either slim can or sleek can and small PET lounges all across the international territory, all across Europe, all across Eurasia-Africa Group and some of the Pacific markets. That, I believe, is an important innovation in a way and also allows us to drive revenue and gross margin.","In addition to that, let also keep in mind that we have some very successful products such as Pulpy that hasn't been fully launched in all of our international territory. Eurasia-Africa Group, for example have taken that and they have launched it in Morocco in a very short period of time, we were able to achieve 20 plus percent market share with that launch.","We've just had a recent launch of extensions of coffee into PET in Japan in the CVS channel recruiting female consumers. We are quite happy and pleased with the results of that. We have been innovating energy drinks in Russia and Turkey by expanding them into PET packages, re-sealable PET packages that the consumers want. So, we continue to innovate in different packages, different categories across our international territory, as well as using successful innovation from the previous years.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson, Irial, Steve, Ahmet and Gary. Our business continues to grow and to capture global volume and value share even in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. And importantly, we do not manage our business for the short-term but rather for the medium and long-term. And as I mentioned earlier, our focus on achieving our 2020 Vision is unwavering with current dynamics leading us to believe that our performance will be better in the back half of this year and beyond. As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections please disconnect at this time.","All participants will be on listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call. I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations Department if they have any questions.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge you may now begin.","Tim Leveridge","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I am here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.","We've posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investors section of our company website. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles. Finally, during today's call, when our senior executives refer to comparable performance, they're referring to comparable performance from continuing operations.","Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first, and then reenter the queue.","Now, let me turn the call over to James.","James Quincey","Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. 2019 is off to a good start with strong underlying performance as we leverage our transformation as a total beverage company. We continue to win in a growing industry. The non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry grew value 4% in the quarter and we gained global value share with a balanced contribution from most developed and emerging markets led by strong performance within our sparkling soft drink business.","During the quarter, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth, cycling 5% last year. Growth was broad-based with positive performance across each of our operating segments.","Of course there are often timing impacts on a quarterly basis and we did see a net benefit in this quarter which John will cover in more detail. But to be clear, we delivered strong topline growth in the quarter which we converted into 16% comparable currency-neutral operating income growth and comparable EPS was up 2%, which was comprised of 13% comparable currency-neutral EPS growth, partially offset by an 11% currency headwind. So, our disciplined growth strategies are working well and we're on track to deliver our full year guidance.","As you know our industry continues to evolve and our approach to addressing this encompasses our system acting with discipline to drive growth. First, innovating and investing in our core categories and brands as well as in emerging spaces. This encompasses everything from massive categories like hot beverages to emerging ones like Kombucha and it allows us to proactively address innovation opportunities that stem from blurring category lines.","Second, we're looking at how we operate as a company from our existing geographic segments to our new Global Ventures segment. Third, our system is aligned and engaged with improved execution. Our bottling partners are investing for growth including cold-drinks equipment and incremental feet on the street as well as implementing more segmented revenue growth strategies. At the same time, we're investing in digital capabilities. We engage with consumers, interact with our customers, and reduced costs across our enterprise.","So, starting with our brands, constant innovation is crucial for sustained growth. Brand Coke, which includes our flagship product and its many variants, has momentum because it has been continually updated to maintain its relevance.","Over the past three years, innovation has helped accelerate global retail value growth each year including up to 6% growth in 2018. This growth is in large part because of the success of Coke Zero Sugar which didn't happen of course overnight. We refined and expanded Zero Sugar over time and we see more growth ahead.","Coke Zero Sugar succeeds because it builds on the brand edge of original Coke, on its taste, its upliftment, on the energy boost that the product provides, all these in a product that doesn't have calories or sugar.","So, what's next for brand Coke? You will see us to continue to innovate to capture additional consumption occasions and need states. One example that I've talked about before is Coca-Cola coffee which we tested in several Asian markets last year. Coke coffee was designed to reach consumers during specific occasions and channels like the mid-afternoon energy slump at work. We've learned from these pilots and we now plan to launch in more than 25 markets around the world by year end.","We're also pursuing another logical extension on the Coca-Cola brand with our test of Coke Energy. This takes one of the original brand edges of Coke, its energy boost, to a new level and a new taste. This product is designed to the white spaces where the energy category isn't well-developed.","But our approach to innovation is not limited to brand Coke. We're taking other brands and pushing into new spaces to offer consumers what they want by leveraging the brand edges. For example, Innocent, our leading juice business in Europe, expanded into plant-based beverages. And within our Challenger brand, Simply, our premium juice brand in the U.S. recently launched a new line of smoothies.","We're also improving the way we operationalize our innovation pipeline. Within our Explorer brands, almost half of our country category combinations are growing volume double-digits, which is up from about a third a year ago.","While we often talk about innovating in products, our evolution is just as much about changing how we work. Our organizational needs are ever-changing, as our portfolio and competitive environment become more complex around the world. So we're adapting.","One example is the creation of a new operating group Global Ventures. The goal is to accelerate some of our businesses, like Innocent and Costa Coffee that have the potential for growth across traditional borders.","While the acquisition of Costa Coffee plays a significant entry point into hot beverages, it's also more than that. Costa is a platform in coffee overall. This requires more and better connectivity than ever before.","We spent the first three months ensuring the transition from Whitbread went smoothly while building connections within our existing business units. And Costa is performing in line with expectations. As we look to the second quarter, we'll be launching our first ready-to-drink Costa products; expect to hear more about that in the weeks ahead.","Turning now to our geographic performance, we saw good results in many markets around the world. Our emerging and developing markets are growing organic revenue double-digits. And our developed markets are performing well, delivering mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.","In EMEA, we grew organic revenue 14%, driven by continued growth in Europe and Turkey, and improved performance in Russia. We also benefited from our European bottlers increasing their inventory levels as a safeguard for a potentially disruptive Brexit.","Across Europe, revenue growth management initiatives and Zero Sugar innovations are creating sustained momentum in the majority of our markets. Not only has this benefited price\/mix, but unit case volume was up 4% for our European sparkling soft drink portfolio. This performance is balanced with growth in our tea and hydration categories as we broaden out the portfolio.","Turning to North America, our results continue to mount steady progress driven by strong marketing and execution. Organic revenue was unfavorably impacted by 2 points for one less day in the quarter and the Easter shift, and grew 1% driven by disciplined price pack management and solid value growth within sparkling soft drinks, juice drinks, and value-added dairy.","Our sparkling portfolio benefited from the continued strong performance in Coke Zero Sugar and new flavor innovations like Orange Vanilla Coke, which helped drive 6% retail value growth for brand Coca-Cola in our flagship markets.","Unit case volume declined by 1% in North America as we continued to focus on providing consumers with smaller pack sizes, for example, mini cans grew 14% in the quarter contributing to transactions and our [pacing] [ph] volume while driving significant value for our system and our customers.","In Latin America, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth in an increasingly difficult operating environment. Argentina's economic environment worsened, the high inflation increased the salary gap and impacted private consumption. The volume here declined double-digits, but we gained value and volume share by adjusting the price pack architecture focused on transactions and maintaining our consumer base.","In Mexico, we're working with our bottling partners to ensure our revenue growth management initiatives continue to drive momentum. And Brazil, Brazil is on upward trajectory. Our turnaround plan is working with volume up 5% and transactions up double-digits in the quarter. Incremental cooler placements and increased availability of our refillable packages are helping to drive this acceleration.","Finally, in Asia Pacific, we saw good performance in China and India along with accelerating momentum in our Southeast Asia business unit, which drove 4% organic revenue growth for the segment overall. Execution around Chinese New Year was strong, contributing to 9% volume growth and double-digit transaction growth in China.","In Japan, our system continues to deal with the supply chain impact from natural disasters last year. Manufacturing capacity remains tight, but is improving, with additional lines ramping up in the second quarter. So we expect this to ease the capacity shortage, but full recovery will take until next year.","In Japan, unit case volume was even. New product launches drove momentum in tea and coffee during the first quarter while we cycle the benefit of a strong innovation pipeline in sparkling soft drinks last year.","So, in summary, we had a good start to the year. Our strategy of being more consumer focused and creating value for our customers is working. And we are confident we will deliver our full year targets and drive shareholder value.","I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Murphy","Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us. Today, I'd like to cover three topics. One, our financial results in the quarter; two, our outlook for the remainder of the year; and three, I'd like to say a few points on our currency hedging program.","So starting with our financial performance in the quarter. As James said, we got off to a good start to the year. You'll see that, the composition of organic revenue growth in the first quarter was the inverse of what we saw last year driven more by price\/mix than volume. Price\/mix was 5%, cycling 1% and trending ahead of our recent run rate driven by strong price\/mix in North America, EMEA and Latin America. Our concentrate shipments grew 1%, cycling 4%, adversely impacted by one less day in the quarter.","Of course with a portfolio as diverse as ours there will often be variability in timing from quarter-to-quarter. The largest timing impact we saw was in Europe, where our bottlers increased safety stock in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit. This benefited both global price\/mix and concentrate shipments, since Europe comprises high revenue per case markets.","After normalizing for the estimated two points timing benefit and impact from one less day in the quarter the best way to think of the underlying top line performance in the first quarter is 5%.","Over the remainder of 2019, we expect a more balanced volume and price\/mix. Importantly, I'm really encouraged by our organic performance in the first quarter and the sustainability of that growth going forward.","Turning now to margins for both growth and operating margins, we delivered another quarter of underlying margin expansion. In line with our expectations, our geographic groups were the primary driver, a function of continued innovation, revenue growth management, strategies and the effect of management of our cost structure. However, comparable margins contracted in the quarter due to the impact of acquisitions and currency.","At the gross profit level, we saw underlying gross margin expand about 30 basis points. Currencies and net acquisitions impacted gross margin by about 100 basis points and 80 basis points respectively. This was expected with the impact from net acquisitions driven, primarily by bottler transactions within our bottling investments segment.","At the operating profit level, a continued focus on productivity as well as the timing of certain expenses drove a 240 basis point expansion in underlying operating margin. But this was offset by about 130 basis point impact from currencies and about 130 basis point impact from net acquisitions.","As James noted, comparable EPS growth grew 2% in the quarter which was comprised of 13% comparable currency-neutral growth, partially offset by an 11% currency headwind. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $335 million in the quarter in line with our expectations. Strong underlying cash generation was offset by the impact of currency headwinds along with an increase in capital expenditures and cash tax payments.","Looking now at the remainder of the year. We are confident we can deliver the full year guidance we have spoken about previously and is included in our release. We do expect the quarterly phasing to be a bit uneven. So let me just highlight some considerations to factor into your models. The timing benefit we received from bottlers stocking up in anticipation of Brexit was roughly $0.02 into the first quarter EPS. But as we move forward, we expect this to reverse this year. This is a fluid situation, but our current estimate is that our bottlers will hold their safety stock through the second and third quarter. So for modeling purposes I would take the $0.02 out of the fourth quarter.","Before giving a currency outlook, I'd like to highlight a few points. Since CAGNY, we've taken a close look at how we manage foreign exchange in over 70 functional currencies. For developed market currencies, I believe we have the right hedging strategy to mitigate fluctuations to cash flows. This approach has provided a significant cash flow benefit over the past five years, which is important for our company given our large domestic cash obligations including the dividend.","Our challenge is emerging market currencies given the increasing importance of emerging markets to our earnings base. While we have not underperformed versus other approaches there has been a limited amount we can do to hedge this exposure in a cost-efficient manner. Going forward we will continue to evaluate our approach to optimally manage this area. We'll provide insight if and when that approach evolves.","I'd also like us to a better job on overall communications. So going forward in quarters where it is significant, we will begin calling out hedging as a component of the overall currency impact so it's clear what gains or losses, we'll be cycling next year. For example in the first quarter of 2019, the currency impact to operating income was not materially affected by hedging activities and is primarily the result of a change in spot rates. We will also provide preliminary currency outlook for the following year once we have better insight into our hedging activity for the latter year. I expect this to be on the third quarter earnings call.","Returning to our near-term outlook. In the second quarter, we expect a 7 point currency impact to operating income. This includes a 2 point impact from hedging activity driven almost entirely by gains we are cycling from the prior year. We are hedged through options near current market rates for the G10 currencies as well as for certain emerging market currencies. So we have downside protection in the quarter and some upside opportunities should the dollar weaken.","As we move into the back half of the year, we expect the impact from currencies to become less of a headwind each quarter. However, while we are hedged on the hard currencies through the end of 2019, we do have some exposure to fluctuations in emerging market currencies and our currency outlook will reflect this accordingly.","As always our Investor Relations team will be happy to answer any questions as you build-out your models for the year. So in summary, organic revenue growth is strong and is broad-based. Currency and acquisitions impacted margins in the quarter, but pricing and productivity are driving underlying margin expansion. And we are confident in our ability to deliver our full year guidance.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Steve Powers","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","James Quincey","Good morning.","Steve Powers","I guess -- James, congrats on the quarter. I think the prepared remarks gave a lot of clarity. I wanted to start actually stepping back and talking about a bigger picture issue, just in terms of innovation. You've talked a lot about incremental innovation, I mean, how you work and how you introduce new products since you've taken over as CEO. And about the need to try more not be afraid of failure, but also when you do fail to -- fail fast and fail cheaply. And I guess my question is as you step back, just how do you assess your progress against those innovation objectives?","You cited some things in the prepared remarks that have shown promise. But what metrics are you specifically tracking when it comes to innovation? And maybe if you could, could you share some of those with us? Is it simply a matter of accelerating the number of new product innovations and introductions? And if so have those in fact accelerated? Or are there other metrics in terms of success rates or product contributions to growth or the balance of innovation across categories and geographies? Just a little bit more context around how you're approaching the measurement of innovation success?","James Quincey","Sure. Let me offer you a couple of thoughts, Steve. I think one is to -- one metric that we track, and I think, we've put some numbers in our CAGNY presentation if I remember correctly, is looking at the contribution of innovation to overall volume or revenue growth or gross margin growth. So just tracking quite simply what was existing and what was new and what's contributing to the base. And that is useful to us not just to know what's new and what's existing, but on the thesis that the most important thing is to work out how to stay relevant there are innovations which are about new products, but there are innovations about marketing and packaging, which is all aimed to help us stay relevant.","So innovation shouldn't be seen just as narrowly as the physical liquid product. It needs to be also seen as the packaging and the marketing. So we do measure the narrow, which is the product but we're also [interested] [ph] in the broad. And ultimately what that ladders up to is driving the framework we've talked about, which is the leader, challenger, explorer and the zombies.","So in the end, the innovations in the product, the packaging, the marketing, the execution, the co-brand it's all about getting more quality leadership positions. And so we're measuring there how many of the leaders are growing faster than personal consumption. Are they expanding their leadership position? How many of the challengers are gaining a decent amount of value share each year, because if they don't gain a decent amount of value share each year, they'll never arrive at being leader. And how many of the explorers are growing double-digits? We called out in the scriptures then that with half the explorers are growing double-digits, so there was only one-third last year. So innovation should be seen as in service of creating quality leadership for the brands and that's the highest level metric that we look at in the end.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks, good morning.","James Quincey","Hey, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","The volume performance in Asia was really notable this quarter. And so I know in the release you mentioned China, Southeast Asia and India. But could you just walk through specifically what's driving the performance? Even like just talk about it in a sequential acceleration. And also I'm sure it's quite small, but you did mention this authentic tea house launch in China. And I just know that's been a tough country category combination for you historically. So if you could just comment on that, because if you put it in the release it must be worth talking about. Thanks.","James Quincey","Yeah. Okay. I think the first thing I would say is that the Asia Pacific volume growth in the first quarter was very much in line with the volume growth in 2018. I think the question that was out there was in the fourth quarter when it softened a little was that a blip or was that the emergence of something else? And I think at least with the first quarter, the fourth quarter looks more like a blip.","So I think it's a retaking of the momentum we have in 2018. Specifically what was driving it was, for example, in China we had very strong performance by the whole Coca-Cola trademark, as well as emphasizing single serve water and the recreating value in the water category that has been an ongoing theme for us in the China business. Obviously all of that was wrapped together with a good Chinese New Year. Tremendous activation on the marketing programs there. So, really a solid quarter by the Chinese business.","In India, we did well, good performance by the sparkling but we also had in the case of India really strong growth in the juices. Maaza, which is the local mango centered juice business, was up very strongly along with some of the Minute Maid local Indian fruit flavors, so a nice performance there.","We also saw Southeast Asia do better. Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam they were all in double-digits, so a really good performance across Southeast Asia. And Authentic Tea House, I know it made it into the release and I think it's starting to continue to do well. So we are pleased with the initial results. It's going to be a very -- it's definitively in the category of explorer. So it's growing. But I think there's a long, long road to go before we are happy with where we end up in tea in China.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bonnie Herzog","All right Thank you, good morning. So I had a question on your margins. The underlying margins were quite impressive in the quarter ex FX and acquisitions. So I was hoping you could help bucket some of the key drivers behind the strength in the quarter. And then maybe give us a sense as to how much of the benefit you got from productivity savings versus the lift you might be getting from some of the strong pricing you're seeing? Thanks.","John Murphy","Thank you. Let me start with a quick walk forward on gross margin first and then I'll cover operating margin. As I mentioned in my remarks, the underlying margin expansion of what's 30 basis points in gross margin was led by EMEA. And the benefits of Brexit was clearly part of that, but there was also a positive benefit of geographical mix overall. And this was partially offset by North America due to growth in the finished good businesses.","I think importantly, we need to take into account the currency headwinds and they were particularly related to the Argentinean peso. And we also were cycling some hedge gains from prior year. In addition to which we also had a structural impact mainly driven by the acquisition of the Philippines bottling business. And there was a slight offset there on the kind of the bottler refranchising.","On the operating margin front, the underlying expansion of 250 basis points was due to EMEA and the Brexit impact where we have a higher revenue and would've had no expenses there and North America also due to productivity in the -- across-the-board and the timing of some expenses. We also saw though the headwinds on operating margin on the acquisition front and the currency headwinds due to the peso and hedging gains I mentioned before. So underlying margin expansion net positive, but purely been impacted by the headwinds on currency and acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning. So James, I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit more color just in terms of your organic revenue growth outlook for the full year. I think in the fourth quarter call, you talked about some of the cautions around some of the macroeconomic volatility in markets like Middle East and Argentina. It seems like first quarter certainly came in a little bit better even setting aside some of the timing noise. So how are you thinking about the 4% number? Do you feel like there's maybe some cushion as you kind of think about the volatility perhaps being a little bit less or certain markets actually doing a little bit better than you thought? Thank you.","A \u2013 James Quincey","Sure. I mean, I think firstly, it's certainly encouraging to come out of the gate in the first quarter with a strong start. And as you say taking the timing aside, I think we can call the first quarter a five. It's obviously our smallest quarter. So there's still a long way to go in the rest of 2019. And I think it's still a question of the macros versus what we can execute against ourselves very much as it was in the last call.","I think since we last spoke, the IMF has come out and reduced its forecast for the year again. So I think the macro environment remains of a lower level of growth than it was in 2018 and a degree of uncertainty as to how some of the bigger issues around trade are going to play out. Depending on the week, it can be blowing a little. We're optimistic, a little more pessimistic, but I think fundamentally, the macro environment remains very similar to what we have been planning against for the last number of months.","Obviously what we are focused on is the execution against our strategy. We think we have a strategy that's right for the consumers and the customers for 2019 and well into the future. We and the bottling partners are focused on executing against that. We're going to have to deal with the ups and downs in some of the trickier parts of the world whether that's Argentina or the Middle East or other places that are under pressure. But we think we have a plan that's going to work. So I think in the end, it comes down to. We are confident in our guidance. We had a good start in the first quarter, although it's the smallest quarter. And we will continue to focus on managing what we can manage to deliver a good result in 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Ali Dibadj","Hey guys. So I was just wondering about the SG&A improvement. It looked pretty strong in the quarter, notwithstanding some of the gross margin impact and FX impact. What's underlying that in particular given a little bit of detail John a moment ago? But I guess, I ask in the context of the $3.8 billion restructuring target that was set a few years ago and whether there's an opportunity to up that number. It certainly seems like you have more room there understanding a lot of moving parts. And then, the second thing is related to Coke Energy. You mentioned it James in your opening remarks. Do you have any detail further about the opportunities there? That would be helpful as well. Thanks.","John Murphy","Thanks. Ali on SG&A, we had a slight increase in comparables at 1.1% and there's a couple of things in there. One, it does reflect the integration of the new businesses, but it's offset by currency and the structural impact. So, when you look at the comparisons take those into account. We did have some savings in SG&A during the quarter, a benefit of the ongoing productivity work that we have been doing, plus some timing of expenses in North America.","And as we look to the future, I quote our ongoing work on productivity in under the whole margin expansion arena, where we would be embedding into just the way we operate a critical focus across the enterprise on driving costs at every line our cost to sales line. We see opportunities to continue to drive, or concentrate supply business more efficiently through harmonization of formulas et cetera. There is ongoing opportunity in the OpEx arena, to drive more efficiency particularly with some of the digitization initiatives we have underway. And then finally, there's always ways to I think be more effective and efficient, with our marketing spend and that's a key area of focus going forward across the enterprise.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning.","James Quincey","Good morning.","Bill Chappell","Could you talk a little more on the innovation especially on the coffee side? Just trying to understand, I guess one how the Coke coffee works with Costa? And also, kind of timing of some of these launches? Will they be in North America? Will they have an impact in 1Q, 2Q, 3Q? Just a little more color on how that flows through the year would be helpful. Thank you.","James Quincey","Sure. I think firstly, the way we are seeing the opportunities for innovation in a product sense is in a way at the blurring edge or partly at the blurring edge with some of the categories. So the opportunity to have a Coke and coffee variant of Coca-Cola is really at that juncture of what are the benefits that people see in Coke versus what are the benefits they look for in coffee, especially perhaps in some of the markets where the occasions are less well-developed. Said another way, in the developed economies three-quarters of what people drink is already a commercial beverage. So they have a certain view as to what drinks go for what and what occasions. But in the emerging economies only a quarter of what they drink is a commercial beverage.","So there's still a lot of in a way creating of the occasions and connecting of brands and benefits to certain occasions. So, there is opportunities to expand categories and to leverage the blurring of the edges. And I think Coke coffee is a great example of that, started out in Southeast Asia in that afternoon slump, and really married the benefits of Coke with coffee in a very unique way and has done most. And there's nothing about that that detracts from some of the more direct coffee drinks that we launched.","Obviously, we've got Georgia coffee, we've got some other coffee drinks in the U.S. with partners, and we see a great opportunity to bring Costa ready-to-drink to the marketplace. We will be doing that later in the second quarter. So as we do that, of course, it's likely that will be concentrated in the markets where Costa already is and we'll be coming up with that later in the second quarter.","And then as for how we foresee the rollout of the coffee platform not just the ready-to-drink, but the vending and being a beverage partner with beans and machines that we'll come back to later in the year as we have time to really solidify the expansion plans with the management of Costa.","Obviously, we closed the acquisition well ahead of schedule. The integration has gone well and is ahead of schedule taking the business and the services out of Whitbread and connecting them to the Coke system. And we're currently working through the various stages of the synergy plans we see ahead.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","James Quincey","Good morning.","Bryan Spillane","John I guess just a couple of questions, balance sheet-related questions for you. One is, if you look at the, I guess, long-term debt in the quarter went up and even net debt went up. And I know part of that is with the Costa acquisition. But it was a little surprised to see net debt that was going up. So if you could just talk about kind of the evolution of the balance sheet and debt balances going forward, first?","Then second, just related to your comments earlier on currency hedging. Can you just give us a high-level view of what the trade-offs are? So hedging -- the currency hedging has been a part of Coke for a long time. So if you decided not to do it, I guess, with the emerging market currencies just what's the trade-off? What benefit do you derive from doing it now that you might have -- you might give up, if you'd change the policy going forward?","John Murphy","Okay. Let me start with the balance sheet question and just a few key highlights from the quarter. First of all, our cash, our balance is slightly lower and that was driven by the acquisition of Costa. We saw an increase in our non-current assets $7.2 billion also driven by Costa and CHI. And that's affecting two line items. One is, the intangibles increased by $5.5 billion. And secondly, there was an increase of $0.5 billion in our plants and equipment line.","We do have lower short-term debt balances driven by lower commercial paper balances. In the first quarter, we did issue a long-term euro debt, which combined with those lower cash balance that I mentioned is driving net debt slightly higher.","So our net debt-to-EBITDA is at 2.7x slightly above our target of 2.5x. But we do expect to get that back to within range. So that's on the balance sheet.","With respect to the hedging questions, I think, there's a couple of points to consider. First of all, we -- when you look at why we do it in the first place and why we've taken the approach, we've taken, we know we have U.S. cash outgoings slated in the course of the year. And then it's important for us that we have certainty with respect to the inflows in order to cover those obligations.","So having that certainty is really important and is a key factor. Historically, we've also wanted to smooth the impact over time periods. And when you take the long view on that, I think the treasury team has done a really good job on it. We did -- over the last few weeks, we did actually take a look at what would have happened over the last 10 years if we had deployed other approaches. And for developed currencies, I think the hedging program we have in place by far delivered a better outcome than if we had done nothing or if we had been sort of more inactive in this area.","The area and I mentioned it in my remarks, the area that's a challenge will be working with our emerging currency portfolio. And as you know the cost of hedging, the more volatile currencies sometimes is not worth doing. And we don't have, I don't think anybody has actually a perfect model or system to cover the risks implicit in, filling in a more volatile emerging currency. So that's an area that we will continue to work on. In the short to medium term, we do have some positions, which we believe are prudent and again give us more certainty in the short-term and allow us to minimize the downside.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","James Quincey","Hi, Andrea.","Peter Grom","Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Peter Grom on for Andrea.","James Quincey","Hi, Peter.","Peter Grom","So I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on Coke Energy. So James in the prepared remarks you talked about launching in white spaces where the energy category is not yet developed. Is that more looking at specific countries across the world? Or are you speaking to maybe a particular sub-segment of the category that you think is underdeveloped? Thanks.","James Quincey","Yeah. I mean, Coke Energy the -- again this is something that debase the dynamic of the blurring of some of the categories and the boundary between some of the categories. So there's -- with every category in energy is no different. There's a very core to the category, a central proposition that everyone understands the category to be.","And then as the boundary of the category people have made innovations by adding other ingredients and starting to connect to benefits from other categories. And in the case of the energy category there has been a lot of growth in the central core of what the category stands for and that's what's propelled the category forward in largely North America and Europe and a few other parts of the world. The energy category in itself is still in development in many emerging markets.","And, therefore, there's an opportunity in complement to the core brands within the energy category to work at the boundary. And Coke Energy is based on that dynamic. I mean, it's got the credentials and some of the origins to be able to connect to some of the energy need states. So we see that as a space where the energy category can grow. And we see that across our whole series of geographies. And we're going to experiment with Coke Energy and see how it works and then, obviously, refine the proposition. And we think it will help complement the other brands that sell successfully in this category.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Brendan Metrano","Good morning. This is Brendan Metrano for Robert. John, a quick follow-up for you. Could you quantify the benefit to gross and operating margin from that concentrate build in EMEA?","And then for James, I'm wondering if you could expand on trends in Brazil and Mexico and some of the initiatives that you're implementing in those markets. Brazil seems to be turning for a while. The staples company in Mexico is, obviously, an important business for you guys. Thanks.","John Murphy","Okay. Let me take the Brexit question. Yes, the timing benefit to margins on Brexit was 70 basis points in the quarter.","Brendan Metrano","And that was for gross and operating?","John Murphy","Operating.","Brendan Metrano","Operating?","John Murphy","Yes.","James Quincey","We'll give everyone a shot at the questions before we come back to the second one. Is there someone else?","Operator","Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask a little bit for a little more detail on the Coke brand. And maybe specifically you've had Coke Zero Sugar for a period of time. Now you have orange and coffee and energy. How do you know you're not overextending the brand and maybe the underlying business becomes less stable and a lot more reliant on the newest innovations?","James Quincey","Yeah. Great question. I think there's a difference between what's central to the brand and what are innovations that are likely to be either in or out or in a way noncore to the identity or the most central part of the brand. And so I would see brand Coke and what it stands for, and therefore Coke Zero Sugar as a key part of what the Coca-Cola brand is.","Now things like coffee that's at the beginning we'll see how that develops. Clearly, that's a product variant that's crossing over into another category with coffee. And obviously, there is a danger there as you say that it becomes -- it starts to change the nature of Coke itself. Orange and Vanilla, I think is a flavor. We've had some history with flavors. Whether it will ultimately end up proving to be one of those ones that endures and is available in the market that doesn't get support or not time will tell. There are a number of them and they are different in different countries.","And I think they add some interest and some connection to the brand. But they are ultimately not marketed in that sense and really driven by availability. In the end, what we have to steward is the vibrancy of the total brand. And of course, those variants that make up the core of the brand. We do that through a whole series of metrics, whether it be consumer metrics or in-market metrics. And I think that is a key challenge and an imperative, not just for the brand teams, but for the management as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge. Your line is now open.","Brett Cooper","Good morning. I was wondering if you guys can talk about the process of expanding information or innovation from the original market, particularly interested in whether it is pushed from the center and pulled from the country. And then, what happens between test and further rollout? And I guess the final thing is just can you talk about the speed of doing that? And is that where you want it to be? Thanks.","James Quincey","Well I think the nature of being in CEO or in corporate management is nothing is ever as fast as you'd like it, but that's a challenge on how to improve its speed rather than something you can live with philosophically. I think look the reality is that you get a bit of everything. When there's a successful innovation in a market there's a very high likelihood that one of the neighboring markets will have seen it and moved on it before anyone from the center needs to say anything.","In the end, we have to set up a system that allows that. Why? Because it's impossible for an enterprise as large as Coke to have everything directed from the center. It's just not possible to know everything and it's not possible to issue enough instructions to all the different markets. The system has to rely on the center focusing on the highest-leverage decisions. That could be moving in innovation around the world or ensuring that an innovation stay in a certain form. But it tends to be directed at a few big decisions and then a focus on talent and culture and a system that can allow an organic amount of self-generation.","So to take the example we've talked about so far today Coke with coffee. That started out in Asia Pacific. They came up with one variant. The next market then started to move on it before it was really something that the seller was worrying about or looking at. They actually then updated the formula, so it already went from 1.0 to 2.0 by the time it went to the second country based on some of the learnings. And then as it got moved out further, yes, there have been further evolutions of the formula.","Obviously, one of the things we've done from the Corporate Center is try to make sure there's some unity in how the variant is being thought about and how the formulas are being developed. Because ultimately, we have to push against the trend that every market thinks it necessarily has to make the thing better and that we'd end up with 200 versions of everything. It doesn't have to be one version, but 200 is also probably the wrong answer. And so we do apply a process of pressure to get into a corridor that we believe is appropriate to both satisfy local consumer differences, yet drive the growth of a global brand and an efficiency of an overall supply chain.","Brett Cooper","Thank you.","John Murphy","And I'd just add -- if I add one additional comment. Just from my experience over the last couple of years, Brett is that I think we've moved from more of a hub and spoke model to a network model. Our R&D center is now reporting into local operations. We have one in Shanghai, Tokyo, Brussels and Mexico. And they're very much wired together and connected to our business units. So the speed at which stuff is moving around has increased a lot over the last two years, not for what we would ideally want it to be, but it's certainly a key part of the overall profit that James just referenced.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Laurent Grandet","Good morning, James. Good morning, John. I'd like to focus on Coke Energy again. I mean, could you please update us on the Coke Energy launch in Europe? The reception from bottlers and retailers and maybe already from consumers? If sales are incremental to the Coke franchise or if it's taking share from competition? Any update on upcoming launches outside of Europe? That will help. Thank you.","James Quincey","Yeah. Sure. I think that the headline unfortunately Laurent is too early to tell. It's only really just gone \u2013 it's only really just been launched. The first sales are only just being made. It seems to have resonated well in the first couple of weeks. And so given how early on it is, it's not \u2013 we're not at the stage where we can really make a good call on where are the incremental sales coming from. So they're still small at this stage. So I think it's very \u2013 it's too early to tell. Obviously, we'll be looking at it in the coming weeks and months, and we'll be able to become clearer as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Drew Levine","Hi, everyone. This is Drew Levine on for Amit. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the competitive environment in the U.S. Your main competitor said that, they are at least not losing share on their cola brand anymore. So I just wanted to see what you're seeing in the market, if you're happy with your market share performance in cola. And then kind of related to that in sports drinks any plans to expand the scope of BODYARMOR or additional support for the sports drinks given some plans by your competitor to increase spending on their own brand? Thanks.","James Quincey","Yeah. We've got a good strategy in the U.S. focused on investing in the brands, building out the portfolio, working with the new network of bottlers post refranchising to execute the strategy in the marketplace with a packaging approach a smaller packaging. We have a standing strategy in the U.S. that has been successful in allowing us to help the industry to grow for our customers, and for us to be able to gain share within that total industry, and that again played out in the first quarter this year.","So we think it's a \u2013 our strategy that works for us. Obviously, as other parties large or small invest in the industry, I think it says two things. One it says, the industry is attractive, because it's got growth and profitability. That's why people want to enter. And it says, we need to up our game because the industry is going to become more competitive. And I think that's in the end good news for The Coca-Cola Company and it certainly has been over the last number of years in North America. We've been focused on driving sparkling beverages and that's continuing to do well, particularly our Coke Zero Sugar. BODYARMOR had a good start in the sports drinks category. It's certainly been one of the things that's been driving growth in that category. So we're going to continue to invest. We're going to stick to our overall game plan. And we'll focus on working to make our brands as relevant for consumers and our plans as value creating for the customers, so we can remain competitive in this attractive industry.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Quincey for any further remarks.","James Quincey","Thank you everyone for joining the call today. To conclude, we had a solid start to the year.

In February, we reported a successful transition year in 2015, where we made tangible progress on our plan and delivered the full-year expectations we laid out.","I'm pleased to report that in the quarter, the first quarter of 2016, we took another positive step in the macro environment that continues to be challenging. Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance.","We're in the midst of transforming The Coca-Cola Company to one that is even more focused on our core value creation model of building and supporting strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. During the first quarter, our continued focus on our five strategic initiatives enabled us to gain value share and deliver positive top-line growth with underlying margin expansion. With the first quarter behind us, we see the challenging global environment continuing, but we remain committed to our full-year targets we laid out in February for both the top and bottom-line performance.","From a highlights perspective, we continued to execute our strategic initiatives. In the first quarter, we unveiled our new global one brand marketing strategy for Trademark Coca-Cola under the Taste the Feeling campaign, which is elevating system engagement with our employees, bottling partners and customers. The initial consumer response is encouraging and positive.","Additionally, we added to our portfolio of fast-growing still beverages. We closed our Chinese plant-based protein acquisition of Culiangwang in March. We also invested in Chi, the leading juice and value-added dairy company in Nigeria, Africa's largest economy. Both transactions are further proof points of how we are strengthening our leading stills position, effectively responding to evolving consumer preferences.","Finally, we are accelerating our global refranchising efforts. In North America, we continued to make progress against our stated goal of refranchising 100% of our bottling operations by the end of 2017. Including the territories announced this morning, we have transferred or signed agreements on almost two-thirds of the U.S. territories we originally acquired from CCE.","Looking outside of North America to Western Europe, our Coca-Cola European Partner's transaction remains on track to close by the end of the second quarter. In Africa, the regulatory approval process continues. The South Africa Competition Commission has recommended for the Competition Tribunal to approve the Cola-Cola Beverages Africa merger with certain conditions. The Tribunal is set to meet in May to review the pending transaction.","In summary, we recognize that we still have much work to do, but we have defined a clear path to transform the company and we're making consistent progress to create long-term value for our shareowners. The Coca-Cola Company is becoming stronger, more efficient and more focused on our core strengths of marketing and brand-building, customer value creation and leading our franchise bottling system. We're making progress implementing our disciplined global revenue growth management strategy.","We're also building new growth opportunities with still and sparkling brands that we develop internally, we acquire from the outside and we invest in through partnerships. And our franchise bottling system is also getting strong, faster, more nimble and more closely aligned. In short, my colleagues and I are getting up every single day with a fresh passion for doing the things that will create long-term sustainable value.","I'll now hand the call over to James, who's going to provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in the first quarter.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. From an industry perspective, we gained global value share in NARTD beverages in the quarter, with increases in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide. We gained value share in all but one of the subcategories in stills, where there, we maintained value share. We delivered 2% unit case volume growth. Our solid performance in many of our developed markets was partially offset by challenges in emerging markets suffering from the worst of the macro slowdown. This had a disproportionate effect on sparkling volume growth, as the non-alcoholic beverage industry in many of these markets is more weighted towards sparkling beverages.","Consolidated price\/mix grew 1%, cycling 3%. Our solid underlying pricing was partially offset by one point of segment mix. We accelerated our price\/mix across every operating segment, except Asia Pacific, versus the first quarter lap. Given the geographic footprint of our own Bottling Investments Group, our consolidated price\/mix was lower.","Given the scale of our pending refranchising, as you consider the sustainability of our disciplined pricing strategy, I think it's helpful to exclude BIG and focus instead on our core business, which delivered two points of global price realization.","Results were also impacted by one less day in our fiscal quarter compared to the same period last year, which reduced organic revenue growth by roughly one point. As a result, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth, including one point headwind from one less day. In the quarter, structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral income before tax grew a solid 9%, with the underlying margin expansion reflecting our focus on productivity, as well as the timing of operating expenses. Notably, this expansion occurred alongside the continued growth in our marketing investments.","Now, to describe more clearly our operating performance, let me briefly describe our results in three groupings of our markets. First, in markets where our strategies are in place and being executed fairly well, we are seeing strong results. This cluster is led by North America, Latin America, also includes Japan and India. Here, strong marketing, disciplined revenue management and improving execution are driving results.","For example, specifically in North America, we delivered: 2% organic revenue growth, with one less day; three points of price realization, led by 3% sparkling price\/mix and good operating leverage in the quarter. North America also grew value share again this quarter, and continued to successfully implement its accelerated refranchising program.","Latin America delivered double-digit organic revenue growth, due to a strong focus on consumer and customer segmentation, despite worsening conditions in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. In Mexico, brand investments, including new products, such as Del Valle Nada (9:57), a sparkling fruit drink, as well as Ciel mineral water and Ciel flavored water, helped increase unit volume by 5%, with growth across all major categories.","Our Japan business unit had a very strong start to the year, supported by several recent innovations, such as I LOHAS Peach, an extension of our premium water brand, and our premium priced Georgia Coffee bottle\/can. We also leveraged innovation from China, launching Lemon+C, which has seen strong early results. These hit products enabled our value share to outperform volume share, as they skew to higher revenue, single-serve packaging.","And finally, India; here, we delivered strong performance in the quarter, due to the rapid scaling of a new price\/pack architecture across sparkling and juice segments, coupled with brand marketing and execution efforts. In addition, we expanded our still beverage portfolio in India with the launch of VIO, our latest value-added dairy beverage.","These positive results give us confidence our strategies are working. While we are making progress in these markets, we also recognize there's more work to be done, and the opportunity for improvement in these good performing markets continues to be significant.","The second group is comprised of markets where we are taking action to positively transform our business for the future. Here, I would include Europe, where we continue to make progress to the establishment of our newly-integrated Western European bottler. And here, several key markets performed very well, led by Spain, up 3%; Germany, up 1%; and in the Central and Southern European business unit, we grew volume 2%. We look forward to improving performance in Europe as the year progresses.","A second transition market is our African business, where we are taking steps to strengthen our bottling business through the creation of new Coca-Cola Beverages Africa bottler. As Muhtar mentioned, we are also taking steps to diversify our brand portfolio through our investment in Chi. And we continue to improve our execution in key markets on the Continent, as exemplified by improving performance in South Africa and Nigeria, where we grew unit case volume 7% and 13%, respectively.","There's a final bunch of markets where we face clear macro headwinds in 2016. Russia and Brazil continue to be challenging. China's transition to a consumer-led economy is putting pressure on commodity-dependent emerging and developing markets. The lower oil price continues to weigh on the Middle East and other oil-driven economies. And while Argentina is taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, short-term results are challenging.","So let me refer to a few of these markets. In China, we are adjusting our plans to reflect these realities. China's macro environment was challenging in 2015, and that continued to be so in the first quarter. While the economic slowdown is not new, the degree to which the NARTD industry was impacted this past quarter was worse than expected. Key success factors going forward require focusing on both affordability and premiumization through segmented growth strategies.","The more premium segments continued to grow in China, as consumers who purchase these products are relatively insulated from broader economic issues. We are working to increase our premium offerings, like sleek cans and Schweppes+C, in high value channels. At the same time, however, we continue to evolve our price\/pack architecture to deliver affordable options in both single-serve and multi-serve packages to ensure we can capture key occasions and recruit new consumers. While the top line has been challenging, our initiatives have enabled us to gain both value and volume share in China in the quarter.","Turning to Brazil, here, we are segmenting our price\/pack architecture to provide packages at key affordable price points while delivering and driving pricing to cover inflation. This strategy enabled us to gain volume share during the quarter. And finally, in Russia, we gained value share, driven by good marketing and promotional activities, with a focus on premium sparkling beverages and juice.","Given the volatility in these markets, we are proactively managing our investments, keeping an eye towards the long term, but ensuring our near-term investments have the right payback.","The challenging macro environment is also a key reason why productivity is critical. We remain on track to deliver more than $600 million in productivity savings this year, enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments while covering cost inflation and driving margin expansion. We are delivering these savings through a disciplined process that involves our entire leadership team and associates. Ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every day, whilst also improving the employee experience. This quarter, the results of our ongoing efforts were evident in supporting the underlying strong operating margin expansion.","Before I hand over to Kathy, let me conclude by saying we are resolutely focused on evolving our growth strategies and transforming our business to deliver sustainable shareholder value. With the challenges around the world, we will focus on what we can control in order to deliver solid revenue growth and strong underlying operating margin expansion through the effective management of our portfolio, price\/mix and productivity efforts.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch upon a few areas of our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full-year outlook.","Starting at the top line, as James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue growth was impacted by one less day in the quarter as well as by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investments Group grew at a slightly slower rate than our core business.","Let me take a moment to explain what we mean by segment mix and why the impact will be more pronounced in 2016 and 2017 until we have finished our previously-announced refranchising actions.","Starting in the first quarter, we revised our operating segments so that our company-owned bottling operations in North America are now reported within our Bottling Investments Group. This greatly increases the relative size of the Bottling segment to the rest of our geographic segments. Since our bottling operations earn significantly higher revenues per case than concentrate operations, slower growth among our company-owned bottling operations results in negative pressure on our consolidated price\/mix, regardless of the underlying pricing in either the bottling operations or our core business. However, due to the relatively lower profitability of a bottling business, slower growth among our bottling operations has an opposite effect on our consolidated margins.","At gross profit, our comparable margin declined, as we were impacted by currency headwinds, the effects from North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster. Excluding the year-over-year effect of these items, we would have seen gross margin expansion driven by a benign cost environment, benefits from productivity and segment mix. As you think about the downhill, keep in mind that the cost environment becomes more difficult to cycle in the second quarter and beyond, due to the timing of when commodity prices eased last year.","Our comparable operating margin improved about 25 basis points on a consolidated basis. Similar to gross margin, currency headwinds, the North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster impacted our operating margins. Comparable currency neutral operating margins increased 140 basis points in the quarter. Excluding these effects, we achieved strong operating leverage in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our productivity initiatives, the timing of certain expenses and segment mix.","Looking at our productivity initiatives, the first quarter benefited from the timing of when certain productivity initiatives were implemented last year. For example, the majority of the head count reductions began in April, with Europe's implementation closer to the mid-year. So the associated expense savings began in the second quarter. As you think about the remainder of this year, while we expect solid currency neutral ex-structural operating leverage, we expect some of these drivers to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons. This was reflected in our previously-provided full-year guidance.","Let me stop here and touch briefly on an ongoing structural impact to provide additional clarity based on some of the questions I have received from you. At CAGNY, we noted that by the time we complete our refranchising, we will see significant increases in both gross and operating margins. While that is the case, I want to remind you that until we begin to increase the transfer of our production operations in North America, the existing refranchising of the distribution business actually has a dilutive effect to both gross and operating margins. Given that we do not expect the sale of production assets to significantly increase until 2017, our margins will continue to be affected by this dynamic this year.","Moving to cash flow, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations before making a nearly $0.5 billion contribution to our pension plans. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate. For 2016, we increased our annual dividend by 6% to $1.40 per share, our 54th consecutive annual dividend increase. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled approximately $150 million. For the full year, we expect to achieve the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range that we communicated during our last earnings call.","Turning to outlook, the first quarter reflected more challenging operating environments in markets like China and Brazil. We see that our strategies are working, however, in key markets like North America, Japan and India. Further, our strategies allow us to scenario plan to adjust to market dynamics. Therefore, we are maintaining our currency neutral outlook we previously provided; however, we are updating the expected impact from currency. We expect organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable currency neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a three to four point structural headwind to income before tax.","Moving to currencies, while current spot rates have improved since our fourth quarter call, these rates have been extremely volatile as well. Therefore, I will caveat our currency outlook, knowing that it is definitely subject to change. We will update you accordingly as we move through the year.","Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we now expect the full year impact of currency to be a two to three point headwind on net revenue versus our previous expectation of four points. Relative to income before tax, we now expect an eight to nine point headwind as compared to our previous expectation of a nine point headwind.","As you model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. We expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a two to three point headwind on net revenue and a three point headwind on income before tax. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a two to three point headwind on net revenue and a six point headwind on operating income. In addition, we will be cycling the euro debt remeasurement gain we recorded in other income during the second quarter of 2015. For this reason, we expect an 11 point currency headwind on income before tax as we cycle this gain.","In closing, we are working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value and leading the system so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower risk, higher return business with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from John Faucher of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. So as I look at your revenue performance this quarter, I guess it highlights a concern that maybe the portfolio is still a little too CSD heavy, despite some of the great results on the non-carb side. And James talked about this at CAGNY, 5% NARTD dollar growth longer-term, but given the fact that you guys still under-index on the non-carb side, that's providing really the majority of the growth in both dollars and volume for the category, don't you need to, I guess, further accelerate the shift in the portfolio away from CSDs, sparkling, into non-carb, and is there a way to move that faster? And I guess on top of that, obviously the weakness in the CSD side this quarter with flat volumes, what do you think is really the right volume number on the CSD side going forward that gets you to your algorithm? Thank you.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, John. It's Muhtar here. I'll just preface just by saying the following and then pass over to James, but first, you know how much we've done and how much we focus on creating successful brands in our still portfolio. And of the 20 $1 billion brands we have now, 14 of them are still brands. And our still business is performing well.","And whether we take value-added dairy or enhanced hydration, or juices and nectars, or juice drinks, we play in all of those categories. In 2015, we gained share in all of those categories. And if you look at whether it's in developed markets or emerging or developing, our still beverage portfolio is being enhanced all the time and even in the case of waters and premium waters from Japan all the way through to Latin America, performing very well.","You just heard now again that we've invested. We just recently invested, as you know, in Suja in the United States. We've invested in Chi and Culiangwang in China. And we continue to always reference that, wherever we look and if there's opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions, we will look at those favorably. If there are also opportunities for organic development of brands, like fairlife, we will certainly look at those also favorably, as we've done.","So I think we're very satisfied with our portfolio. And certainly, we've got more work to do, as we said in the call and in the remarks. But right now, we feel that our portfolio is being transformed very well, and transitioned very well. And we're in a pretty good place, and more work to continue. James?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, just let me add one last thought perhaps, John. At CAGNY, we talked about, we have a 50% share of sparkling and a 15% share of the stills, but I think it's worth remembering that, over the last 15 years, we've gone from stills being less, a single digit part of our portfolio, to now over 25% of our portfolio. So I think there's a long-term track record of generating growth and value in stills. Even given today our market position, we expect to continue to grow faster in stills. As we said in the call, we are gaining share in every subcategory, apart from one where we held it, and we'll continue to look for bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate our growth. So I think it's going to continue to be a faster growing part of the business.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And also, just on sparkling, you asked, we certainly see also continued growth opportunities in our sparkling portfolio. And that is naturally, with the focus on revenues, it will skew more towards revenues, but certainly also, as we have demonstrated and with our new campaign, Taste the Feeling campaign, just being launched, and everything else that we're doing in terms of the investments with our aligned partners, we see growth opportunities in revenue and also in volume, in our sparkling beverage portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers of UBS. Your line is now open.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Maybe sticking with the top line, I just want to better understand where you expect to source top-line acceleration from over the remainder of the year, against a difficult macro environment and increasingly difficult year-over-year compares? I get that you were probably closer to 4% organic growth this quarter, excluding the calendar shift and the price\/mix drag of BIG, but BIG will be with you over the balance of the year. So in that context, is there truly enough in your control to have confidence in sequential improvement, or are you expecting the macros to improve? And I guess, alongside all that, is it fair to say that you're guiding us more towards the lower end of 4% to 5% at this point, versus the midpoint?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steve. It's Muhtar. Well, first, I think we did expect the first quarter to trend slightly below the full year, driven by a couple of things. One, the macros are trending toward the bottom in the first quarter, recognizing that the environment continues to be challenging. But we will continue to monitor that closely. The launch of our new campaign in the first quarter will certainly benefit the back half of the year. The benefit of Olympics marketing as we move into the second and third quarter; one less selling day, which certainly you also mentioned; and I think we are confident, definitely, in the strategy and initiatives in place to support our growth targets over the course of the year, and believe that we will land again in the corridor that we stated in the past, in February. James or Kathy, you want to add anything?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","No.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Question on North America, we now have the filings you've given us and we can, therefore, see the level of profitability here in CCR, which is pretty low. I think, when you back out the numbers, you get kind of like a 2% operating margin. And I'm sure there's some accounting matters in there that this isn't the forum to go into, but it does raise the question of what really has been going on in terms of profitability for CCR here in North America. If you think it's appropriate, I think it would be helpful to talk a little bit about the trends in that business as you've seen them, now that we're seeing a level \u2013 the margin I'm getting is a 2% operating margin. So can you just talk a little bit about the trends and what you think they reflect? It certainly speaks well to what you get left behind, if you will, but it raises questions about what someone might pay for that kind of business.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So sure, Mark. We look at the margins and CCR, there are three primary drivers of what you're seeing. First of all, we have shifted some of the territories, so we have transitioned some territories to-date. And we did that, obviously, before we put the financials out there earlier this quarter. Then if you remember, we incurred, back in early 2010, 2011, 2012 time period, there was a significant hit to us from a run-up in commodity prices that certainly adversely impacted margins. And then I guess the third thing I'd say was we had to incur incremental costs to prepare that business for now being ready to be refranchised and to strengthen that business. And I think what we are seeing is improvement in the results that I would say today. But those three things really are impacting what you saw in the financials that we put out there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to go back and tie, I guess, a couple of comments that have been made about the effect that BIG had on organic sales growth for the quarter. So I just want to make sure I understand it correctly. If we look at sales excluding BIG and we add back the effect of the extra day, organic sales growth was around 4%. Is that correct?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","It's James here. Look, volume grew 2%. Core price\/mix was 2%. So that's the right answer.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. So I guess one of the markets where you pointed out you were taking more actions is Europe, and certainly, from a top line perspective, continues to be a pretty challenged market, deflationary pressure there. So wanted to just get a little bit more color, just really what are some of the more tangible actions that we can see? And how much dollars are really going in in terms of the marketing investments that we should expect to see some of that improvement really coming through and how long that would sort of take as you think about for the balance of the year?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Judy. It's James here. A couple of things on Europe, one, it is worth noting that in this quarter, there was a disruption to the business in GB due to the supply chain. So there's a one-off impact that we expect to see not recurring in the balance of the year. So I think that's worth taking into account. And it was a material impact.","Now, as looking for the rest of the year, you will see in the numbers we had pretty decent price\/mix in Europe in this quarter. And we are also looking to see volume improving versus the first (34:40) quarter, not just because of the supply situation, but also the new programs, the launch of the new marketing campaign, the launch of a new Coke Zero variant starting in GB, plus the Europe Cup, which will be in France this year. And, of course, shortly, we will hopefully complete Coca-Cola European Partners, where there are very strong plans being put in place to drive that forward. So I think some temporary factors and the buildup of our ongoing investments should drive a better result in Europe in the balance of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to delve a bit more into the Asia Pacific pricing number in the quarter, a negative 5%. Can you run through how much of that was due to geographic or product mix or other factors and thoughts going forward in the remainder of the year on if that pricing pressure will moderate and how mix should trend in that segment?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure, James here. I'll come to the numerical piece. Let me start off with the conceptual. (35:54) The Asia Pacific price\/mix is always a little bit of an oddity, because it's a group that brings together Japan and Australia, which are very high revenue markets that don't grow as quickly, along with a lot of emerging markets, not just China but India, Indonesia and the Philippines, which grow much faster. So there's a kind of an ongoing mechanical effect that creates a negative price\/mix for this group, which you can see over the years in Asia Pacific. So in 2013, full year, it was minus 4%. In 2014, it was minus 2%. In 2015, it was minus 2%. In the first quarter of 2016, obviously, it was minus 5%, but it was cycling a very atypical plus 3% in the first quarter of last year. So I think what you will see is in the future quarters, it is a little volatile and bumpy, but the long-term trend is for a negative price\/mix in Asia because of the dynamic of the fast growth of the emerging markets versus Japan and Australia.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So I'm still getting a lot of skepticism from investors about the 4% to 5% organic revenue growth target for the year. And openly, you don't sound 100% confident and it feels like there's a lot of kind of messiness and moving parts. So can you try again? Can you talk about what specifically you're seeing right now that gives you confidence in the 4% to 5% organic sales growth for the year? I mean, clearly, whether it's a 3% or a 4%, you kind of delivered a 3% in some sense this quarter, so you're below pace, so maybe in that you can tackle where you expect Eurasia Africa to get to, why you'd expect it to get better. Europe, you mentioned you're going to invest more and you hope that to get better, but we've sometimes heard that before. So why is it going be better in Europe?","And then, maybe as a jumping off point as well, you can talk about what you're learning in North America, because that seems to be doing better, for sure. And a footnote, I'm not quite sure what you grow organically North America because you want us to add three points back for concentrate sales up to unit case sales for one day missing. I'm not quite sure how to get there, so some explanation there would be great. But just more specifics very clearly on what gives you the confidence in your top-line target for the year. Thanks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ali, I'll start just by saying, as I indicated, first, on the core, with one less selling day and on the core price\/mix of the core business without BIG, we certainly did get to the 4% in this quarter. So what we feel looking at the downhill comparisons and looking at also all the programs in place, looking at how our business performs in all the different quarters and different groups, we feel confident that we still will achieve what we have said in February in terms of the top line for the full year.","The marketing program, the additional marketing, the new marketing program, that is just being launched and then not having the one less selling day and then also the continued franchising and all the programs that the bottlers have in place. So our U.S. business is performing very well with its revenue growth, with its price\/mix, with its brand, with its portfolio and that will continue. We have every confidence that it will continue.","And we do believe that macros are at the bottom and that there will be in the second half a certain degree of improvement in the macros. Or even if they stay the same, we feel confident with the current macro situation that we will get to the corridor that we have indicated and shared with you in February. Any other comments, James, Kathy?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","No, I think the one thing I would add, Ali, is obviously there's a strong momentum in the North America business. We called that out as the place where the strategies are working. And then the other countries I put in the other two buckets, there's degrees of implementation of the strategy. So you can go to around the world, there were places which were struggling in 2014 and maybe even in 2015, and as we've been executing the strategy, the momentum is starting to come back to some of those countries and it's starting to build over time.","So I think, as Muhtar said, the first quarter was kind of within the envelope of expectation for our guidance. And we can see, based on what we're doing within our control, within a reasonable scenario of macros, we will stay within that corridor for the rest of the year, but in the end, I guess, only results will answer the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.","Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks. The refranchising that you announced today includes a creation of a new bottler from outside the industry. You've spoken a lot about the collective willingness of your existing bottlers to invest and a desire for more territories. So can you help us understand why you went outside of the existing system for this refranchising? And is there something you're seeing from other new bottlers that makes this more appealing to you guys?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think on that, predominantly, we have existing bottlers that are expanding, if you look at the percentages of territories that have been franchised. And then we have, in order to ensure that we can get the right level of diversity in our bottling business and the right level of also representation, we have also selected some new partners like in Florida, like in Chicago and like now the most recent one announced. And we feel that that is a healthy mix and that that's also a healthy balance. And we have, very much, the right approach and the right alignment with our expanding bottling partners, whether they are just entering our system or they are proven expanding bottlers, like the ones that we've mostly franchised new distribution to in the past year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you guys give us a little bit more granular bridge on the gross margin decline this quarter and then maybe some broad stroke outlook for the rest of the year? I know the comps sort of get easier as the year progresses, but it'd be really helpful to just aggregate the FX impacts, some of the refranchise impacts and then kind of what you're thinking for the rest of the year.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Kathy?","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Certainly, Bill. So really, the gross margin decline is really impacted by just two things really. It's currency and it's the structural impact. Currency, I think added like 80 basis points \u2013 would have added 80 basis points back to our gross margin and the structural impact actually would have added significantly more than that. So it's really as simple as that. It's really about currency and our structural adjustments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies. Your line's now open.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So question, how much slip-down in the top line in the quarter was macro slowing in the NARTD category versus execution? You spoke to share gains in both stills and sparklings, so it would certainly seem to be just broader slowing in the category. And then, of course, there's been a lot of discussion on the top line. It would seem like the lower end of your 4% to 5% organic sales outlook would be prudent at this point. So a follow-up question on that, how much visibility do you have on productivity and other levers to deliver the high end of the EPS growth guidance range, should you come in toward the lower end on the top line? Thank you.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Let me take a bite of that, Kevin. I think the answer on the slowdown, we don't get all the category numbers necessarily. And but clearly, as we're gaining share in that top-line number, there's got to be some weakness in the category versus the long-term target of 5%. I think we talked a little bit about that at CAGNY about how our expectations for 2016 and 2017 were below the long-term 5% dollar value for NARTD. So there's definitely some of that. And I think you can see the macros influencing the industry in the sense that it's the number of the emerging markets, particularly the commodity ones, where we've had the slowdown, and that's clearly flowing through into the industry.","I think what I would highlight is, we're going to focus on what we can control. We have a long-standing game plan of what to do in countries that are in crisis, focusing on really gaining a lot of share, to set ourselves up profitably for the long term. It's worked in a lot of countries in the past, and it seems to be working now as we gain share in the Chinas and the Russias and the Brazils. It'll pay off in the end. I think the visibility, look, we're managing to our corridors at the top and the bottom line. We feel that this quarter was within the envelope. Clearly the macros, slightly better, slightly worse, will be an influence on where we end up. But we've got a lot of management left to do in the balance of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Could you just talk a little bit more about, now that you've unveiled kind of the one brand packaging in, I guess it's being launched in Mexico, expectations for that, and maybe what you've learned as you've tested it out? And I say that just \u2013 I understand it's certainly going to be more efficient from an advertising, marketing front to kind of, on the one brand strategy, but didn't know if you expected a sales lift, or if there's been any confusion from consumers as they've seen it, just kind of thoughts as we start to launch that?","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Bill, this is Muhtar. We said from the beginning, first, that the new campaign is not just a new campaign, but also, it's a new strategy, in terms of the one brand strategy, and that it's got many advantages. And we expect it to give us significant efficiencies and effectiveness. But also, in terms of how we communicate with our consumers, it will certainly play into that as we execute the strategy. And we've now launched the new campaign. And then I'll let James comment in terms of, you asked the Mexico-specific example, but also, there's also many other places where it's being tested, and tested favorably. Go ahead, James.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Bill, a few thoughts. One, the initial pilot markets, the two sources of very clear impact were, one, it helped us expand and grow the zero calorie variant of Coca-Cola by driving availability and driving trial. So we would expect to see benefits on the zero sugar variants. The second big area of benefit is, it helps us create what we would call corporate blocking. In other words, we execute in stores all the variants of Coca-Cola together as one big block, has a much greater store impact, visual impact, engagement with people who are shopping the stores.","I think slightly more strategically, and back to Muhtar's point, this is an implementation of a strategic idea. I'm sure we'll evolve it. I'm sure we'll make it better, but it's the strategic idea that's important. It's not just about the efficiency in the advertising. It's about helping consumers join and stay in the Coca-Cola franchise, whatever of the ingredients they want to manage, including their management of added sugars, whether that's in drinks or any other categories that have added sugar in. So this has a number of benefits that are going to play out strategically, and we will keep improving the execution.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Amit Sharma of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Kathy N. Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning, Amit.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","James, I just wanted to, as we look to the rest of the year and 2017 as well, can you also talk about the progress of the small pack architecture? Like, we've heard a lot about that in North America, but if you can give us a little bit more detail as, where are we with that in rest of your divisions? And is that a source of incremental growth or price\/mix as we go forward?","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes. A few thoughts then. Clearly, North America has had a lot of traction in pushing forward smaller packages, away from the traditional two-liter and multi-pack of cans. It is worth noting that some of those packages are premium packages, and some of those are intended to create affordability or low price point entry points for the category, whether it be the mini cans. And that combination does generally help price\/mix. You can see that starting to roll out across other parts of the world.","I think Latin America's traditionally been very good at that. You do see more of it coming in to Asia Pacific and Eurasia on a global basis. The immediate consumption packages outpaced general volume growth. So it is part of our strategy to push more into smaller packages.","Just this last month, India launched a new technology, a very small package with a special technology that allows a much longer shelf life in ambient environment of rural India, so it will be able to get to many more places.","So, a lot of innovation in the technology, a lot of innovation in the package, in the sizes and the occasions and the channels, so that we can bring down the price points for affordability, take advantage of premiumization, and also offer people the right amount of any beverage that they want to actually consume.","Amit Sharma - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One point I'd just add, Amit, would be that the U.S. compared to the rest of the world, the prevalence of small packages was much less in the United States three, four years ago compared to the rest of the world. If you look at Europe and places like Spain, or if you look at many countries in Latin America, you had much more prevalence of smaller packages than in the United States.","So in a way, the United States in the last four, five years, but particularly the last two and a half years has moved very rapidly to the 12-ounce glass to the 8-ounce glass to the 7.5-ounce can to the 8.5-ounce aluminum bottle. And that has really worked and those are all growing double digits in the United States because the consumer and customer preferences, and also benefiting our system because they have a higher price per liter. And so that's in a way playing out from what was already prevailing in many parts of the world in the past.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.

Waller - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Morning.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the health of brand Coca-Cola. In your press release, you called out softness either around the total brand family or Trademark Coca-Cola in a number of geographies. And while I appreciate that you have a lot of new initiatives, between Taste the Feeling and new packaging. In the past, you guys have said that it does take time for some of those advertising initiatives to actually gain traction and show up in brand health and volume. So how should we think about the trajectory of Trademark Coca-Cola as you roll out these new initiatives, please? Thank you.","James Quincey - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Vivien, I think a couple of things. One, obviously most of our campaigns are weighted into the second, third and fourth quarters. So those are the biggest quarters. And even Taste the Feeling, we announced it this quarter, but it's only really hitting at towards the end of the quarter and rolling out in the rest of the year, as with the Euro Cup and the Olympics. So I think a lot of the programs are going in later this year. They, obviously, the execution is there. So we would expect to see better performance from Trademark Coca-Cola going into the downhill.","I would make one other note, which is the relative change in where global growth is coming from, or industry growth is coming from, a little more in developed and developing, a little less in emerging, tends to create a kind of a portfolio effect that weighs a little more against sparkling and, therefore, Coca-Cola, because those emerging markets tend to be more sparkling orientated. And so you see North America, Latin America, Japan, with stronger stills growth. So we do expect to see growth. We would expect to see it coming back. There is a geographic mix impact, but when we look at the markets, we believe we will be back on track with Coca-Cola.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on the questions on the one brand strategy and specifically ask when you look at, let's say, the full implementation of that two, three years from now, do you think the benefit will be 50%-50% between cost savings and efficiency and greater demand or how do you see that breaking out? And specifically also in terms of the answer to the prior question on that, how exactly is this strategy helping drive trial and availability for Coke Zero? Thank you.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Robert, it's Muhtar here. I think, first, in terms of the efficiencies, the most important benefit will be simpler and less fragmented communication with the consumer. That will be the biggest benefit, but also it will certainly help create more efficiencies and effectiveness in our non-working EME (55:32) and, therefore, will also provide some productivity in that respect. But the most important benefit will certainly be a less cluttered and better and more direct communication with the consumer base.","And in terms of the trial of product, that will certainly come as a result of that, of what James mentioned in terms of better presence in the store, in terms of better merchandising, in terms of better interruptions in the store and also in terms of the communication piece. And we believe that the most important benefit of this will ensue and will come to brands like Coca-Cola Zero with more availability, better communication and have the broad perspective of the global campaign as opposed to the every different brand under the Coca-Cola trademark having their own campaigns. That will be how I think the benefits will come. And we trialed and pilots so far have proven that in Europe and other parts of the world.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remarks.","Ahmet Muhtar Kent - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, James, Kathy and Tim.

At the same time, we continue to evolve and strengthen our global bottling system as we accelerate refranchising and as we return to a predominantly concentrate-driven model with significantly higher margins and returns.","We remain confident that the long-term dynamics of our industry are promising. And we absolutely believe that The Coca-Cola Company is well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareowners.","As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.","Operator","Thank you, speakers.

Mr. Kelly, you may begin.","Jackson Kelly","Good morning, and thank you for being with us today. I'm joined by Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Fayard, our Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.","In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules on our company website at www.thecoca-colacompany.com under the Reports and Financial Information tab in the Investors section, which reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures that may be referred to by our senior executives in our discussions this morning, and from time to time in discussing our financial performance to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information.","Now let me turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by saying that we're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. We continue to deliver consistent quality results, with our business growing worldwide volume by 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. Importantly, we realized positive growth across all 5 of our geographic operating groups this quarter despite facing a still uncertain global economy. Together with our global system, we are operating from a position of real strength.","This past quarter, we built on this advantage by once again leading industry growth and extending our volume and value share gains globally in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. We gained global share in the sparkling beverage category, where our portfolio is up 3% in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis.","To put this in perspective, our global sparkling business has generated nearly 450 million incremental cases year-to-date or the equivalent of adding another Russia to our global business. And this growth has been consistently and reliably led by brand Coca-Cola, which has grown every quarter over the past 3.5 years and is up a healthy 3% year-to-date. We also gained global share in the still beverage category, where our portfolio grew a solid 10% in the quarter and 9% year-to-date. This quarter's still beverage results were well balanced, with high single-digit growth in juice and juice drinks and sports drinks, as well as double-digit growth in the water, energy and ready-to-drink tea categories. We are committed to striking a sound balance between the growth of our sparkling and still beverages. We see this balance as the key to growing our total business while sustainably enhancing our margins and profits, in line with our 2020 Vision.","We're also committed to providing consumers more choice in brands, beverage types and calories or no calories, all of which contributes new growth to our business. The balance results that we have achieved across our portfolio demonstrate that we are delivering on this commitment.","As we've shared during our prior earnings calls this year, we recognize that consumers across the globe are still feeling the effects of the prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing cooling of the economy in China and a mild recovery in the United States. We believe these global macroeconomic pressures will extend through 2012 and likely into 2013. Despite this, we are heartened by our ability to consistently deliver quality results, as well as by our global systems commitment to invest in the business for the long-term growth.","We're also encouraged by how we have successfully and systematically adapted our business model these past few years to readily address the changing demands of the global marketplace. First, we better positioned our company to capture North America's long-term growth opportunity by acquiring CCE's North America business. Our North America business has delivered volume growth every quarter since we executed this important transaction. Second, we broadened the relevance of our Bottling Investments Group, evolving it further from its initial role of fixing challenging markets to a more significant role of spiriting our growth in select strategic markets, such as India and China.","Constant renewal is in our DNA. Now with solid fundamentals and real momentum in our business, we are ready to take the next step towards our 2020 Vision. As announced last quarter, effective January 1, 2013, we're organizing our company around 3 major operating businesses: Coca-Cola International, consisting of our Europe, Pacific and Eurasia & Africa operations; Coca-Cola Americas, consisting of our North America and Latin America operations; and Bottling Investments Group, which will continue to oversee our company-owned bottling operations outside of North America. By consolidating leadership of our global operations under 2 large and similar-sized geographic regions, as well as in our Bottling Investments Group, we will streamline reporting lines and intensify our focus on key markets. This newly evolved structure will also enable us to better leverage synergies and more flexibly adjust our business strategies within those geographies in the future. All of this will further strengthen our efforts to achieve long-term sustainable growth as we advance our momentum towards our 2020 Vision.","Now let's review our performance across our global markets in more detail, beginning with our flagship market, North America. This past quarter, our business in North America delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of growth, up 2% for the quarter and year-to-date. We also captured volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages while sustaining a positive 3% price mix for our total North America beverage business. Our growth in North America was once again driven by our still beverage portfolio, which was up 7% this quarter. This is the 10th consecutive quarter that our North America still beverage portfolio has either maintained or gained both volume and value share. In sports drinks, POWERADE grew volume 9% this quarter while also leading the North America sports drink category in absolute unit case volume growth for the fourth consecutive quarter.","Our juice and juice drinks portfolio in North America outpaced the category, up 6% for the quarter while gaining both volume and value share. Our positive result in this category was broad-based, driven by strong growth in our juice drinks business, volume and value share growth across our Minute Maid Light portfolio, and further value share gains in the 100% chilled orange juice segment.","Our glac\u00e9au brands were up mid-single digits in North America once again this quarter, gaining both volume and value share, and led by the 18th straight quarter of double-digit growth for our premium smartwater brand. The rest of our North America water business grew 4% in the quarter, led by DASANI, which maintained its premium price position, and saw further gains across key brand equity measures, driven by consumer awareness of our innovative PlantBottle packaging.","And our key portfolio in North America sustained its momentum, up double digits while gaining both volume and value share. This result was led by Gold Peak, which has now grown strong double digits for 22 consecutive quarters. Our sparkling beverages in North America were even in the third quarter, a sequential improvement over our second quarter results and ahead of the broader sparkling beverage industry. Importantly, our sparkling beverage portfolio earned a positive 3% price mix in both the quarter and year-to-date in what continues to be a rational pricing environment. Coca-Cola Zero growth accelerated, up 9% this quarter. We also sustained our momentum behind Fanta, which was up mid-single digits for the third consecutive quarter.","We are encouraged by our consistent progress in North America, and we remain positive about the long-term outlook for this very important market.","We're also leading the effort across communities in the United States to tackle obesity. Last week, we joined fellow members of the beverage industry to announce the first-of-its-kind partnership with the cities of Chicago and San Antonio, encouraging the citizens of these cities to be more health aware and physically active. We introduced a city-to-city wellness challenge, as well as our new Calories Count Vending Program that will provide consumers with the choices and information they need to choose beverages that are right for themselves and for their families. When it comes to non-communicable diseases such as obesity, we know that there are no simple answers. But we also know that a lack of physical activity is a primary contributor to obesity. We also know that there is a lack of understanding of how many calories people consume in a day. As such, our company is committed to partnering with customers and cities to promote active, healthy, balanced lifestyles, as well as making calorie information more transparent.","Now let me turn to our Pacific Group, which grew 3% in the third quarter and 6% year-to-date. Our business in Japan was up 2% this quarter, bringing our year-to-date volume growth in Japan to 3%. Japan has now delivered volume growth in 8 of the last 9 quarters. Our business in Japan continues to gain share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages this quarter and also grew both volume and value share in still beverages. This positive result was driven by the sustained momentum of our Georgia coffee brand and water and sports drink category offerings, which led to consistent volume growth across channels, including drugstores, convenience retail outlet, as well as supermarkets. Looking ahead and consistent with what we said during our last earnings call, we expect our fourth quarter volume results in Japan to moderate somewhat below our year-to-date trend as we cycle strong growth from prior year. Having said that, our business in Japan is on track to deliver full year low-single-digit growth.","Moving now to China. Our business delivered 2% volume growth this quarter, cycling last year's double-digit growth. On a year-to-date basis, our volume in China has grown 6%, cycling strong 15% growth from last year. And once again, this quarter, we captured both volume and value share in sparkling beverages. Importantly and in alignment with our strategic priorities in China, we are growing transactions ahead of volume, with total transactions up 10% year-to-date. One package that is helping us deliver against that strategy is our 300 ml, milliliter, package. On a year-to-date basis, this new package has generated over 0.5 billion incremental transactions in China. We will keep driving our 300 ml package to provide consumers with a great offering at the right price point while also building our brands and the sparkling category in a healthy way over the long term.","As we look ahead to the next 6 months, it is reasonable to expect that China's ongoing economic slowdown may have a short-term effect on our industry and on our business. In our view, the Chinese economy is undergoing a natural and necessary economic transition as the government places greater emphasis on controlling long-term inflation over injecting short-term economic stimulus. While the Chinese economy undergoes this period of transition, we have every confidence in the long-term resilience of our business for 3 key reasons. First, our brands in China are strong. In our latest survey of consumers aged 12 to 49 years old, Coca-Cola was rated as both the most favorite sparkling and nonalcoholic ready-to-drink brand. In this same survey, Minute Maid was rated as the most favorite juice drinks brand.","Second, we hold the leadership position in the sparkling category. This is the ninth consecutive quarter in which our sparkling beverages in China either maintained or gained both volume and value share. And third, our system in China is strategically focused, well aligned and committed to invest for sustainable long-term growth. As such, we remain encouraged and excited about our opportunities in this region and continue to believe that China will serve as the long-term growth driver for our business.","I also want to share our perspective on a few other markets in the Pacific that are exhibiting strong growth, starting with Thailand, which again delivered double-digit growth, up a sound 19% this quarter. Thailand growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, which was up 26% in the quarter and 34% year-to-date. I also want to highlight our result in South Korea, another market which has grown double digits in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. As additional context, our business in South Korea has nearly doubled since 2007. This is a testament to our system's ability to implement a robust set of occasion-based price and packaging offerings to consumers and drive growth across this region. We're excited about the growth opportunities in both Thailand and South Korea, and we'll keep investing for the future in these vibrant markets.","Moving now to Latin America, our volume grew 5% for both the quarter, as well as year-to-date. As in previous quarters, this growth was led by brand Coca-Cola, up 3% in both the quarter and year-to-date. In Latin America, we once again captured both volume and value share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. Our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Mexico and Brazil, were both up a solid 6% this past quarter while also growing volume and value share in sparkling, still and also the entire nonalcoholic ready-to-drink category. Importantly, our growth in both these markets was well balanced across all categories. Mexico grew sparkling beverages 3%, and still beverages were up double digits for the quarter. Similarly, Brazil delivered 4% sparkling beverage growth and double-digit still beverage growth for the quarter. Brazil was up 5% on a year-to-date basis. In light of these strong results, we now expect our 2012 growth in Brazil to be in the mid-single digits.","Let me also share our perspective on a few other markets in Latin America that we see as great opportunities for long-term growth; specifically, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Together, these markets are 1\/3 the size of our current Brazilian business. Our system is very focused on implementing the same winning strategies in these markets that have driven such positive results in Brazil this past decade. We will keep investing in Colombia, investing in Ecuador and Peru and across the entire Latin America region, as we execute our 2020 Vision. As such, it is easy to see why we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity represented by these 3 dynamic Latin American markets.","Our Eurasia & Africa business extended its strong momentum, growing a solid 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date, including 11% year-to-date growth for brand Coca-Cola. During the quarter, our business in Eurasia & Africa grew both volume and value share in total  nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. On a country level, India once again led this group's performance, delivering balanced and consistent quality growth. Our business in India was up 15% for the quarter, with double-digit growth and volume and value share gains realized across both sparkling and still beverages. Sparkling beverage growth in India was led by brand Coca-Cola, up over 30% for the second consecutive quarter, as we sustained our focus on immediate consumption offerings. And still beverages in India were led by our juice drink brands, with Maaza up over 20% again in the quarter. Russia was up 7% in both the quarter and year-to-date, with the strong result driven by the further acceleration of brand Coca-Cola, which grew 18% in the quarter and 20% year-to-date. Like last quarter, we observed similarly strong results across our broader sparkling portfolio in Russia, with Fanta up 15% and Sprite up 7%. And our Dobriy juice brand built on its recent success, delivering 16% growth in the quarter and raising this brand's year-to-date performance up to 12%.","Our strong performance across the Eurasia & Africa Group was supported by our partnership with Aujan. We're excited about the further growth opportunities represented by our partnership with Aujan, which holds the #1 position in the still beverage business across the entire Middle East. And our collaborations in Eurasia & Africa extend beyond business relationships, as exemplified by our partnership with The Global Fund to bring critical medicines to rural Africa. At last month's Clinton Global Initiative, we announced our plans to expand the reach of project Last Mile, which was established in 2010 to help Tanzania's government-run medicine distribution network build a more efficient supply chain by leveraging our expansive distribution system and core business expertise. Nearly 20 million Africans have benefited from this partnership since 2010. The newest phase of this partnership will increase the availability of medicines to 75% of Tanzania and expand the project's reach to Ghana and Mozambique. The success of this project demonstrates our belief in the power of civil society, government and the private sector, or what we call the Golden Triangle, working closely together to solve real global issues and problems.","Moving now to Europe. We saw our business return to growth, up a solid 1% for the quarter. These results were achieved despite the continuation of unseasonably poor weather in the first half of the quarter, as well as the impact of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Even with these external headwinds, all 4 of our European business units saw positive growth this quarter, demonstrating our ability to execute with excellence across this entire region.","Germany once again led the region, up 3% for the quarter and 2% year-to-date. This marks Germany's seventh consecutive quarter of positive growth. And while our business in Germany is winning today, we are connecting with consumers to ensure continued success for tomorrow. An example of this was our award-winning Coca-Cola summer campaign in Germany, which was named the best 2012 out-of-home campaign by Germany's leading marketing industry weekly. Understanding that music is a passion point for teenagers, our campaign in Germany leveraged our global partnership with Spotify, a leading music streaming platform, to offer teenagers access to millions of songs and exclusive Coca-Cola content. This campaign generated more than 1.5 billion contacts and reached more than 90% of all teenagers in Germany as they created their own Coca-Cola playlists and shared them with their friends via Facebook.","We are successfully applying the same consumer engagement principles across regions, as exemplified by our highly successful global activation of the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games. Our internal indicators show that the marketing programs we executed across almost 100 markets drove global improvements in recruitment, frequency and brand equity with our consumers. Our television commercials were acknowledged by Ace Metrix as consistently being among the highest-rated ads during the Olympics. Our efforts across the digital and mobile space were also recognized. We received a Digital Gold Award by Unmetric, a brand tracker, who analyzed the social media performance of every major sponsor. And we were honored with the Global Marketer of the Year award by the Mobile Marketing Association while also taking home a Best in Show nod at their awards ceremony for our Olympic Games Move to the Beat campaign.","Our social media programs' success goes well beyond our Olympics activation. Over just the last 9 months, Coca-Cola's Facebook page has grown by over 40%. This past quarter, Coca-Cola became the first brand to achieve over 50 million likes. And as of today, this number has increased further, surpassing 52 million. This rise parallels the growth of our social engagements footprint across all major social networks that generate conversation and content with our consumers. The recent study by PQ Media found that Coca-Cola was the #1 brand in social media impressions by nearly a 2:1 margin over the next most-mentioned brand.","Another area of emphasis for our system is to support sustainable communities by replenishing 100% of the water used in our finished beverages by 2020. To advance this goal, we recently announced the global clean water partnership with DEKA Research & Development to bring clean water to communities where potable water access is limited. This partnership will leverage innovative technology to deliver clean drinking water to schools, health clinics and community centers in rural regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. When fully scaled, this partnership is expected to add more than 0.5 billion liters of clean drinking water per year to the global water supply.","While water is the lifeblood of our business, we're committed to doing our part to replenish the water we use and give back to communities we proudly serve. By partnering with DEKA, we hope to empower local entrepreneurs with a specific focus on women by delivering, as well as maintaining, a clean water solution for communities and improving the daily lives of thousands of people around the world.","Finally, we were humbled and honored earlier this month when brand Coca-Cola topped the list of Interbrand's Best Global Brands rankings. Interbrand has rated Coca-Cola as the #1 brand on its list every year since 2000. This is a testament to our ongoing commitment to invest in our brands, innovate our marketing and engage with our consumers in a sustainable manner that builds long-term value.","Certainly, the world has been very volatile from a macroeconomic perspective over the last 4 years. As a global company and also on behalf of all our associates, I'm pleased to say that we continue to crack the calculus for growth in this challenging and volatile environment. We've done this by consistently increasing our investments in our system and our brands to ensure that our global portfolio is more relevant and healthier today than it's ever been during our history. We remain resolutely focused on ensuring that we leverage our unique heritage and fuse it with what is expected by our consumers today in order to earn and sustain our place in their daily lives today and tomorrow.","I want to thank all of our consumers who invite us into their lives 1.8 billion times each and every day. And I want to thank all of our shareholders for your interest and investment in our company. It's a great responsibility. You can rest assured that our entire leadership team is working diligently to protect and grow the value of your investment in our company, both today and for tomorrow.","So with that, let me now turn the call over to Gary.","Gary P. Fayard","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of solid performance results, reflecting our global system's ability to consistently execute our strategic plans while managing through a still unpredictable macroeconomic environment. As you'll recall, I provided a commentary about the third quarter during our last earnings call because we knew there were several unique timing and cycling factors to consider when modeling the third quarter. Taking these factors into account, I'm pleased to say that our third quarter results were consistent with the commentary we provided in our last earnings call. And as such, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year volume, revenue and operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets.","So let me start our review with our third quarter results with our comparable earnings per share, which came in at $0.51 this quarter and at $1.56 on a year-to-date basis, up 2% year-to-date despite facing considerable currency headwinds throughout the year. Our comparable currency-neutral operating income was up 1% this quarter, in line with our expectations. And on a comparable basis, the impact of currency on this quarter's operating income results was a 7% headwind.","On a year-to-date basis, our comparable currency-neutral operating income is up 4%, also in line with our expectations. As per my previous comment, we expect to deliver full year operating income results in line with our long-term growth targets, and we understand that this implies we will achieve double-digit comparable currency-neutral operating income growth in the fourth quarter.","Comparable currency-neutral net revenues grew 6% in the quarter. The currency impact on this quarter's comparable net revenue results was a 5% headwind. On a year-to-date basis, comparable currency-neutral net revenue growth is also at 6%. As we discuss profit and revenue growth rates, let me take a moment to remind everyone that the profits and revenues generated by some of our more recent strategic partnerships, including Aujan and Innocent, among others, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. So while unit cases related to these businesses are fully reflected in our volume growth, their associated concentrate sales or concentrate gallons-associated profits and revenues are not currently contributing to our operating income and revenue growth rates. Instead, these profits are consolidated into our equity income results. While this did not materially impact our third quarter results, I think it's important because there is an impact on growth rates.","Returning now to a review of our third quarter results, our concentrate sales came in slightly ahead of unit case volume by approximately 0.5%. As a reminder, growth rates for concentrate sales and unit cases can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Having said that, concentrate sales are in line with unit cases year-to-date, and we expect our full year concentrate sales growth to be in line with unit case volume growth.","As for our consolidated price mix, this came in slightly positive in the quarter, rounding to even, consistent with outlook we provided in our last quarter call. On a year-to-date basis, our consolidated price mix is up 2%. We continue to expect our full year 2012 consolidated price mix results to come in between 1% and 2%, in line with our long-term target range.","Our third quarter comparable gross margins were in line with our second quarter comparable gross margins. This was a slight improvement over the estimate we provided during our last earnings call, as we successfully offset some of the currency and mix shift headwinds faced by our business. For the full year, we still expect our comparable gross margins to come in below our second and third quarter comparable gross margins.","On comparable currency-neutral SG&A expenses, they were up 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. These results include a mid-single-digit increase in our third quarter direct marketing expenses, as we continue to invest in the health and strength of our brands. Our third quarter SG&A also reflects an increase due to the timing of certain operating expenses, as well as the cost of adding incremental feet on the street, primarily in North America, in support of our growing business. And one point of both our quarter and year-to-date SG&A rate is related to the impact of structural items, primarily in our Bottling Investments Group and North American business. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect our full year SG&A to come in close to our current year-to-date rate. Our operating expense leverage was minus 4 points this quarter, right in line with the minus 3- to a minus 5-point range that we estimated during our last earnings call.","As we've stated in our last call, we expect this trend to reverse in the fourth quarter, as we benefit from having 2 additional selling days. This should enable us to achieve slightly positive operating expense leverage on a full year basis. Our net interest came in at a positive $16 million in the third quarter, which is ahead of our initial expectations. This raised our year-to-date net interest income to $43 million. Looking ahead, we still expect our net interest to come in as an expense in the fourth quarter, primarily due to expected lower rates in some of our international locations, as well as ongoing currency headwinds. As a result, we're updating our full year net interest income outlook to a $30 million to $40 million range.","Our underlying effective tax rate held steady at 24%, and we expect to carry this 24% tax rate into next year. And our cash flow from operations increased a very healthy and very strong 15% year-to-date. Our year-to-date share repurchases, net of employee stock option exercises, totaled $2.3 billion, placing us well on track to achieve the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range for full year 2012 that we communicated at the outset of this year.","With regard to commodities, in our last call, we reduced the estimated full year incremental impact of our Big 4 commodity cost on our results to $300 million. Based on our latest forecast and hedge positions, we now expect our full year incremental cost of commodities will come in at approximately $225 million.","As for currencies, we previously provided an outlook that we would have an 8% to 9% headwind on an operating income in the third quarter. Today, I can confirm that currency came in slightly better than our initial outlook, resulting in a 7% headwind on third quarter comparable operating income. Based on our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of our prior year rates, we continue to expect currencies to be a mid-single-digit headwind on our operating income in both the fourth quarter and on a full year basis.","In closing, and as Muhtar said earlier, we are strategically and successfully advancing our global momentum while navigating through a challenging global economy. Our system is focused on maximizing economic profit and long-term cash flow, which allows us to continue to reinvest in the business and anticipate changes in the marketplace and competitive dynamics. While we have made several important and strategic investments this year, our financial priorities remain the same. We'll reinvest in the core business. We still expect to spend around $3 billion in capital expenditures in 2012. We will strategically invest in acquisitions and partnerships, the strength in our bottling system, and to increase our position in key nonalcoholic ready-to-drink growth categories.","We will continue to pay dividends. In 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend 8.5%, and we have returned $4.3 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2011. And further, we expect our Board of Directors to approve another quarterly dividend this week, which by the way will be paid in December of this year, as it has been every year since 1934.","And we'll continue to repurchase shares with excess cash. In our current program, which we started in 2006, we've already repurchased 533 million shares at an average price of $31.17. Since our share repurchase program started in 1984, we have repurchased 2.9 billion shares at an average price of $12.55.","As a result of our strong cash flow and that of our bottlers, I remain very confident that we can continue to invest and deliver our long-term growth targets on a sustainable basis to achieve our 2020 Vision and deliver value to our shareowners. Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today comes from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research.","William Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Gary, you talked about the double-digit operating profit growth expected for Q4 versus the 4% year-to-date,  I think it's something like 14% you need to hit the 6% lower end of the long-term range for the full year. I know you have the 2 extra days in the fourth quarter. You mentioned commodities were easing. Anything else about the timing of expenses in the fourth quarter versus year-to-date, as well as what you're lapping in the fourth quarter that'll explain the strength? I know last year's fourth quarter was strange, you had some of the timing differences related to the CCE transaction. So I don't know if that's also coming into play in the lap there.","Muhtar Kent","Bill, this is Muhtar. Let me just address a few of the things in your question, and then Gary will add some more commentary. First, I want to just ensure and stress that our business momentum continues in the midst of ongoing global economic challenges. Our system is very well aligned and on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. And the appetite for investment by our bottling partners is strong as it has ever been. And consumers' love for our brands is stronger than ever. And as such, we do remain confident in our ability to meet our long-term targets, while also delivering sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareowners. With respect -- and so -- at the outset. With respect to your question on the fourth quarter, let me -- as Gary said, we -- based on what we know today, we feel very confident that we can dock our ship for 2012, in line with our long-term growth targets for both top line and bottom in terms of operating profit. And so as Gary mentioned, that will imply having a double-digit growth in our operating income for the fourth quarter. We feel confident that, that can be achieved based on what we know and based on current trends. And that is a host of reasons; cycling of marketing expenses, as you saw total marketing for the company was up quite significantly in the fourth quarter. We had spend related to -- a onetime spend related to the Olympics, to the UEFA Cup, spending on our brands in a healthy way. And I think it is important to note that you can find many companies today around the world, around -- in the United States, around the world that can generate their profit line from no growth in top line. That is not sustainable. We feel very confident that we're doing the right thing for our business, right thing for our brand and we will dock our ship in 2012, yet again, in line with our long-term growth target, despite having -- facing significant commodity headwinds in both 2011 and cycling also on top of that, headwinds in 2012, investing in our brands, growing our top line and also earning our price\/mix. So I'd like to just emphasize that, and pass it over to Gary.","Gary P. Fayard","Okay. Bill, a couple of things. As you mentioned, the 2 extra days helped significantly, most particularly in the finished products business, so both in North America and in BIG. And we saw the opposite impact of the 1 less day in the first quarter. So the 2 extra days helped significantly. There are quite a bit of cycling things. And you see a lot of that cycling in the third quarter, which made the third quarter so complex, and that's why we try to give a lot of extra guidance at the end of the second quarter because of the third. But a lot of that is what we've been saying all year, particularly about the North America business, how we would expect to see sequential improvement in the North America business. If you remember, just it went from minus 9 to even, now to plus 3, and you'll continue to see improvement in North America. The easing of commodities is -- obviously is helping some, although a lot of that commodity now has come through, the easing has come through into the standard costs, but that's helping. And currency will help as well, in that the headwinds of currency from the minus 7 in the third quarter to lower in the fourth quarter, not just on the translation of the results but the transactional impact, particularly inside of BIG where that currency owned -- the cost of their commodities or in their cost of goods, we do not pull out our currency-neutral calculation. So the impact of currency does hurt BIG results, and so that will improve as well in the fourth quarter. So I think everything we're seeing -- the brands are healthy. We've taken pricing across the world, we've seen much better elasticities than what we've ever had historically, which give -- has given us a lot of optimism as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of North America, so it's nice to see the profitability of slight positively in the quarter. If you could just maybe talk about as you look 2013, your ability to sort of sustain kind of a positive pricing mix. And also just color as it relates to some of the commentary on channel mix that you've alluded to in the last quarter where you continue to see that pressure in terms of shift towards take home versus immediate consumption and how that's kind of playing out so far.","Muhtar Kent","Sure. Judy, let me address some of those. I'm very pleased with the performance of our United -- U.S. business. I think in terms of -- we've increased total beverage volume and value share in this past quarter once again, driven by the 2% overall volume growth, led by 7% growth in still beverages, while -- and also maintaining sparkling volume on a year-to-date basis. And this is, again, 10th quarter in a row of volume growth in our North America business. And I think we continue to build our occasion-based price, pack, channel strategy that provides increased consumer choice, along with preferred packages, preferred price points, which is very important in this economic environment. We see also some more positive trends in the channel mix compared to last quarter. I think the overall convenience retail channel in the third quarter was stronger. Industry grew almost -- certainly above 4%, almost 5%. And we have not only taken significant pricing, 3% price\/mix, up again in the quarter and maintained it for the full year, but also we are focused very much on transactions getting pricing, maintaining share and growing transactions in the United States. That's the model. That's working. And specifically, we've got a great package in the 12.5 ounce, which is retailing for under $1 in that channel, for example. And then also, we continue to expand in our food service channel with our innovative Freestyle. We will pass, for the first time this year the 10,000 mark in terms of dispensers deployed in this coming quarter, in the quarter that we're in, the fourth quarter. The average incidence lift there is more than 6%, the volume lift is significant, as well as revenue lift for the customer. So that's another very important point of reference in our business in the United States. And again our growth is led by strong performance with Coke Zero, up almost double digits in this past quarter, coming back very strongly, strong performance across multiple categories, such as POWERADE continuing, Gold Peak growing strong double digits, Fuze growing, smartwater, glac\u00e9au, Minute Maid, all growing in a very significant manner. So we feel confident that our North America strategies are working. We are focused on execution. We can always improve and strive for more, we always do. And we're optimistic about our outlook, despite the challenging competitive and macroeconomic backdrop. But important channels, we see better light coming through in some of the really important critical channels in the third quarter. I hope that's helpful.","Gary P. Fayard","Judy, it's Gary. On your -- the rest of your question, in 2013, we're going through business plans now. And on the year-end call, we'll give you an outlook on what we see, both for North America and rest of world, as well as -- because that will obviously encompass things like commodities, currencies, et cetera. So we'll go through that at the end of the year. And -- but we can't do it today.","Muhtar Kent","And again, just to close the question, we feel confident about sequential improvement in this year and the fourth quarter in the U.S. business in terms of results. And again, we feel that the strategies that we've deployed are working in the United States. We have invested. Our total marketing, again, in the United States in the quarter, and this past quarter is up. And also I would say to you that we feel that specifically also that the packaging strategies are working really well for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just have a question regarding productivity in the productivity and reinvestment program. I guess one is just, Gary, if you could give us some idea of how much productivity is contributing to this year and kind of where you stand in terms of the 2015 target. And then, Muhtar, I think in your comments you talked about the new reporting lines and how that would help enable leveraging synergies. And so I just wanted to see if you could tie that comment back to the productivity and reinvestment program. Does it -- do the new reporting -- does the new reporting structure accelerate it? Does it increase, enhance it in some way? Just trying to get a sense of kind of where we stand on productivity.","Gary P. Fayard","Yes. Bryan, thanks. This is Gary. On the program just to remind everyone, what we announced earlier this year is a new productivity and reinvestment program from 2012 through 2015. And $550 million to $650 million composed of quite a few different focus areas. And we would take all of the productivity that we realize, and then take that and reinvest it back behind -- into the brands. We have started. We're well on the way. In fact, I can tell you that I have a sightline today to where we can achieve the entire target, so it's not an issue at all on achieving. Relative to the current year, I would say it's probably in the $40 million to $50 million range that's already been achieved and reflected in the results or will be in this year. So it's already flowing through. And we're doing, I think, really well. Just to remind everyone, the focus areas were around supply chain optimization, around marketing and innovation effectiveness, around operational excellence, which leads to OpEx leverage and around standardizing data and IT systems, where places where you can really get a lot of leverage, and then take that and reinvest it behind the brands. Muhtar?","Muhtar Kent","Yes. And again, Bryan, in terms of the structure, I think we have a new leadership structure that is going to be leaner, more effective, more flexible structure; and that is going to drive a further, I believe, enhancement in our productivity initiatives. Gary and Ahmet Bozer and Irial and Steve and myself will be -- in terms of looking at these productivity initiatives, feel confident. And as Gary can see the -- have sight in the numbers and in the productivity being achieved, I think that we will certainly be looking at what we can do to enhance it even further. As you know, we came in, in the last productivity cycle for the past 3 years significantly over our targets, and we feel that we have again room to improve always. And also, as Gary said, importantly, while we deliver our results, this allows us to continue to invest successfully and making our brands even stronger. That is the key, and that's what you should always be looking for and that's what we always look for.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just sort of circle the square for me here? So you had great organic growth in both Latin America and Eurasia with terrific price and mix. But those are the 2 regions where you had the biggest margin compression. So is that really just sort of year-over-year comparisons and maybe some of the FX transaction here? Because you would have thought that with that kind of growth, perhaps the margins would have been a little bit better.","Muhtar Kent","Just very quickly on that. I'll tell you, first, we had very significant marketing spend in our international operations and total company for the third quarter. Our total marketing was up double digits for our international operations. And I think that again, that is partly cycling from prior year, particularly in certain geographic areas. But also it was to do with the onetime spend related to the Olympics, related to brand building around the UEFA Cup, particularly for Europe, but also for Eurasia, as well as for Latin America. So I think you need to take it into that context, from the perspective of marketing spend, cycling and prior year comparisons. And I'll see if Gary wants to add anything to that.","Gary P. Fayard","Yes, one thing I would add, and I don't know if this is directly responsive to your question, but when I made a few comments in the prepared remarks about volume and how we have different business models like the Innocent, Aujan, et cetera. So you've got some volume in Eurasia this quarter, for example. So if you look at the table in the release, if I remember correctly, it would show that Eurasia and Africa's volume, volumes up 11% and comparable currency-neutral operating income is up 11% as well. So you're not seeing a lot of leverage in that. If you -- but remember, there is no income in there related to Aujan. It's sitting down in equity income, but the volume is in that 11%. So if you adjust for that, Eurasia, Africa actually has some really nice operating leverage within their P&L. And so on operating margins, they're actually sitting in a really nice place for the quarter and year-to-date. So and then on Latin America, I don't think anything really unusual at all. I think they just continue to hum along as they have for the last number of years. And there's nothing other than we continue to invest in Latin America because it's such a great, great, strong market.","Muhtar Kent","One other thing about Latin America, just want to add context is in the -- a couple of years ago, we had this discussion. And many were questioning Latin America's ability to continue grow. And I always said, \"Latin America is just beginning its journey in still beverages.\" The key is to have balanced growth. Still beverages, though, growing, of course, from a very small base at a higher rate of growth than sparkling beverages. But I think there's -- Latin America is a great model for how we can continue to grow at even high per capita as for sparkling beverages entering into new categories. And I think that is adding tremendous value to our business and also tremendous strength to our bottom line as we continue to progress in Latin America. We're cycling a very strong quarter from Latin America last year and we still achieved 5% and generating very healthy returns.","Gary P. Fayard","Yes. The only \u2013I'd add one other thing as well. We're probably starting to give you too much detail. But within the quarter in Latin America -- in Brazil actually, they started making -- we started making our initial investments around the 2014 World Cup. That's in marketing. And while in absolute dollars it's not that big, it will continue. But in fact, it does have an impact of 1 point or 2 points on the leverage that you're seeing in Latin America. So I guess, all in, what we're saying is we are continuing to invest in the brands. We're investing well ahead of the curve. We're getting ready for 2014 World Cup. It's flowing through in the third quarter. And you'll see it flow-through next quarter as well because we're going to make sure that we do these things right.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In taking a look at the price\/mix number, obviously didn't come in as strongly as we've anticipated in Europe and the Pacific. Can you talk a little bit about what's driving those price\/mix numbers and sort of how you see that playing out over the next couple of quarters?","Gary P. Fayard","Yes. Thanks, John. Let's go to Europe first. And there, I think, price\/mix was negative 4, and there are a couple of things going on there. But I'd say it's primarily actually the economic condition of Europe. And we've been seeing this flow through for some time now. So I think it's kind of the new normal until we start seeing some more favorable results. But what you're seeing is go to Madrid and what you -- and look at the cafes, and there aren't a lot of people sitting around drinking cokes or coffee or whatever. It is a shift in consumer spending in Europe from immediate consumption much more to future consumption. So while we grew our volume across the region or across each of the business units, there is a shift, and it's all about the macroeconomic environment that we're dealing with. So we feel very confident because people continue to love the brands. They continue to buy the brands. They are just buying them in more of a take home because they're not going out. So it's the macros that are impacting that. And additionally, if you look at the growth rates, there's negative geographic price\/mix in Europe as well, just look at the growth rates. Europe and Central and Southern Europe grew faster than Spain and Northwest Europe. So that's some of it as well. And we're cycling through the tax increase in France. So it's all of those kinds of things together. Don't expect to see it get worse. I think we're kind of at the bottom now and should be okay. Relative to price\/mix in the Pacific, I think your initial reaction would probably be, \"Oh my God, it's minus 6.\" And your initial reaction is probably that it's all China. Well, it's not actually. A lot of it is actually because if you look at cases and gallons while, as I said in the prepared remarks, that gallons are slightly about 0.5 point ahead of cases in the quarter, in Japan, where Japan volume was up 2, gallons were actually down 2. And it's normal and it'll be fine at the end of the year. But that's 4-point swing in Japan, which as a very high profit per gallon market causes significant price\/mix, negative price\/mix, and that's a large part of what we're seeing in the Pacific. It's not a big deal. I think Japan was, I think, pretty much in line year-to-date and will be full year.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, that's great. And then if I can just ask a follow-up on the -- particularly on the Spain piece of this, which is are you guys running on a straight incidence pricing model then in Spain? Because that negative channel mix would probably -- I'm trying to figure out how that's impacting you so quickly unless you're providing either a, you're on a straight incidence, in which case the channel mix would hit you immediately? Or are you providing a little extra funding into the bottlers in terms of trying to help them get through this?","Muhtar Kent","John, the primary reason, I'd say probably 70% -- this is Muhtar, 70% of the mix in Europe is geographic, related to the fact that lower price regions like Germany and Eastern Europe and Central Europe were growing faster than some of the other regions in Europe that have a higher pricing like France, like England, and that has really -- and like Spain. Spain has one of the highest prices in Europe. And so that has had the biggest contributing factor. One of the reasons for that was very unseasonable weather in Northern Europe during half of the quarter. It's never been wetter than -- in history than this \u2013 than the beginning of the quarter for 2.5 -- 2 months, 1.5 months, half of the quarter in Northern Europe. So that is coming back, and we feel that, that is one of the primary reasons. As we have more balanced growth in Europe, which we expect will happen, and as Gary said, we feel that it's not going to get any worse than it is and it may even -- and even in these conditions, we can generate growth and crack the calculus for growth, then we feel that, that will certainly be coming back quite significantly. Spain remains today, on a net revenue per unit case basis, the highest in Europe. So I just want to make sure that those -- that commentary gets through.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Caroline S. Levy - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Obviously, my concern is definitely around China. And just I'm just wondering how margins in the Pacific would not be impacted by what's happening in China. Can you just dig a little deeper? Was there -- did you have increased promotional activity in China during the quarter? Or should we expect that in the next period? Just as we know the competitive environment there has got more -- both more price competitive and there's more distribution for Pepsi brands there.","Muhtar Kent","Well firstly, I mean I think, Caroline, on China, we are confident in our ability to continue growing in China, in this important market despite the changing, as you mentioned, competitive landscape and softness -- comparative softness in the macro conditions. And our transactions are up a healthy 7% in the past quarter. We have said it before in previous quarters that we're focused on transactions and that's the health of the business in China. And certainly, we're driving transactions in a very favorable way. Year-to-date, volume is a solid 6% and our brands are very strong. We have a clear leadership position in the sparkling category, and I have total confidence in both our bottling partners, COFCO and Swire beverages and Bottling Investment Group were to continue to deliver. You have noted from previous calls that on a total comparative basis, relative basis, China's contribution to profit is less than its contribution to volume in the Pacific Group for a number of reasons. One is because we've got much more developed countries that have much bigger margins for like, of course, Japan, but like also Australasia. And therefore, it is -- the impact -- even if we were to promote in China and not that, again, we feel it's a rational environment. But even if we were to promote, it would not have significant impact on the results of the Pacific Group, simply because of the size and scale of the profit pools that are generated out of markets like Japan and out of markets like Australasia. And again, given the size of our Japan profit pool in the Pacific Group, what Gary mentioned is the primary cause of that, which is an increase in volume, 2%, but a commensurate decrease at the same percent point in actually concentrate shipments.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Muhtar, I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about North America c-stores, and I had 2 questions there. Firstly, on the sparkling part of your portfolio, can you give us a little more detail on what's going on with some of the smaller pack sizes? I think they were having some difficulty in the second quarter. What's happening there? And also within sparkling in c-stores competing products, with Mountain Dew spending a lot more, what's your strategy versus that particular brand with your portfolio? So that's on the sparkling side. And then can you just give us an update on the energy segment sequentially in c-stores?","Muhtar Kent","Yes, I think in terms of -- firstly, the good news is that there is more positives to talk about the c-store channel in the quarter than in the first half of the year, we feel. And certainly, it is also important to note that we aggressively led the industry on competition and pricing in the channel. And also that the industry grew at around just under -- shy of 5% roughly in the channel. And we led the pricing. And we have, again, very healthy growth in transactions. And we held share in the channel and of course in total market. And in terms of packaging, our variety of packages starting with the entry pack of 12.5 ounce is really working well for us at the entry price of under $1. And then that puts us -- our 16 ounce significantly ahead of competition and pricing at $1.19 and so on and so forth. So I would say we are very confident and very pleased with the progress that we have in that channel as we have in the Foodservice channel where we see increased traffic coming through, particularly in the latter part of the quarter. And then in energy, you asked, we had double-digit volume growth. Our brands were up and gained volume and value share in the energy channel, in -- which is primarily the c-store, the convenient store channel. But also I'd say that our variety of packages, including the mini cans, 8.5 ounce mini cans and all the way through the 1.25 liter combined with the 2-liter, et cetera, are working really well for us in the future consumption channel as well.","Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So it sounds like Mountain Dew -- of all the things competitively happening in c-stores, Mountain Dew is not, on the margin, a big impact on your business, at least for now?","Muhtar Kent","I wouldn't want to comment on competition. I just would say that I think it's healthy for everyone.","So thank you Gary and Jackson. And in closing, we had a strong third quarter, have again delivered quality year-to-date performance results. Our business continues to grow even in the midst of global economic challenges. Our system is clearly aligned, on track to achieve our 2020 Vision. The appetite for investment by our bottling partners is as strong as it's ever been. And together we, as a system, continue to invest in our brands on a global scale through world-class marketing and also through world-class commercial strategies. And as a result, consumers' love for our brands is stronger than ever. As always, we thank you for your interest and your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you so much for joining.

I'm here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; Kathy Waller, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Murphy, our incoming Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives, and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.","As a reminder, we will be hosting a separate modeling call at 10:30 AM this morning to review our 2019 outlook in greater detail and allow sufficient time to address questions pertaining to guidance. We posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investor Section of our company website.

Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then reenter the queue.","Let me now hand the call over to James.","James Quincey","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. 2018 we concluded another quarter of solid operating performance capping off a successful year. The nonalcoholic beverage industry was stronger in 2018 as emerging and developing markets accelerated from the prior year while the developed world held hits volume trajectory on top of stronger pricing. Our business performed well across all key dimensions in 2018 as we leveraged our transformation as a total beverage company.","Most notably, we gained global value share and those share gains were broad based. We held or grew value share across each of our geographic segments. Organic revenue grew 5% versus our goal of 4% driven by strength across all operating segments. Underlying operating income grew 11% versus our goal of 8% to 9% as we built momentum through the year while accelerating the capture of productivity savings. This resulted in an approximate 170 basis point expansion in the underlying operating margin. And comparable EPS grew 9% in line with our guidance of 8% to 10% despite absorbing $600 million in stronger currency and structural headwinds than we anticipated at the beginning of the year.","Our results reflect actions taken over the past several years to transform our business for long-term success. Execution is getting better. We set ourselves up for the future with an energized bottling system that is bringing a renewed focus on execution around the world and in particular several key markets including North America where we have completed our refranchising activities.","Pricing power is improving. We are delivering accelerated top line growth as we continue to implement revenue growth management initiatives in markets around the world and marketing is becoming sharper. We are focusing on innovation that leverages brand edge and retro building, with increased efforts to digitally connect with consumers. And we have begun embedding a productivity mindset across the organization.","Now let's talk specifically about how we drove disciplined growth this past year. First, we strengthened our sparkling soft drink portfolio leveraging brand edge and innovation to build consumption rituals by offering people what they want, when and where they want it. Trademark Coke grew volume 2% driven by solid performance in brand Coke and supported by innovations such as Coca-Cola Plus Coffee and Coke orange juice as well as strong growth in our no sugar variants.","Coca-Cola Zero Sugar delivered yet another year of double-digit volume growth globally and in North America we reinvigorated Diet Coke with the brand growing retail value 3% after multiple years of declines. Very much Sprite also performed well growing global volume 2% through premium innovations such as Sprite Plus Fiber in China.","Second, we rapidly scaled successful brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and AdeZ across more markets. With the launch of Fuze Tea in Europe we delivered over 100 million incremental cases in EMEA offsetting the volume loss from the dissolution of Beverage Partners Worldwide. This enabled us to gain leadership positions within the ready-to-drink tea category across 11 European markets highlighting what an aligned system can accomplish.","Of course driving disciplined growth isn\u2019t just about expanding our beverage portfolio, we need to allocate resources to those brand and strategic initiatives that are delivering the highest returns. To that end, we eliminated over 700 underperforming zombie SKUs. By finding ways like this to reduce complexity we ensure that our system sales force is focused. Our supply chain is efficient and our latest innovations get more space and visibility at the point-of-sale.","Third, we expanded our portfolio through M&A and strategic investments. This included smaller investments like BODYARMOR, one of the fastest growing beverage trademarks in the U.S. Of course our biggest announcement was the acquisition of Costa which we closed on January 03, this year. Costa platform will give us the ability to scale within the $500 billion global hot beverage category and create a world-class global coffee business allowing us to better serve our customers and strengthen our ready-to-drink portfolio. All of this shows how we've been pursuing the vision we first shared with you a couple of years ago.","Now, one of the most important aim of this work is having the right leadership team and operating structure in place. In 2018 we appointed a President and Chief Operating Officer to bring accelerated focus on execution and talent development. We are now in orderly transition for the CFO with Kathy' retirement and John's shift from Operations to Finance. We added two new Group Presidents with considerable experience and we created a new group, Global Ventures to ensure we connect and globally scale key acquisitions, investments and partnerships like Costa Coffee and Monster. The changes we made are significant and they help set us up for more success in the years to come across our geographies.","Looking around the world we are already delivering better performance in key markets. In EMEA we grew organic revenues 7% delivering a second sequential year of accelerated top line growth. We accomplished this in part due to revenue growth management initiatives that focus on small baskets and pack sizes. These were phased into multiple markets over the years. As we continue to build all these actions in 2019 we expect continued group performance.","In Asia Pacific good results across several large emerging markets drove our strongest organic revenue growth in over five years. We had a stronger innovation pipeline, solid digital initiatives and steadily improving execution by our bottling partners. For example, in India, 25% of our revenue growth came from new products. And in China, digital initiatives coupled with a robust innovation pipeline resulted in solid performance. During the fourth quarter our B2C business capitalized on Singles Day, the massive online shopping holiday. Both our digital B2C and B2B businesses grew over 40% for the year and now account for over 5% of the system revenues in the market. And collectively across the group, our bottling system opened approximately 1 million new customer outlets.","Turning to Latin America, we delivered 11% organic revenue growth for the year as we continued to execute against the fundamentals amidst varying macro environments in argentina. The economy tipped into recession in the back half of 2018, so we adjusted quickly our plan to maintain affordability and protect our consumer base. In Mexico, our business continued to perform well amidst a volatile backdrop and in Brazil the operating environment became more certain after the elections with turnaround of our business there is taking hold and our strategies are driving improved performance.","Finally, in North America we continue to deliver strong performance in the marketplace and gain value share supported by a stronger, fully refranchised bottling system. During the year we undertook a significant package resizing initiative across our chilled juice and tea portfolios and implemented pricing actions across our sparking soft drink portfolio to mange through a challenging cost environment while adding over $1 billion in incremental retail value to our customers for the brands the Coke system sells. Due to the strength of our brands and increased investments from our independent bottling partners, we were able to capture price mix in the marketplace while beating historical elasticity.","So, lots of activity across our various regions. Overall, there is a consistent thread in what's driving better results across our territories. We strengthened our brands including Coca-Cola through strategic innovation and more disciplined ritual building. And our bottling partners have increased investments and improved execution and together we are aligned with the system on how to capture the growth opportunities before us.","Before moving on to 2019, let me provide some context on the fourth quarter. We continue to grow global organic revenues 5%. The composition of the growth changed. We delivered stronger sequential price mix while unit case volume was flat. Volume was impacted by slowing economic conditions in some countries like Argentina, plus decisions to focus on value of our volume in certain margins. However, we have seen a good start to 2019 with more balance to volume and price mix and this is consistent with our expectation for the full year.","Looking ahead, we're seeing the impact of some increasing uncertainty and volatility in global macroeconomic conditions. Consumers are under more pressure as we head into the New Year. However, demand for our categories remained healthy and our business is built to perform even if the tailwinds behind us moderate somewhat. Ultimately we will focus on what we can control taking steps to manage the business as we become a total beverage company.","Further lifting, shifting and scaling entr\u00e9e brands like Fuze Tea, smartwater and Innocent across markets, reformulating products to reduce sugar levels, rolling out revenue growth initiatives across additional territories to improve performance within our sparkling soft drink portfolio, connecting costs across many of our business units build a leading global coffee business and leveraging digitization to build a business for the future. Therefore, we feel confident that we can deliver against our 2019 guidance.","Finally, I'd like to thank Kathy. Kathy has made significant contributions to our company, our systems and our people, working her way from financial analyst all the way to the most senior finance role in the company, truly a testament to the value she has brought through every phase of the journey. As CFO, she has steered the company's financials through an extremely complex refranchising process and she is leaving a strong foundation for John to build upon. Finally, she has been a critical partner to me and I appreciate all of her valuable support.","With that, let me turn it over to Kathy.","Kathy Waller","Thank you, James and good morning everyone. During my time as CFO, I've met personally with many people who are on the call this morning, from analysts who follow our industry to investors in our company and many of our associates and partners that I know are listening this morning. I thank each and every one of you and many others for your help, whether it was in the form of guidance, support, plotting or accounting. Each encounter helped me to be a better CFO and a better representative of this company that I love.","Effective March 15, I retire after 30 plus years at the Coca-Cola Company. From the very beginning with my start in accounting research I've had amazing opportunities to learn and grow and eventually become a leader in the company. I am very proud to have been a part of this company and this system.","Coca-Cola is about experiences and making lives better for everyone who touches our system, from the smallest shop or kiosk owner to the largest customer, those who simply enjoy drinking our products. It has been my privilege to be a part of this extraordinary business and it would be my pleasure to watch Coca-Cola continue to grow and evolve under the leadership of James, Brian, John and the rest of the leadership team. Along with the hard work and support of the 700,000 people who are taking this symptoms into the future.","And with that, I will hand this call over to the future. I'll let John take it from here.","John Murphy","Thank you, Kathy. You've been a great partner over the years and you leave behind a tremendous legacy. My congratulations to you on our retirement and my appreciation as well for your many contributions over the years to the company and especially to many people in the company.","Now I look forward to partnering with James and Brian to drive the business going forward, and before I begin, let me just take a moment to talk about my key priorities going into this role. Number one, will be rise, healthy top line growth leveraging our expanding portfolio. Number two will be to improve margins in all our operating segments. Number three will be to optimize our balance sheet and allocate capital in a disciplined manner to our highest return activities. Number four, will be to drive a culture of agility and productivity across the enterprise. And number five will be to develop our people and build the capabilities that we need in the company going forward. Ultimately, I will be looking to push our enterprise to find opportunities to sustainably maximize free cash flow and returns.","Turning to our financial performance, as James said, 2018 was a good year. We delivered 9% comparable EPS growth due to momentum in the underlying business, accelerated productivity, and a favorable tax rate. Our press release covered our fourth quarter results in detail so I will focus on our 2019 guidance. At our high level we expect 4% organic revenue growth, double-digit comparable currency neutral operating income growth, comparable EPS to range from plus 1% to minus 1%, and free cash flow of at least $6 billion.","Now, let me touch on the key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect global growth to be slightly lower than in 2018 with continued growth in the developed world and macroeconomic challenges in certain emerging markets. However, there is a significant amount of uncertainty and geopolitical tension which could result in further changes in this macro environment.","That said, we focus on the things we can control and the actions we've taken over the past few years has set us up for continued success despite shifting macros. We expect organic revenue growth to benefit from our continued focus on lifting, shifting, and scaling products such as good quality of sugar and Fuze Tea, as well as implementing revenue growth management activities across lower markets. In addition to the solid organic growth we expect an 8 to 9 point benefit to revenue from net M&A and structural activity.","We completed our North American franchising efforts and divested our company owned bottlers in Uruguay and Guatemala last year. We also took full ownership of our Philippines bottler in the fourth quarter. And earlier this year we closed the acquisitions of both Costa Coffee and the remaining stake in Chi, Africa's leading value-added dairy and juice company. We expect the net effect of these transactions to result in lower comparable gross margins for the year driven by the Philippines bottling operations.","In the U.S. while freight costs are expected to remain above historical levels, we do not expect to see the same level of year-over-year increases as we saw last year. And we have $600 million remaining in growth productivity to capture in 2019. A portion of these savings will be reinvested in the business. Recent investments are generating a good return as evidenced by our strong top line relative to most CPG peers.","So all in, we expect solid pricing, a continued focus on expense management, and a net benefit from acquisitions to deliver 10% to 11% comparable currency neutral operating income growth. We expect currency to be at 6% to 7% headwind to operating income as we faced strength in dollar and cycle hedging gains in 2018. Below the line we expect the leverage driven by higher net interest expense and we expect an effective tax rate of 19.5%. However, this rate could vary from quarter to quarter.","So in summary, we expect double-digit, comparable, currency neutral operating income growth, but the impact of currency along with higher interest and taxes will lead to the standard range of plus 1% to minus 1% or comparable EPS growth in 2019. As you model the flow of the year there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing. The first quarter will have one less day than in 2018.","Easter will fall in the second quarter this year compared to the first quarter last year. Due to the timing of fed rate increases the year-over-year increase in interest expense will be more heavily skewed to the first half of 2019 than the back half. And similarly because of when the dollar strengthened last year we expect a more significant currency headwind in early 2019 which will then begin to moderate as we move through the year.","As James said, we created a new operating group, Global Ventures. This will be a new reporting segment in 2019 and will include Costa Coffee, [indiscernible] tea, Innocent and Monster. As such we will provide the revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before first quarter results are released. There are times our company can be complex to model. For example our M&A and structural changes impact several of our operating segments this year. Our investor relations team will hold a call at 10:30 this morning to answer any further questions as you build out your models for the year.","So in summary, we delivered against our EPS guidance in 2018 amidst stronger headwinds than anticipated at the beginning of the year. We maintained a disciplined approach to the use of capital and we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities as we enter 2019.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","James Quincey","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","And Kathy, just to get in one more time, just congratulations on a great career and wish you all the best as you move on.","Kathy Waller","Thank you, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","So I guess James, just my one question is really around EPS guidance this year being flat and I think previously we've talked before about kind of a commitment to dollar EPS growth. So I guess one is that's still sort of a commitment going forward, but more importantly maybe could you maybe talk about some of the considerations? I understand the currency headwinds being a big part of it this year, but just what other trade-offs you might have made in terms of what you are choosing to invest this year versus maybe dropping more to the bottom line?","James Quincey","Sure, good morning Bryan. Firstly, the whole idea of the in a way the three-legged stool is still absolutely valid and important and just to recap what I meant by that. This is a business that predominantly wins all those, but our focus is on wining in the local marketplaces. We focus on getting the consumers and growing customer value in each and every country and so there is very much a focus on getting that to work and I think over the last few years you've seen accelerated performance of us able to drive the industry grow and capture share within that and that's a starting point of value creation for the Coke company to work on that and making sure the operating margins of how we do that are all the same or better, such that we turn that revenue growth into profit growth at the local level.","And then as you said we have in more recent years had a more intense focus on making sure that sum of the parts is more than just the sum of the parts and the lever is necessary to turn that into U.S. dollar EPS earnings after a number of years where currency had eroded that and the EPS had effectively declined. That's still our going in objective.","The guidance is where we stand today, it's a really strong operating plan for 2019. I think we are being cautious about the macroeconomics and how that's going to be a little softer than 2018, but a strong plan behind the marketing, the execution and innovation. And absolutely we are reflecting here in our guidance where currency and interest rates and tax sit today which are the three in a way non-controllable factors. There is a long way to the end of the year and they could change markedly. But our focus will remain and our mission will remain to end the year with positive EPS growth. We would be disappointed if it wasn\u2019t positive. But we wanted to share with you where things stand today and we will focus on pulling the levers that we can pull to get to the result that we want.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thank you, good morning.","James Quincey","Good morning, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Hey, I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about North America this quarter. So the flat organic sales growth looks pretty different than what we'd seen in the Nielsen data. So I think a big question would be kind of what drove that gap and if you could give us any updates specific to North America outlook I think everyone is worried about is you had a resurgence set of competitors, is that driving an impact or even how you're planning for that as you look into 2019? Thanks.","James Quincey","Sure, yes, we were a little softer in the fourth quarter in North America and I think part of that is we took the medium price increase going into the \u2013 or in the middle of the summer and it took a while for it to flow all the way through to the consumers. That's a really \u2013 I think it was more fully in the marketplace by the end of the summer and obviously then coming into the fourth quarter. So I think you saw a little of the effect of the price increase more actually in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter when the system was taking it and I think that kind of combined with a little bit of consumer outlook malaise in that period of time, so a little softening of the volume.","But then it started to pick up and so we started the year well, this year in terms of North America volume and price mix was also continued to be positive through the back of the year. I know it's only comes through as 2% in the fourth quarter for North America. There remain - this carries with it some of the oddities of which business system was growing because the juice business which is finished goods business where we were rightsizing the packaging and seeing volumes go down, obviously finished goods versus the sparkling which is concentrate and it has that mechanical effect that the faster the sparkling business grows the more it actually affects mix in a negative way, but that does not affect profits and it does not affect the marketplace.","So there's a little bit of mix and the freight and all the noise, but let's draw a line because the good news is 2018 has ended. The freight accounting issue is disappeared for 2019. The marketplace pricing is clear and positive going into 2019 and the businesses started with a foot forward and so we are confident we have the right strategy for North America and that we will see the benefits of that strategy flowing more simply and more clearly through the results in 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy Hong","Thank you, good morning.","James Quincey","Good morning, Judy.","John Murphy","Good morning.","Judy Hong","And Kathy, again congratulations from my end as well. I guess James, just your comment about good start to the year, was that specific to North America as you alluded to the prior question? And then as you kind of think about the comment about increased volatility in the global macro environment maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the key markets where, some of that concerns persist and how much is that sort of factored into that 4% organic revenue guidance? Thanks.","James Quincey","Sure, my comment about good start to the year was both about North America and globally. We have started the year only six weeks. It's a long year, but the \u2013 what is good is it started off well in terms of volume and therefore we see ourselves start the year with a good balance of volume growth and price mix that is very consistent with having a balanced contribution to driving the top line guidance and as I said, North America is good.","We have seen to have had a good Chinese New Year. You never quite really know until the end of February, but it seems like it has been a strong Chine New Year. Brazil is looking a little better. Mexico seemed to have started well given some cold weather at the back end of last year.","You heard about the European outlook today this morning. So we think we started well, a long year to go, great plans. Also that will need managing no doubt and the volatility, so we baked in what we know today. Clearly there are places where weakness is apparent. Argentina went down quite strongly in the fourth quarter and that's likely to continue in the first half of this year. Turkey, very similarly, some parts of the Middle East.","We've baked in what we see and what we believe is likely to be the softening of the global macro outlook and in the countries which are more apparent. Clearly the visibility is more apparent in the first half of the year than the second half. Hopefully the world will turn a little and the second half will improve and that will certainly help us reap even more benefits from our strong plan. But that's kind of where we stand today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Ali Dibadj","Hey guys.","James Quincey","Good morning.","John Murphy","Good morning.","Ali Dibadj","I think you may have missed the memo on lowering 2019 expectations. So we are all kind of thinking Pepsi would do that tomorrow and not Coke today. And so I'm a little confused about the drivers of it and if we start with top line, you're saying approximately 4%. Not too long ago you insist on quarter 6% being the right number. Then you have a big gap from that to 10% to 11% OI which seems aggressive, so a big improvement there.","And then I'm still confused about the move from 10% to 11% OI to flat EPS, even with FX at I guess, I think it was 6 to 7, that does not jive as what we're seeing from a currency level today, so you are assuming things are getting worse. I see the taxes change that you're describing I don\u2019t really know why. So I know you've tried to explain in bits and pieces but there are a lot of moving parts and I want to understand the moving parts. I don't want to wait until 10:30. I don\u2019t think any many of us do, so to at least understand the drivers of why we're getting so disappointed her both on top line and on the EPS? Thanks.","James Quincey","Sure. Well I think at the highest level the story is a simple story. We started off last year, well obviously we had the long term growth model of 4% to 6% on the top line. We've been delivering within that range for the last six quarters. We are being prudent in our outlook for 2019 given the multiple reductions in global economic growth outlook for 2019 and our own experience in some of the emerging and developing markets. I think 4 is a prudent number.","We have a strong plan that's backed up by the marketing, the innovation and the execution. So I think we're going to be in great shape on growing, continuing to grow the top line and I think that number will end up being at the higher end of consumer products companies in terms of revenue growth for 2019 in the same way the number for 2018 was at the high end of consumer products companies.","You're seeing then the benefits of a lot of our actions over the last number of years in terms of productivity, in terms of our focus on smaller packages, and revenue growth, and innovation, and premiumization of our portfolio such that we are getting operating leverage. Operating leverage is not just driven by productivity, but by better work on the portfolio, and you see that flowing through obviously with some of the tailwinds from the acquisitions and the divestitures. A small piece, so that we're getting excellent leverage from our revenue growth into our operating income growth at the 10% to 11%. Obviously the currency is where it is. That is currencies as they stand today we're not making a forecast as to what the currencies will be by the end of the year.","There is a piece of that that we're cycling hedging gains in 2018 as we commented earlier. But the number of the 6 to 7 is as things stand today. How it will stand at the end of the year we will see. And then of course we're losing some leverage from operating income. Finally down to EPS through the higher tax rates which the Fed has taken through the year and through the changes in the tax rates. The interest rates from the Fed and the tax rates, the tax rate is going to be slightly higher in 2019 than it was in \u201818. So that's pretty straightforward.","Clearly that's leading to EPS growth. That is not what we aspire to. We're going to focus on controlling what we can control and driving the business. We'll be pulling the levers as I talked about earlier on the call to make sure we focus on our aspirations of turning our winning local plans into growth of dollar EPS. But we want to be prudent in our outlook guidance given the macro environment, despite a strong good momentum winning plan and to put the FX as it stands today. The only thing that is for sure is it will be different tomorrow and we will update it as we go through the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Your line is now open.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi guys.","James Quincey","Hi, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","So I just wanted to quickly clarify your answer to Bryan's question earlier. I understand that 2019 underlying profit outlook is solid ex-items if in fact you deliver it. But I think you had intimated before that you were really looking to drive earnings growth even in the face of FX pressures. So obviously we've talked about 2019 guidance already, but as we think about the earnings trajectory post 2019 is it more in line with the long term algorithm that you guys have outlined plus or minus currency or do you still think there's some levers that you can pull over time that even if FX continues to be unfavorable, you can hit your earnings growth targets? I don't know if that will count as my question or not, but first maybe clarify that and if I can ask another and you're ready to be generous, go ahead if not move to the next person. Thanks.","James Quincey","Okay, I think it sort of seems all wrapped up in one burst of the same idea. We are committed to growing the earnings of the company. I mean, in simple terms, the earnings of the company are the fuel to pay the dividends of the company and drive the stock price and reinvest back in the business. So without dollar increased earnings of EPS it is not going to be a growth company and therefore we reaffirmed the long term growth model at some of our previous investor presentations, the 4 to 6 on revenue and the growth in EPS. Yes, there'll be years where currency will weigh on it more heavily. We certainly have the aspiration that there will be no negative years.","We have said we will not do things that are irrational just to get a positive EPS, but we will focus on trying to pull levers to get there. But as you look out into the future, we absolutely expect to keep focusing on coming back to the long term growth mode. Now, to the question well what happens if the dollar always gets stronger? Well, then that simply put assuming that there still is a global trading system that will export inflation to the other parts of the world. And therefore, if we enter some very long extended period of dollar strengthening then we will logically expect to see higher pricing in other parts of the world that will compensate for some prolonged ongoing strengthening of the dollar. So either way we want to get back to our long term growth model in dollars realized for the shareholders.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Steve Powers","Thank you very much. Kathy, thank you from me as well, and best wishes for the future and John, my congratulations again on the new role. James, for USA good job and I'm actually my gift to you is I am going to ask Kathy and\/or John a question, related to the to the free cash flow guidance for next year. It implies another year of about two thirds conversion of net income to free cash flow which is below the company's 90% plus target. So I'm assuming there's still a good number of structural costs flowing through with respect to refranchising and the recent acquisitions, but can you help us get underneath those dynamics at all and paint a picture of what it will take to get back to that or get to that 90% plus conversion ratio on a consistent basis and can we can we look to 2020 to be that year of inflection?","John Murphy","So let me start, for 2019 while your cash from operations is expected to increase at least 10% it's going to be largely offset by increased CapEx from a free cash flow standpoint and that's increased CapEx is primarily due to three factors. One is the acquisition of costs and some CapEx related to investing for the future there. Secondly, with BIG [ph] taking on the Philippines and then thirdly, we have a couple of strategic initiatives in the digital arena and in our concentrate business to invest in 2019.","As we go forward, we do have a clear line of sight to get to the 90% to 95%. One area of focus is going to be to drive greater efficiencies in working capital productivity. Secondly, it would be to reduce the cash flow impact from the timing of payments of onetime items related to restructuring and re-franchising. And then finally, we would love to see some of our upfront CapEx investments scaling back. So whether it's 2020 or 2021, I think it's too early to say, but clearly the focus is to have that number back to the 95%, so I think we have a very clear line of sight as to how to get there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I wanted to circle back to your top line guidance which James you did mention is prudent. So I guess, I was hoping you could drill down a little further and give us a sense as to how fast you expect your different category questions to grow over the next year and then maybe where you see potential for faster growth? I guess I'm just trying to understand how we should think about your sparkling cluster growth for instance versus some of the other clusters like tea and coffee, especially everything that you've done last year and then possibly touch on your juice and dairy? Thanks.","James Quincey","Sure. I think that, well firstly, before I jump into the clusters, I think that some of the prudence is being derived from developing and emerging markets, whether it - that be some of the ones like Argentina or Turkey, aforementioned Middle East and some parts of Africa as well. So I think the prudence on the softening is more geographic based than it is cluster based. Having said that, I think we are expecting to see in 2019 continued growth of the sparkling category.","We've clearly aimed going into the future to see a strategy that is more price mix than volume in the developed markets and more perhaps volume centered in the developing emerging, so as we look out into 2019 I expect the sparkling business to continue to grow and I think we'll see a little more price mix than volume given some of the things that are happening in the developing markets. As we move through some of the other categories, I mean clearly coffee is going to grow much faster because of the incorporation of posture and as we start to realize that synergy plans. But that's not driving obviously the 4% organic which is like for like so it doesn't include the acquisition in that sense.","In terms of tea, we're expecting to do better in tea in 2019 than we did in 2018. 2018 has the kind of base effect of pulling out of the beverage partners worldwide joint venture which where we counted volume but we didn't count revenue, and then obviously that sort of made it very hard to cycle the volume in 2018 but made it easier to get the revenue.","As we go into 2019 we expect to see continued growth in tea in Fuse and leverage Gold Peak in the U.S. which should see a bit more balanced growth. In juice will come off the period of the rightsizing of the packaging in North America. And so I think we will see a better performance from the juice business particularly the premium end of the juice business that speculate may be part of the world where we will question some of the juice drinks and the values that they bring.","Obviously in aggregate juice will do better because we'll have the incorporation of tea which is a great business in West Africa. But that's not part of the organic growth drivers. And then in hydration we'll be focused on more of the premium parts of hydration whether it be sports drinks, leveraging our partnership with BODYARMOR, driving things like Topo Chico and smartwater or smartwater with its new variants like alkaline.","We still may see some backing off of very low value water in some parts of the world. So I think you'll see positive results in the in the different clusters going forward and I think versus 2018 you're likely to see a continued strong picture across the portfolio. I think the places where you would see some, places where we would sacrifice some volume would be the lower value end of water and juice drinks, but otherwise a strong focus across the portfolio and balanced growth.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Laurent Grandet","Yes, good morning James, Kathy, and welcome John. Kathy, I mean congrats on your extremely successful carry out Coke proscenium [ph]. I'd like to thank you for helping me head back into the Coke system a few years ago. Really a question about Costa, you mentioned at the time of the acquisition that Costa would be a slightly accretive to earnings in first full year, in the current context of the UK economic and political situation and a potential hung Brexit looming, did that change?","And if you can update us more on the Costa integration and the expansion plan and specifically we'd like to understand if you are planning to refranchise this still 51% fully owned stores? Thank you very much.","James Quincey","Sure, look on the Costa thing obviously we managed, the team did a great job in closing the acquisition well ahead of schedule in January rather than April and we're now in the phase of the transition period of really connecting, it in a systems sense and also being able to finally sit down with management and bring together that kind of base underlying growth plan with our views on synergies and acceleration. That's a process that's going to take a little bit of time to work through to really validate all those synergy plans.","Once we got to the end of that process of course we'll be able to come out and be more specific about how we see the cost being rolled out against our coffee strategy of driving coffee against the pillars using the stores that we have as the experience, serving as a provider of a total beverage portfolio in foodservice, whether it's beans or machines or the vending, selling the coffee at the at home and of course the potential for ready-to-drink. So that's the strategy remains clear.","We're putting more flesh and detail on the bones of the plans as it rolls out. And then of course you know Brexit will be Brexit. I'm not sure anyone knows how it's going to end at this stage. We clearly have contingency plans for this business and for our other businesses in the UK and in the European environment. It's something that will be have to manage through, but it will be, whatever it is going to be, it is likely to only be a short term disruption effect if indeed it ends up in that scenario and we will manage through it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","James Quincey","Good morning, Kevin.","James Quincey","Kevin Grundy","I wanted to come back to advertising and marketing levels in the 2019 outlook and what's embedded in your guidance because as was alluded to earlier in the call, the market widely expects higher investment from Pepsi, this year likely directed at North America Beverages and we'll find out less than 24 hours whether that's true or not. So can you talk about advertising and marketing levels for fiscal \u201819? Does that look similar as a percent of sales, higher as a percent of sales, many companies in CPG will guide on that. So I'm not sure if you can comment on it. And then number two to that, have you left adequate cushion in your guidance should you need to react to higher levels of investment spending? Thank you.","James Quincey","Sure. Look we grew advertising spend in 2018. We expect to grow our advertising spend in 2019. Of course, we continue to work on how to drive productivity in our non-working marketing investments and to leverage our scale with our advertising partners and with our property.","So we're going to continue to invest in advertising.","I think it's also worth saying that we are being even more disciplined as we look through the framework of leader, challenger and explorer. Obviously is our leader brands which are the brands that make best use of TV commercial, advertising spend. As we drive the challenges and the explorer brands, there in some other parts of the marketing mix that often become a more predominant element of making them work.","And then, if our competitors are going to increase investment, you know what it is going to increase the growth of the categories. Ultimately, if there are more competitors investing, it drives more market growth. We believe that we have strong brands and strong plans. And I think net-net it's going to be overall beneficial to the industry.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Andrea Teixeira","Hello. Hi. So thank you and good morning. Kathy, I wanted again to thank you for your leadership and legacy and all the best to you and John in the new role. So thank you. So I was hoping if you could revisit the 2020 operating margin expansion targets that you outlined at CAGNY last year of 34% plus. I realize there have been a number of key changes in accounting and acquisitions and FX is there, but with the guidance that you have now implying operating margins now year-on-year in 2019 and the noise like the puts and takes, but how should we think about the reinvestments and other moving pieces that relates to the 2020 target?","James Quincey","Yes, so the 34% target that was outlined is one that was outlined I think at the time to provide guidance to the refranchising process and today we are on track to get to that 34% over the next couple of years. We've had some margin expansion over the last couple of years and there's implied margin expansion in our 2019 numbers. However, given the fact that we have new businesses coming into the mix, I would like to really focus on improving margins across all of our different business segments as we go into 2019, 2020.","Maintaining the underlying objective outlined in the 34% margin target, but being a lot more focused on making sure that our core business, our Global Ventures business and our BIG business are delivering margin expansion as they develop their respective portfolios and businesses.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, thank you very much. Over the last year, year and a half or so, you've been more assertive on taking price and driving that in North America and then in Europe and we see some of the results. But I was wondering if you could kind of stand back and give us an assessment of what you've learned from that change in tactics or strategy if you will. And in terms of your brand equity and need to perhaps tweak investment in certain areas, your bottler execution in terms of executing on those price increases and then obviously kind of the general customer demand suggests you know kind of big picture what you've learned from the price initiatives over the last year or so? Thank you.","James Quincey","Sure, Robert. Look, I think the simple conclusion is the following. If we just think we can depend on headline rate increases in the absence of other everything else then we're very likely to see high elasticity. And therefore what we've learned and I guess relearned is that it's really important that pricing become part of our strategy. A strategy that starts with the right brands, the investment behind the brands to build equity with the consumers and then to provide the consumers the innovation not just in the brands and the product, but also in the packaging that allows pricing to be taken sometimes with the headline price, sometimes through mix.","And there's the sum of all those pieces backed up by good execution that creates the willingness of the customer to go with the plan because it creates more value for the customers in their stores often the beverage industry then grows faster than the average, and so the learning and the relearning it's the complex task of pulling all the pieces together that earns you the opportunity to drive price mix, perhaps ahead of where we had been. And I think that's something that we and the bottling partners have dedicated ourselves to even more over the last number of years, I think it's showing through in some of the headline numbers that you see and we absolutely are going to stick to strategy.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Carlos Laboy with HSBC. Your line is now open.","Carlos Laboy","Yes, good morning.","James Quincey","Good morning.","John Murphy","Good morning.","Carlos Laboy","James, your Brazil business looked unbelievable last week. Lots of innovation and new SKUs, but how do you see beer in Brazil and the importance of keeping these Coke bottlers competitive on beer? And while on the subject of M&A if you could just give us a quick update on the refranchising process in general and the urgency to see through the sale of the remaining properties?","James Quincey","Sure. Well thank you for the feedback on the Brazil business. I'm sure the Brazil team will be pleased with that. They have had a number of years trying very hard to adapt and update the business and bring the affordability and the innovation in line with the marketplace. And I think with the improvements in the macro conditions in Brazil that business is starting to do a lot better and it's a multi-channel business and they distribute the beer only in some of those channels. So that's a work in progress as the relationship with Heineken is a question.","And I think as we see the refranchising business or the refranchising strategy, we've largely refranchised the world. We're down to just a small percentage of the volume. It's been very successful whether it was North America, the creation of bottlers like European Partners or the Japan bottler. And so we think that has been very successful. Clearly, we're still working on our beverages Africa, in terms of refranchising started it has obviously been slower than anyone would have liked. I think some of that has been process and macros related. We're still working on that one.","And that leaves us obviously with the Southeast Asian set of bottlers. Obviously, we'll be thinking about what's the right strategic direction for that part of the world. But the ongoing, you know curation of refranchising is not refranchising for the sake of franchising. It's in the service of creating a stronger and more energized bottling system that is aligned set of partners with the company to drive our collective business with more growth and with better margins into the future and that takes different forms and places and of course we allocate capital within the process whether it's owning bottlers or having stakes in bottlers. We drive that process with the objective of using capital as and when necessary, sometimes yes, sometimes no, to get the most energized bottling system out there and bringing new partners in. That's an ongoing management as we curate our remaining bottling operations and some of our other investments in bottlers.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference.

Mr. Leveridge, you may now begin.","Timothy Leveridge","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Murphy, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to inform you that we posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investor section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com. These schedules reconcile certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.

In addition, this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report. ","Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions. [Operator Instructions].","Now let me turn the call over to James.","James Quincey","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. As you'll have seen from our earnings release earlier today, we continue to deliver strong results. We are part of a great industry with solid long-term growth potential. For our company, the power of aligned and engaged system is driving solid top line growth across all our operating segments. We see that innovation, revenue growth management and improving execution ,all supported by greater brand building, are helping us sustain momentum across our business. ","Our associates within the organization and across the system are responding to the cultural changes we are driving. So through the 3 quarters of the year, we've gained global value share with a balanced contribution from both developed and emerging markets, we're sustaining that solid top line performance with growth across all the operating segments and we're on track to deliver our EPS commitments, as momentum in the business have helped offset increased currency headwinds. And as John will talk about, free cash flow is up strongly year-to-date, which is also encouraging. ","Looking around the world. As I said, all our operating segments delivered solid organic growth. In EMEA, we've seen sustained revenue growth of 7% year-to-date. Importantly, we're seeing contributions to growth come as much from developed markets as the emerging markets. This is partly due to our revenue growth management efforts over the last few years. And it's pretty encouraging, as we continue to roll out these revenue growth management initiatives, to developed markets in other areas of the world. ","In Asia Pacific, we've grown organic revenue 4% year-to-date. We're gaining horizontal distribution and recruiting new consumers in emerging markets, like Southeast Asia, India and China, leading to strong volume growth. In Japan, while we still have work to do, we're seeing sequential quarterly improvement in both volume and revenue. The system continues to rebuild manufacturing capacity, and we're adapting the fast-changing consumer environment and evolving our operating models to drive efficiencies and effectiveness. ","Turning to Latin America. Again, we're driving positive momentum, despite a more challenging economic environment, and they're up 9% organic growth year-to-date. Brazil has sustained strong performance even as the macro has slowed a little in the third quarter. This has been driven by improved execution and consistent investment behind cold drink equipments. Our approach has enabled the business to grow twice the rate of consumer spending in the third quarter. Our business in Mexico has actively adjusted to the -- to a more challenging economic environment, shifting the portfolio towards affordability with a push on returnable packaging. This has led to improvement in trends as we've moved through the year. In Argentina, though, a worsening economic situation and higher inflation has affected consumer spending, impacting our business and our industry. However, by following our playbook of carefully balancing price increases, while also focusing on maintaining our consumer base, we have gained value share year-to-date. ","Finally, turning to North America. We saw a strong marketplace performance driven by innovation in our sparkling portfolio and improving performance in stills. We also continue to gain share. And so far, revenue growth -- organic revenue growth is up 2% year-to-date. This growth was largely driven by continued strong consumer demand for No Sugar versions of some of our best known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for smaller packages with less sugar per serving. Of course, we always have the opportunity to get better. For example, our performance in the water category has not been as strong as we'd like. We're working on further plans to address this in the marketplace in the near future. ","Taking a step back and looking across all our markets. We are driving a platform for sustained performance through a disciplined portfolio growth approach, an aligned and engaged system and collaboration with our stakeholders. Within our portfolio, we focused on operationalizing further our leader, challenger and explorer framework to build quality leadership positions in more brands in more markets. ","While consumer behavior is rapidly evolving, we continue to find new ways to connect with consumers through our leader brands. For example, we see continued strong performance in our sparkling portfolio led by trademark Coca-Cola, with 3% volume growth and 6% retail value growth, so far this year. Our brand and formula has been around for more than 130 years, and we continually work to make Coke relevant to recruit new generations of consumers. ","In addition to great marketing campaigns, consumer-centric innovation has been a key factor, especially over the last few years. This includes smaller packaging, such as mini cans, which are growing at a rate of more than 15% year-to-date in the U.S. It includes lower and no calorie variants that help consumers moderate their sugar intake. For example, Coke Zero Sugar is growing globally 14% volume year-to-date. And most recently, it's included new launchers such as Coke Energy and Coke Plus Coffee, which is designed for consumers looking for a little extra upliftment. We've launched Coke Energy in more than 25 markets, and we're adjusting as we learn to how consumers are responding. As you know, we have plans to bring Coke Energy to the U.S. in 2020. Overall, we're seeing more consumers drink products from our flagship trademark globally.","Within challenger and explorer brands, innovation and sustained investment levels are helping drive performance across key geographies. In Asia, our Authentic Tea House brand is well ahead of the plan in China and across Southeast Asia. At the beginning of last year, we launched Fuze Tea in Europe. Now entering its second year, we've seen positive momentum in both revenue growth and share gains driven by marketing investments, innovation and added distribution. Fuze Tea has gained 3 points of value share across Western Europe, showing the importance of sustained investment to build challenger brands into leaders. Chi, West Africa's leading value-added dairy and juice brand, continues to perform well in the marketplace and expanded footprint across the region. The disciplined approach we are taking is yielding results. Consumers have responded, as shown by our sustained momentum. More broadly, we will continue to invest behind our brands. ","Of course, strategy and marketing are only one part of the equation. Daily execution in the marketplace is also a critical component. Globally, our bottling partners are aligned and energized. They're committed to building scale and investing for the future. We're working with them to collectively raise the bar on consistent execution. Key levers of growth include driving new pack price architectures, increasing the availability of immediate consumption packages, expanding chilled space with more cold drink equipment and growing our customer base. In India, for example, immediate consumption transactions have grown double digit year-to-date, fueled by adding more than 650,000 new customer outlets during the year and placing more than 25 additional coolers in the market. These initiatives are allowing us to grow at double the rate of personal consumption expenditure. Globally, this kind of action has helped lead to volume growth in immediate consumption packages of 4% year-to-date. ","Fundamentally, our business is driven by the ability to operate a more sustainable enterprise that makes a difference for all our stakeholders. And let me highlight one critical issue, we, of course, see across the world, which is package waste. We first shared our World Without Waste goals in 2018, and we provided updates from time to time. But I'd also like to share a recent example of initiatives around the world. In the U.S., we're working on a number of packaging plans with DASANI, including removing the equivalent of at least 1 billion virgin PET plastic bottles from the supply chain over the next 5 years. DASANI will introduce a lineup of recyclable, reusable and package-free options, including aluminum packages and expansion of PureFill water dispensers, which leverage our Coca-Cola Freestyle technology. ","In Great Britain, our system has switched Sprite bottles from green to clear plastic to make it easier to recycle into new bottles. And in 2020, we will double the recycled plastic in all of our bottles in Great Britain to at least 50%. ","In Australia, by the end of the year, all single-serve PET bottles will be made from 100% recycled plastic. Finally, we and our partners just unveiled the first sample bottle made with recovered and recycled marine plastics. This shows the future potential for ocean debris to be recycled, packaging for foods and drinks. ","Of course, none of this will be possible without the people throughout our company and our system that take an expansive approach to imagining what's possible. This is what gives me confidence this company and system is building a better shared future. ","So in summary, we're driving a platform for sustained performance through disciplined portfolio growth, an aligned and engaged system and are working with our stakeholders. For the first 9 months of the year, we delivered strong underlying growth ahead of our initial guidance. This gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year EPS target and drive shareholder value. ","And now I'm going to turn the call over to John.","John Murphy","Thank you, James, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'd like to start with a quick update on a few key areas of focus I've mentioned previously that are critical to the company, driving sustainable top line growth, expanding margins across our business segments and improving cash flow. ","As I look at our progress in 2019, our top line continues to respond to the actions James has just spoken to, both to drive innovation, revenue growth management and improved execution, and all supported by a comprehensive range of brand building initiatives across the world. Organic revenue is up 6% year-to-date, and we've reached the ninth consecutive quarter of being within our long-term target. Our healthy top line and effective cost management are translating into solid underlying operating margin expansion across all 3 areas of the business: our geographic segments, Global Ventures and Bottling Investments. And we're doing this while continuing to invest in our brands. We've made steady progress in improving our free cash flow position, which is up 41% year-to-date. We're achieving this through solid underlying performance, acting on working capital initiatives, in addition to tapering off our productivity and restructuring costs. ","Our progress has enabled us to grow in line with our earnings per share expectations, despite an 8 point currency headwind, setting us up to meet our guidance for the year. We are pleased that the business is responding to the actions we've been taking. But as always, we aim to do better. We will continue to make the right investments in the business to sustain this momentum into the future. ","Turning to our financial performance for the quarter. We delivered solid 5% organic revenue growth with contributions across all operating segments. As expected, revenue growth was driven by strong price\/mix due to our revenue growth management initiatives in the marketplace, along with some items we are cycling from the prior year. ","The biggest driver of these items was cycling increased inventory levels in our Brazilian Bottler's from last year. This put more than 2 points of pressure on concentrate sales in the quarter, and this was partially offset by a corresponding price\/mix benefit as our Brazilian business revenue per case is lower than the company average. We are also cycling the timing of certain deductions in the third quarter of last year, which was a slight benefit to price\/mix in the quarter. However, no impact on the year-to-date performance. So adjusting for these items, I would look at this quarter's 5% organic revenue growth as being on an apples-to-apples basis, 1% volume and 4% price\/mix. ","Underlying growth margin expanded about 120 basis points during the quarter with contribution across our geographic segments, Global Ventures and Bottling Investments. Operating margin was roughly even on an underlying basis, negatively impacted by cycling the timing of expenses and concentrate shipments in the prior year, in addition to the timing of certain items in the current year, including investments in marketing. This translated to 5% growth in comparable currency neutral operating income, which was more than offset by a stronger-than-anticipated 7% currency headwind. Comparably, EPS declined 2% in the quarter, impacted by a 6 point currency headwind. ","Turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With the momentum we see in the business, we're now guiding to organic revenue growth of at least 5%. This is translating into stronger underlying profit growth and an increase in our free cash flow guidance to at least $6.5 billion. Our underlying performance allows us to maintain our full year comparable EPS guidance, even in the face of increasing currency headwinds compared to previous expectations. ","Staying on currency for a moment. On the second quarter call, we provided an initial review -- view of 2020, namely that based on rates at that time, we expected a benign outlook. Since then, the dollar has strengthened, which has impacted our outlook for the -- for next year. Based on those recent movements, there will be an approximate 1 to 2 point currency headwind of revenue. And given the natural multiplier effect due to business mix, a 2 to 3 point headwind at operating income for full year 2020. This is almost entirely from movement in market rates as our hedging gains and losses in 2019 are minimal so far. ","With respect to our hedging program, we are nearly 100% hedged for the G10 currencies in 2020, but we have minimal hedges today for our non-G10 currencies. It goes without saying that several geopolitical factors can have an impact on our currency outlook between now and when we provide our full 2020 guidance in February. ","Coming back to 2019. In quarter 4, there are a couple of things you should consider. First, we have an additional day in the fourth quarter, which adds about 1 point of revenue growth. Second, we expect an estimated 2 point headwind to top line growth, biggest factor being the reduction in inventory levels by our European bottlers. You may recall that in the first quarter, price\/mix and concentrate shipments benefited from those bottlers increasing their safety stocks in advance of a potentially disruptive Brexit. We currently expect this to fully reverse in quarter 4, but, of course, it's subject to the pending Brexit outcome. The net of these 2 will result in a 1 point headwind to top line growth for the quarter. ","So in summary, we are pleased with the momentum we have in the business. We continue to invest for sustainable growth in the future, and we remain very focused on raising the performance bar everywhere to capture the opportunity available to us. ","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers","I almost hate to start on currency because there's so much talk about elsewhere, but it is a topic that's dominated conversation the last few months, especially. So John, looking ahead, I think the currency outlook for 2020 is less severe than a lot of investors feared. But I guess, the question is what levers do you feel you have to offset such FX impacts in terms of managing to dollar-based EPS and cash flow. My read is that in the past, the company leaned more on financial levers and hedging to try to work through FX headwinds, whereas now you think you can lean a little bit more on operating levers, like productivity and realized price\/mix. But is that right? I just love a little bit more color if possible as to how you're thinking about it and, more importantly, how we should all think about your flexibility, especially to the extent that FX volatility and, I hope this isn't the case, but if it continues to get worse.","John Murphy","Thanks, Steve. Just a few comments. First of all, you're correct in that the outlook, as we go into 2020, it's an easier picture to paint given what I just described in the call. Secondly, I think it's important to emphasize that our overall growth algorithm continues to start with an objective to win locally in all of our markets around the world and to take the appropriate actions to be able to do that on a sustained basis. I think, at the moment, we are also doing, I think, a much more integrated job in determining with our local operating leaders the degree to which we can also manage the various headwinds and leverage, the tailwinds that we have on an ongoing basis and particularly with respect to currency. ","As we think about next year, there's a lot of puts and takes still in the equation on both the operating and the nonoperating line, which we'll obviously provide more detailed guidance when we get to February. But I think the overall point I'd make is that with respect to managing this space as we go forward, it's important to keep in mind our primary focus is to deliver on that algorithm I just talked about, but we're doing it, I think, in a much more connected fashion around the world and taking advantage where it's possible of levers that allow us to mitigate some of the -- some of those headwinds.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I just want to ask a little bit about cash flow. So in particular, on CapEx, I think you took down the CapEx budget this quarter, but my recollection is you actually raised it last quarter. So John, I know you've talked sort of a conscious effort to reassess balance sheet overall and then obviously cash flow, so wondering if you could talk a little bit about kind of the change in CapEx and how you're thinking about that going forward.","John Murphy","Sure. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, let me start just to emphasize year-to-date, the strong cash flow is driven by underlying growth. We're cycling some taxes that we paid in the prior year. We're getting the benefit from the -- from working capital and from the -- a lowering of our onetime restructuring payments. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see the -- our capital expenditures finish the year in line with our previous guidance, actually just a little bit lower. I think we started at $2.4 billion. We're down to $2.2 billion. And the timing of a number of the projects we have is actually scheduled for the fourth quarter. So there's really no major change in our expectation for this year and going to next year with respect to CapEx. But as I've discussed in some previous conversations, the improvement in overall free cash flow remains a top priority for us, and we expect to continue to work on the initiatives that I've just outlined as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","John, I also wanted to keep on the cash flow topic. Operating cash flow guidance also moved up for the full year this quarter. So what's driving that? And as you think about the improved free cash flow outlook, you've now raised underlying free cash flow a couple of quarters in a row ex the structural items. So is that more timing-related and you're getting traction on some of the initiatives you put into place given your focus on this area? Or is it more you're discovering greater efficiencies with that focus and that means that the confidence around improving free cash flow conversion is actually moving up as you look beyond this year?","John Murphy","Yes. Thanks, Dara. First of all, I think the primary driver for this year is the underlying performance of the business. And so we're seeing an uptick in overall -- the overall delivery from operations. Yes, we have a plan underway, which is delivering on working capital. We're not -- I don't see -- I don't have any new news to talk about the working capital arena, but we just continue to plug away at the opportunities that we know are out there. ","And with respect to CapEx, as I just mentioned in my -- in the previous question, we see, for this year or next year, the range to be in the -- in that $2.2 billion, $2.4 billion taking into account of the fact that we have taken back into the full South Africa and the Philippines in the last 12 to 18 months. So going forward, I expect to see the continued health of the business in the primary driver. And we will continue to advance on the working capital plan, as I've previously discussed. And also as we go into next year, we will see a further tapering off of the onetime restructuring and productivity cost that we've incurred as part of the productivity program over the last three years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","I wanted to ask about unit volume this quarter was -- and year-to-date has been pretty good, but in the press release and also in prepared remarks, you talked a bit about just the focus on immediate consumption, cooler placements, right, which also just kind of smaller pack types, right? So it's -- so if you -- could you just give us a sense of just where transactions are trending relative to unit case volumes and just some color on that to get a better perspective and just whether the lift is even bigger or better than what we see in unit cases?","James Quincey","Sure. I mean absolutely, it's being driven by a strategic focus on immediate consumption packages and smaller packages, in particular. Lots of different shapes and sizes, no pun intended. Example, the U.S., the mini cans growing at 15%, so some clear strategic focus on driving immediate consumption and smaller packages. Transactions have been running ahead of average unit cases for a number of quarters there. It's running about 4% compared to about 2% on volume. So clearly, this is encouraging and something that we're after. And so it's heartening to see that the transactions coming in perhaps to simply put a point ahead all of unit cases.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So I only have one question, but let me try to have questions, but both are just clarification questions. One, given that you're establishing the free cash flow improvement as perhaps the next leg of the Coke story, can you talk more about when we should think about that cash being used to buy back more stock than just the dilution because you curtailed that obviously a while ago? And then secondly, you talked again a little bit about this in the prepared remarks, so it's a half question. The gap between the 0 basis points improvement on operating margin -- underlying operating margin versus 120 basis points on underlying gross margin. Can you just elaborate a little bit more about what you're doing there from an investment perspective?","James Quincey","Maybe I'll start with the first half of the two questions. Free cash flow, look, we've been pretty clear as we've gone around, which is we have a dividend coverage, which is not where we wanted to be. We set ourselves a target of expanding that, but also made a clear point that it would clearly be our intent to see the dividend continue to grow. So we would like to see EPS track for multiple periods ahead of the dividend growth and obviously have the cash flow grow faster than the earnings. From where we are now, that -- we need some runway to get to a more comfortable point. So of course, when we come to our guidance for 2020 next year, we'll be clear on what we're doing, but I don't think we are likely to have a programmatic increase until there's substantially more flexibility.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.","Sunil Modi","James, maybe you could just talk about and give us an update on cost and really trying to understand what the longer-term vision is with that particular part of the business. And then if I can slip another one in, and apologies for doing this, but you've talked in the past about kind of the balance sheet and kind of realign to the prior question. So just where are we in that process in terms of thinking about some of the equity investments you have and potentially having some cash to realign the balance sheet, so you can kind of fix the cash flow situation?","James Quincey","Yes. Sure. I mean cost, we've talked a little bit about it in the last call. The integration -- or the separation from Whitbread and the integration in the Coke system has gone well ahead of schedule. We bought the associates over. The business is also up. That's been accomplished successfully. It will be fair to say that in the short term, the U.K. business has been impacted by the consumer sentiment driven by Brexit in the U.K., which has affected everyone, the entire business outlook in the U.K. But I think, over the long term, we're actually more encouraged about the opportunities to drive the various platforms. ","And we certainly see a lot of interest, and we're setting up the partnerships with the bottlers and working with customers on how we can bring a package of coffee platforms to support that growth, whether it be the Costa Express machine, which is -- continues to have a lot of extra placements coming through this year. And we see a lot more as we go into the future, all providing Proud to Serve or beans and machines as a service to customers and, then at some point, ready to drink, which is not going to likely be the first entry point. We'd like to see the brand exist before doing ready-to-drink. But we launched it in the U.K. and early days, but sales are ahead of expectations. It's doing very well in the context of the coffee strategy. So we see some good validation of the strategic idea of using the different platforms with our system to drive coffee as a solution for customers around the world.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","I was just trying to see what are your plans for Coke Energy in terms of ACV in the U.S. and how broadly you would think it can be positioned in terms of the shelf for the energy shelf? And if I can squeeze a Latin American question, I would appreciate it, but I'll defer to you.","James Quincey","Thanks, Andrea. So Coke Energy, obviously, we've launched it in sort of 20-plus countries around the world so far in 2019. And I think we've got some excellent learnings. It's resonated -- some things have resonated in some places. We've got some learnings on things we need to improve. We've been able to build that into the -- a sort of 2.0 version that we'll be rolling out in the U.S. I think the U.S. marketplace, in order to really drive towards a strategy that brings new consumers into the energy category, we're moving the flavor profile closer to Coke. Plans -- we'll save some of the bells and whistles of the plans for a later date, so that a very clear approach in the U.S. to drive additional growth for the energy category by taking the product closer in flavor to Coca-Cola Classic. And then in the rest of the world where we have launched it in some of those markets, we'll be building on the learnings to date and evolving next year. And we see an opportunity to play a role for Coke Energy in the energy category and within the Coke franchise to bring some new consumers and some new relevance to the trademark.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","You think about talking -- you mentioned affordable packaging in Mexico and that aligns with what we're hearing from a bunch of other CPG companies, including Diageo, which is normally high-end spirits. Is there something perhaps more secular permanent that you're seeing in some of these markets that leads you to focus more on affordability rather than just an economic cycle?","James Quincey","I think it's largely the economic cycle, especially in the case of Latin America. I mean there's no doubt that there's been a difference in the last 10 years than the previous 10 years where, prior to financial crisis, there was more creation in the middle ground. And over the last 10 years, there's been a section of society in -- all around the world that have felt under pressure, the lower income end. And more of the wealth has been generated at the top -- while income has been generated at the top. So you've seen, in the last 10 years, in general, across many industries a bifurcation growth in both the top end of the luxury end and growth in the value end. And so yes, there is a piece here, in general, of a spreading out of the pricing spectrum in categories based on that trend. But I think, in the case of Latin America and Mexico that we've talked about, this is very much the kind of the pressure that some of these economies have been under lately and a doubling down on affordability. And the reason we've been out there is because we have an infrastructure that's very much a set up to be able to serve the needs of those with less income.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore.","Robert Ottenstein","James, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about trademark Coke in the U.S. It's doing quite nicely. And what I'm interested in learning is in terms of what's going on with the business, is it primarily share gains from your competitors? Or are you recruiting new customers to the brand? I'm particularly interested in how the brand is doing with consumers, let's say, under the age of 30 or 20, whatever number you want to take and to what extent you're able to continue to keep the brand very vibrant with the younger consumers.","James Quincey","Sure. I mean I think, firstly, clearly, part of this is a revitalization of the sparkling business. It's clear that the strategy of making Coke the brand relevant with marketing, with innovation, of getting it in formats that are more on target for consumers, whether that be the Zero Sugar or the smaller packages is part of getting growth to be in the sparkling soft drinks category. And I think you can see that and as a demonstration of what is going on with Coke. So I mean in a way, it's a formula that's always been true and is true around the world. You need innovation, you need marketing, you need relevance, you need packaging, you need execution and you need to be able to engage. And I think what you're starting to see is, yes, some reconsideration of the category by whatever age you want to take it down to, let's call it loosely, the millennials of the sparkling category. Has it flip-flopped overnight? No, it hasn't, but I think you're starting to see that if you bring relevantly marketed innovation for the right occasion to people, then they will engage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William Chappell","Just want to follow back up on Brexit kind of near term and longer term. Didn't fully understand, for fourth quarter, is it -- if Brexit goes through, you'll have to destock and if it doesn't, you won't? Or is it automatically, the destock is expected to happen? And then do you expect, again, if Brexit goes through, for a pickup in sales? I mean do you expect a better environment as we move into 2020?","James Quincey","Well, I mean, if it mercifully all comes to an end, then yes, I do think our sentiment will improve, maybe not overnight, but over time and, hopefully, going into 2020. I think it's not as mechanistic of if they pass the vote, the stock drops out and if they don't pass the vote, the stock doesn't drop out. We'll need to see what happens tomorrow. I mean call us on Monday. We'll see what happens tomorrow with the super vote. But we would clearly like to err to seeing inventories normalize. So our preferred path would be to see normalization of the inventory by the end of the year. Clearly, we need to see what form the agreement does or doesn't take in the coming days. But as you should take it from us that our preferred outcome is unwinding of that extra inventory, but it's no -- there's no guarantee because we need to manage through it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.","Laurent Grandet","Just to put off actually Coke Energy. I mean you announced the launch of Coke Energy in the U.S. from January 1 with 4 SKUs in total, 2 more than in Europe and at a price point where it's just in the middle between Red Bull and Monster and not any more aligned with Red Bull. So I'd like to understand what are the learnings you get from the launch you already did this year that triggered those changes. And what do you expect, I mean, for Coke Energy in the U.S.?","James Quincey","Sure. I mean I think the two most obvious learnings, one I mentioned that I'll just repeat, which is to bring the formula of Coke Energy closer to Coke Classic. The energy category in the U.S. is much more developed than many of the other markets. And therefore, we are clearly taking an approach of trying to bring new consumers into the category rather than competing for the current ones. And we believe that based on our experiences in the launch markets and our research in the U.S. that doing so with a formula closer to Coke will be more effective. ","On the pricing, clearly, the structure of the pricing and the relative weights of competitors at price points in the U.S. is different to Europe. And therefore, we've chosen to go in that -- in a slightly different direction or slightly more balanced starting point with a broader portfolio of SKUs. Obviously, we're looking for shelf visibility by having the full packages of the 4 variants. And that's kind of part of what, of course, is a learning from Coke Energy, but actually that's true in many other categories, that you need to have some standout especially if the shelf has a lot of SKUs in it already. I mean if you go to some of the markets where we launched around the world and the energy category is underdeveloped, 1 or 2 SKUs is enough to make an impact. But if you're in a more developed part of the world and there's more competitive offering, then you need a bit more presence. And I think that's what's driving that. And we'll launch in the U.S. And no doubt, we'll learn and we'll continue to evolve and focus on driving this as part of driving the Coke Trademark and the revitalization of the Coke Trademark, which has been very pleasing for all of us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.","Amit Sharma","James, it looks like the message, at least on the consumption point of view, is still fairly upbeat even as the macros continue to get a little bit tougher. And you've talked about that a little bit from a profitability point of view in L.A. But can you elaborate that a little bit historical connection between consumption and GDP? Is that changing a little bit? Or is the playbook different for Coke than it has been in the past recessions?","James Quincey","Sure. I mean, firstly, yes, on a long-term basis, our business is correlated with GDP growth. So in the long run, that matters. Secondly, as I commented in the last quarter, there are some storm clouds in the sky. It -- have raining in a few places, but it's not -- there's not a total problem here. And I think the approach we're taking is to not overinvest our time looking in the news as to whether that is or isn't a global recession, but to focus on what we can do and to recognize that a lot of work has revitalized our top line. And our emerging bottom line has been up in the actions we've taken. And as we look around the world, whilst we can certainly find places where we do things really well, we are not a 10 out of 10 on any of the strategic initiatives all over the world. So we have a lot more we can do over our marketing and portfolio management, on innovation, on revenue growth management, on investment in the media consumption and calls and on execution. And so the way we look at it is, look, you could waste your time looking at the forecast, but actually, if we stick to our needing and execute against that strategy, we can drive the growth we need.","Operator","Our next question comes from Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","And congratulations on a great growth on brand Coke.","James Quincey","Thank you.","Caroline Levy","I just want to touch on Global Ventures and Bottling Investments, which are businesses that should see faster top line growth than the rest of the business, I think. And the Global Ventures margin looks like running around 11% to 12% and bottling around 3%. So are these sort of unusually low levels because of all the recent changes in both divisions, the creation of one and the change in the other? And do you see those trending upwards beginning in 2020? Or is that longer term? And maybe you can just help us size out what a more normalized margin might look like on those businesses.","James Quincey","So let me start with that one. Yes. So firstly, should Global Ventures and BIG be going faster than the average? Yes. Clearly, part of the idea of the Global Ventures is we've invested in categories that we are treating slightly differently in order to drive much better growth. So one, yes, they should be growing faster. ","Two, when looking at Global Ventures, and we might try and kind of explain more when we get to the February guidance, it's got a mix of some very different businesses, whether that be the Dogadan tea business or Innocent or the Monster partnership or Costa. So I don't think you can talk about a normalized margin for Global Ventures because it encompasses a set of different businesses. But what we certainly should see is faster growth on the top and the bottom line. ","And in the case of BIG, clearly, we had a lot of ins and outs on that group. But I think if you like, philosophically, historically, we have, perhaps in using the expression hospital ward for some of our bottlers, invited the idea that they should be -- or that they're going to be underperforming. And I don't think that's how we want to look at that going forward. We think they should be making margin returns and growth rates that are equivalent to what the best of our bottlers do in like markets. I mean the margin structures in emerging markets and developed ones are not the same, but we should certainly be aspiring and heading towards performance that is above average for a like-for-like market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean King with UBS.","Sean King","Just maybe a little bit in a whiz, but given that this is the first time you're giving your -- a preliminary next year FX outlook and considering the very recent favorable move, when did you mark currencies to market for that outlook?","John Murphy","Let me take that. Monday, that's the very precise answer.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","And congratulations on the strong result.","James Quincey","Thank you.","Kevin Grundy","Question on price\/mix. You spend a lot of time on these calls discussing the various initiatives around revenue growth management. And while unit case results are quite good, the price\/mix contribution is 6%, certainly materially higher than The Street had modeled and what we should expect going forward. So a few questions related to that, James. I mean, one, had price\/mix come in relative to your own expectations in the quarter? Two, how much did Argentina contributed in the quarter? And then three, how should we be thinking about this in the fourth quarter and into next year?","James Quincey","Sure. So clearly, price\/mix is atypically higher. It is -- there's a little bit of Argentina in that. But actually, there's a quite a bit about cycling some of the inventory that was in Brazil from last year. So I think it's much more sensibly thought of as a 4% rather than a 6%. Still a excellent number for the quarter. And I think if you look back over what's been happening in '18 and '19, you're seeing more of a 3%. Obviously, it was a number we expected to come in. And so I think the revenue growth management initiatives, which have been rolled out and still have some good runway ahead of them, along with the brand building and innovation, which earns us the right to be able to put the right pricing into the marketplace, is what makes us think we can take that forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I actually wanted to ask on margins. You've really done a good job of telegraphing some of the pressures you're facing from a margin perspective this year. But that said, just hoping you could give us a sense as to how we should expect margins to trend over the next years once the effects of FX and M&A start to subside. I think it would be helpful to hear some of the key levers you have that you can pull to ultimately drive margin expansion and really just touch on what gives you the confidence that the business can grow margins on an underlying basis.","John Murphy","Thanks, Bonnie. Let me take that. First of all, as I said, when we look at the total company, we're really looking at margins across the 3 business segments that we have, our geographic core businesses, Global Ventures and the Bottling Investments Group. Within each of those businesses, we -- we've got pretty clear line of sight on the levers that we have at our disposal. Starting with the top line -- if I take for example in our -- in the core business, starting on our top line, innovation and increasing focus on premiumizing the innovation agenda, continuing to take advantage of the revenue growth management works that's -- that we -- that's been in its current iteration and expanding that around the world are examples of ways in which we can drive at the -- certainty at the gross margin line. Cost management across each of these three groups, there's a different bucket of cost in each and there's ongoing -- we see ongoing opportunity to operate more efficiently and more effectively. And specifically within the marketing arena, we have a large $5 billion, $6 billion base. We continue to mind new ways of driving greater output from that investment base. ","So overall, we -- we're confident that margin expansion, as is implicit in our long-term growth model, is manageable. Our performance year-to-date -- underlying performance year-to-date would -- gives me confidence that, that can continue. And as we work towards the February call and talk more about 2020, we'll be in a position to give you a little more texture on some of the specific areas of opportunity in the coming 12 months.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer","I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on the mini can business in the U.S., which is clearly doing exceptionally well. So a couple of questions on that. Number one, can you just remind what it represents as a percentage of sales for the Coca-Cola franchise? Number two, do you have any targets over the next kind of 1, 2, 3 years in terms of continued -- continuing to drive that mix shift? And number three, are there any CapEx considerations around future growth of mini cans or small format more broadly?","James Quincey","Sure. I mean we don't break out the percentage of the total business that mini cans is representing. But certainly, we are focused on driving that. Along with a series of other immediate consumption packages and smaller format packages, I think the mini cans being the most emblematic one, it grew 15% this quarter. So we're very pleased with this opportunity. We don't kind of, as a target to pursue, I said, well, it should be this percent of sales because, ultimately, if you're going to be consumer-centric, you will end up with the percentage that the consumers want to buy rather than what you want to sell. And so I think, philosophically, we focus most on making our brands or our packages or whatever bundle we're selling drive on the relevancy for the consumer. And if that's -- if we've got it right it, it will go up. And if we haven't, we have to go back to the drawing board. It is worth noting that mini cans do require some CapEx. And so, yes, the more successful they are, the more we'll have to adjust some of the manufacturing footprint to do it, but that's a good problem to have.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session.

Please look on our website for this information.","Now, let me turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Jackson, and good morning, everyone. We delivered sequential volume growth in the third quarter while capturing global non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage value share for the 25th consecutive quarter. We gained volume and value share across core sparkling, juice and juice drinks, sports drinks and ready-to-drink teas. Importantly, we were able to do this in combination with a 2% increase in price mix. ","Excluding the impact of structural items, we generated comparable currency neutral net revenue growth of 4% and strong operating income growth of 8%. Our broad diversified product portfolio, the disciplined approach to extracting and reinvesting savings and our global geographic reach are enabling us to effectively navigate a still uncertain macroeconomic environment. History has taught us that when we invest through difficult times, we emerge even stronger.","This quarter our system delivered the highest number of servings ever reported in the third quarter both for brand Coca-Cola and across our portfolio. In all, we delivered 181 billion servings thanks to global volume growth of 2% driven by 2% global growth in brand Coca-Cola. This record number of servings speaks not only to our systems worldwide strength, but also to the opportunities ahead of us as we engaged with the next-generation of global consumers. Our global still brands also delivered solid results, growing 3% and gaining global value share. These third quarter results bring our year-to-date volume growth to 2% cycling 5%.","In line with our expectations for the third quarter, we delivered sequential volume growth in many key markets including North America, China, India and regions across Europe. That said, clearly the global economy remains challenged as noted by the International Monetary Fund last week, which trimmed this forecast for global output for the sixth time since early last year.","And as we have all noted, emerging markets have become increasingly more volatile further exacerbating a challenging global landscape. Hence, disposable income and consumer spending have become challenged and consequently have impacted the overall growth of the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink industry.","Yet, despite these ongoing headwinds, our business remains healthy and we continue to invest in the strength of our brands. We are fully implementing our productivity and reinvestment plans and together with our global bottling partners we continue to advance our system. All of this leads us to remain confident in our ability to drive our volume growth trajectory back in line with our long-term growth model over time.","Looking first to our operations in North America, brand Coca-Cola grew an impressive 2% in the quarter, leading our total beverage portfolio to 2% growth on top of 2% growth in the prior quarter -- in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date volume growth in North America is even as we cycled 2%.","Sparkling beverages were even in the quarter with sparkling price mix increasing 1%. Year-to-date, sparkling price mix is up 2% as we remained committed to a rational pricing environment.","We also remained focused on consistent investments in packaging innovation, in immediate consumption growth and increased teen recruitment, all of which are yielding positive results.","Specifically, packages like the 1.25 liter and mini packs -- mini can packs have increased our household base by more than 1.8 million in the last year. In addition, Coca-Cola has generated over $19 million incremental immediate consumption transactions year-to-date and importantly, Coca-Cola remains the most preferred beverage brand amongst teens by 2 to 1 margin.","Still beverage volume grew a solid 5%, with volume and value share gains across the energy, juice and juice drinks, water and tea categories. In sports drinks we gained volume share while maintaining value share.","As these results indicate, our revenue growth management strategies are working and enabling our system to provide consumers the brand they love, the convenience that they crave and the value that they need, while also expanding our topline. We continue to outperform the industry, gaining volume and value share across both sparkling and still categories.","I\u2019m also pleased to share that we are making progress on the evolution of our North America system as our North America team continues to advance discussions with existing and prospective partners who are eager to be part of this dynamic franchise system.","Turning now to Latin America, our volume growth was even in the third quarter, cycling 5% growth and coupled with a double-digit increase in price mix, due primarily to continued and disciplined focus on price and pack architecture enhancements, as well as inflationary environments in some markets. Across the region we gained non-alcoholic ready-to-drink volume share, making this the 25th consecutive quarter that we maintained or gained volume share.","Similar to what we have experienced in other markets, we are seeing a slowdown in economic growth in Mexico and Brazil. Falling GDP growth rates have led to slower growth rates in personal consumption and consequently in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages.","As in other instances where we have witnessed economic slowdowns in recent years, we are expanding our marketing efforts, while actively working with our bottling partners to invest in these markets and to offer consumers attractive price pack combination. Examples include the expansion of returnable glass bottle distribution and initiatives to ensure affordability tied to magic price points. Outside of Mexico and Brazil, we experienced solid performance with volume growth of 4% in the quarter. ","Moving on now to Europe, we again witnessed diverging results with 3% volume growth in Northern European countries, offset by a 5% volume decline in countries that make up Central and South Europe for a net decline of 1% in our European business in the third quarter. In spite of this challenging environment, we gained volume share in core sparkling across the entire continent while continuing to strengthen our competitive positions across the non alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry in our Central and Southern European business unit.","Price mix increased 8% in the quarter, including the impact of the consolidation of Innocent. Our Share a Coke campaign was extremely well received. We placed over 2.5 billion customized packages into the market to drive team recruitment and further bolster immediate consumption.","Lastly, our operations in Germany continued to perform well delivering 3% growth in the quarter cycling 3%. This performance was fuelled by high single digit growth in brand Coca-Cola and double-digit Coke Zero growth. Sprite and Fanta also contributed to growth in the quarter in Europe. ","The Eurasia and Africa group grew 4%, cycling 11% as we maintained focus on broadening distribution, honing our marketing efforts and strengthening brand loyalty in the more than 80 countries that make up our business in this dynamic region. Volume growth grew 4% led by brand Coca-Cola which grew 3% and Sprite which grew 4%. Still beverage volume grew 3% in the quarter. The Eurasia and Africa group maintained volume share in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages while growing volume share in sparkling beverages and juice and juice drinks.","Both the Middle East and North Africa business unit and the Central East and West Africa business unit maintained their strong first half volume performance in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, the Eurasia and Africa group is up high single digits, cycling 10% growth and has been an important contributor to our year-to-date performance. Our Pacific group delivered 5% growth in the quarter improving sequentially from the second quarter and cycling 4% from the prior year quarter. Sparkling beverages led with 5% growth as Brand Coca-Cola delivered 7% growth and Sprite grew 5%. Still beverage volume also grew 5% in the quarter, while cycling 7% growth. ","As noted, our second -- as noted during our second quarter call, we anticipated a better second half of the year in China and I'm pleased to report that we were able to deliver 9% volume growth in the quarter, led by 8% growth in sparkling beverages. Earlier this year, we began to evolve our strategies in China to reflect the current economic and competitive environment and also to position ourselves for continued sustainable profit growth.","Our business in India delivered 6% growth in the quarter, cycling double digits. We achieved this growth while increasing prices across our juice brands to offset higher cost of goods. In addition, volume grew by strong double digits through September once the impact of the extended monsoon abated. Brand Coca-Cola again led the way with 22% growth in the quarter.","We are pleased with these results and with our solid volume and value share gains across sparkling and still beverages in India. Looking ahead, we have strong marketing programs planned for the fourth quarter of this year and into next year. I'm particularly excited about two iconic marketing programs that will ignite consumer passions across key markets. Specifically, the Olympic Torch relay recently started [ph] from Asian Olympia as it begins its relay journey across Russia. And the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour is also underway with stops planned in 89 countries where passions for football run high.","Further, throughout our company's history we've always been at the forefront of cultural change in forming the conversation, inspiring our youth to act and bringing resources to our local communities all across the world. This legacy has sprained our thinking about forging effective and lasting partnerships, creating shared value, making a positive societal difference in areas that are of critical importance to our business specifically water, woman and wellbeing.","Returning to our global performance, we benefited from marked sequential improvement in several key markets. We achieved robust and widespread growth of our flagship brand and we delivered solid financial results.","Our efforts to enhance the health of our system are working as evidenced by our broad based growth improving execution and strong cash generation. At the same time, we also acknowledged that we have more work to do as we will no doubt face headwinds as we work towards our 2020 vision.","Nevertheless the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage industry is a vibrant and rewarding business to compete in and our business has consistently grown. And I can assure you that underlying forces that shaped our 2020 vision just a few years ago remains very much intact today.","Together with our global system partners, our roadmap is enabling us to strategically invest both through good times and challenging times to deliver long-term sustainable performance.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Gary.","Gary P. Fayard","Thanks Muhtar and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results underscore several key points. First, the global economy is still struggling to recover with increasing volatility across emerging markets.","Second, slowing economic growth clearly impacted consumer spending and overall non-alcoholic ready-to-drink industry growth in the quarter. And third, in spite of these macro trends, our strategies and solid execution enabled us to once again capture global value share and to deliver solid financial performance.","As Muhtar said we grew our global volume 2% in the quarter while at the same time delivering solid financial results. While we\u2019re pleased with this sequential volume improvement, we remained focused on further advancing our volume growth trajectory over time. ","Concentrate sales were slightly below unit case volume growth in the quarter but we\u2019re in line with unit case sales year-to-date.","Moving onto our financial results, each of our geographic operating units contributed to comparable currency neutral operating income growth in the quarter. Comparable currency neutral net revenues were even both in the quarter and year-to-date, excluding the impact of structural items, this would primarily be the Philippines and Brazil bottler, net revenues increased 4% for the quarter and 3% year-to-date. We realized a healthy 2% global price mix for the quarter and 1% price mix year-to-date. Importantly, year-to-date price mix was positive across each of our geographies with the exception of the Pacific due to geographic mix.","Also as you know, we consolidated the Innocent brands in Europe which helped our price mix in the quarter but just to be clear our global price mix was 2% without the Innocent brands benefit.","As expected, our gross margins moderated somewhat this quarter due to geographic mix. We expect our full-year gross margins to be relatively in line with our year-to-date comparable gross margins. Excluding the impact of structural items, we achieved five points of favorable operating expense leverage for the quarter while we continued to support our brands through increased marketing investments.","Our operating expense leverage now stands at three points year-to-date and we expect low single digit leverage for the full year. As a reminder, we are cycling the reversal of expenses related to one of our long-term incentive plans in the fourth quarter of last year.","Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 7% this quarter and 5% year-to-date, excluding the impact of the structural items, operating income grew 8% in the quarter and 6% year-to-date. Therefore we now expect our full-year operating income to be generally in line with our year-to-date performance.","On a comparable basis, the impact of currency was a 5% headwind on this quarter\u2019s operating income results, a full point more than we expected due to the -- and this is due to the weakening of many of the emerging market currencies. We now anticipate continued currency headwinds will have an unfavourable impact on the operating income in the 5% to 6% range in the fourth quarter. ","Comparable earnings per share grew 4% in the third quarter, despite currency headwinds of about 5%. Year-to-date comparable earnings per share also grew 4%, despite headwinds from currency of about 4%. We generated $7.7 billion in cash from operations year-to-date and have repurchased $2.7 billion of our shares in line with our plans to repurchase $3 billion to $3.5 billion this year. Equity income came in lower than in the prior year quarter due to the ongoing challenging macroeconomic conditions around the world. We expect equity income will continue to be impacted by these factors. ","Let me now provide you just with a couple of reminders as we look through the balance of the year. Looking forward as mentioned in our second quarter earning call, we anticipate that bottling transactions, including the impact of the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations early in the third quarter, will have a 3% structural impact on our full year 2013 net revenues. Likewise, our full year operating income results should see a 1% negative structural impact.","In closing, we are strategically navigating through these challenging macroeconomic times, investing in our business to steadily strengthen our competitive position and to drive balanced growth and long term sustainable performance. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Muhtar, I was hoping for more granularity on emerging markets given the Q3 slowdown, particularly in Latin America, which was in contrast to some improvement we saw in China and India. So can you give us an update on macro environment as you look around the world and also some of the strategies you mentioned you were implementing, are you gaining traction at this point from a market share standpoint and should we expect to see volume performance in emerging markets improve as we look out going forward from here?","Muhtar Kent","Yes, Dara good morning. Now I think first, it\u2019s important to realize that there are different timings across the world to some of the volatility in macroeconomics and particularly what's interesting for us which is disposable incomes. So I think China has already had a slowdown and is beginning to recover. We see that and there\u2019s always also a lag between GDP, per capita and disposable income. So also important to realize that they don\u2019t all happen at the same time. The numbers don\u2019t correspond to each other one to one. And so we do see an improvement in Southeast Asia, and parts of certainly China where things have stabilized and things \u2013 people are beginning to normalize their sort of habits.","And in the last sort of three, four months we\u2019re seeing a flight of currency from emerging markets, market stock exchanges in countries back into North America, that\u2019s had an impact on disposable incomes in Latin America, in Eurasia, in countries like Turkey and other countries \u2013 and certain other countries in North Africa. So yes, those are \u2013 and you can track stock exchange indexes and you can track disposable income growth or slowdown. They are all very related and we do see that the world is not just one city or one sort of element of volatility. ","There are different pockets of volatility happening at the same time. And what we are fortunate with is a great portfolio, a wonderful portfolio where India slows down, maybe seven, eight, nine months ago, it\u2019s coming \u2013 we see some comeback in terms of disposable incomes I\u2019m talking about and China is the same, Southeast Asia, ASEAN similar, Philippines also pretty much in that camp and then, we certainly also see that we still got some headwinds maybe in other parts of the world. So there are some tailwinds coming and some headwinds coming, and we continue to invest in our brands.","And when you look at our performance, we have sequential improvement in many parts of the world, particularly when you look at places like India, places like China, ASEAN, even also developed markets such as Australia and also South Africa.","And our African continent, I haven\u2019t mentioned that countries that are in Sub-Saharan Africa that are usually sort of south of 80 per capita, again grew in a very healthy manner this past quarter about 5% up and we expect Africa to continue to generate a good results and economies in Africa seem to be pretty buoyant and seem not to be too impacted. But of course, they are at a very slow level of their per capita development as well. I hope that helps.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then some of the strategies you are implementing, do you think, it is helping to drive an improvement in market growth at all or drive market share gains and do you feel comfortable that emerging market trends have bottomed in general at this point and we should see some improvement going forward or is it still too volatile to call right now?","Ahmet Bozer","I think, it\u2019s pretty, as I said, different pockets showing different results, but we have a very, very sharp focus on, I was down in Latin America recently, a month ago. I have visited many countries in Africa recently, as well as in Asia. That we have an incredibly sharp focus on brand price pack channel architecture, new price points, lower price points, more focus on affordability, more focus on returnable packs and smaller packs, individual packs, that helped continue to keep the drinkers base growing, which is key and essential to when economies also start turning up and when disposable income start heading north.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Pecoriello from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Good morning, everybody.","Muhtar Kent","Good morning.","Bill Pecoriello - Consumer Edge Research","Muhtar, critics have said that Coke\u2019s growth story is over and reflected in the stock price pointing to the slowing emerging market growth you were just talking about, declines in Diet soft drinks, some say the pricing in U.S. is irrational and inability to grow in big markets like U.S. and Mexico? Could you explain why you still see solid growth ahead for the company and what the company is doing in terms of innovation, productivity, you mentioned price pack earlier to drive that growth and why the critics who declared the growth story is over are wrong? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. Thanks, Bill. First, philosophically, from a strategic point -- vantage point, the whole story of balanced growth we believe is still very intact, balance being growth in western markets, growth in emerging markets, balance being growth in sparkling and growth in still beverages and you see that happening in this past quarters as well. So we have grown in markets like United States, which we believe is a long-term growth market and when you think about it 14 of the last -- of the last 14 consecutive quarters, we have grown in all but one of them and now we have generated again 2% growth with 2% growth of brand Coca-Cola.","So we, Australia grew, many important markets in Western Europe grew, Germany grew again 3%, countries in Northwest Europe generated good healthy growth for us. So, and then emerging markets. Yes, there are some headwinds that are happening in emerging markets but we believe they are very temporary.","The whole demographic, the whole investment, the whole story of 1 billion new middle class still holds very strong in our opinion by 2020 over this last -- this past decade that we are in, this decade that we are in, a 1 billion new middle class, that bodes very well for our - the industry we are in and we believe we can continue to generate very healthy good growth. We believe we can continue to generate very healthy price earnings -- I mean, I'm sorry, price mix and we believe that therefore like in this past quarter, which was where we did see a lot of headwinds, we generated 4% revenue growth and 8% currency neutral operating income growth. And we believe that there is -- we had a lot of headwinds. So as economies begin to move, I think, we will see a lot of improvement. I\u2019ll now ask Ahmet as well to make some comments on this and if need be also ask Steve to add his commentary. ","Ahmet Bozer","Bill, you mentioned a few items, I will just focus on a couple of them. Emerging markets as you would know if you look at the history that it goes through cycles. So it has a cycle of years and years of growth and every now and then you have economic headwinds and you managed through that. But the emerging growth \u2013 emerging market growth economically certainly isn\u2019t over and we have a formula which pretty much closely shows that as personal consumption grows, we actually grow with it.","Now having said that in some of the emerging markets where there might be personal consumption and macro headwinds, we can still grow, like India because we have very low per caps and we have significant investments in feet on the street, infrastructure, brands. We are just really building our business and India showed that again this year. So that's what I would say about your comment of the emerging market. The growth story there is far from over for a long time to come. And I guess, the rest were about U.S. pricing and decline in soft drinks. So maybe I should just pass that on to Steve.","Steve Cahillane","Yes. Thanks, Ahmet. First, I'd just underscore on the broader question what Muhtar said in his prepared remarks that in this quarter, we delivered the highest number of servings ever reported in the third quarter. So I think that bodes well for our growth story going forward. But with regards to North American pricing, which I heard you asked, Bill, and in particular sparkling price, we feel good about delivering positive price mix in the quarter of plus 1%, in line with our strategy to consistently earn at least one to two points of sparkling with consumers.","And the U.S. Coke system remains committed to taking rational pricing and we\u2019ve done this very well over the past several years. In fact, we achieved two to three points of price mix in sparkling beverages and across our total portfolio in both 2011 and 2012. Year-to-date we are 2% sparkling price mix, which we feel good about. But I think it\u2019s important to remember we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going to focus on consumer-centric pricing. And if I can give you an example of that -- the average price today of an eight-ounce serving of Coca-Cola is $0.25, exactly $0.25. This is up over 5% versus two years ago and it\u2019s up nearly 10% versus three years ago, which compares very favorably to the U.S. inflation market.","And this tells me really three things: First, at $0.25 we do not have an affordability issue. Coca-Cola remains a very affordable indulgence. Two, we've been able to earn price above inflation in the United States. And three, we still have plenty of room to continue to take price. But now addressing the third quarter in particular, we acknowledge we did strategically invest in select promotional activity in the back half of the summer through the Labor Day holiday. Given that we essentially didn't have much of a 4th of July holiday, a Memorial Day holiday, this Labor Day acted much more like a 4th of July holiday. But these investments were tied to specific occasion-based brands and packages to help drive incremental household penetration which they did, attract more consumers into the category, which happened and is very much in line with our longstanding North American strategy.","And all of these activities that we did, all of them to take price in the marketplace, I think, set us up very well to take more price in this quarter and going into 2014. So we are very confident that the pricing environment in North America remains very rational and we will able to continue to earn price in the marketplace in this quarter and going forward into next year.","Muhtar Kent","Yes, just let me round up that question with one final remark, Bill. And that is that once again, if you take our world average per capita of around 90, just under 90, you take the most populous nations of the world that are less than half of that per capita. India, China, Indonesia, way below that number, way below half of that number. We believe this and many other parts of the world as well in Africa, the youngest billion, we believe that -- we believe the critics whoever they are, are wrong. I don\u2019t understand that sentiment. We are growing while others are not at the moment and our business and balance portfolio is built for times like these. So we see this as a time of opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Hi. Good morning.","Muhtar Kent","Good morning Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Question about Mexico in excise taxes, I guess it\u2019s been in the press over the last -- especially more so over last couple of week and then speaking the some of your bottling partners. In Mexico, specifically teams like they are sort of more resigned to the potential that\u2019s it\u2019s going to be a reality.","So I guess if you can talk a little bit about just how you see the situation unfolding in Mexico? The extent that we get or you\u2019ll get an excise tax increase. How you plan to or do you plan to do anything differently in Mexico with response to it, may be some thoughts about elasticity and then finally just any concern that there is spillover into other market would also be helpful?","Muhtar Kent","Yes. Look Bryan, firstly let me just address that by saying regressive taxes do not work. And wherever we have seen them being implemented, in some cases they have been taken away by the government after two, three years. Basically like in Denmark they are not working wherever else they\u2019ve been implemented and so the consumer suffers and then its proven time and time after again.","We\u2019ve made our case to the government. We have tremendous respect for the government of -- President Pena Nieto. And we need to understand that -- and we have made our case that\u2019s really does not have anything to do with health policy. In order to address the health policy properly, we have to come and work together with government and with civil society to raise their awareness and to create program that will really work, that really drive physical activity.","And therefore just a regressive discriminatory tax on one part of the food industry, just is not going to work and would currently that\u2019s all I would really like to say because its discussions are in progress. And I don\u2019t want to comment any further.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Are there any preparations for, I guess, just trying to understand, if it does become a reality, is there -- do you have plans in place to deal with it if it does occur?","Muhtar Kent","Well I just don\u2019t want to comment on it at this moment. As I said it\u2019s -- there is lot of discussions going on and that would be wrong for me to publicly comment on any of those discussions. And therefore we\u2019ll deal with whatever the result is in the most effective way.","I can assure you that we will continue to prosper the business. We have -- we are one of the largest -- we are the largest consumer goods business in the country. We are largest contributors to the GDP in that country by a big margin. And we support millions of retailers in the country effectively for their livelihood and therefore I think that we will certainly find the right way forward whatever happens.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from John Faucher from JPMC. Your line is open.","John Faucher - JPMC","Thank you very much. Muhtar and Gary, you guys talked about the price mix number improving sequentially which was good to see. So Gary I guess -- you talk a little bit about how you see this playing out over the next sort of 12 to 24 months where you have the negative geographic mix offset by the sort of the positive mix on a per case basis is the bottler territories where you own the bottler gets better like North America versus the absolute level of pricing?","How should we look at those factors sort of competing against each other to try and map something out? And then one other housekeeping question, which was your comments on operating profits for the year, could you just revise those and restate those just because there is some confusion about whether it was currency neutral or non-currency neutral, what have you? Thanks.","Gary P. Fayard","Okay, John. Let me see how well I can do on this and then you can come back and ask. But first, going to price mix and just as a reprice in general on price mix, generally what we see and I am going to take this in steps. Generally what we see is you see pricing. So you see rate and mix -- positive rate and mix would be positive across almost all of the groups. You would then see negative -- generally you would see negative geographic mix and it's basically a function of higher growth in emerging market countries than developed market countries, which would give you a negative geographic mix. Then on top of that and you are absolutely right, then where we own bottlers and they are growing and that gives you then a positive price mix, because they are finished products versus concentrate.","So a couple of things. So if you go back to the second quarter, I talked about margins and I thought margins would moderate and because of geographic mix, in the follow-up to a question, I remember, I said because we expect North America to actually perform better and that will actually hurt margins because it\u2019s a finished product business where margins are lower. But it helps price mix and what you are seeing today is what price mix in North America was even for the quarter. We are getting positive price mix from our finished product businesses going forward and not talking about specifically about 2014, because we're still in the midst of planning 2014, we'll give you full review on our views on next year in the February call.","We are planning to take appropriate pricing that would -- and Steve referred to taking pricing in North America as well. So we are expecting to take pricing. So going forward what I would expect to see is that we should have a positive in rate going forward. We should have a positive in mix going forward. We should have a positive from finished products going forward. And we should have a negative from geographic mix. So, that's the kind of \u2013 and if you add all that up, it should be a positive price mix and that\u2019s what we would expect and it\u2019s what we would expect is within our long-term earnings growth model is positive price mix long term.","Now let me see if I can turn to operating income. When I was talking about operating income, it was definitely currency-neutral; it was an ex-structural. So let's be very clear on both of those. Currency-neutral and ex-structural. So operating income was 8% currency-neutral, ex-structural for the quarter and 6% year-to-date currency-neutral, ex-structural. And what I said was we now expect the full year to be generally in line with the first half of the year. So somewhere in that ballpark and that is net of currency neutral and net of the structural impact, because I can tell you with the structural impact it would -- it's a point of negative structural impact and so that would take our year-to-date from six to five, for example. So, just to be clear ex-structural, currency-neutral.","John Faucher - JPMC","So, and I am not trying to trick you into guidance or anything here. But it basically sounds like you are saying sort of currency neutral ex-structural mid-single-digit year-to-date. So therefore that implies to Q4 but then you talked about the currency impact. So as we are looking at those should basically offset to sort of get you to like slight operating profit growth for the quarter?","Muhtar Kent","Well, without giving guidance what we are basically saying is that the full year we think ex-structural and ex-currency at all to be in line pretty much where we are year-to-date.","Operator","Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","I had one follow-up question on North America and then a question about Europe. So in North America, there has been a lot written about the declines that we've seen in diet sodas and see if I am not sure if you went through that and whether you shared some of the similar concerns that people have written about the decline in diets and sort of your perspective on whether the artificial sweetener issue is impacting the category at all and kind of from your strategy and dealing with that situation?","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. Steve, do you want to address that?","Steve Cahillane","Yeah. Thanks, Judy. First, I didn\u2019t talk specifically about Diet. I would underscore that we have a very wide portfolio in North America led by brand Coca-Cola, which is twice the size of Diet Coke of brand Coca-Cola as you know grew 2% in the quarter which we are pleased with.","Diet Coke is like a lot of Diet products in the United States and not just beverages, but across the whole array of food are under a bit of pressure as people are questioning ingredients, ingredient safety and so forth.","But we believe very strongly in the future of Diet Coke, the number two sparkling brand in the United States. We\u2019ve got terrific programs against it. We are actually seeing increased incidence in the past quarter between 19 and 24 year olds. We think a lot of that has to do with the exciting new promotions with Taylor Swift, some of the new packaging we are bringing in the marketplace and increased focus on Diet Coke.","But there are headwinds. There are headwinds that we are facing and we face headwinds in a lot of different areas, in a lot of different places and this is just one of them. But last year it became the second best selling sparkling in the United States and we are continue to focus on it.","Coke Zero also a part of our zero-calorie portfolio grew mid-single digits in the quarter. So we are very happy about that. We\u2019ve got a great program around Coke Zero. College GameDay just kicked off. It\u2019s really becoming ever more relevant with young males.","So we are confident that throughout our whole portfolio we are offering consumers exactly what they want, when they want it, how they want it, at the right prices that they want it and we\u2019ll continue to focus on any of the headwinds around Diet Coke and we are confident that it has a bright future in this country.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just on Europe, the improvements that we saw in Northwest Europe and Germany as well, I guess, to what do you attribute that to, perhaps weather getting much better in the quarter as opposed to the macros and consumers, and kind of what you guys are doing to really rejuvenate growth in those markets?","Muhtar Kent","Well, Judy this is Muhtar. First, I think it\u2019s important to understand that and I\u2019ve said this in the past that the economies are performing at a different pace in the continents of Europe, not -- it\u2019s not everywhere is really bad, not everywhere it\u2019s really good. And so you still have very challenging consumer sentiments in Spain, in Italy, in Greece, in Portugal in the South, in Southeast Europe and what used to be termed as the Balkans, Romania, Bulgaria, former Yugoslavia. It\u2019s a very challenging environment.","And then you\u2019ve got a better environment in Northwest Europe and then certainly the best environment still in Germany. And so based on those, our business also reflects some of those conditions and so it\u2019s a pretty good mirror actually.","And I will ask Irial to comment on Germany and why we\u2019ve been consistently performing in Germany and growing our business. And again, the tremendous sequential improvement versus the first half in many countries of Northwest Europe, in Scandinavia and also Northwest European countries, Irial?","Irial Finan","Thanks, Muhtar. And this actually goes back to one of the earlier questions. I think in Germany we\u2019ve got an economy that\u2019s doing okay. We have got actually really good marketing, married up with continued excellent execution and you bring all that together and you get great results.","And for me in Germany it gives me great confidence about the future of our business, quite frankly, because we are seeing, where we\u2019ve put in the hard work, where we do the right things in the business. We do get good results and Germany is just an example of what can happen, quite frankly, in many markets around the world as the economies turn and improve.","Muhtar Kent","Ahmet, do you want to comment on that?","Ahmet Bozer","Yeah. I just wanted to -- hi, Judy. I just wanted to say to the others, so we had a very, very strong Share a Coke campaign across Europe this summer that worked extremely well. We are ever more closely aligned with our bottling partners, really driving growth.","And just on the macro, I\u2019d like to add that there is a clear divergence between north and south. So north continues to do better and south continues to do worse. So our business in the north certainly is reflective of that.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Can you just talk about the timing of some of the re-franchise in the U.S., because I think we talked a lot about it earlier in the year and it\u2019s kind of hit a low recently and then I\u2019ve a follow-up?","Muhtar Kent","Yes, I think it\u2019s all target as we have said -- reported previously, or we\u2019ve made very sound and significant and good progress and discussions with some of our existing partners, as well as discussions ongoing with some other prospective partners. So we are on target, if not, a little bit ahead and I think you'll hear more about it in the coming sort of period ahead of this and I will ask Steve just to maybe shed some more light on it.","Steve Cahillane","Bill, I mean the one thing I would really underscore is we absolutely have not hit a low. Don't take the absence of public commentary to mean that we are not making very good, very constructive progress. All of our bottling partners, both current and prospective, are extremely excited about this business in the United States about the opportunities to continue to be franchise partners in the United States, to grow the business in the United States. And we are making a very exciting progress and we will have more to report in the coming months.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","And then just on the SG&A costs, can you just give us a little bit more color on what drove some pretty significant efficiencies, that's obviously great? But was the advertising ratio flat or up and then maybe what drove some of the other improvements on that line item?","Muhtar Kent","Are you talking about productivity, Bill?","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Yes, productivity and SG&A broadly, yes.","Gary P. Fayard","Sure, Bill. Within the quarter, we continued to invest in marketing. So marketing is actually up in the quarter and up year-to-date. We had significant productivity savings in the quarter. We have some previously announced productivity programs that we announced back in 2012. Those 2012 programs will go through 2015 and really focus around productivity and then reinvesting those back into the business that we are focused on information systems, marketing, supply chain, innovation, operational excellence, that sort of thing.","I can tell you -- we will give you a full update on it at the year-end call. So I can give you the full year but we are making very good progress against the goals. And you will see that on the February call when we go through a full update. And we\u2019ve got hard savings and soft savings. So let me give you some examples of what's happening and it\u2019s adding into the productivity and some of the leverage that you are seeing. So -- and things like supply chain, if the pricing [ph] is cheaper, hard savings. So we are doing a lot around supply chain and actually getting a lot of hard savings and those you are seeing are being reflected. ","In marketing, if you can buy media cheaper, then we just buy more media. Basically it\u2019s what we are doing. So we are reinvesting back into marketing and be enable to buy more media for the same price, if you will. So we -- as I say we will give you a full update on all of the productivity programs in February at our year-end call. But we're making excellent progress and you're seeing a lot of that, it\u2019s what's coming through the G&A line, as I say within that marketing, SG&A marketing being up for the quarter and year-to-date.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Was there any benefit from the incentive compensation accruals, either this quarter or maybe end of the fourth quarter as well? ","Gary P. Fayard","Very, very little. There is a huge cycling of last year in the first quarter as I've mentioned earlier. But there is very little -- I mean there is a little bit but nothing of significance in the quarter of this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Just one quick thing and then a real question. So, I just want to underscore something again, because it's a key conspiracy and I think what Steve said a moment ago is music to a lot of investors\u2019 ears and I want to replay to make sure I understand. So did you say that the past couple of months in North America from a price, from an investment perspective were little bit more of a blip in that we should expect something like higher pricing that we saw in 2011 and 2012 going forward in North America?","Steve Cahillane","Yes, thanks Ali. I think that's a fair interpretation of what I said. This was a very different summer. It's been a difficult year starting with the fiscal cliff and sequestration and payroll taxes and so forth and then the summer was very sluggish. And it\u2019s very important in our business to keep consumers engaged with our brands to make sure that we are in the households, to make sure that teens are being recruited. And so Labor Day acted very much like 4th July or a Memorial Day, whereas typically it would not. It would be the end of summer. And Labor Day acted more like the only summer. So it was more promotional than you would have seen. It would be more promotional than what we would expect going forward.","But those things happened from time to time. And we think that the pricing environment will continue to be very strong, very rational and because of all the investments we\u2019re making in our brands, we feel that we have the opportunity to earn even more price going forward in the marketplace. And that would be absolutely our intention to do that.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. That makes perfect sense.","Ahmet Bozer","I just want to add one thing. In terms of the Nielsen\u2019s data, yes that\u2019s exactly the reflection but don\u2019t underestimate. We took very healthy pricing in [ice tea], also in the quarter. And so overall, that\u2019s how you get to the one price mix positive on sparkling. And so don\u2019t let that point go unnoticed at the moment.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","I appreciate that. That makes a lot of sense. And then a broader question, I don\u2019t know how often you revisit this but what do you think the company has to grow volumes between now and 2020 to deliver on the 2020 vision, given some of the recent slowdown in volumes. And I guess in that context, do you think as a company you have to acquire more to reach that vision?","Muhtar Kent","I would say that first we believe that our long-term growth model with appropriate mix which we believe we can take and we can generate. It would definitely get us to our 2020 vision of -- from our system revenue point of view of doubling our business with the base of 2010. So that is sort of trajectory if you like and we\u2019re on track in terms of moving ahead to doing -- achieving our goal.","The second piece is -- we always -- we\u2019ll always be looking for any kind of bolt-on acquisitions as may make sense but that\u2019s the expense of what I would say that right now we would be looking at. Bolt-on acquisitions and that\u2019s sort of if there is an opportunity, we will look at it seriously.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","And in some the difference of volume versus price mix to reach the system doubling goal, has that shift -- has it shifted at all between the two?","Muhtar Kent","Sorry. Sorry. Say that again.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Well, so to double the system sales by 2020, there is perhaps an ingoing assumption of what would be from volume and what would be from price mix. Has the recent global slowdown shifted that mix at all between volume growth and price mix growth to reach the doubling of sales?","Gary P. Fayard","I don\u2019t think materially. If you look at our long-term growth that sort of corridor of volume plus what we\u2019ve been achieving, I think the balance is still there.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","Okay.","Gary P. Fayard","Same as it used to be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research. Your line is open.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First question on China, can you talk about the acceleration, the pick-up in volumes there whether that was driven by any change in pricing or promotional levels and what your outlook kind of a normalized run rate because that region has been so lumpy in terms of volume growth kind of as we go into \u201814 whereas the base case of volume growth?","And then my second question is looking at the buyback program, the stock is on track for two years of relative underperformance. And we haven\u2019t seen that for a while and yet your targets for buyback hasn\u2019t changed since the beginning of the year. So I\u2019m kind of surprised the balance sheet you have with the weakness in the stock, and certainly Muhtar with your resounding confidence about the launch of outlook. You\u2019re not getting more aggressive on the buyback here? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","Yeah. I\u2019ll have Ahmet just comment on China then maybe Gary can finish off the second part of the question. Sure.","Ahmet Bozer","Thanks Wendy. You might remember that in our last call, we talked about the fact that we were evolving both our organization and our strategy in China. And what we see in the third quarter really encourages us that we had not only 9% growth in total but also 8% growth in sparkling.","And that\u2019s pretty much delivers on the expectation that we\u2019ve said that we would expect sequential improvement from the first half results in the second half of this year and we expect that sequential improvement from the first half results to continue into 2014.","To your question on pricing promotion, we did not have any significant marked pricing promotions in the marketplace. It was basically a combination of a), beginning to implement parts of our new strategy in the marketplace; b) the same share of co-promotion that we are scaling up these wonderful global assets in all parts of the world. And then our new team beginning to gel together connecting with our bottling system and really improving execution. So we are encouraged by those results and we expect to continue to, as I said, improve sequentially from the first half results.","Gary P. Fayard","Yes, Wendy, relative to share repurchase let me just first \u2013 let me just start with the preface that don't particularly agree with you on saying our share repurchase has relatively underperformed for the last two years. But after that, couple of thoughts on share repurchase. Our view on share repurchase is that share repurchase is value neutral. It is not something that grows value. It does for the short-term holder, so maybe you can get a buck in the share price but for the long-term holder it is not something that's value enhancing. It is much more like a cash sufficient dividend, which is the way we treat it. And that our priorities for cash are number one to reinvest in the business, to grow the business that will include bolt-on acquisitions et cetera. Number two would be dividends, which we have increased for the last 51 years, 10% this year and third, excess cash would be put into share repurchase. And just because we don't need the cash in the business, so it's a return of cash to shareholders. But leveraging the balance sheet to do something that we would view as value neutral, we don't think, is the right thing to do. So we continue to just perform exactly in line with the target that we set at the beginning of the year.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you, Gary, Ahmet, Steve, Irial and Jackson. We delivered sound third quarter results within an ongoing challenged macroeconomic environment. While we saw sequentially improvement in the business, we remain constructively discontent and resolutely focused on further advancing our growth trajectory. Our 2020 vision and long-term strategies remain firmly intact. And together with our global bottling partners we are investing in our brands and our capabilities to further strengthen our system and to drive sustainable growth and value.","As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

I want to start off today by recognizing that many of you are attending the CAGNY conference this week, given the timing of our earnings call and the fact that I will also presenting at CAGNY this coming Friday, we will keep our prepared remarks a little bit shorter to ensure that we have adequate time for your questions and that we can get you back into the conference.","With 2013 behind us I am now looking forward to joining forces with our global system associates as we work to restore momentum to our business in 2014. 2013 was clearly marked by ongoing persistent macroeconomic challenges and our business was not immune to these pressures. Nevertheless we delivered sound financial results and we grew global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages for a 26th consecutive quarter. ","Our volume -- our worldwide volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full-year. We delivered full-year comparable currency neutral operating income growth of 6% after excluding the impact of structural changes off of a comparable currency neutral ex-structural revenue growth of 3% for the full-year. And we delivered full-year comparable currency neutral EPS growth of 8% in line with our long-term growth targets. This performance underscores our ability to generate sound financial results even in a challenging environment. ","Our sparkling brands grew 1% in the full-year cycling 3% with brand Coca-Cola adding nearly a 100 million unit cases. In fact all of our billion dollar Sparkling brands except for Diet Coke Coca-Cola Light grew in 2013 contributing more than 140 million incremental cases in the full year. As of the end of 2013 we've gained core sparkling value share for 17 consecutive quarters. For the full year our portfolio of still beverage brands contributed over 300 million incremental cases or 5% growth while cycling 10% growth in the prior year. Importantly, we gained volume share and value share for the year. ","Our tea volume grew 11% for the full-year with solid performance across our entire tea portfolio. Juice and juice drinks grew 5% for the full year with strong performance by Minute Maid, Simply, [indiscernible] Minute Maid Pulpy Rani and InneSense. We are proud of our robust portfolio of leading juice and juice drink brands. ","Sports drinks grew 2% for the full-year with Powerade continuing its solid and consistent growth performance. ","Packaged water grew 5% for the full-year as we focused on growing over premium water brands and on expanding our PlantBottle and Ecoflex packaging. ","While 2013 was an unusual and challenging year, it has certainly not deterred us from our commitment to our 2020 vision. Many economies around the world remained volatile in 2013, developed markets are slowly starting to recover from this turbulent time and consumer expenditures remain moderated. And emerging markets faced substantial challenges as they dealt with fluctuating currencies and other structural issues. ","However, we remain optimistic and excited about the future of our business and brands in emerging markets after all per capita consumption for our brands remains relatively low in most emerging countries. That said, these emerging market conditions simply reinforce our commitment to remain focused on our long-term strategies and to keep investing through these tough times to ensure that we continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth.","In Europe we saw a 1% volume decline for the year. However, we gained sparkling and still value share and we were pleased by improving volume performance in certain key markets. A better second half of the year helped our North-West Europe and Nordics business unit close 2013 with 1% volume growth while Germany continued to outperform delivering 6% volume growth for the quarter and 2% growth for the year. Our successful share of Coke campaign last summer contributed to full-year trademark Coca-Cola volume growth of 1% in North-West Europe and Nordics and 5% in Germany.","We also launched share of Coke in our Iberia business unit in the fourth quarter of the past year and as in other markets the campaign has generated tremendous excitement contributing to strong double-digit immediate consumption growth and to trademark Coca-Cola growth of 2% in the quarter.","Moving now to Eurasia and Africa, full-year volume grew 7% cycling 10% in the prior year and we grew volume and value share in non-alcoholic ready to drink beverages for the full-year. All our business units delivered solid full-year volume growth including double-digit volume growth in our Middle East and North Africa business units. ","In Russia, strong Olympic and Christmas campaigns activated across the country view double digit growth in trademark Coca-Cola for the year and enabled us to gain core sparkling volume share while maintaining value share. Fittingly, leading up to this Olympic year our business achieved an all-time high market share for non-alcoholic ready to drink beverages. We recently completed a successful Olympic torch relay bringing the torch to thousands of Russian towns and cities and I was pleased to have an opportunity to host our customers and our bottling partners in Sochi last week where I saw our best ever activation of an Olympic asset. Our local team and bottlers are doing an excellent job in Sochi.","Our Pacific Group grew 3% in the full year cycling 7% in the prior year. We were pleased to see improving trends across key markets including India, China and Japan as the year progressed. ","For the full year our volume in Japan grew 1% with Sprite, Minute Maid and ISACA each growing by double digits. China contributed 3% volume growth for the full year cycling 4% in 2012 and grew 5% in the fourth quarter. We delivered balanced growth across sparkling and still beverages thanks to strong campaigns and a renewed focus on execution.","We\u2019re engaging teams and driving category excitement in China through campaigns like our Mini-Me Coca-Cola campaign which contributed to double digit immediate consumption growth in the fourth quarter and our popular Share a Coke campaign last summer. ","And India cycled 16% full year growth with a 4% volume increase in 2013 closing out the year with our 30th consecutive quarter of volume growth. It is remarkable to think of the business that we have built in India over the last two decades. In 2013 our system generated nearly $1.8 billion in revenue and we have four of the top five core sparkling brands, the number one juice drink brand, a commanding non-alcoholic ready to drink share and so much, so much fun tapped opportunities still ahead.","Turning now to Latin America, we grew 1% for the full year [cycling] 5% in the prior year. Argentina, Mexico and Brazil all come to mind as we consider what worked for us and what was challenging in 2013 in Latin America. We were pleased with our performance in Argentina where despite challenging economic conditions our brands performed well resulting in 7% volume growth for the full year. Sparkling was an important volume driver in Argentina with Coca-Cola\u2019s Sprite and Fanta each growing mid to high single digits. Cola-Cola Life met our expectations and is playing a meaningful role as it is not just delivering incremental volume, but also enhancing the positive feelings that consumers have for Coca-Cola.","We\u2019re excited about the potential of Coca-Cola Life as it has shown great promise in bringing people back into the category. It\u2019s another example of how we are working to be part of a solution to the obesity issue giving consumers a blend of sugar and natural zero calorie sweeteners. ","Returning to our business in Argentina our still brands grew double digits with strong performance in packaged water with the launch of the Bonaqua Ecoflex bottle as well as solid growth in juice and juice drinks and sports drinks.","In Mexico, volume growth was even for the year with still beverage volume growth offset by sparkling. Despite a solid start to 2013, we had a challenging second half of the year mostly due to severe weather. We continue to see opportunity in Mexico where our strong brands, world class execution and an improving economy bode well for the future. ","Our bottling partners have adjusted their pricing as a result of the newly implemented tax and we are closely monitoring any further adjustments as needed. While we expect the change to adversely impact our volume in Mexico in the short term, it is too early to tell what the exact impact will be at this time.","I will wrap up my commentary in Latin America with an update on our business in Brazil where consumers have been impacted by a slowing economy, rising prices and reduced disposable income. Full year volume was down 2% due to a disappointing 6% drop in the fourth quarter. Our local team working closely with our bottling partners has now launched an upgraded affordability strategy enhancing our [Asian] brand price pack and channel architecture. We are optimistic that this strategy together with our World Cup program will enable us to return to growth in Brazil in 2014.","Turning now to North America, we remain steadfast in our commitment to building long term value in our flagship market and a commitment that calls for building strong brands, trading customer value and enhancing our system capabilities. Sandy Douglas is leading our North American business where we will again benefit from a strong customer and strategic brand expertise. Adding Paul Mulligan and Irial Finan's disciplined focus on execution at the point of sale will enable us to refine these strategies and to enhance their impact. The combined experience and expertise of this leadership team and a joint accountability for driving value will ensure that we are laser focused on continued improvement of our overall performance in this important market. We will therefore continue to assess and to evaluate the operating results in North America as an integrated business.","In October of 2010, we established a four to five year timeframe to commence the refranchising of our bottling operations in North America. 2014 is the fourth year and as the North America operating model evolves, it will not only streamline our focus but if will also expedite refranchising to independent bottling partners. To date, we've closed on the first transaction of our 21st century beverage partnership model at the end of 2013 and we are very encouraged with the seamless transition of the territory.","Looking ahead, we are well aligned on the transition with the other four bottlers that we announced back in 2013. We expect to reach agreements with those partners shortly and for those transactions to begin closing later in the year that we\u2019re in. We will also eminently announce new bottling partnerships whose ownership reflects the diversity of the consumers and customers we proudly serve in North America.","We expect North America to deliver consistent volume, revenue and transaction growth with the balance volume and price mix that you would expect from an industry leader. We also firmly believe that the business will deliver consistent profitable growth over the long-term. 2013 was a challenging year in North America and I am not satisfied with our overall performance. Nevertheless we gained volume and value share while generating positive price mix of 1% across our portfolio and positive price mix of 2% for our sparkling brands. However, our volume was even versus prior year and operating income fell short of our targets.","Sparkling beverage volume fell 2%, largely due to softer diet coke volume. We have implemented a multi-faceted approach to address category headwinds and the various misperceptions that fuel them. This effort is targeting both obesity and ingredient concerns and increase aggressive sweetener innovation, transparent consumer communications, continued packaging evolution and new partnerships with credible third parties around the world who will use meaningful facts to defend and protect the sparkling category. ","While we work to nurture our sparkling business back to growth, our still beverage business continues to perform well. Still beverages grew 5% for the full year as our diverse portfolio of still beverage brands continues to outperform the competition.","Thanks to continuous innovation and to growing brands like Powerade, Simply, Gold Peak and Smartwater, the fourth quarter marks the 15th consecutive quarter in which our still beverage portfolio gained or maintained volume and value share in North America. ","As we approach the mid-point of our 2020 vision, we remain fully committed to taking the necessary bold actions to realize our vision. One such action is our recently announced global partnership with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters. This partnership is a real game changing innovation in the non-alcoholic beverage category. Consumers are demanding more beverage variety, functionality and convenience. And we believe Green Mountain is the perfect strategic partner to collaborate with and to capitalize on the many transformative opportunities we see available in the marketplace. Importantly for the Coca-Cola Company with this exciting partnership we\u2019re leveraging new technology to create a transformative platform for consumers to enjoy our great brands through new consumption occasions and new channels.","By combining Coca-Cola\u2019s brand leadership and global footprint with Green Mountain\u2019s cutting edge technology and innovation capabilities, together we will capitalize on the many exciting opportunities in the single serve pod-based segment of the cold beverage industry as well as explore other future opportunities to collaborate on the entire [current] platform. As evidenced by this recent announcement, our management team is constantly identifying and constantly evaluating creative ways to formulate and fuel the power of partnerships that keep us at the forefront of consumer trends, driving the dynamic global beverage industry.","We are fortunate to participate in a global and resilient industry fuelled by a robust long-term demographic trend. We are part of a great business system and unparalleled in its reach and its commitment to invest and we are the stewards of some of the world\u2019s most loved brand.","Thus there is no doubt that the lingering effects of the global recession in 2009 have created a challenging environment over the last two years. In addition obesity and ingredient concerns have raised some questions about growth in developed markets. Throughout this time period our Company has consistently delivered on our profit objectives and we will not allow ourselves to become distracted or to make decisions focused on short-term gains. Instead we have thoroughly evaluated what we need to do to accelerate sustainable growth and we\u2019re acting with urgency and decisiveness.","Historically we know that when we invest in our brands, commit to near flawless execution and control what we know we can control, we can accelerate our growth. With this in mind we aligned on five strategic priorities to restore our momentum and to keep us on the path to achieve our 2020 vision. These priorities focused on the growth drivers for our system, sparkling beverages, still beverages and global system execution. And on securing and strengthening the financial assuming capital necessary to deliver long-term sustainable growth. ","Our five strategic system priorities to restore momentum are; firstly, accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola; secondly, strategically expanding our profitable still portfolio; third, increasing media investments by maximizing productivity; fourth, winning at the point of sale by unlocking the power of our system; and five, investing in our next generation of [layers]. ","Let me just spend a few minutes providing some detail on each of these system priorities. First, we will accelerate sparkling growth led by Coca-Cola. There is quite simply no other brand in the world like Coca-Cola, the world\u2019s most universal beverage brand. We are fortunate to be its stewards. And indeed, in many markets around the world, brand Coca-Cola remains magical but we need to work even harder to enhance the romance of the brand in every market around the world. Our global marketing community is laser focused on doing their best work while reallocating resources to the most impactful campaigns and mediums. ","A good example of this great work is Share a Coke, which I have referenced several times in my remarks earlier. Since the initial launch of Share a Coke in Australia back in 2011, we've now executed the campaign in 21 other markets. There is -- this is much more than the marketing campaign. In fact, it\u2019s a system-wide collaborative effort to engage consumers in a meaningful and a very authentic Coca-Cola way. ","Markets that have launched Share a Coke have experienced increased household penetration, higher immediate consumption volume and improved brand love scores as a direct result of this campaign. This is the kind of marketing that we love to invest in and we look forward to again sharing a Coke with millions of consumers around the world this year. Same time we're working hard to empower our consumers and we're making progress against our four commitments to further contribute to healthier, happier and more active communities.","To that end we've placed a special emphasis on innovation efforts to enhance low or no calorie versions of our brand as well as on supporting active healthy living programs all around the world. ","Our second priority is to strategically expand our profitable still portfolio. We are the world\u2019s largest still beverage Company with $11 billion still brands and many more in the pipeline. We have shown in juices that when we approach an objective and a goal systematically aligning with our partners, planning from end-to-end, we win and we win big. Today, the Coca-Cola Company is also the world\u2019s largest juice and juice drinks company almost twice the size of our closest competitor. We are the stewards of $4 billion juice and juice drink brands and we are working diligently to raise that number. We're bringing the same disciplined thinking to other categories partnering across our system and across our supply chain to establish a scalable formula for value creation in new categories. This effort involves re-examining every stage of a beverage\u2019s lifecycle and developing category specific plans that balance organic growth, innovation and acquisition.","Our third system priority is to increase media investments by maximizing productivity. We are in a business where great marketing works. So, we have committed to increasing our media spending behind our brands by up to $1 billion by 2016. We will fund this increased investment through a combination of supply-chain optimization, system standardization, diligent resource and cost allocation as well as improved utilization of our global marketing network. This incremental productivity goal will further enable us to drive long-term profitable growth and momentum towards realizing our 2020 vision. Gary will share further details about this new opportunity in a few moments. ","Our fourth priority is to win at the point of sale by unlocking the power of our global system. Working together with our marketing partners, we are continuously building capabilities and leveraging best practices to improve our execution. In the last four years alone, our system has invested over $50 billion to enhance our competitive position in markets all around the world. As you know execution in the global marketplace is about doing many common things uncommonly well and doing them in an aligned way across our great system. It is about presenting our brands in the right package, in the right outlook, in the right channel, at the right price, cold available and within an arm\u2019s reach of our consumers. This is why we're calling 2014 the year of execution at the point of sale beginning with brand Coca-Cola. ","Our final, but perhaps most important priority is to continue to invest in our pipeline of leaders. There is nothing more critical to our business than our people and we have to continue to hire the best, retain the best, train the best, and manage with the best. Our Company and leadership must inspire our people to live our values of focusing on the market, working smart, acting like owners and being passionate ambassadors for our Company and for our brand.","As we look forward to 2014 and beyond, we remain very confident in our ability to drive our volume growth trajectory back in line with our long-term growth model. The overall beverage industry remains healthy generating both volume and value growth. Our diverse portfolio of $17 billion brands combined with our unparalleled scale provides us with many opportunities to accelerate market share gains. We have identified opportunities to significantly enhance our productivity initiatives and we made important commitments to increase our brand investment. Consequently, we are no less enthusiastic about the future ahead of us and the beverage industry then when we embark on our 2020 vision back four years ago.","With that, let me the turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Fayard","Thanks, Muhtar, and good morning everyone. As Muhtar shared earlier, 2013 presented numerous challenges to our industry and to our business and as a result, our full year volume growth was below our expectations. However, before we put 2013 behind us I wanted to reflect on a few items that I shared with you all at CAGNY last February. Specifically, I\u2019ve talked about how our unwavering focus on long-term value creation for our shareowners and apart from competing in a great industry, there were three specific points I emphasized.","First, we are focused on delivering value creating volume growth and despite volume growth being below our expectations in 2013 we delivered full year operating income and EPS growth in line with our long-term growth targets. ","Secondly, our goal is to take volume share and although we fell short on volume, we again gained global value share in non-alcoholic ready-to-bring beverages into 2013. ","Lastly, I emphasized the critical role that the evolution of our franchise system plays in creating sustainable long-term growth. Our Company and our system made solid progress on this front throughout 2013. ","We sold 51% of our Philippines bottling operations to Coca-Cola Thums Up. Our four bottling partners in the greater Tokyo area merged to form Coca-Cola East Japan. Our seven bottling partners in Spain and Portugal merged and the integration of that bottler is underway. We merged our company own bottling operations in Brazil with an independent local bottler to form the second largest bottler in Brazil. And we also continue to advance the system of the future work in North America. Having said that, let\u2019s quickly review a few key drivers of our financial performance this year.","Unit case sales and concentrate sales were in line on a consolidated basis in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our comparable currency neutral operating income was up 6% in the quarter and for the full year after excluding the impact of structural items. ","Comparable currency neutral earnings per share grew 7% in the quarter and 8% for the full year, and we generated $10.5 billion in cash from operations which was down 1% primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and increase in tax payments and the impact of deconsolidation of bottling operations in the Philippines and Brazil.","Now let me take the moment to update everyone on our productivity initiatives before I move to our outlook for 2014. First let me start by saying, we made significant progress on our previously announced productivity and reinvestment programs, in fact I\u2019m pleased to report that by the end of 2013 we have substantially accomplished the objectives of the program and captured the savings associated with those objectives. ","Secondly as Muhtar mentioned earlier, we\u2019re expanding our previously announced productivity and reinvestment program to drive an incremental $1 billion in productivity by 2016 that will be redirected primarily in to increased media investments.","Our incremental productivity goal consists of two relatively equal components. First, expanded savings through global supply chain optimization data and information technology system standardization and resource and cost reallocation which will be reinvested in global brand building initiatives with an emphasis on increased media spending and also will be increasing the effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer facing marketing investments to accelerate growth.","As we look ahead to 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few outlook items as you model our business. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling of prior year rates, we partly expect a currency headwind at the operating income of approximately 10 points in the first quarter of 2014 and seven points for the full year. ","In terms of coverage, we\u2019re fully hedged on the euro and the yen, almost totally covered on sterling and also have near term coverage in place across several other major currencies. ","We anticipate that operating leverage on a currency neutral basis will be flat to slightly positive. We expect net interest income will contribute roughly equivalent of penny per share to our full year 2014 earnings per share and will be evenly distributed throughout the year. We expect the tax rate for 2014 to hold steady at approximately 23%. ","With respect to structural items, we\u2019ll be still cycling the impact of some bottling divestitures during the first six months of 2014 and even though these structural items will not have a significant impact on earnings per share, they will result in a one point headwind at both net revenue and operating income for the full year. To be clear, our 2014 outlook for the impact of structural items does not include the potential impact of refranchising bottling assets in North America related to our system of the future work. We will continue to provide updates as we move forward throughout the year. ","As for cash, as I\u2019ve shared with you over the years, we utilize a very disciplined and consistent framework, first we reinvest in the business which includes making the necessary investments to strengthen our brands to accelerate growth. It also includes capital investments which we expect to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion this year. ","Second, we reward share owners by paying a healthy dividend, we\u2019ve increased our dividend every year for more than half a century and we will recommend another increase in the dividend this year at our Board meeting this week. ","Next, we evaluate opportunities to grow through acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures. We do these as enablers to help accelerate growth when appropriate and where there is a need within our existing portfolio. ","And finally we put what\u2019s left over into share repurchase, in 2014 we expect share repurchases to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Although our 2014 outlook for net share repurchase is below 2013, I would remind everyone that our 2013 buybacks represented a 15% increase from the prior year and was partially funded by cash inflows related to bottling divestitures. ","Also given the forecasted exchange headwinds in 2014, we believe this is the right approach and we\u2019ll obviously continue to update you as we move forward throughout the year. ","In terms of quarterly saving our first quarter in 2014 will have one less selling day and our fourth quarter will have one additional selling day. In addition we expect the impact of the Easter holiday to fully benefit the second quarter of 2014 and we\u2019ll be cycling the reversal of certain expenses related to long term compensation in the first and second quarters of 2014. ","In closing we continue to be focused on doing the right things for the health of our business and to ensure we can deliver sustainable long term growth to create value for our shareowners. I believe our Company and our system are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities within our great industry. I look forward to seeing many of you at CAGNY later this week and at CAGE in March. ","Operator, we\u2019re now ready for your -- for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is from Bill Schmidt from Deutsche Bank.","","Bill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank","","Hi, good morning, can you guys talk about, through the outlook geography by geography and then maybe how the pace of growth is going to differ between volume and pricing given some of the big currency moves and also obviously the tax in Mexico and I have a follow up if I could.","","Muhtar Kent","","Sure Bill, good morning, this is Muhtar. Let me just first just take a step back and just say that in a way we\u2019ve had a speed bump we know that would have come on our road to 2020. We dealt with commodities in 2011 and \u201912, volatility in weather has become a norm, uncertain economies, internal also execution issues caused us to underperform versus our expectations in 2013, I\u2019ll start with -- by saying that. ","We have looked at everything, we\u2019ve looked at our people, priorities, marketing, selling and innovation and we have refreshed our plans, and with a simple but scales offset of priorities on marketing our brands, system execution by our franchisees and bottling partners and Company owned bottlers and on innovation of all kinds, business models like the one that you -- we\u2019ve recently announced with Green Mountain, brands, equipment, packaging, the lot. ","Our long term outlook is our performance algorithm which we have and will deliver going forward and 2014 will be a year of steady improvement as we get back up to speed. But make no mistake, our leadership team is confident, accountable, our system will market well, we will sell well and we are going to achieve our 2020 vision.","Now let me just take you through a quick tour of the world, and I will ask Ahmet also to comment. ","Starting with Asia, I think China is going to sustain its growth. India, in terms of its macroeconomic outlook, and I think we will continue to benefit from that. In India I think there's election coming up and usually when there are elections, there\u2019s a little bit of easing of fiscal discipline, I think that will play into a little bit of added disposable incomes.","In South-East Asia certainly we've seen quite a lot of political turmoil especially in Thailand. I think that will, as we go into 2014, my expectation is that that will ease a little bit. Indonesia, also there\u2019s an election coming up, but I think Indonesia is certainly having some macroeconomic issues that will probably continue into 2014. And then Philippines, I think we'll see some slightly improved outlook in the Philippines versus 2013.","In Japan, I think obviously everyone is looking very closely at the new policies of the Prime Minister and his government. There\u2019s a new tax coming up, but we\u2019ll see how that impacts but certainly we all feel that are operating in Japan feel that there is some hope for a little bit of more inflation in the economy that will benefit also businesses like ours, although recently then last economic numbers from Japan were a little bit below expectations.","And in Africa, youngest continent, we\u2019re very well positioned and we feel that we will continue to grow well in the years to come in the African continent and benefit from also improvements in governance across the whole continent. ","And in Eurasia, there is elections coming up in Turkey. Lots of, again, political issues in the Middle East will continue. And Russia I think, all Russians can be very proud of the Olympics that are taking place. And I think that we will, as we move forward, as [our eyes are now] there in Russia looking at some of the great activations that we've had in our business. And I think Russia our business will continue to grow, in Russia with all the investments that we are making with our bottling partners.","Europe is a tale of -- continued tale of two cities. It\u2019s like a phase of seven zones, I think the high unemployment and low growth is going to continue but it\u2019s not going to get worse. As far as Northern Europe, Britain is certainly ahead of all the other economies in terms of the growth outlook. And I think Germany also is in that area. We will continue to benefit from the robustness of policies in those two economies and the rest of the continent is somewhat behind Germany and England.","And in Latin America, again, 2014 is going to be year leading into an election, in early 2015. We'll have also the benefit of the World Cup, and our biggest [February activation] globally on the World Cup. And Southern Cone, Argentina, Chile; we should continue to see the benefit of all the programs we have in place and also continued inflation environment in those two areas. And Mexico I think, President Pena Nieto\u2019s programs are taking effect over the reforms, both long-term I think that is a benefit to our business, to the economy, to the people of Mexico. And again as I said in my commentary, it's too early to say about the impact of the price increase we've had there. So I hope that that gives you a good tour of the world. ","And then finally in terms of our flagship market in the United States, clearly the best right now as far as we can see, the best western developed economy in the world we think we will see slightly improved mobility in the United States in 2014 versus 2013. And we hope that will also mean a little bit of increased spending for consumer products as we go into 2014. And again we will benefit from all the robustness in our marketing program and our increased expenditure and quality of marketing as we move into 2014 for our flagship market. ","Ahmet, you want to add some commentary?","Ahmet Bozer","Yes. I will add few things, I guess, to really compare some of these issues that have existed even last year, how they are different now? For example emerging market currencies; when the first news on discontinuation of [paper] came out last year around May or June; there was a bit of a shock in emerging markets. We see that over the last seven or eight months these emerging markets are sort of finding ways to deal with it, by no means it\u2019s certain, by no means it\u2019s perfect. But it certainly feels a little bit more under control compared to when it first came up and the interest rate and things like that have been baked into those expectations. So, I guess the message there is countries and our business we're finding ways to deal with that new reality of less liquidity coming out of United States.","I would just add Muhtar to your comment on Europe north south divide, that is very much true but we are sort of beginning to see sort of different shades of grey in the south as well. There are some encouraging signs in Spain, sort of less so in Italy at this point in time although there is a new Prime Minister there and we\u2019re hopeful with the new programs to be announced if they are. And the Eastern Europe, it continues to struggle in terms of consumer confidence and economic. So north continues to do well and south is even showing different performance now. ","The other point that Muhtar mentioned is political uncertainty, it's another common thing to many of our emerging markets. They eventually could impact the economic realities but again so far in countries like Turkey and Thailand it\u2019s been fine. And let me just in the interest of giving time to other questions, let me just stop it here.","Muhtar Kent","Sandy, do you want to add any commentary to North America. I think it\u2019s important to say in North America that we believe in the North American market, we believe in the demographics, we believe this is a growth market; we have grown in all but two quarters of the last 15 quarters in the United States. We believe we can do better and we\u2019re intent and thus we\u2019ll be focused on achieving that. Sandy?","Sandy Douglas","Yes. Thanks Muhtar. We have a great business in North America and our focus in accelerating the business is on our brands, on our customers and on our capability. And I\u2019m really happy to be working with Irial and Paul and our all of our U.S. bottlers. I think Irial and Paul bring a tremendous amount of selling and executional energy that will help us build on our momentum. ","On my end, over the last six to seven weeks, Paul and I have met with our major customers. We\u2019ve met with our bottlers and we\u2019ve gone through the brand plant in detail looking at opportunities to focus and strengthen them and to move resources to emphasize advertising and brand building on our largest brands. And I think with the plan in place our focus as a system Irial, Paul and I, and our bottlers is to improve all aspects of our execution, whether it\u2019s marketing or sales or in the marketplace. And we believe as a result of that that we will improve steadily over time and we share the confidence that Muhtar expressed in the long term health of North America. It\u2019s a great market. It will grow. And I think we can be confident about our long term future there.","Operator","And our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Just a follow up to Bill\u2019s question. I guess if we think about 2014 there is a lot of moving parts with exchange rates and some of the volatility in emerging markets. Maybe Gary could you talk a little bit about how we should think about currency neutral and also maybe sort of neutral of the effects of structural change? Are you still looking at a currency neutral sort of on-algorithm year in operating profits? And also just some of the other major drivers behind volume that might influence that cost of goods sold inflation, price mix, country mix that sort of thing? I think that would be helpful.","Gary Fayard","Yes. Bryan thanks and let me say back and go through all of those. So, let me start at the top, when you\u2019re the industry leader you have to believe in rational pricing and believe we should get pricing for our brands because our brands are worth it and we would expect to have positive price mix this year to go with the volume that we\u2019ll have this year. When you look at commodity, it\u2019s fairly benign from what we\u2019re saying for 2014 so not a big deal. But now the currency among the worst we\u2019ve seen in years and there is not a whole lot you can do about it when all the emerging market currencies kind of melt down as they did earlier at the end of December or early January.","But with that said, let me be very clear, ours is a growth business, is a business model that is built on growth and we know that we cannot save our way to prosperity. We will have productivity but that productivity will be reinvested for growth and while we are reinvesting for growth in our marketing, we have our goals are also in addition while we\u2019re increasing the marketing we will also have a goal and is a goal up for this year up hitting our long term growth model this year. So we\u2019re going to significantly increase our marketing but at the same time the goal is we will hit long term growth model this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Thanks, just one quick follow up to Gary\u2019s question and then a question for Muhtar or Gary\u2019s answer rather. Gary, does that include a Mexico impact in hitting your long-term algorithm in 2014? ","And then Muhtar, responding to Gary\u2019s question about ramping up the marketing, I guess how do we view, there is a sense out there in the market that given the headwinds for the category that adding more marketing could be sort of pushing on a string so to speak. So what is it that you are seeing that says these headwinds that you are facing can be offset with higher marketing? Thanks.","Gary Fayard","","John its Gary, thanks for the question. First as Muhtar said in the prepared remarks, it's too early to tell what\u2019s going to happen in Mexico. We have planned around Mexico of what we believe is the most likely day. But we have a portfolio of brands that are marketed and sold across 200 countries and our job is to manage that portfolio. So unless something unforeseen should happen, I think the answer has to be yes, it includes what could happen to Mexico, if that changes, we\u2019ll update you obviously, but we\u2019re going -- what we believe would happen today.","Muhtar Kent","","And just add to Gary\u2019s answer and to the second part of your question John, I\u2019ll just tell you very simply that the Coca-Cola way is to grow our way to success and we invest for growth together with our [bumping] partners and we have great -- the greatest system in the world and we have had tremendous amount of experience to say that a good marketing, good selling works for our business and it will work for our business. We have numerous cases to prove that and we\u2019re going to continue to build on our marketing in both quantity and quality. This is a global increase in marketing and in every country that we operate in large or small, we know it works and when we invest in marketing, our global partners invest and feed on the street, in more coolers in more trucks, and more line and that\u2019s what we see happening and that\u2019s what we will see we believe happening to our business as we restore steady momentum in through 2014 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","","Just a few questions, first, just the North America Gary, the profitability decline in fourth quarter was pretty surprising. So maybe you could give us a little bit of color in terms of the components of the profits decline in North America. ","And just broadly in North America from a profitability perspective, the business hasn\u2019t really grown since the acquisition of the bottler. So as you think about the next couple of years, thinking about the refranchising opportunities and all the productivity savings, are we at a point where we can actually see growth in this business from a profitability perspective in 2014? Or is this more of a transition year or so with the investment that\u2019s going on?","Gary Fayard","Judy its Gary, let me take the first part of that question. On the fourth quarter profit -- operating profit decline, it was down 12% I think in the fourth quarter. And by the way I know the answer to this one specifically, because I asked the same question some time back, and got into my new detail on it. And 100% of that change is because of -- it's an all in OpEx or primarily all in OpEx and it\u2019s what we\u2019re cycling from 2012, there were some incentive compensation, accrual reversals in the fourth quarter of 2012 that did not happen in 2013 and that cycling caused a significant change in OpEx swing year-on-year in the fourth quarter only and it\u2019s what swung North America to that 12% operating income loss.","So I think it\u2019s much more reasonable to actually look at North America, look at it for the full year and you will get a better picture of actual performance versus the fourth quarter. When you look at the full year then you will see -- that is where we\u2019ve got some challenges as Muhtar said around volume and particularly in sparkling around diets and lights but that\u2019s what we are specifically on.","Muhtar Kent","Just let me add to in terms of the outlook and that is that as I said we are confident about and excited about first our performance algorithm worldwide but also in terms of steady improvement as we get back up to speed in the United States. And I think that that will -- when we start restoring the momentum in the United States which we believe is going to happen, well that will also bring the results in the -- financial results that we will be happier with as we move into 2014 and beyond. It\u2019s going to take a while, this is not a fix -- an immediate fix but we know that it\u2019s going to be a steady improvement.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","And just in terms of the media investments, is there any color you can give us in terms of the breakdown by regions, by categories, is North America likely to get the proportionate amount in terms of the media spending increase in 2014?","Muhtar Kent","","Can\u2019t give you the specifics on the geographic mix Judy, but as we announced it\u2019s about $1 billion by 2016 and it is a global number. And again there will be a good distribution and we will be again also looking and tracking through franchise leadership, resulting also system increase and investments in all the key markets.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","","Hi, I also wanted to touch on profit in North America. It sounds like in 2013, you view the profit challenges as more driven from a volume perspective but given the diet soft drink where you seem to be more secular around longer term health concerns, I am just wondering if going forward you may manage more for profitability and lean more on pricing than driving volume growth. Is there any change as you look at the algorithm between pricing and volume and which metric you will focus on going forward?","Muhtar Kent","","Thanks, Dara. Sandy you want to take it and then [indiscernible] if you want to comment.","Sandy Douglas","","Yes, I think the key to the North America growth algorithm is investing in our brands and our feet on the street and a key element to that is getting our pricing, so that we can have the revenue to be able to reinvest in sustainable growth. Where we had issues over the years in my experience in North America is when we did not get the price we needed, when our marketing execution was not what it needed to be and therefore the feet on the street started to get reduced and ultimately it hurt sustainable growth. ","Our plan going forward and it\u2019s going to take some time and we're focused on improving it, is to make sure that we get the price and that we execute the marketing well and feed the feet on the street which creates the virtuous cycle in the United States just like it does around the world. [Gary] do you want to add to that?","Unidentified Company Representative","I guess the only comment I would say, Muhtar already mentioned that we are an industry leader and industry leaders have to set the tone in terms of price, in terms of how to market their brands in any given market. And actually 50 days, in less than 50 days into my new involvement in North America, I am really excited about the future. I am excited about the enthusiasm, the passion of our people. Our job, mine, Paul\u2019s, Sandy\u2019s is really is to make sure that excitement translates into performance and into results. And as Sandy said, it\u2019s not going to happen overnight but I feel we've already started on the journey and over the next quarters, the next couple of years, you will see very positive momentum in our market in North America.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","","And then move to our post the investment in Green Mountain, I was just hoping to get an update on how important a role acquisitions might play in meeting your 2020 vision goals? You mentioned the focus on partnerships earlier in the call, I was hoping you could elaborate there and if acquisitions are greater priority here given some of the difficult macro-conditions and somewhat favourable environment with your healthy balance sheet and still lower rate here.","Muhtar Kent","","Look, nothing different than before, so no change. I think we're obviously very excited with the new opportunities for consumption as will be brought to us by the partnership with Green Mountain over time. I think the key is to feel the power of partnerships. The Coca-Cola Company and System is an incredible integration of power of partnerships in every respect and therefore this is yet another one. And so think about if you look at household consumptions in particularly, Western markets, there is a tremendous opportunity to gain incremental consumption occasions for our brand through these kind of partnerships and this is what the Green Mountain partnership is all about. ","When you look at how beverages are consumed at home and when you look at trends in the next 10 years, people are going to spend more time at home. They are going to work more from home. Home is going to be an even more important place for people for consumers and I think we need to present there with different technologies, different packaging, different ways to serve our brands and that\u2019s why this is important and partnerships like these are going to be important for us over time going forward.","And so, our thinking has not really evolved or changed in terms of bolt-on acquisitions, if we see opportunities, we will get them like InneSense like [Ocean] and so forth. And we will continue to seek new power of partnerships, to leverage new power of partnerships also going into the remaining part of our 2020 vision for the next six years.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","","So I guess the frustration I am hearing from many investors and a lot of questions on this call, is that there is a feeling that the Company isn\u2019t doing enough to change itself despite that the world around it has really changed and many like us we secularly, to sort of continued emphasis on the Coca-Cola way in history which is respectable in volumes, market shares, and even more marketing blaming short-term externalities but it\u2019s been a little while now that we\u2019ve seen tougher volumes, North America will profit continue to shrink, there is only $1 billion cost savings when some competitors are doing more from a pro rata basis. There is limited movement on refranchising and help innovation so far. So I guess might the company ever believe that it needs to focus on new levers of shareholder value creation like pricing up even more lower promotions, massive cost cutting, big portfolio innovation change and indeed returning more cash to shareholders. So, I know there\u2019s lots there but should investors expect bigger bolder change that pay out to meet this truly different world and so what specifically should we be looking for to just kind of sharing your confidence about the story or should we just expect kind of same status quo going forward?","Muhtar Kent","First, Ali I disagree with you. I think we have a great portfolio brand, we have a great system, the best consumer product system in the world and I believe that our programs will work and had worked. We have significantly outperformed and grown since 2012 and yes we\u2019ve had speed bump and certainly that makes us even more focused and more resolute to continue on our road to 2020. And I think that we have -- I will share at CAGNY on Friday the real reasons why we believe in our future and so that\u2019s all I would say.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","But I don\u2019t disagree with you about the strength of the brands at all actually, Muhtar. And I don\u2019t disagree with you about the strength of the system. I\u2019m just looking the results and I\u2019m trying to figure out whether enough is changing, enough is different and whether you guys do actually view the world is different enough and [indiscernible] but I actually don\u2019t disagree with you.","Muhtar Kent","I understand and I understand it\u2019s easy for people to have very short memories but we have the experience and we know what we are doing and we will continue to do what we believe and we are focused and we will execute the best and we will achieve our 2020 vision, that\u2019s what this is all about. So that\u2019s what I would say and we have talked about pricing, you\u2019ve heard all colleagues also talked about pricing and I think we don\u2019t want to repeat ourselves.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you Gary, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Jackson, we\u2019ve delivered sound full year financial results. We\u2019re implementing the strategic actions that will enable us to restore momentum in 2014 and we see many reasons to believe that we can accelerate our growth over time, achieve our long-term growth model targets and realize our 2020 vision. Our global beverage industry is healthy, the trends that have historically fuelled this, continue to be strong and our global systems commitment and reach are unparalleled.","This commitment has never wavered and the strategic decision that we have made over recent years have not only enabled us to deliver solid financial results that also advanced our competitive position, enhanced our capabilities and strengthened our result as a global system to achieve our 2020 vision.

Mr. Leveridge, you may begin.","Tim Leveridge ","Good morning and thank you for being with us today. I\u2019m joined by Muhtar Kent, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Kathy Waller, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that you can find Webcast materials in the Investor section of our company Web site at www.coca-colacompany.com that support the prepared remarks by Muhtar and Kathy this morning.

Ahmet Bozer, Executive Vice President and President of Coca-Cola International; Sandy Douglas, Senior Vice President, President of Coca-Cola North America; and Irial Finan, Executive Vice President and President of Bottling Investments will also be available for our Q&A session. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Muhtar.","Muhtar Kent ","Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. During our last Earnings call we articulated 5 strategic actions to reignite our growth and committed to providing you an update on our progress as we move forward and into 2015. So today, I'm going to start with some highlights from our fourth quarter performance and then review the progress we've made against our 5 strategic actions.","For those of you following our Web cast, you can see our quarterly performance on our new scorecard on Slide 4. Overall, our performance came in slightly ahead of where we had previously expected. This was driven by some net positives above the operating income line slightly offset by higher than expected returns to remeasurement impacting profit before tax. As the top line structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 4% in the quarter driven by a balance between volume and underlying price mix in what was a challenging macro environment. ","At the profit level, structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral operating income grew 7% in the quarter, while we continue to invest heavily behind our media with double digit increases in the quarter and full year. Importantly, there are some highlights for the quarter. We continue to focus pricing and revenue realization in key developed markets with North America and Europe both delivering positive price mix in the quarter and for the full year. Our core strategies and our diversified global portfolio enables us to gain global value share in non-alcoholic ready to drink Sparkling beverages as well as Still beverages in the quarter.","This is a key metric for us particularly in a challenging macro environment. As we announced last week, we also continue to strengthen our overall portfolio\u2019s billion dollar brand and in particular our Still brands. Gold Peak, a premium tea brand in the United States benefited from great marketing, strong media and stepped up execution to achieve this status. Furthermore FUZE TEA, our popular mainstream tea brand now available in nearly 40 markets around the world reached this status in less than three years demonstrating the strength of our systems marketing and executional capabilities. And finally, LOHAS our innovative water brand in Japan regained billion dollar brand status in 2014. This brings our total number of billion dollar brands to 20 out of which 14 are Still brands. Just five years ago we had 14 billion dollar brands. Since 2010 on average we\u2019ve added more than one new billion dollar brand each year to the list. ","Stepping back from our quarterly performance I would like to talk about the bigger picture in 2014 a year of significant change for our company that will continue in 2015. Specifically I want to discuss our five strategic actions to reignite our which are first; targeting disciplined brand and growth investment, Second; driving revenue and profit growth with clear portfolio roles across our market, Thirdly; refocusing on our core business model, Fourth; driving efficiency through more aggressive productivity and fifth -- last but not least streamline and simplify our organization. ","While we're making solid progress we have more to do. In 2014 we invest significantly in both our brands and in incremental growth opportunities. We substantially increased our media investment in markets and categories where our media was underfunded relative to the market opportunity, where we had the right price tag, channel architectures and where we had clear executional alignment with our bottlers. The quality of our media has been increasing and we intend to improve it even further under the leadership of our new global Chief Marketing Officer Marcos de Quinto. ","We're seeing initial success as exemplified by North America where our incremental media investments coupled with our segmented price tag strategies drove revenue growth in our Sparkling portfolio through strong 4% price mix in the second half of the year. This gives us confidence that when we invest in our brands, align on our system plans and focus on execution we do see positive results. ","And looking beyond our existing portfolio we continue to focus on expanding our participation across a range of consumption [occasions]. Today the average household globally consumes 26 beverages per day and of these 26 beverages only 1.4 are Coca-Cola company brand. Our opportunity to capture more beverage [occasions] is just immense. And for that reason we've announced strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and Monster Beverage Corporation both of these investments underscore not only our ability to adapt to changing consumer trend but also our commitment to accelerate innovation. ","Next we expanded our market segmentation recognizing that each of our markets has a specific role in order to sustainable revenue growth. Some markets focus on price realization, others on volume and the remainder on the balance of the two. Importantly our proxy statement will be coming out in the coming weeks and you will see the revised intensive metrics which will add revenue growth directly aligned to those market roles. ","We also made headways in refranchising our bottling operations both in the United States and internationally. In North America we closed several refranchising transactions in 2014 and laid out a clear path and timeline to refranchise the remaining territories. Specifically, we refranchised territories representing approximately 5% of the U.S bottler-delivered business in 2014 and have already signed definitive agreements to continue refranchising a similar amount in the first half of 2015. ","These agreements along with our ongoing work give us confidence that we will continue to accelerate our rate of refranchising each year and achieve our goal to retain a maximum of about one-third of the U.S bottler-delivered business by the end of 2017. And it is our intent to refranchise the remaining territories by 2020 at the latest. As we reached the end phase in North America these actions will drive higher operating margins, lower capital spending and invested capital and improve the ROIC for our company. ","Outside of North America we announced two transformative changes to our bottling landscape in critical high growth markets around the world. First in Indonesia we announced a joint venture in Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia that will help our system to capture the long-term opportunity in this extremely attractive emerging market. We also entered into an agreement to re-architect our African bottling system with the creation of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa which will serve 12 Southern and East African countries and will be a top ten global bottler once the transaction is completed. ","Importantly, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have the scale, resources and efficiencies to fund the investment required to capture the strong long term growth potential in Africa. These markets will be long term growth engines for our company so it is absolutely critical that we invest sufficiently today to prime those engines for decade to come. In order to reinvest our business and deliver against our long term financial targets we embarked upon an expanded productivity plan that will result in a total $3 billion in annualized savings by 2019.","As Kathy discuss in detail during our modeling call in December this represents the significant reduction to our investable spend base and our efforts are on track. As you\u2019ve seen in the press we've began work on reducing positions that are no longer aligned to our growth priorities or are deemed redundant as we streamline our operation. While this is never an easy process, it is absolutely essential to ensuring that our business is wired for greatest speed, responsiveness as well as innovation. And importantly, it also frees up the resources we need to reinvesting in the business to accelerate our growth.","Fifth and finally towards the end of 2014 we begin the process of streamlining and simplifying our operating model. We announced the streamlining of group functional layer and began standardizing the key processes across our business units. This will not only reduce our cost structure but more importantly will create a more nimble organization that is wired to act swiftly and rapidly in today's dynamic landscape.","In summary, I am confident that these strategic actions are laying the grand work for accelerated top and bottom line growth in the future and delivering the long term shareowner value you expect. Looking ahead we will continue to make progress against our actions to regain momentum. But as we\u2019ve said before 2015 will be a transition year for the company as we implement our new operating model and our incremental media investments in both 2014 and 2015 taking time to pay off in full. Further we expect the global consumer environment to remain volatile, geo-political hotspots around the world and potential deflation environment in Europe and continued softness in many emerging and developing markets around the could to be partially offset by an improving environment in the United States. ","So against this back drop what remains to be seen is how quickly and to what extent lower oil prices trickle down to impact consumer discretionary spending in both importing as well as oil exporting nations. Therefore we will focus on what we can control; we will implement our strategies with focus and conviction, investing for the long term in emerging market as well as taking advantage of opportunities to solidify our position in the growth market of today and tomorrow. While in 2015 we expect to grow comparable currency neutral EPS mid-single digit, from 2016 on we intend to be back to delivering again a long term target of high single digit comparable currency neutral EPS growth.","We will strengthen our leading brands through incremental media investments and best in class marketing campaign. We will deliver a [net] change in productivity and complete the majority of North America franchising both of which will drive growth and improve our margin structure. And finally we will continue to enhance our marketing leading capabilities to provide our customers and consumer with the innovative and refreshing product they expect from the Coca-Cola Company. ","I will now hand the call to our Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller who will provide you with a more detailed look at our financial performance as well as the outlook on our business for 2015.","Kathy Waller","Thank you Muhtar and good morning everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter was slightly ahead of our expectations due primarily to three factors. First, several markets around the world delivered slightly better top line performance thanks to a strong finish during the holiday season. Second, gross margin came in slightly better than anticipated and third, operating expenses were lower than expected which led to comparable currency neutral margin expansion. We are pleased with where the quarter landed. Structurally adjusted comparable currency neutral revenue growth was driven by 3% growth in concentrate shipment and 2% underlying price mix. Concentrate shipment outpaced unit cases in the quarter driven by an extra selling days. However for the full year concentrate shipment were in line with unit cases. Consolidated price mix in the quarter was driven by pricing initiatives in North America, Latin America and Europe.","Importantly as we've done throughout 2014 we continue to invest the behind our brand. During the quarter our marketing expenditures grew high single digit resulting in mid-single digit growth for the year. This increase in annual marketing expenditures was driven by a double digit increase in media investment as we continue to drive efficiencies within our overall marketing budget to put against our media spend. Our fourth quarter comparable EPS was $0.44 which included a 10 point currency headwind. On a comparable currency neutral basis our EPS grew 5% in both the quarter and the full year. Items impacting comparability in the quarter were primarily related to the impact of changing the exchange rate used to measure our Venezuela subsidiaries, net monetary assets into U.S. dollars, a write down on the competent sales receivable from our bottling partner in Venezuela, non-cash charges related to refranchising certain territories in North America and cost associated with our previously announced $3 billion productivity program.","Given increased uncertainty and lack of liquidity in Venezuela, we remeasured our bolivar-denominated net monetary assets at the end of the quarter using the SICAD II exchange rate. We are also using the SICAD II exchange rate to translate our Venezuelan subsidiaries local currency income statement into U.S. dollars beginning in January 2015. The receivable write down was recorded as a result of revised assessment of the U.S. dollar value we expect to receive. Despite a difficult operating environment in Venezuela, the Coca-Cola system remains committed to the market and will continue producing and selling our products that Venezuelan consumers enjoy on a daily basis.","As you saw on our scorecard, full year free cash flow with $8.2 billion, up 3% primarily due to the efficient management of working capital and cycling incremental pension contributions last year, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations","and the deconsolidation of the Company\u2019s Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013.","For the year, cash returned on invested capital declined 32 basis points due to the $1.5 billion investment we made in Keurig Green Mountain. As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in many markets around the world. Despite this, we're on track with the access we laid out during our last earnings call and we remain confident in the outlook we provided in December. Therefore we expect our comparable currency neutral EPS growth in 2015 to be mid-single digit, roughly in line with our growth rate in 2014.","As you\u2019ll recall from the modeling call in December, there are many puts and takes to our P&L in 2015 with the exception of currency these are not changed. Therefore I'm not going into detail on this call, but you can see the various line items on Slide 13. After considering our hedge positions, current spot rate and the cycling of our prior-year rates, we now expect an approximate five-point currency headwind on net revenues with a seven to eight-point headwind on profit before tax for the full year 2015.","This is a stronger headwind than the previously communicated five to six-point for profit before tax due primarily to the effect from translating our bolivar-denominated profit at the SICAD II rate and to a recent decline in several emerging market currencies which we do not hedge. In terms of coverage, we're fully hedged on the Euro, Yen and Sterling for 2015. We also have near term coverage in place across several other major currencies. There are a couple of phasing items you should consider when modeling the first quarter. Due to our fiscal calendar, there are six additional days in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014.","Although that will benefit revenue, variable cost such as marketing, sales and distribution expenses will also occur to a much greater degree in the first quarter. We expect the Venezuelan pricing provision will continue to negatively impact our net revenue and operating income in the first quarter of 2015 as we began to recognize the impact in the second quarter of last year. And we expect structural items primarily related to North America to be a headwind in the first quarter. Taken together, we expect structural adjustment and the Venezuelan pricing provision to be an approximate two-point headwind on net revenues and an approximate three-point headwind on a profit before tax.","In addition, we will cycle the timing of expenses in the first quarter of last year when we had four-points of operating leverage. Therefore we expect the comparable currency neutral operating leverage will be negative in the first quarter. Finally, we currently expect currency will be an approximate six-point headwind on net revenues and an approximate eight-point headwind on profit before tax in the first quarter as we cycle more favorable rates from the prior year. We currently anticipate closing the transaction with Monster Beverage Corporation at the beginning of the second quarter, note that there is a slightly later than our initial expectations of the first quarter due to various closing considerations. At this stage we do not anticipate any material changes to our structural impact guidance from December and of course we will update you along the way if there were to be a change.","In closing we're confident in our strategies and in the actions we've already taken to regain our momentum. 2015 will be a transition year as we implement significant change in our company and continue to reinvest in our business. We absolutely believe that the Coca-Cola Company is best positioned to capture growth in the non-alcoholic beverages and to continue to deliver long term value to our shareholders.","Operator, we're now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone. I've got a question about -- Muhtar, in your prepared remarks you mentioned the consumer environment remain volatile in terms of your expectations for '15. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what type, what range of volatility you might have embedded in your sort of plan for '15, maybe talk a little bit more specifically about the consumer environment both in Europe and Latin America where those are really two important markets for the company and where it seems volatile and then finally just maybe how that might affect your decision to spend more vagaries in those markets this year given the volatility -- I know there is a lot there but? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","Sure. Thanks, Brian. First just at a very high level 10,000 feet, 2015 I think we expect the macro environment to even become a little more volatile versus 2013 and 2014. As the micro economic vagaries get worse in certain parts of the world, so rate of interest, currency certainly will add to volatility, growth gaps will in some parts are going to -- versus other parts are going to grow. Take for example the United States and Great Britain two large western economies starting the year of 2015 strong whereas the Euro zone, Japan and most of the emerging worlds starting the year slower. So there is this kind of gap and some catching up to do. ","We're gaining share across the world in Sparkling juices, important categories. The industry -- we see some evidence that there are some things that are working for us but we need to be cautious and take it quarter-by-quarter I think that\u2019s really is important, then as far as Latin America is concerned I think Columbia seems to do continue to do really well as an economy and I think there is some more lifting to do in Mexico and Brazil and South zone. I was recently in Latin America and our business there continues to -- we have fantastic group of bottling partners investing for the short and long-term growth and we continue to gain share, we have a fantastic -- very strong packaged product channel segmentation and architecture and pricing, competitive, but at the same time great revenue growth, management strategies working there. ","And so Europe as towards the last quarter, quarter four which we're just reporting on the Southern European countries continue to be challenged. Germany, our business was very much in the positive, Northern Europe had a better environment for us -- was a better environment for us than the South and Eastern Europe is again challenged by some of the macro volatility that spills over across from the East. So I think that how will see. ","And then Asia I think we're still very bullish and Africa and you see the actions we have taken related to the reorganizing our bottling structure to even better suit the growth potential and opportunities there in both Indonesia, the fourth most top of the nation in the world as well as the very dynamic one plus billion consumers in Africa. ","Bryan Spillane ","And just -- fair to say that you\u2019ve got a sort of wider range of volatility or contingencies for that type of volatility built into the 2015 plan to -- maybe they\u2019re normal, just in such a volatile environment?","Muhtar Kent ","Yes and I think when you look at LRP or non-alcoholic ready to drink beverages, Brian I think what you would see probably is maybe a hundred basis points less growth versus the sort of previous years. It's again anybody's guess as to how quickly some of those economies are going to come back. So that we have definitely all those contingencies built in and maybe I can refer to Ahmet to give you a few more sort of snapshots of the world in terms of micro and macro picture. Ahmet?","Ahmet Bozer","Thanks, Muhtar. Brian, the only thing I would add to Muhtar's calculation is that volatility sort of comes on top of sort of slowdown. But what's working for us is that we're getting more and more traction on our plans and programs working with our bottlers. I was in about four, five different countries over the last couple of weeks and even though we witness economic volatility or uncertainty even in Northern Europe, yes there is quantitative easing, yes there is lower oil prices but it is uncertain yet whether the consumer will really benefit from that. But even within that our plans that address the right pricing and packaging and the right level of media investment and our alignment with our bottling system is giving us confidence that we could actually weather this volatility in line with the guidance that has been provided. ","So couple of bright spots too, I was in India probably one country where there is a lot of optimism inside the country in terms of economic development. And as you know we have an incredible momentum in India over the last seven or eight years especially last year. And our plans continue to build on each other from year to year, so that's pretty. I was in Brazil, again a similar story. After the elections there was come cautious optimism and that sort of caution side of that continues there is still a bit of optimism. But we do continue to deliver our results despite that environment as you know Brazil had a mid-single digit growth at the end of the quarter. Yes, it was cycling better numbers from last year. But we've also had very strong share gains in Brazil. So I would say that is our story, there is volatility on top of a slowdown but we do have traction with our plans and programs in the marketplace with close alignment with our bottlers.","Muhtar Kent ","Bryan one last thing I want to add to what Ahmet said and what I had said earlier to your question about doesn\u2019t make sense to invest in media and marketing. And the answer is absolutely yes, when we are able to target our investments in media and the way we're doing it, segmenting them by the different countries and the different regions of the world and improving not just the quantity but also the quality of the media that\u2019s what one of the main important factors that we see driving a better revenue number -- a better price mix number. So the two are really connected and that\u2019s what I really want to -- so gain in share improving on the top line through all the actions we're taking of which targeted media increased an improved quality media is one of those.","Bryan Spillane","Alright thank you for that look forward seeing you next down at Cagney.","Operator","Our next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong ","So I guess my question is really relating to the strong price mix that you saw in North America in the quarter. Obviously you've been focused on getting mix impact and rational pricing can you just speak to how much of the improvement was mix driven as opposed to maybe cycling some of the height and promotional environment last year. And as you think about 2015 and beyond just thinking about some of the mix acceleration potential on the pricing spot in North America.","Muhtar Kent ","I'll let Irial answer that question and then also Sandy will add labor to that too.","Irial Finan","I think the most important things are 12 quarters ago Sandy and I spoke on this topic and we iterated our belief in having balanced price mix volume growth in North America. And we delivered another epic quarter this year and our plan is to deliver again next year in the same way. But in terms of your question on mix and headline price it's a balanced approach. Yes in the fourth quarter last year we were trending some lower numbers when we had some heavy promotional activity, but when you look over the half year as Muhtar said we grew pricing 4%. So we feel very good about the actions we\u2019re taking, we're feeling very good about how the trade is reacting and more importantly we're feeling very good that our marketing and our execution are coming together in a way that really adds incremental value to our system. But I'll ask Sandy to add to that.","Sandy Douglas","As Irial said it's a consistent strategy and the strategy is born of where the consumer wanted to go. The consumer is buying smaller special packages of our Sparkling beverage brand and accelerating that purchase and we're seeing the kind of mix benefit from that that you described. But that\u2019s coupled with the disciplined approach to rate and volume. Because in the end what we're trying to do is expand the values and usefulness of our brand and create value for our customers and through the consistent execution of that strategy we're seeing in 2014 solid year, but a year of improving performance through the year and we'll continue to pursue that disciplined strategy in 2015. ","Judy Hong ","Got it okay and Kathy if can just have a quick follow up on just in terms of the commodities in 2015, what have you locked in, in terms of your exposure there. And as you think about different commodity complexes that are turning more favorable. How much of that could we expect to see drive some of that margin improvement, particularly markets like North America?","Kathy Waller","The commodities environment for 2015, commodities we expect really to be benign for -- there are some that are absolutely favorable. But then we have other challenges and depending on the amount in North America, but of that in North America we also have impact of secondary exchange embedded into our commodity. So we really anticipated being more of a benign commodity environment for us versus they have any significant impact or benefits from it.","Operator","Our next question is from John Faucher from JPMC.","John Faucher","Wanted to follow a little bit on Muhtar on your comment on Europe and obviously it's been a difficult market over the past couple of years. What's the right way to think about sort of glide pass getting back to growth there? Is it something where QE works and we start to see the economy come back, you think you can get back to consistent growth and what are some realistic sort of ranges of expectations for 2015 and potentially into 2016? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","Yes well I think we're all going to watch what's happening with the quantities easing, John, in Europe 18 months of the planned amount 60 billion and month of Euros coming kicking in whether that will have an impact or not we will watch and see. I think stability is the key word for Europe as we go into 2015.","So, not getting much worst and I think in some areas continued volatility and South Europe is going to continue to be, certainly to be a challenge. So, I don't think there is going to be suddenly a lifting of the cloud for the consumers in the Southern belt of Europe, I think Germany is the very low, -- current exchange rate I think will help exporting countries for sure, how soon will that trickle in related to Germany, related to other export markets from Europe. But that's a positive; the quantitative easing is a positive. ","The notion that most consumers now are used to this environment and feel that it's not going to get much worse, it may get a little better because of the [indiscernible], so we\u2019ll have to see but we think that it will continue to be challenged and then you've got of course the whole political environment to sort of basically weave into the equation, that political environment is something that is an unknown for us all. I think that's how I would see, as far as growth, yes, there will be pockets of growth in Europe and there will be continued pockets of challenges but I think what we see was our -- we've very strong plans in place with our bottling partners for growth in Europe and we'll see how -- we've all kinds of contingencies built into the plan in Europe also and we're going to take it quarter-by-quarter.","John Faucher","Great, thanks and if I can ask one follow up to Kathy. Kathy, you talked about your FX coverage on translational for '15, obviously what this can lead to sometime is sort of year two impact, any thoughts on 2016 and how you\u2019ll manage what could potentially be some FX headwind there as the hedges roll-off? Thanks.","Kathy Waller","Yes, so John, for 2016 we are also hedged on our major currencies and at this point also have some on other currencies as well. So, we'll manage the impact and we're at pretty good rates at this point with that hedging. So, basically we don't think that there is a relative issue at this point.","Operator","Thank you, our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS.","Steve Powers ","Hey, thanks, good morning. I guess one quicker clarification question and a slightly more thematic one. First, obviously there are lot of moving parts driving pricing mix in the quarter globally, and I was wondering if you could just focus in on rate increases and talk about trend there because my guess is that rate lagged overall price mix in North America which you talked about but Europe, the volume [best] looks like in Latin America and then rate was probably stronger than price mix and Eurasia, Africa, Pacific and across the whole company, so any help there would be great just parsing our overall rate trend. And then more broadly, it sounds like your productivity targets remain unchanged from last fall, which isn't really surprising as it's only been a few months, but at the same time we've already seen announcements of headcount reductions that likely we're not envisioned prior to your October update. So I\u2019m wondering, why we're not seeing more incrementality sooner on that front or perhaps we are, it\u2019s just being absorbed by the macro headwinds, so if you can clarify that, that would be great.","Muhtar Kent","Steve, this is Muhtar, good morning again. As far as the rate versus mix I think it's basically completely depended on the country and the environment and the region. So there is no trend globally, this is on average, this much rate and this much -- it all depends on price tag channel architecture, our position in the market, the strength of our brand, how effective is our marketing driving the result that we need, which is all work in progress. So, I think it all depends on -- and I'll let Sandy comment on the United States, on that but it's very much dependent on the region and depended on the country and depended on the circumstances.","I think that's really what I would say and then Sandy, you want to just address the United States part of that question?","Sandy Douglas","Sure, I mean our strategy in the U.S. is again as Irial sad very consistent. We view there to be a significant upside pricing opportunity in the Sparkling beverage category. We are driving that with significant investments in brand building and execution of price package architecture that will expand margins for our system and also for our customers and that involves a very healthy rate program but at the same time, we're executing with tremendous amount of energy, multiple proprietary and other small packages that the consumer is buying at accelerating rates, I mean for example mini Cans increased by 15% in the fourth quarter and that's following the consumer to smaller packaged sizes of the brands they love and that combination of rate and mix is creating a good balance with volume to healthy top-line growth picture. ","Muhtar Kent","And see just on your question on why -- what on productivity, I would say to you that they reorg and how we're flattening the organization and the number of -- and announced cuts were all part of the program -- totally part of the program. So there is nothing that just being executed and that's all. And as Kathy -- we standby what Kathy said in the modeling call in December we're on track with the 500 plus million dollars piece of the productivity program for 2015 and we're on track with that. So but just to emphasize all of what you see, what you hear, what you read was part of the program. ","Steve Powers ","Okay. So just two points of clarification just a follow-up on those answers, thank you very much. On the price mix I guess maybe just Kathy -- specifically to Eurasia, Africa where I am assuming great pricing in Russia for example is quite positive should we be expecting this negative mix trend to persist in '15, this is one pop on pricing. And then Muhtar to your point on the part of the plan, does that mean the headcount reductions for example that were announced, was that part of the original $1 billion or is that part of the additional $2 billion that was announced last call? Thanks. ","Muhtar Kent","Just quickly on the last piece of your question, it was part of the additional 2 billion and then as far as the rate increases I will defer it to Ahmet, if you want to just refer to that part of the question. ","Ahmet Bozer","On the markets like EAG we price in line with inflation, we may be slightly below inflation, slightly ahead at times, so you should expect to see consistent rate increase more or less in that range. Fourth quarter for EAG was a bit of an anomaly, there was a sort of geographic mix impact that was driven by cycling of Galland shipment. So if you look at full year price mix realization of EAG, it\u2019s a healthy 4 points. So I wouldn't look at Q4 to draw any conclusion. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. ","Ali Dibadj","So, given the pressure that currency is placing and kind of all this macro volatility. Do you anticipate or can you actually accelerate anything around your cost cutting plans to offset this or do you plan taking even more pricing in places like Europe, Eurasia, Africa, or Asia-Pacific where does it not look like you are offsetting your currency moves as much?","Muhtar Kent","Yes I think Ali it\u2019s just on a broad base answer to your question. I think it's really critical that we balance the needs in the marketplace and the needs for us to be healthy in the marketplace on a both medium and long-term basis that's why we hold accountable all our business unit President's for local currency. And I think that, we're very happy with our progress so far with what we're doing with our productivity initiatives and what the current results are for those productivity initiatives so far, early days. But we certainly are looking to do more where it makes sense. But one thing you will not see us is taking -- basically actions in the marketplace that weakens our position for the medium and long-term that's the critical piece that I want to stress. ","Ali Dibadj","So in other words we shouldn\u2019t anticipate more pricing as FX continues to be at a negative pressure. And if you can answer that also in the context of the benign mix of commodities in 2015 and if that's a limit on your ability to take pricing again to offset FX in the bottle price ","context?","Muhtar Kent"," I think we work with all the different levers that are available to us. How our better marketing --more marketing is working driving results, how the investments are working, with that we're putting in the marketplace with our bottling partners, our basic brand strength in the marketplace all of those things. And especially in terms of commodities, again that's something that is very volatile in the world that we live in. Four or five months ago if someone said we\u2019d be looking at the current price of oil, no one would have believed this. So I think everything is changing very rapidly and we are remaining flexible on what we can achieve to the best of our ability, both in pricing, both in terms of investing for the future as well as making sure that our investments are targeted and our segmentation works. So I think there is not one solution, the segmentation is really driving better results than we have anticipated when we put that program into place. ","Ali Dibadj","Okay. So I am just trying to understand, so we could anticipate if the consumer is ready to do it and if the segmentation suggest, we could see more pricing align with inflation because of currencies being so negative. Is that kind of what you\u2019re saying? ","Muhtar Kent","Ali I'll just leave to what I said.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Financials.","Mark Swartzberg","Just a quick one Kathy a technical question, the six additional days in the first quarter, is there some level to get back later in the year. Do we see reverse of that in the fourth quarter for example?","Kathy Waller","Based on our corporate calendar the six additional days get pushed into the first quarter. But they come out in the fourth quarter.","Mark Swartzberg","Okay fair enough. That\u2019s all I've got. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Bill Schmidt from Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmidt","Wanted to ask sort of a housekeeping question. Can you just tell us what the pricing would have been in Latin America if you were at SICAD II for this year and last?","Muhtar Kent","I think what we talked about is oil pricing in terms of the local currency we pick. So whether we re-measured that in SICAD I or II it will be the same number.","Bill Schmidt","Okay I was just trying to get at what impact Venezuela had on the price, it\u2019s just for modeling for next year I think there was sort of Venezuela anomaly this quarter that might have taken that pricing down next year.","Kathy Waller","So for next year the impact of share pricing law will continue in Venezuela. That is what actually impacts our revenue in Venezuela, so its caps our ability to take revenue that does continue obviously it's kind of cost -- that are over in 2015. But it will not be a structural item because we [indiscernible] as of the second quarter. But then -- yes we also do have an impact to our revenues from a different exchange rate and that will be considered into currency.","Bill Schmidt","And then just on Asia Pacific we came in a little bit late then our expectations. And I think it's one of the lowest volumes outcomes in while and in you prepared comments it seems like you're fairly safe about that segment. So was there an anomaly this quarter that took the volume a little bit softer and the price mix of negative and other is a mix element there. But any comments on that would be very much appreciate.","Ahmet Bozer","Hey Bill, this is Ahmet. I'll try and address that; one big thing was the timing of the Chinese New Year. But I wouldn\u2019t conclude my comments without saying that the market in China specially the food and beverage market has been weakest in the last 10 years. But I would also say that we've been consistently applying our strategy that we have covered with you guys number of times before. And resulting in fairly significant share gains in China and as you know in Japan and in the middle of last year there was increase in taxes and we're continuing to see the effect of that. But still delivering almost close to flat but not that close it\u2019s minus one. So -- but the biggest item there was the timing of the Chinese New Year as well as continued sort of industry headwinds in China.","Bill Schmidt","And just one quick last one if I could. Just too kind of gauge the progress of the productivity program is it good metric to look at the cooperate and allocated line in the segment data. So should that come down as kind of the restructuring savings come through? ","Kathy Waller","The cooperate on allocated line. So yes that is one place where you will be able to see the restructuring come through, but as Muhtar said we are on track with everything that we have announced to date.","Operator","Now I would like to turn the call back to Muhtar Kent for closing remark.","Muhtar Kent","Thank you Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy and Tim. In summary, we\u2019re moving quickly to regionalize revenue growth while simultaneously driving cost out of our business during an aggressive productivity plan. While we've already made progress against our five strategic actions to regain our momentum we're just beginning 2015 will be a transition year as we rewire our operating model for growth and mix in uncertain global consumer environment. While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging in the near term we are confident in our ability to return to sustainable growth as the long term dynamics of our industry remain promising. Our brands and our global system are unparalleled and we are fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world's leading beverage company.

Today, I\u2019ll cover a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. We\u2019re committed to transform our Company to a brand-centric organization, leading a great franchise system. This journey began back in late 2014 when we got behind a set of strategic actions design to invigorate growth and increase profitability. Since then, we\u2019ve been advancing on our path to deliver greater long-term sustainable value to our shareowners, associates, partners and stakeholders.","We simplified our organizational structure for speed and flexibility. We\u2019re driving aggressive productivity. We're redeploying more and better marketing. We're driving revenues through segmented growth strategies, and embarking also on the biggest refranchising in bottler restructuring in our history. 2016 was a critical year as we continue to make strong progress in transforming our Company while keeping focus on our consumers. We continued to gain momentum in building revenue growth through segmented market roles and disciplined brand investments.","Since launching our incremental media investment plan in early 2014, our core business has accelerated top-line performance even with slowing macroeconomic growth. We strengthened our brands and portfolios through better and more marketing innovation and targeted acquisitions. We brought to market more than 500 new products, nearly 400 of which were tea, juices, coffees, waters or other still beverages. We generated over $600 million in productivity for a three-year total of over $1.7 billion, taking a balanced approach in investing in our brands, while leveraging our P&L in 2016.","Finally, we continued to strengthen our bottling system. The world's largely independent Coca-Cola bottler based on revenue, Coca-Cola European partners began operations in a market that represents one of our most valuable profit centers. We signed definitive agreements to sell our bottling businesses in China, and we expect to close these transactions during the first half of 2017. Our two largest bottlers in Japan and Greek emerged, which will create a single bottler covering roughly 85% of our system's volume in Japan that\u2019s a very important profit tool again.","We successfully helped to create Cola-Cola Beverages Africa, and we're now working to transition ownership to ABI to a strong partner of our choice. Finally, we've made substantial progress refranchising our North America bottling operations. At the same time, the North America business has flourished throughout this process, delivering top-tier FMCG performance with mid-single digit organic revenue growth in each of the past two years.","Taking together, half of our system revenue has been in motion through these actions. We accomplished a lot and built a very strong and purposeful foundation for the future. Now, it's time to write the next chapter in our growth story with the appointment of James Quincey as our next CEO. I have every confidence in James and our management team. And throughout his career, James has shown insightful leadership in addressing the changing consumer environment by expanding product offerings, and most recently, driving systematic portfolio reformulation through reduced added sugar with hundreds of initiatives in progress. He's absolutely the right leader at the right time.","James is well prepared to deliver the next level value creation. He knows that in order to deliver robust and sustainable value creation for shareowners will also need to create value for all of our stakeholders. I'm excited about what's ahead for our Company and for our system, and James will have my full and vigorous support as I continue to serve as Chairman of the Board.","Now, I\u2019ll hand over the call to James who will take you through our operating performance in 2016, as well as provide thoughts on our performance this coming year.","A - James Quincey","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thanks Muthar. And it will be an honor and a privilege to succeed you as Chief Executive. This is the pivotal time of change by Company, our system and our industry. We\u2019re seeing consumer preferences evolve, technology and ecommerce transform the retail landscape, and of course, ongoing volatile global economic conditions.","And the actions we\u2019ve taken over the past few years have set a strong foundation for our Company, and I look forward to steering us through our next phase of growth. I will take you through some of the house when we present at CAGNY in a couple of weeks. So today, let me just cover a few topics; our top line performance for the quarter; a summary of our actions and performance for the whole year; and a little on our expectations for 2017. Then I\u2019ll hand the call to Kathy to walk you through some additional financial details.","So, let's start with our top line performance in the fourth quarter. Here, we delivered good organic revenue growth, even allowing for the fact that quarter had two extra days. Clearly, this was driven by 6% price mix, while volume didn\u2019t grow. Mostly, this is a result of what we plan for and expected with a couple of twists. Firstly, those things we expected included our continuing focus on momentum in our developed country markets; for example, North America, which had another very strong quarter; and also, we expected to cycle negative price mix from last year in Asia Pacific, producing a strong number this year.","Things we saw occur in the quarter and responded to included; for example, India, where demonetization impacted the whole CTG landscape; our system responded quickly by facilitating digital payments; extending credit to mitigate destocking; and increasing our emphasis on the modern trade. Also, macro conditions worsened in Brazil. Here we chose not to drive poor value promotions to over-protect volume, but focus instead on more fundamentally resetting the price package architecture to support affordability, and this will take some time to fully implement. These not only hit our consolidated volume but in curious way mechanically improved our price mix as well.","Now, clearly 6 points of price mix is a one-off and it's not our destination, nor is a 1% decline in volume. So, rather than focus just on the quarter, let's look at the full year results, which I believe are better indicator of how we think about the full year success in '16 and going forward into '17.","For the full year 2016, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, a mixed more challenging macro conditions than we expected. At core being the Company that will exist after the refranchising, our core business grew organic revenue by 4%, and we gained NARTD value share. Given the refranchising of our Company-owned bottling businesses, we look at this core business as an important indicator of the longer term trajectory of our top line, and remained encourage that we are growing the core in line with our long-term revenue target, even if at the bottom end.","Finally, we expanded our operating margin through strong price mix and by balancing over $600 million in productivity with disciplined investments given the overall macro-environment in 2016. These actions enabled us to grow comparable currency neutral structural income before tax by 8% at the high-end of the target range we laid out at the beginning of the year.","Now, I for some texture on 2016, I\u2019ll touch on a few of our operations around the world. We performed well in certain key markets. We took action in others those needed, and managed through some other difficult operating conditions. Our developed country markets performed well as we continue to execute against that strategy of transforming the system, investing in good marketing and better execution. In North America, we saw all elements of this strategy come together, resulting in 4% revenue growth; Japan and Mexico, both performed well; and in Western Europe, increased investments coupled with a new reinvigorated bottling partner brought good results there.","Our developing and emerging markets saw more of a mix bag of performance. Markets like Nigeria and Pakistan performed very strongly. China, which began the year with a pretty challenging situation, but through a combination of adjusted strategies focused on the consumer, our performance is improved as we moved into the back half of the year. A few markets face significant challenges; Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and they impacted our overall results. There, we focused on the basics like the example I gave on packaging in Brazil.","Turning and looking forward to 2017. We expect another year of volatility around the world. I don't need to tell you about the rapid changes taking place at geopolitical and macro level, and how this will bring continued challenges and yet also opportunities across the portfolio. Some markets will get better and some will get worse. But net-net, we see the overall environment to be similar as we did to 2016.","Historically, our approach has been to grow the consumer franchise in each local market by driving consumer incidence; effectively the number of consumers enjoying our grounds; value share and transactions; and to deliver locally, against our comparable currency neutral profit targets.","So, while we are pleased with our underlying trajectory, our comparable EPS has not grown over last several years. So, going forward, if currency swings, our balancing out overtime currency neutral result to be a proxy to U.S. dollar growth, then we must adapt. So, importantly, we are intensifying our focus on delivering comparable EPS growth each year. We won't sacrifice the long-term health of the business, but we need to better balance investing to grow the business with delivering earnings growth in an environment like this.","So starting with 2017, even in the face of strengthening dollar, higher tax and interest rates, we expect to grow comparable EPS before the impact of our M&A transactions; 2017 particularly those due to refranchising. So, while the refranchising effect in 2017 is meaningful, it ultimately has laid the foundation for accelerated growth. And as you read in our release, this becomes a much less significant factor to overall growth as we move into 2018 and beyond.","Now, to deliver all that, it starts with revenue growth and then getting the operating leverage rise. Revenue growth will be built through a consumer-centric ground portfolio; by scaling in regions where we have leadership positions, like U.S. and Japan; expanding successful brands globally; and continuing to execute bolt-on M&A and partnerships. So, for example, we launched smartwater and Honest Tea in Western Europe in the past year, and plan to further expand in 2017. In the U.S., our investment in fairlife milk is paying-off. It captured over one-third of the retail bottler growth in value-added dairy during second year on the markets.","And of course, sparkling soft drinks remain a key focus, as well in the principle categories in which we compete. Within our sparkling soft drink portfolio, we are reshaping our growth equations to continue to drive revenue growth, building over the revenue growth we delivered in 2017. We'll do this through a continued mix of great marketing, great execution combined with helping reducing over-consumption of added sugar. This includes the reformulated products to reduce content, leveraging our one-brand strategy to expand zero sugar products, and driving the availability of small packs. All of this we\u2019re approaching with a mindset of test and learn, knowing that not every strategy will work in every market but the speed, flexibility and adaptation are paramount to success. I look forward to sharing more of what we\u2019re doing at CAGNY.","So, in summary; we\u2019re going to make the right decisions for the business and for our shareholders; looking out for the consumer franchise; tasking the local operations to grow locally; and managing across the portfolio and the levers of our business to deliver comparable EPS growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathy to take you through our outlook.","Kathy Waller","Thank you, James and good morning everyone. As I look back at 2016, I am pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made against our strategic initiatives. We drove organic revenue growth; grew segmented market growth and disciplined investments; further embedded productivity into our culture; and strengthened our system in several key markets. Importantly, we delivered our profit target in this tough operating environment and we returned $8.3 billion to shareowners through dividends and net share repurchases.","Now, looking at 2017, we have a strong foundation in place, but we still have a lot of assets across the system in motion. In North America, we will refranchise more of this year than we have accumulatively to-date. In addition, China will close and Africa is on track. We have strong plans in place and we recognize this level of change requires a disciplined focus to minimize any potential disruptions. As of any endeavor of this size, it is understandable that timetables may move. So the best way to think about our refranchising is to take both the 2017 and 2018 expected impact together to arrive at the total expected impact to revenues and profit. That way you can understand the dynamics and effectively model what in change in time of this year means for next year.","Starting at the top, we expect the global environment in 2017 to be roughly similar to that of 2016 with continued macroeconomic challenges in the emerging and developing world, and continued growth in the developed world. However, there is a significant amount of uncertainty and geopolitical tension, which could results in a changing macro-environment. Therefore, we expect 3% organic revenue growth that more by pricing than by volume growth. And we expect the core business to outpace our consolidated results, consistent with our performance in 2016.","We will take a disciplined approach to our marketing investments and our operating expenses in 2017. And we\u2019ll continue to full productivity through to the bottom line. At the same time, CCR, our Company owned North American bottler, is eliminating stranded cost as quickly as possible while transitioning territories to new partners. We expect the elimination of these costs to contribute roughly 2 points of underlying operating income growth. Therefore, with another year of price mix and expense management, we expect to drive very strong underlying operating margin expansion for the year. Below the operating lines, we expect an impact from higher interest expense, thereby, resulting in underlying income before tax growth of 7% to 8%.","As you all know, currencies remained volatile. And since we operate in over 200 markets, we are not immune to this effect. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect a 3 to 4 point headwind to come to income before tax. We expect our effective tax rate will increase in 2017 to 24% due to geographic mix, the impact of currencies and bottler transactions. So we are encouraged by the prospects for corporate tax reform in the United States. For business planning purposes, we have not assumed any change to U.S. tax environment for the coming year. Finally, we expect net share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.","2017 marks a turning point in our return to a more efficient capital-light model. It is the largest year for divesting profitable bottling businesses, primarily in North America. Therefore, we expect a 5 to 6 points structural headwind to income before tax, which will negatively affect our comparable EPS growth. So, while this is absolutely the right thing to do for our Company and our system, we expect it will result in a 1% to 4% decline in comparable EPS in 2017.","Now, looking further out to 2018, while it is premature to talk about underlying growth, I wanted to provide some additional thoughts on a few items in 2018, given all of the complexity impacting our financial performance this year. First, based on the timing of our 2017 actions, we expect structural headwinds in 2018 of 16% to 17% on revenue, and 1% to 2% on income before tax. Please note, this does not include any impacts in the transition of ownership of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa or the acquisition of any other ABI territories, which will be minimal as we intend to account for these as discontinued operations, given our intent to immediately refranchise.","Second, we are hedged on a number of hard currencies through the end of 2018, but a slightly less attractive rate than for 2017. Assuming today\u2019s spot-rates remained constant we would expect a low-single digit currency headwind to 2018 income before tax. Finally, we expect that absent U.S. tax reform, our effective tax rate would increase to 26% in 2018. Again, we believe reform as possible in the year ahead; however, the details are still uncertain and therefore we had assumed no change to the U.S. tax environment.","Returning to the immediate future, there are a few items to consider. Our first quarter in 2017 has two fewer days than first quarter 2016, and Easter will follow in the second quarter this year as compared to first quarter last year. In some of the markets experiencing challenges at the end of the 2016, these conditions will continue into early 2017. For example, in India, where own the majority of our bottling systems the tough operating environment, stemming from demonetization, is likely to persist at the start of the year before gradually recovering. And due to the timing of when we issued debt last year and Fed rate increases, the year-over-year increase in interest expense will be more heavily skewed to the first half of 2017 than the back half.","We expect structural items to be a 12 to 13 point headwind on net revenues, and 1 to 2 point headwinds on income before tax in the first quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be 1 to 2 point headwind on net revenue and 3 to 4 point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter.","Now, for those of you who want to get us into greater detail, the IR team will host a modeling call at 11:30 AM today to take you through additional details, as well as answer any questions you might have. Prior to that call, we will post a separate modeling presentation on our Web site at 10:30, so you will have supplementary materials to follow.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Bryan Spillane of BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Bryan Spillane","Hey good morning everybody, and just wanted to offer my congratulations and best of luck to both of you Muthar and to James. I had a question, James, in regarding price mix. And I guess as you\u2019re you kind of looking out over kind of what the environment is like over the next couple of years. Can you just talk a little bit how you\u2019re balancing the desire to get some price mix in with how you think about that relative to volume? And also relative to maybe affordability, especially in some of the emerging markets where the consumer environment is still pretty tough.","Muhtar Kent","Couple of thoughts there, I mean, over the long-term we said we\u2019re looking for a balance between price and volume, well price mix and volume. And that\u2019s certainly our long-term objective. Now, given what\u2019s happening, I think it's almost as we said it's easier to divide the world into the developed and the emerging market. In the developed countries, we\u2019re looking to drive probably a little more price than volume, and you can see that happening in the U.S. marketplace as we focus on smaller packages, as we focus on higher value categories or sub categories. So you see that across North America, Western Europe is a little more balanced, and similarly into Japan. So, that\u2019s our approach for the developed market.","In the emerging markets, obviously over the long-term, we expect them to be a bigger source of underlying volume growth, and that will bring the total Company equation into balance. So they would be more volume driven and less price-driven. Now, what\u2019s happening is in some of the markets, say for example Brazil where the micros are really under pressure, I mean, GDP over the last three years in Brazil has probably declined by more than it did in the great recession over the last decade of the 80s.","So, there what we focus on is in any moment that we will do those promotional things that make sense and return. So, we don\u2019t over-protect volume, we do what make sense on a quarterly or a monthly basis. And the principle access we act on is trying to reform the packaging strategy to make it more affordable. Whether that\u2019d be small or one-way packaging or more returnable packages backed up by good marketing that really emphasizes with the economic situation, the consumers that are in and obviously great execution by the bottling system.","So net-net, likely overtime, developed markets will push, will get more price mix and slightly less volume. And in emerging markets, more volume and slightly price mix with that caveat that those markets that struggled, we have a game plan that we\u2019ve developed over the years and that we find helps us really build a good strong consumer franchise going forward and balances the short-term.","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Powers of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steve Powers","So just -- and congratulations from me as well, to both of you. Just following on Bryan's question on price mix when have a great price mix quarter like you did here in Q4, I guess the question that is in my mind is why aren\u2019t we seeing more flow-through to the bottom line. Because in a vacuum you think 5 or 6 points of pricing mix would be significantly margin accretive. So, I guess, is it the case that what maybe mix-accretive, on the revenue line is actually margin or even penny profit dilutive on the bottom line? And I am thinking here really about the structural shift from sparkling to stills, but perhaps some of the packaging changes and geographic shifts in the balance of your overall business may play role as well. Can you just talked about that, why we are not seeing more profit flow-through on the price mix?","Muhtar Kent","Sure. Well, I think you saw lots of flow-through actually in the fourth quarter. Operating income currency neutral structure was up 18% after gross profit of 8, so there was 10 points of leverage. So, we got a lot of leverage coming through. The reason I didn't translate from operating income to PBT is more about other factors, like interest or other corporate items. So, the underlying operation, actually when I talk about PBT growing at 8% in '16 and what we've guided in '17, actually the underlying operating income performance is actually even better than that. And then we've got a bit of a headwind in interest in some of those other items.","So, there\u2019s actually a lot of leverage coming through from the operation as we focus on segmented revenue, as we focus on higher value category, as we focus on smaller packages, we're getting a lot of operating leverage between that revenue line and the operating income line. Some of it's getting that is often a headwind. So it is there, in the fourth quarter. Just to make the point, 6% is not projectable going forward. You will see in the numbers, for example, we were recycling a big negative in Asia Pacific from last year, so we've got big positive this year. We have some very good results and improvements where we own bottling operations, like China, which was very much richer in the first half.","So there is some oddities in the fourth quarter. I would encourage everyone to look at maybe the full year '16, look through to the core operation where we were growing 4%, 8% PBT, bear in mind the interest headwinds at the higher operating income growth, lots of leverage. This is the game plan for 2017.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara Mohsenian","So, James, in your prepared remarks, you touched on plans to reinvigorate sparkling growth. Can you give us more detail on where you think you stand currently in terms of the areas you mentioned, effectiveness of marketing, you shift to long-tailored products, et cetera, and any big changes you\u2019re planning going forward to drive improved trends? And then you also mentioned tuck-in M&A. So, how big a role should we expect diversification into other sub-categories to play-out over the next few years for your Company? Thanks.","James Quincey","Sure. Of course, I'll say some things for CAGNY. So, let me start with, the sparkling business is growing revenue, it grew revenue in 2015, it grew revenue in 2016. Momentum is rebuilding. If you look at the U.S., sparkling was up 1% in the fourth quarter in the U.S., in aggregate, in volume and obviously much more in revenue. So, there is -- the sparkling category is growing revenue. Let me, another piece on to that just take a couple of examples. In this quarter and last quarter as well, total -- if you take the combination of Diet Coke, Coke Light and Coke Zero, they came into robust growth in the back of the year, the growth of those altogether, so no calorie colas, exceeds the growth of the sparkling actually exceeds the growth of that total portfolio and most of our other categories.","So, there is robust growth as we press into zero sugar colas, we're getting the growth. And in North America and some of the other places where we're pushing smaller packages, we're getting the good growth. Smaller packs in the U.S. grew almost 10% in the fourth quarter. So the game plan out there of smaller packages, zero sugar, re-engagement with the sparkling category, is driving the revenue growth and we believe it will continue to do so. And the shape and the quality of that, in terms of the suitability, is looking better overtime. Obviously, tough on M&A won't be sparkling related. We have consistently done a few things this year. Hopefully, we\u2019ll do a few in '17. We\u2019ll do those that make strategic sense, financial sense, and where we find willing partners.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Ali Dibadj","I\u2019ve couple of questions on guidance, especially in the context James of your focus on EPS growth, going forward. So, for 2017, very helpful in line with our thought process, at least; except why only 3% organic sales growth? For 2018, it seems like your EPS would be barely ticking up based on assumption of high single-digit comparable currency neutral income growth before tax, or so. So 2017 like based to growth. So 2018, looks like its growing EPS very much at all. Does that sound right on 2018, and why? Or is your statement in prepared remarks suggesting that looking 2018, we\u2019re going to things like incremental cost cutting, we\u2019re going to do things to really grow the EPS. And then I can't resist have to throw this one as well, slightly different. But why does the total gross structural PBT headwind look like something like 9% to 11% versus what you said CAGNY at 7.5%? So, thanks for throwing all those. Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","I\u2019ll start, may be and then Kathy, if you feel like jumping in it, let me know. The 2017, 3%, I think we see a similar year in 2017 in terms of micros that we did in '16. And I think we\u2019re making a prudent call that given everything that\u2019s going on in the world, on a consolidated basis, we\u2019re expecting a similar outlook and a similar number for the total Company. Obviously, as Kathy said, we\u2019d like to see the core business grow above that as we did in 2016, where the consolidated was 3% and the core was 4%, which is the bottom end of our range and then that obviously lots of operating leverage. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re seeing, and we just see the way the world is going.","In terms of 2018, obviously, we\u2019re not providing guidance on 2018. We\u2019re just providing some of the elements that we know are important from a modeling perspective. So, obviously, 2018 conversation will have to wait. But we wanted people to understand the structural pace, because obviously the timing of when we sell those transactions makes a big difference. And so as timing varies, the structural adjustment can move backwards and forwards between 2018. So we just wanted to give people a total perspective. I don\u2019t know Kathy about number three. I am not sure we have the thing in front of us, Ali.","Kathy Waller","So the bridge of total structural versus what we\u2019ve shown at CAGNY. The part of what, I think is misunderstand stood in structural adjustments is, as we -- and particularly in this year, we talked about 5% to 6%. The two additional things you need to factor-in in your structural adjustments, the CCR business is not kind of standing still. It's continuing to grow, as well as the fact that they are taking out stranded costs. Now, we think of stranded costs a lot like productivity if you will. And so we have embedded those, and that\u2019s why I said in my prepared remarks to be at 2 point of productivity, of 2 points of stranded costs that are coming out as well in our numbers.","But the stranded costs are more like productivity. In that they don\u2019t just transfer with the territories, we did work to do to get them out. And for some reason if they don\u2019t transfer, they\u2019re part of our business, and we have do work to get them out long-term. So the stranded costs, we treat that as part of the business. And you can choose to net those and that to understand the short-term impact. But that's how they represent themselves in our numbers. And again, we're not getting any other underlying growth guidance for 2018 at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","William Schmitz","Could you guys just give a little bit more color on, what sounds like a little bit lower advertising spending next year? I think, you mentioned in the prepared comments. So is it something that, like you've realized that maybe the advertising efficiencies and there\u2019s much. And how that -- like what the numbers are, is it going to be lower as a ratio and in dollars? And then it seems like there is a probably lot of initiatives you can support next also. And so like the plan was getting Coke Zero Sugar out beyond Europe, if that's also in the plan for the next year. So I tried to wrap two questions in one. But the absolute and ratio of advertising spend in rationale for reducing it and then if you do as that plan to take Coke Zero Sugar to other markets outside of Europe? Thanks.","Muhtar Kent","So, firstly, the aggregate amount of marketing spend is slightly below gross profit, you are correct. Now, what is super important to know within that is we will continue to increase what we would call working spend of the marketing ahead of revenue, but we are driving material productivity in the way we organize and produce the marketing to become much more efficient. So, we are able to grow media, if you like, in all its different forms ahead of revenue. But with the extra productivity initiatives, we are actually growing total spend less than revenue, that's how that dynamic is working. So, we'll be out to do much more in the marketplace in a more efficient way.","And then secondly on Coke Zero Sugar, absolutely you should expect this to move around the world things that are successful, and that had a great start in GB in the backend of 2016 was growing double-digits, very good start. We're rolling out in Europe. It just launched in Australia. So, you can absolutely expect this to push it into those markets where we think it can be really effective, including Latin America soon, so absolutely. And I think that is part of why you're now seeing the continued acceleration of Coke Zero Sugar each year. We grew several points faster in volume in '15 than '14, and we grew several points faster in '16 than with the rate we were growing in '15. And as I said, aggregate no calorie colas, is in good mid-single digits growth as we exited the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy Hong","Thank you good morning and my congratulations to both of you as well. So first just a follow-up on price mix, specifically in North America. Obviously, we've all learned that the Nielsen data is not perfect. But there it seems to be a pretty big disconnect between, particularly in the fourth quarter where you\u2019ve got the 4% pricing versus softer pricing that we\u2019ve seen in the data. So, if you can just elaborate on that as a follow-up. And then James I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how much of a priority in '17 is really a shift towards still, if I look at '16 performance, 3% growth that you got. And still it seems like it could be much stronger in the context of a lot of the categories that seems to be growing at a faster rate. So, can you just talk about, either on the innovation front or investment front, how much of that focus would really that you\u2019ll look towards in '17 on the still category?","James Quincey","Sure. I mean, clearly, there\u2019s disconnect. I mean the Nielsen University is a much smaller piece of our total business. Obviously, when you look at the aggregate of North America, fountain is very important to us, it's almost a third of the volume in North America. And that\u2019s not going through Nielsen. And obviously, there is a lot of warehouse business there where we sell some of the still categories directly. But we have not deviated from our strategy. We talked on previous quarters that sometime the pricing will be at least the risk that the apparent pricing in Nielsen will look little softer or a little better.","The important message is we have not changed our strategy. We continue to focus on realizing pricing intelligently and through packaging and pricing in the sparking category, and focusing on those, the other categories that we believe have value in terms of revenue and profitability. And so, every now and again you will see this disconnect between Nielsen and our total results. But no, that our strategy has not changed, and we plan to continue to pursue it into 2017.","And then in terms of the other categories, absolutely, we continue to innovate and invest there. I think the underlying trend is even better than what it jumps out in the volume, bearing in mind the strategy is to participate in those categories as the highest value to us, both in revenue and in terms of profitability. So, for example, if you went to China and you look at what was happening some of the stills categories, maybe water, you see a growth rate of X. But what you don\u2019t see in the volume is actually we\u2019re selling less of the cheap water and more of the higher value waters recycle and re-innovate our business to drive the positioning and the premiumness through different brands and reset the way we attack some of these categories.","So, we\u2019re asked to driving consumer franchise that\u2019s about incidence of consumers the number of times they drink our beverages, even if that\u2019s a smaller package and about competing from value on the top and the bottom line.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Nik Modi","Thanks, and congrats guys from me as well. Question, James, I guess is when we look at North America, numbers have looked pretty good relative to I think most people's expectation going back about a year and half. A lot of the initiatives that you have put in place have started in North America. So I am just wondering if you can help us map out how to think about what\u2019s happened in North America, and the applicability to the rest of the world? And that would be helpful. Thanks.","James Quincey","Absolutely, North America has had a great run. The team has done a good job. The strategy is working. The numbers in '15 and '16 that put us at the top end of CPGs in terms of revenue growth with our customers, we\u2019re very pleased with that. I think what you see in the North American strategy, which is absolutely likely what you should expect is a fusion. And what I mean by that is things that they have done, they have taken from other parts of the world successfully. And they have blended it with new ideas and things that are relevant for the North American market, and that\u2019s what turned into the wining plan they put in place, and they\u2019ve executed, and it's doing well.","And so, you should expect us always to be taking ideas from one place, applying the learnings in another place. And fundamentally, I think North America is a great example of where we reinvest marketing behind the right strategy and a balanced portfolio with execution by the bottling system. And I underline that, the importance of the execution by the bottling system and our own fountain and what wholesale business is during a time of tremendous change through the refranchising.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Robert Ottenstein","Two questions, first, to the extent that you're able to talk about it. I\u2019d love to understand the thought process about not purchasing by, which Dr. Pepper ended-up buying. It seemed to check a lot of boxes. Is it the product, is it the timing? Any color on that. And second, could you discuss whether all the franchising, and particularly in Africa, has caused any disruptions in the business, any headwinds through that process. And a little bit more on the timing, you'd expected timing on Africa. Thank you very much.","James Quincey","Sure. I don't think it will be appropriate to comment on the M&A process of by, so I am going to skip that one, if I may. Refranchising in Africa, I think there has been a very robust process. And I think the management team of the bottler, both prior to the closing of SAB transaction under ABI on the board as well and ongoing. The management team has remained focused on doing the right things in the marketplace to a creditable performance by the management team in conjunction with the local business unit. So, we see no disruption there. And I think everything is going well. The refranchising itself as Muthar commented and as you've seen, we've reached agreement with ABI at the close of last year, and with the rest of the process is ongoing, both from a regulatory process point of view and a selection and determination of the partner from those that will be strongest in those that are interested.","Operator","Next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning and congratulations to both of you. I was hoping you guys could drill down a little further, on headwinds and the consumer, in some of your key emerging markets. And then, how has the overall category been performing in these markets? And really how is it been holding up given some of the headwinds and pressures on consumer spending, and whether you're taking share. And then, specifically in China, things seem to be accelerate in the second half last year. So could you guys talk a little bit more about current trends, whether that\u2019d be near-end and long-term outlook for China. Thank you.","James Quincey","Sure. I mean I think the emerging market is a very mixed tag. I mean there are some, which was doing well. I called out some, like Nigeria, which had a very strong year even in the close of the year as the currency came under pressure, places like Mexico. There are number of emerging markets, South Africa, which we did well in.","Now, there are others where the macros were tough, whether that\u2019d be Venezuela, very tough, Argentina, Brazil, and there we applied our strategies, a combination of what's the right tactical use of promotions to balance the system. We don\u2019t want the scale, but we don\u2019t want to overinvest in promotions, while resetting the pack price architecture to really drive long-term affordability. So, it's very much a mix bag across the world. Obviously, India is something a lot of people have commented on. I am not sure any more I can add on the India example.","In terms of China, I think China is a great example where you see us executing the game plan, I talked about for Brazil. So the China back-end of '15 coming into the first and the second quarters of 2016 was a very rough year to CPG, a rough year for beverages in China. We went for our game plan, exactly what I said about Brazil, we started to do some promotional things. And then we reset some of the pack price architecture. We\u2019ve focused on the right package sizes and the right brands, doing the marketing in the right way, and a reset of what was important in terms of execution, where you should execute, in terms of channels and focus to the city. So, in the case in China, the markets are actually doing pretty well in the top tier cities. There was lots of growth, look more like the strategy of focus on the value-end, focus on the premium end of the business and then in the more rural and lower tier cities, really affordability and smaller package sizes.","And then in the second half of 2016, China rebounded. We grew in both the third and the fourth quarter in volume terms and in revenue terms in China. So, the game plan works. Obviously, it's not instantaneous but we know what to do when markets get into trouble if we focus on understanding the consumer, understanding the customer, and getting organized as a system.","Muthar Kent","Yes, I\u2019ll just add one point just to complement what James said is that this was the 38th consecutive quarter for us in gaining value share, 38th. And then in sparkling, in NARTD, and in sparkling, this was the 12th consecutive quarter of share gains. And then in North America, importantly, 27th consecutive quarter of share gain. So, we continue to gain share as we implement this playbook that\u2019s really working, and the business is getting stronger over a much, much bigger base than any one of our competitors going forward. So, I just wanted to add that.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Swartzberg","Thanks. Good morning everyone, and my congratulations as well, James and Muthar. I wanted to, if we could do tail of three countries here, James. And what I mean by that is Mexico, your results, the Asia's results, Walmex, Antab retail data. It seems that the consumer is doing rather fine there, and of course there is a lot of concern about Mexico, since November 8th. So, in Mexico specifically, could you just give us the feel for what you\u2019re seeing in terms of broad consumer behavior since November 8th? And then with Brazil and India, with the pricing you have taken some of the invisible, if you will, because of what you\u2019re doing with price pack architecture. What's the level of confidence you have in those markets that the elasticity that you experienced will not be worse than what you have actually -- that you have a an adverse elasticity impact, greater than what your model say?","Muthar Kent","Sure. Well, Mexico, I think the -- honestly, I am sure the Mexican consumers in terms of what happened in the marketplace, the purchasing pattern, really changed that much pre and post that date. I think the Mexican economy there has been a lot of focus on it. There was a reform. So, I think it performed well. And we have a great business in Mexico. I think our system there has been innovating, it's truly one in the places where we\u2019ve been most innovative and most creative across the total portfolio where we compete in almost every category, and they've done a really robust job of building a good business.","And I think that that is what you see in the Mexico results, and may continued to build on a strong 2015 with a stronger 2016. And I think it's a wonderful operation down there, and they did a very creditable result. And I think hopefully that will all continue into 2017. Certainly, where we think that our system is up to the challenge come what may in Mexico.","In terms of Brazil and India, I think they\u2019re two very different examples. India, it was -- it certainly it's really one-off event. I mean, the demonetization effectively drained liquidity. I don't think that's about price elasticity, I think that's about the current shock to the circulation and liquidity. Clearly where the view that a formalization of the economy helps the formal players and I think it will work, it will be good in the medium term and the long-term. We expect the short-term disruptions to mitigate to tail-off as we come into 2017, though not from January 1st. And I think what we just need to see is some stabilization there. And we will be out to then come back and execute our game plan. So, I don't think that\u2019s particularly about resetting everything we do in India. I think it's about working through the effects of this one-off demonetization.","Brazil is a different thing. Brazil, I talked about. I think we saw -- we've taken quite a bit of pricing in Brazil over the end of '15, and beginning of '16. I think the consumer environment got worse towards the end of the year in Brazil. I know a number of the states in Brazil had trouble with some of the public employee payrolls going into the back of the year. So, there was a kind of reduction in the mass of consumer disposable income, perhaps more aggravated in Q3 going into Q4. And I think that the elasticity and the effects of the pricing did become worse. I mean, the value of the promotions wasn't as good as perhaps the high-lows, wasn't as good as it was at the beginning of the year or even in '15.","And I think that\u2019s what caused us to do some things in the fourth quarter, the balanced pricing and volume. But to recognize, we need to come in for '17 with a more aggressive reset at the pack price architecture. Given the circumstances in Brazil, they\u2019re not likely to be completely fixed overnight. And I think there\u2019s some focus on improving things, and we expect Brazil to slowly get better. But we are going to execute and implement a packed price some part, reset some part of it with the expectation that it will start to rebuild the business as the economics get a bit better.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Bill Chappell","Just a quick question on commodities, maybe I missed it. But the net exposure, as we look forward to this year in terms of headwind-tailwind, and then also maybe help us understand how that changes with the refranchising, I mean do you have less exposure to certain things or is it really unchanged?","Kathy Waller","So, this year, the commodity environment was relatively benign and we anticipate that next year is the same time. As we said, next year will be the largely the same as what we\u2019ve seen in 2016. We do anticipate that with the refranchising, our exposure to commodity, it goes down significantly. As we talked about, I think last CAGNY, so there is -- and we'll give you some more flavor of this, I think in the modeling call. But there is a significant change in the impact to the Coca-Cola Company is related to commodities.","Operator","And now, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Kent for closing remarks.","Muhtar Kent","Thanks James, Kathy and Tim. Last year, we made significant progress as we accelerated the transformation of our Company into a higher margin business, while keeping focus on consumers. With the strong foundation set now is a time for a seamless leadership transition. And I have every confidence that James is the best person to take us through the next phase of our sustainable growth. There is no question that this phase will look different than the past driven by a broad consumer-centric portfolio across all categories, while enabling consumers to control their intakes of added sugar. And this is going to require a change to some of our strategies, many of which have already begun and now need further scale in regions all around the world.","As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our Company and for joining us this morning."],"5767":["The Coca-Cola Co.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the formal question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would like to remind everyone that the purpose of this conference is to talk with investors, and therefore, questions from the media will not be addressed. Media participants should contact Coca-Cola's Media Relations department if they have questions.","I would now like to introduce Tim Leveridge, Vice President and Investor Relations Officer. Mr. Leveridge, you may begin.","Timothy K. Leveridge - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm here with James Quincey, our Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Waller, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, today, I'd like to remind you that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning long-term earnings objectives and should be considered in conjunction with our cautionary statements contained in our earnings release and in the company's most recent periodic SEC report.","Before we begin, I would like to inform you that you can find additional materials in the Investors section of our company website at www.coca-colacompany.com that support the prepared remarks by James and Kathy this morning. In addition, I would also like to note that we have posted schedules under the Financial Reports and Information tab in the Investors section of our company website. These schedules contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, which may be referred to by our senior executives during this morning's discussion to our results as reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please look on our website for this information.","Finally, during today's call, when our senior executives refer to comparable performance, they are referring to comparable performance from continuing operations. Following prepared remarks this morning, we will turn the call over for your questions.","Please limit yourself to one question. If you have more than one, please ask your most pressing question first and then re-enter the queue after that.","Now let me turn the call over to James.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In 2017, we completed another solid quarter of operating performance, capping off a successful year. The nonalcoholic beverage industry was a little soft during 2017, as the emerging and developing markets slowed slightly from prior year, but the developed world continued its growth strategy.","We continued to gain global value share for both the quarter and the year. And importantly, we achieved or exceeded the guidance we shared with you at the beginning of 2017. Full year organic revenue grew 3%, with four out of five category clusters delivering top-line growth, led by our sparkling soft drink portfolio.","Underlying PBT grew 9% versus our goal of 7% to 8%, as we accelerated the capture of certain productivity savings. And we delivered comparable EPS of $1.91, which was ahead of our plan. While we did what we said we'd do, it's still not as much as we aspired to. We need to be growing revenue and EPS at a faster rate.","Now looking around the world. All of our operating segments delivered positive organic revenue growth. We saw solid growth in our developed markets, particularly in Europe and North America, driven by improving execution in recently refranchised territories and enhanced pricing and packaging strategies. Our China business built momentum in 2017 even as we refranchised our bottling system.","Other emerging markets were more challenging, especially in the first half of the year, but we saw improvement in key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil as we moved into the second half. We accomplished this growth while driving significant change at our company as we accelerated our transformation into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model.","First, we implemented a new operating model designed to enable an accountable, performance-driven growth culture that we believe will result in greater returns for our shareholders; a lean model with employees who are externally focused, empowered, quick to take action and willing to take smart risks. To accomplish this, we made significant changes to our leadership team, corporate structure and updated both our incentive metrics and compensation philosophy.","Second, we implemented new digital platforms to support our leaner operating environment and improve the employee experience. This lays the groundwork for initiatives like the SAP implementation that will take place this year.","Third, we expanded our consumer-centric product portfolio, scaling wins from market-to-market, leveraging M&A and embracing more of an experimental test-and-learn approach to marketing new products. For example, we entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category, capturing over 7 points of value share by the end of the year. We lifted and shifted two of our leading U.S. brands, Honest and smartwater, into multiple international markets and acquired AdeS, the leading plant-based beverage brand in Latin America with the intension of expanding it into Europe in the near future.","More importantly, we launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 20 markets, with a clear four-point playbook of a great-tasting reformulated product, evolved marketing, new packaging and upgraded execution. And we saw very positive results with the brand growing revenue double digits, including a meaningful acceleration in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar strength in the U.S. since its launch in Q3.","Of course, it's not just about large brands. We balance rolling out large-scale brands and keeping an entrepreneurial focus on emerging consumer trend and identifying products that meet those trends. This is about developing brands, channels and points of engagements with our consumers. For example, we adjusted our pack price offering to adapt to the explosion of online ordering in China. And we're leveraging a decade of learnings from North America's Venturing & Emerging Brands model to approach opportunities in international markets. As I mentioned last quarter, we launched a unit in Central and Eastern Europe to test premium brands in high-value outlets and channels through a separate route-to-market. And of course, while it's still early days, the unit has met our expectations, and we are moving quickly to expand coverage to another seven cities in Europe.","Fourth, we focused on converting portfolio expansion into stronger revenue growth. This can clearly be seen in our EMEA operating segment, where organic revenue growth accelerated from a 3% run rate over the past few years to a strong 5% in 2017. We accomplished this in part due to the revenue growth management initiatives that focuses on small baskets and pack sizes. These initiatives were phased into several EMEA markets over the year, and we will continue to roll them out in additional markets in 2018 and so expect to see continued momentum this year.","And finally, we reenergized our system for future growth. Over the last few years, as you well know, we have been returning ownership of our company-owned bottling operations to independent companies around the world. In 2017, we accomplished major milestones in three of our most important markets. We sold our bottling businesses in China, creating two strong bottlers with contiguous territories. Our two largest bottlers in Japan merged creating a single bottler, covering roughly 85% of our system in that important profit pool. And most importantly, we completed refranchising of our U.S. bottling operations. At the same time, our North America business continued to deliver top-tier FMCG performance with 3% organic revenue growth.","Ultimately, all of these strategic and tactical changes mean something very important. We are assertively shifting our culture, the way we operate, the way we look at growth opportunities and the way we engage with our bottling system. It's been a lot of change, and much of it is only just starting to show tangible results, which is a good thing when you think about future performance.","Looking ahead, 2018 is shaping up to be stronger than 2017. We are well positioned to accelerate our top-line performance based on the actions we've taken, the impact of new U.S. tax legislation on consumer spending and the improvement in the global economy. And while the economic environment in key emerging markets like Brazil and Argentina may not yet have tipped into a tailwind scenario, they are also not causing the same level of headwinds they did last year for our industry.","With that as a backdrop, we feel confident that the revenue growth initiatives we've launched in multiple markets, coupled with the strong rollout of brands like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, FUZE Tea, AdeS plant-based beverages and smartwater will enable us to deliver 4% organic revenue growth. We will balance productivity with reinvestment to deliver significant underlying operating new (10:48) margin expansion for the year. And our refranchising effort's largely complete and a benign currency environment, we expect to grow comparable EPS 8% to 10%.","Now, of course, many of you have asked us how U.S. tax reform will impact our business. Overall, we view this as encouraging for the operating environment. Clearly, tax reform will make investing in the U.S. more attractive and should spur economic growth. We are currently evaluating it and expect our system to accelerate investments to capture further opportunities.","The tax reform also eliminates a long-standing distortion due to the former U.S. worldwide tax system, which will make it easier for our company to manage its cash and debt balances. However, in the short term, there are puts and takes to the financial benefit. Over the next eight years, the lower effective tax rate will mostly be offset by the annual payment on the tax charge we took during the fourth quarter.","Now, while we are focused on delivering this year's plan, we must also keep an eye on the long-term health of our business. In order to have a healthy business, you need to operate in a healthy community. One of today's biggest problems is packaging waste. And over the decades, Coca-Cola has done a lot of work on recycling. We made most of our packaging fully recyclable, and we've invested a lot in R&D around reusing plastic. And now we're doing more. Our system is fundamentally reshaping our approach to packaging, with a goal to collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of all the bottles and cans we sell by 2030.","We're also increasing the amount of recycled content in our packaging, and we're working to make all of our packaging finally 100% recyclable. In a world where packaging waste, especially plastic waste, is a growing problem, we are working to make sure that no bottle is ever a single-use bottle. Through recycling, it'll have more than one life.","This is the next step in our ongoing sustainability efforts, building off our success in replenishing 100% of the water we use in making our beverages. We must grow with conscience and, therefore, becoming a total beverage company that grows the right way because it is the correct thing to do for the consumers and our business.","So finally, to recap, we had a successful year. We implemented a culture shift, which is ongoing. We made large scale changes to strengthen our bottling system, met or exceeded our financial guidance and delivered top-tier FMCG organic revenue growth. And we are encouraged that 2018 will be even stronger.","With that, I'm going to hand over to Kathy.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As James said, 2017 was a good year as we met or exceeded our financial guidance during significant change at the company. Our press release covers our fourth quarter results in detail, so I will focus on the implications from the U.S. tax reform, two accounting changes that will affect our operating margins and our 2018 guidance.","Starting with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, while I won't touch on every element, I think there are three important factors to review: the impact to our underlying effective tax rate; the tax liability on our foreign accumulated earnings; and capital structure implications.","First, based on our expected earnings split between U.S. and international locations, we estimate this will lower our global effective tax rate to approximately 21% in 2018 compared to our 24% rate in 2017 and our previously expected 2018 tax rate of 26%. However, we expect increased variability from quarter-to-quarter, as future interpretations of the law and updates to the related accounting guidance could have an impact on our effective tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Therefore, the 21% effective tax rate estimate is just that, an estimate, and will be subject to change. As we go through the year, we will update you on any potential changes.","Second, in the fourth quarter, we recorded a one-time non-cash charge of $3.6 billion associated with the enactment. The charge encompasses several elements, including a one-time $4.6 billion tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a primarily offsetting net deferred tax benefit of $1 billion.","Despite being recorded in the fourth quarter, the one-time tax will be paid over an eight-year period, as stipulated by the Act. So the cash flow impact from the $4.6 billion charge will fall in future periods, but will be more than offset by the accumulated cash benefit from the lower ongoing tax rate after a six- to seven-year payback period.","While the accumulated impact is a benefit to free cash flow, the tax payments impact the company's free cash flow conversion target over the next eight years. At our Investor Day last November, we introduced a free cash flow conversion target of 95% to 100% of GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude non-cash items impacting comparability.","While the lower effective tax rate will benefit both earnings and cash flow by the same amount, the tax on historical foreign earnings will only impact our free cash flow. So this has the mathematical effect of lowering our free cash flow conversion. Since the impact of tax reform was not anticipated when we provided the guidance during our Investor Day, we are now adjusting our target to 90% to 95% during this eight-year period of tax payments.","Turning to implications on our capital structure and cash repatriation, now that the U.S. has moved to a modified territorial regime, it will make it easier to manage our cash and debt. As a result, we are providing a few updates to our capital structure. First, we have a target of 2 to 2.5 times net debt leverage, as we believe this provides the right balance between reaching the optimal capital structure and preserving financial flexibility as we move forward on strategic initiatives.","We currently operate at 3.9 times gross debt leverage and 2.2 times net debt leverage, with a credit rating of AA- from S&P and a Aa3 from Moody's. Since we are already operating within our target net leverage range, we intend to use approximately $7 billion of our cash held overseas to repay gross debt. This will allow us to reduce the spread between our gross and net debt levels, support our credit rating and continue to access the commercial paper market and reduce our net interest expense.","The remaining cash will continue to be invested overseas, as a significant portion of it is non-remittable because of local regulations or is required for working capital purposes. Another portion is required to support our commercial paper program, and then some of the cash is earning a good return in certain overseas markets.","And finally, our cash priorities remain the same. We will continue to reinvest in the business, grow the dividend, fund acquisitions and use any remaining cash for net share repurchases. As we move forward, we will periodically reevaluate and balance our opportunities with our cash flow needs. At times, and as appropriate, if we have excess cash, we could use that cash to buy back shares above our previously stated goal of offsetting any equity dilution.","Moving on to changes in accounting standards. The FASB, which is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, issued an accounting standards update on revenue from customer contracts. Based on classifications provided by this new guidance, we will now be required to account for a small number of contracts differently in the future.","While there are various considerations, the primary impact will be that certain revenue and costs and contracts that were previously netted together in revenue will now be grossed up into the revenue and cost of goods sold component going forward.","Further, as this change is prospective, meaning there is no restatement of prior results, this will result in an estimated increase in net revenue growth of 1% to 2% and an increase of 3% to 5% in cost of goods sold in 2018. Importantly, there is no material impact to our consolidated profit or EPS as a result.","However, the math of this accounting change does result in operating margin compression. This change impacts the operating segments in different ways, and it causes a timing difference, which impacts the quarters. Supplementary materials with additionally details on the impact to our operating segments and our quarters are filed on our website, and our Investor Relations team can cover any additional questions with you.","The FASB also issued an accounting standards update on pensions and postretirement benefit costs, which requires companies to split out net pension expense, keeping the service costs and SG&A and moving the other components of pension expense to other income.","As this is simply a re-class on the P&L, there is no impact to profit before tax or EPS. However, there is an impact to operating margins. Taking these two accounting changes together, we expect approximately 150 basis points of operating margin compression going forward.","Turning to full year 2018 expected performance. We expect organic revenue growth to accelerate to 4%. We expect comparable EPS to grow 8% to 10%, with the majority of earnings growth coming from the second half of the year. And we expect cash from operations of at least $8.5 billion. This represents over a 20% rebound as we cycle certain cash costs associated with refranchising activities and with the restructuring of the organization in 2017. We will continue to follow our capital allocation priorities, starting with an expected $1.9 billion in capital investment. This is higher than our long-term expected spend due to investments we are making in 2018 to enhance digital capabilities.","And we will return our free cash flow to share owners through dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and approximately $1 billion in net share repurchases. As announced yesterday, our board increased the dividend for the 56th year in a row to an annual equivalent of $1.56 per share, up 5% from $1.48.","Now let me touch on key considerations and assumptions embedded in our outlook. We expect continued portfolio lift and shift initiatives such as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and FUZE Tea, strong marketplace execution like we see in EMEA and a slightly improving macro outlook to result in stronger top-line growth. Along with some improvement in emerging markets, we see commodity prices rising. However, continued solid pricing and a focus on expense management will more than offset higher raw material costs.","As such, we expect to deliver 8% to 9% underlying operating income growth. As mentioned previously, the accounting change for customer contracts will result in a 1 to 2 point tailwind to net revenue and a 3% to 5% increase to cost of goods sold, with a minimal effect on operating income. The pension accounting change will require restatement to our 2017 results, and given the amount of the reclass, we do not expect it to impact our 2018 guidance on operating income.","Turning to structural items. We will continue to see a structural headwind in 2018, primarily due to the timing of when certain bottling operations were sold last year and the planned refranchising of bottling territories in Canada this year. Therefore, for 2018, we expect a 17% headwind to revenue and a 2% headwind to operating income from structural items.","This will result, however, in an approximate 500 basis point benefit to comparable operating margins on top of solid underlying margin expansion in the core business. We expect currency to be a 0% to 1% headwind to operating income, as improving spot rates will be offset as we cycle hedging gains from 2017.","Below the line, we expect modest deleverage. While we plan to repatriate approximately $7 billion of overseas cash to pay down debt, higher interest rates will result in an increase to net interest expense. These factors, along with our updated 21% effective tax rate, will lead to expected growth in comparable EPS of 8% to 10% in 2018.","As we model the flow of the year, there are a few items to consider in terms of phasing for the year. We expect earnings growth to be back half weighted, primarily due to the timing of expenses and productivity initiatives.","Moving specifically to the first quarter. The first quarter will have one less day than the prior year first quarter. We expect a 6 point headwind from structural items and a one point tailwind from currencies on operating income. And we expect the change in revenue recognition to be a 1 point tailwind to revenue and a neutral impact to operating income in the first quarter.","Now I realize that was a lot to cover. And as always, our Investor Relations team will be happy to walk through each of these elements in more detail as you build out your models over the year.","So in summary, we delivered against our guidance in 2017 during tremendous change in the organization and our broader system. We believe we are well positioned as we enter into 2018 and expect accelerated performance.","And then, finally, abating headwinds from currency, macros and structural impacts, along with an improving tax outlook, will allow a significant acceleration in our comparable EPS versus the past several years.","Operator, we are now ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our formal question and answer portion of the call. Our first question is from Mr. Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Happy Friday.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yes.","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So James and Kathy, you both touched upon this in your prepared remarks, and I'm sure you'll speak to it in more detail next week as well. But can you just, perhaps, expand a bit further on what makes you confident in the 4% organic growth guide for next year? It's clearly a solid number. It benchmarks really well against what we heard from peers and the momentum that you have coming out of the fourth quarter helps, I think, put it in perspective.","But what are the relative tailwinds that your system may have that other companies may lack right now? Because I think there's probably a bit of skepticism, maybe some concern out there today that 4% growth may be just be too aspirational, just given what we've heard from others this season. So I guess the question is really why is 4% the right call for Coke when the rest of global CPG seems anchored to more like 2% or 3% growth right now? Thanks so much.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Thanks. So a couple of thoughts that I think can underpin our expectations around the 4%. I mean, firstly, look back to 2017, clearly, we were making sequential improvement as we went through 2017, as we were finishing the refranchising, as we were building out the greater portfolio plans, we were, as you said, the fourth quarter was good and so was the third quarter in 2017. So I think the first point is, we were seeing some sequential improvement, so we were coming out of 2017 into 2018 with a better run rate.","Secondly, we talked on the Investor Day that what we needed to do to get back into our revenue growth rate range for our long-term model, there were a number of things we need to do on the portfolio, on some of the clusters, on some of the revenue growth management strategies and also, to some extent, an improvement in the macro environment in the emerging and developing markets. So there were things that we had to do, and there was some of the environment that would get us well into our range of the 4% to 6%.","So I think what you're seeing is a good \u2013 another good step forward in 2018, of us executing events what we need to execute, particularly the portfolio expansion and some of the RGM work. And you can see that some of that coming through in the fourth quarter. So I think the actions are in place.","The results are starting to come. The momentum is building. We're not out of the woods in 2018. The world still remains uncertain and volatile. But I think the momentum's in the business and the momentum's in the actions that we laid out that needed to be taken, plus a little bit of an improvement in the emerging macros, makes us confident that 4% is a good number for 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Want to talk a little bit about EMEA. So really solid price\/mix, obviously, so revenue growth management showing through would seem for both developed and developing markets. And yet, you had margins down pretty considerably. So could you just talk a little bit about what went on there that quarter? And how we should think about that looking forward? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. Firstly, on EMEA, I mean, there's a couple of things. Clearly, we were executing against our plan to expand the portfolio, and I think they've got good growth and good launches, particularly coming into 2018, preparing the ground for the FUZE Tea launch and the AdeS plant-based drinks launch.","So I think there's a lot going on, on the portfolio in EMEA, which is very encouraging. They have been executing a lot of revenue growth management approaches, some smart packaging, some different choices on pack sizes and driving transactions. I think you all have seen that come through in the results of both Coke Hellenic and Coca-Cola European Partners in the last few days. So there's a lot of good work going on in revenue growth management, and we \u2013 a bit back to the previous answer \u2013 we see that carrying through into 2018.","We did have some places that weren't perfect. We had problems in Egypt and in South Africa, more to do with the macro environment in Egypt, the disruption of the supply chain. So my point of reference there is when we lose volume in some of the emerging markets, it kind of has a mechanical benefit on the price\/mix.","And I think the last thing I would say, so actually, really strong start in EMEA, also end to EMEA in 2017. And the other thing that's driving the margin is the Innocent business continues to perform really well in Europe. And given that that's finished-products business, it appears to create margin compression, but it also drives top-line and good results.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Can you talk a little bit more about North America? I mean, since you have and continue to look like you will outperform your competitor and there's been, at least in the scanner data, more pricing promotional pressure. I mean, is that a risk, or are you seeing any real change in terms of more aggressive pricing to try to win back some share?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Look, I think, a couple of things. Firstly, we're very happy with our strategy in the U.S. We've been executing it for a good number of years. The team in North America, CCR as it was and now many parts that transferred to the bottlers, have been executing a great plan and winning in the marketplace and driving top-tier revenue growth.","We've always said that it won't necessarily be a straight line in terms of pricing. However, I don't think the wheels have come off pricing in any shape or form. I think in part it's a question of comparisons. If you look at the two year run rates, you start to see much less noise than you do when you look at just versus prior year, and that includes ourselves where we're lapping a very strong price\/mix from the fourth quarter of 2016. So I think, it appears to be more action than it actually is.","We think that our focus on driving value for our customers, and ideally, helping beverages grow faster than their average business, is what's creating the environment where there's a lot of value creation for everyone, and I think that strategy continues. And I think it's being successful and we're continuing to drive it forward. And so I think while it's not going to be always a straight line, I think it's still good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Wanted to go back to the top-line organic sales growth, so the 4% that you mentioned for 2018; back in November 16 you said, 4% to 6% long term. I guess, do you wish you'd said 3% to 5% longer term? And if not, how do you build up to the 4% to 6% longer term in terms of price\/mix, volume? And also even the 4% for 2018, how do you build up the price\/mix and volume? And then a sub-question of that, hoping you'll take two questions, but a sub-question of that is you mentioned changes in compensation metrics. Can you talk about how that ties to that 4% to 6% or 4% for 2018 from a top-line growth perspective? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Okay. Well, I do appreciate that you're all trying to talk me down from the revenue guidance. But let me lay it out. I mean, the 4% to 6%, couple of points. Firstly, we always said we were looking for a balance of price and volume. So in the long run, to get to our 4% to 6%, we know that that's going to be a mix of price and volume and in some degree of balance.","Clearly, what we've not had enough of in the short term is volume. Although it's worth saying, as a consequence of our focus on smaller packages, transactions are growing a whole point faster than volume. So we see that the strategy is driving us to the right place, but over the long term, we would expect to see some degree of volume growth necessary to be comfortably in our range of 4% to 6%. And no, I don't regret not taking it down to 3% to 5%. And so that's what needs to happen. And it's not something that needs to happen tomorrow morning, but over time, yes, we'll need volume growth to balance out the pricing. And I think that's what we aim to do.","Now, in terms of getting there, I would refer back to some of the material on the Investor Day, and we'll talk about it again at CAGNY on Tuesday. Clearly, what needs to happen to get comfortably into the 4% to 6%, and 2018 will be a step on that journey, which is why we're calling out 4%, which is the lower end of the range because we know, kind of, as I was saying on Steve's question, we know we need to do some more things on the portfolio. We're really driving expansion across the clusters.","I mean, in the fourth quarter, our initiatives were about half coming out of sparkling and half coming out of the other categories. So we're starting to see more of the portfolio there, more of the way (35:26) to driving growth. And we know that we need to continue with our revenue strategies, particularly around smaller packages; reference my previous comment on transaction, but also improving macros. I mean, the emerging markets need to come back. I called it out in the script.","The good news is Brazil's gone from being a major headwind. Actually, it was broadly flat in the fourth quarter. Over time, that market will come back and so will some of the other markets that have suffered. But it'll take time.","And so I think it's the right journey. We know what we need to do. We know what macro environments need to improve. We can see a path in the long-term for the 4% to 6%, and we've got back into the range for 2018, and I think it's a solid estimate for 2018. Of course, the world could be volatile, uncertain, but I think it's a good estimate. I reference you back to 2017. We made a realistic assessment of what we thought would happen in 2017. We called it, and we basically hit it or slightly beat it in 2017, taking the actions we needed to take. And I think we got a strong plan in 2018, and it's robust.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I have a question on margins. Very impressive growth during the quarter, so wondering if you guys could drill down a little bit and quantify the different drivers of this, especially how much your refranchising contributed versus some of your other productivity efforts. And then separately, could you walk through how much of a contributor productivity will be to your structurally-adjusted operating income growth of 8% to 9% in 2018? Thanks.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure, Bonnie. Good morning. So if I were to, first of all, disaggregate the gross margin expansion, the majority of that increase is, in 2017, was from the structural change and from pricing. Gross margins are under some pressure from various finished goods businesses, and we also faced a slight headwind from currency and some incremental costs from the hurricanes from last year.","Having said that, however, then pivoting over to our operating margins, in the fourth quarter, the margins expanded over 500 basis points. So we delivered very strong comparable margin expansion, and the primary driver of that again being the refranchising. And again offset by some of those costs and a donation that was made by corporate. So the majority of what you're seeing is driven by the refranchising, but at the operating margin level, a significant portion of that is being driven by the productivity initiatives, particularly the lean center initiatives.","In 2018, the margin expansion will again be \u2013 gross margins will continue to be under pressure as we are moving to other categories. However, we will offset that with the productivity, particularly, lean enterprise initiatives, and there will, again, be more expansion due to the refranchising.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Good morning, everyone.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Nik.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So the question I have is on costs, just kind of following up on the last question. How much of what you've identified is really just kind of corporate versus what's going on in the region? So I'm just trying to get an understanding of how much have you explored in all of the regions in terms of what you could possibly do in terms of a cost out perspective? Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. Nik, hi. James here. We've been exploring what can be done in corporate and across the whole enterprise, including the field. We've been building this more as a culture than an event or a series of events. I think we made a lot of progress over the last number of years, going back to the start of several of these programs. So I think we have a clear line-of-sight to all the productivity initiatives we need to hit the targets we previously laid out.","So there are no stones that are unturned. We not necessarily can address everything at the same time. Some things depend on systems being put in place, and you can't get everything done in the same day. Having said that, I'll repeat myself, we have clear line of sight to what we need to drive the productivity that's embedded in the margin expansion, because ultimately, we're driving productivity, but we're also reinvesting, we're also covering some inflation. So all of that is netted into the margin expansion that we're driving.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, good morning, James and Kathy.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'd like to follow-up again on this, what seems to me, I mean, a weak profit guidance for this year. When we did the math, our initial reads suggest that the operating profit and EPS growth guidance is weaker than expected. So you said EPS would grow 8% to 10% from fiscal year 2017 based of $1.91, which, as we understand, it includes the benefit of the tax reform. So as tax will decline to 21%, that's roughly a seven-point benefit to EPS by your math?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","No.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No? So I mean, I'm just asking \u2013 I mean, did I miss something here, or I need some clarification on this because...","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah.","Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, go head.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","So our tax rate in 2017 was 24%. And we are estimating, and I underline Kathy's cautionary comments on it's not a fixed rate, so it could vary and particularly vary between quarters going down to 21%. So our year-to-year change in tax rate is 3 points, which, when you take it on the 76% of the cents on the dollar we were keeping, is a 4 percentage point headwind. So if you want to look at it that way, you can take 4 points off the EPS growth due to the tax changes. However, I would also point out that we have called out comparable EPS, so that includes the fact we're selling some of our bottling businesses, which is worth 2 points of growth. So you can net those two together. So actually, I think it's a pretty strong number off a 4% revenue growth in an environment where interest rates are increasing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Morning.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So on Latin America, one, just in terms of the price\/mix improvement in the fourth quarter, it was quite strong, so just wanted to get a little bit more color there. And I know you touched on this, James, a little bit earlier about Brazil getting better, but wanted to just get a little bit more color just in terms of some of the initiatives that you had in place in the price pack architecture initiatives. How far along are you in that market? In contrast, Mexico softened a bit in the fourth quarter, so just trying to get a better sense of the outlook in that market within that region?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah. I shall go in reverse order. So I think Mexico did weakened \u2013 softened a little bit. I think it's largely the macro environment in Mexico is getting a little softer at the moment, and I think that'll likely play through a little bit, at least into the first half of 2018. But I think that's largely macro.","Of course, we are adapting and looking to execute some initiatives around affordability, around packaging, around launching new products. We did de-prioritize in the fourth quarter a little bit of the low-margin bulk water, so that is part of the story but not the full story. So there a little bit of softness in Mexico.","Now driving the price\/mix in the fourth quarter clearly got better, and in part, it was due to the ongoing improvements in Brazil, where we had clarity been executing a plan through the year to improve affordability and focus on smaller packages that are more affordable but actually helped from a price\/mix point of view. Plus we have the benefit of some of the price increases and incidence increases that flowed in in the back half of the year. So I think it was a pretty strong year of actions to drive RGM.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you very much. You mentioned earlier on that transactions were growing 100 basis points faster than volume, which is terrific. I was wondering if you could just give us any more thoughts on that. Do you think that is the likely outlook going forward in terms of 100 basis points? Do you think that can expand? And how does that number compare on a geographic basis? Are there some areas where transactions are down or other areas where transactions are up much more than 100 basis points? Just more color around that would be helpful. Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yes, sure. So I think our objective and recent history is have transactions growing ahead of volume on an aggregate basis. So clearly, it's something that we are pursuing actively because we are pursuing a strategy of smaller packages across most of the geographies, whether it's through affordability or whether it's around helping people with portion control. There's a lot of places where we're trying to drive transactions ahead of volume.","Now, the U.S. is one of those. Clearly, we've had the strategy around this area for some time. We made great progress. The mini cans were in double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, and the U.S. absolutely had transactions more than 100 basis points ahead of volume. So we were very pleased with the execution of that strategy in the U.S.","Similarly, the other parts of the world that most of the countries' transactions are ahead of volume. Not everywhere, and that can sometimes be because we're trying to increase the affordability of the multi-serve packages, and that just happens to have a mechanical effect. But I would call out, as the kind of the lead ones in really driving smaller packages very assertively, are some of the developed markets led by places like the U.S., Australia, France, some of the places like that. And then in the emerging markets, it kind of depends on whether we're driving affordability or not.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company.

Thanks.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. I mean, clearly, and it's one of our points of dissatisfaction in 2017 is we were not able to turnaround Diet Coke. I think the team have come up with a strong plan for 2018 with the new flavors, the new can design and size and some of the marketing. And I think we are going to have hopefully a better year in 2018 in terms of Diet Coke.","I think we're finding a path forward. Clearly, part of the story in 2017 towards the end was we started doing even better with Coke Zero Sugar as the relaunch of that drove almost 10 points of growth in the fourth quarter on Coke Zero Sugar.","Nevertheless, we want to improve Diet Coke, too. We had a strong start at the beginning of this year with the launch of new program. Clearly, we would love to at least stop declining, if not get into growth. I'm not sure just the flavors and the packages will get us there, but it's certainly going to be a good step in the right direction.","Operator","Thank you.

Can you talk a little bit more about that? Where do you see most impact on consumption? How much, if you can quantify that? And then just tied to that, what's the expectation for the U.S. business in terms of 2018 top-line growth?","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Well, I think the first thing to say is, the tax reform has just come in, and so we're not actually seeing the effects into the economy yet. Clearly, as the investments behind more opportunities, because of the lower tax rate, start to occur, that will lift aggregate demand. But in the end, we are a broad enterprise. And so, lifting of consumer income ultimately is what's going to flow through to us.","As confidence returns in the economy, often you see increases in people going out and in foodservice, so you'd start to see it occur there. But we are ultimately going to benefit as the broad-based economy does better and more money flows into people's pockets.","What was the second half of the question? Oh, North America. We don't provide a guidance number by group, but clearly, we've got a good strategy in North America.

Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Good morning.","Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","My question is on the fountain business. It's just a two-part question, very simple. It's a large part of your volume, about 35% in the U.S. Why has not been that refranchised, or will it be? I suppose that bottlers would benefit from that volume. And the second part to your question is, you've done a great job in terms of moving into smaller RTDs, garnering increasing revenue per case, higher growth there. I suppose that in some outlets, over time, you can ship from fountain to literally smaller PET bottles, and that could be very profitable for the whole system. So just can you give us a sense of how that can play out in the future? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Sure. I think you said the fountain was 75% of the volume. I'm not sure I heard you correctly. But just to clarify, the fountain business in the U.S. is about a third of the U.S. system volume, not 75% if that was the number you said. So it's about a third of the U.S. volume. It operates in a very different way to the bottle-can business. It requires different capabilities, both in the supply chain and the customer. And it operates largely with the national chains of customers, even more so and much more so than the grocery retail and the mom-and-pop business and the convenience store businesses or the kind of the brick-and-mortar store.","So I don't think that there's any likelihood of us doing that in the short-term. I'm not sure I see the acceleration of performance advantage in doing so. And so I think we will stick to the strategy that we have.","And then, in terms of fountain versus smaller PET, what we're focused on is making sure we're delivering the consumer experience that they are after in the outlet in which they're buying and optimizing that and providing that in the package form that best fits that consumer experience with the customer that they're at. So we're not trying to artificially drive the packaging structure one way or the other. We're trying to optimize the consumer experience.","Operator","Thank you.

I would like to just focus on FX outlook. I understand that now it's becoming a tailwind, finally. And how I understand that in the past was obviously a major drag to EPS. So how would you think for pricing and your ability to take more risks in innovation, let's say, in Latin America or even reinvest more in products that are less \u2013 like you quoted Honest Tea \u2013 on products that are less margin accretive in the beginning, but would be very growth accruing in the future? Thank you.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","I'll maybe take the first one. And if I've missed something, then you can jump in, Kathy.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Okay.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","I'm not sure that we link the two pieces of the question you're putting out. I mean, we largely have an approach where we drive our business in local terms. The world's not one-size-fits-all. So we look at each marketplace and say, what do we need to win in this marketplace with these consumers, working with the customers to create value for them. And the company is, in a way, the sum of all those local actions.","Now a year ago, we talked about we were going to take some extra effort to make sure the sum of all that turns into positive comparable EPS growth in U.S. dollars, which it hadn't done necessarily for a few years. And we got to flat last year, and we're going to drive for some good growth in 2018. But the variations in FX, assuming they're not completely wild, don't drive our operational local market decisions. The expansion of the brands like Honest and all the other innovations are really driven by the market.","And so, therefore, pricing is really driven by those local opportunities of launching the portfolio and local inflation. So to the extent that, I guess, FX somehow theoretically is linked to local inflation, it comes to play. But we start at the other end of the equation, which is what does the local market need in terms of products and pricing, and then work it back.","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Yeah, if I can just add. We talked about the tailwind in the first quarter, however, remember, we have a hedging strategy and that so whether it's a tailwind or a headwind, and we're really guiding towards more of a headwind, is because of our hedging strategy that we have employed. And so we're cycling some really good hedging gains from last year, which is causing most of that headwind for next year.","Operator","Thank you.

I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments you made about free cash flow and the effect of the tax code change. We think about two things, gross debt and then, I guess, net interest expense, understand that the free cash flow conversion maybe comes down a bit, but seems like you had more access to cash. So I guess, over time, forgetting about what's going to happen this year, will you have the ability to maybe take gross debt balances down over the next few years is the first question? And then related to that as we think about interest expense, with rates rising and then whatever you may do with gross debt balances, just how we should think about net interest expense, both for 2018 and beyond?","Kathy N. Waller - The Coca-Cola Co.","Hi, Bryan. So gross debt balances will \u2013 are initially going to come down about $7 billion, as we said in our remarks. And that will allow us to then kind of balance out our spread.","Over the long term, yes, we have \u2013 tax reform gives us the ability to have flexibility with our cash. So we will employ the right capital structure for us. We're going to keep a net leverage position of 2 to 2.5 times and as we need to, yes, we could potentially bring down more gross debt. The focus right now is maintaining that net debt leverage position.","Interest expense is, obviously, we're in a rising interest environment, and our interest expense will be going up, even though we are going to pay down some of our gross debt. And over time, I guess, you asked about specifically the longer-term kind of outlook for interest expense.","Today, we only have about 20% floating. As we are, I guess, moving over time, more into \u2013 we will, I believe move more into a floating rate environment, as we see the benefit, and that will hopefully help us to temper that interest rate expense increase. But for now, interest rates are going up as we have continued to move our debt into longer-term maturities over time. And because of when we bring back the $7 billion, we will take out some of our commercial paper, which has a lower interest rate.","So basically, I would say we'll take a look at the capital structure, always manage it over time for now. We believe the right thing is to bring back the $7 billion, pay down gross debt, manage to a 2% to 2.5% net leverage position. And that does impact our interest expense going forward. And over time, we'll continue to manage that as well.","James Quincey - The Coca-Cola Co.","Great. Thank you very much, everyone.
