Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sally Curley, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Eric. And welcome to today's quarterly conference call. We will be making forward-looking statements on the call today. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied.

So, please make sure to visit the site often for updated information. We hope to see many of you at an upcoming event.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Sally, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. We're off to a very strong start to our fiscal 2016. Our first quarter revenues increased 17% to $28 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 30% to $737 million. And we reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38, an increase of 38% over the prior year. These are strong numbers representing meaningful and measurable results in a very positive start to fiscal year.","Our operating performance is a powerful indicator that our organization is creating value for our customers. With an emphasis on disciplined execution, we've competitively positioned for sustained growth for both the near-term and long-term future. With a strong quarter behind us and some better visibility to the balance of the year, we are raising our full-year non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $5.15 to $5.35, which represents an 18% to 22% growth rate over our fiscal 2015.","At Cardinal Health, each of our lines of business contributes to making the company as a whole better, stronger and more accountable to our customers and our shareholders. With that, as a reminder, I'll take just a few minutes to comment on our segments and the overall healthcare environment. And then, I'll turn the call over to Mike, who'll provide greater detail on the quarter.","Our Pharmaceutical segment had an outstanding first quarter. Revenue increased 19% to $25.1 billion. Segment profit was up 46% to $657 million. Our Pharmaceutical distribution business continues to demonstrate the highest levels of operational excellence, software product and customer positioning, and unyielding attentiveness to the needs of our customers. Most of our growth this quarter was driven by organic activities. Our world-class generic program continues to be a source of real and measurable value for us, our manufacture partners and, most importantly, for our customers.","In July, we completed the acquisition of the Harvard Group, enhancing our generics business and our ability to support both retail and institutional customers. The integration of that business is going well and we feel very optimistic about achieving our financial targets.","At the same time, our branded biopharma partners see us as an efficient, effective, and committed partner in getting products to market. Make no mistake, this is an extraordinary time in the pharmaceutical industry. As I said before, we are at an inflection point. We're witnessing a new way of pharmaceutical innovation. This requires a strong position in specialty pharmaceuticals. Our Specialty Solutions business continues its record of robust growth, and this quarter, delivered the highest rate of growth we've seen in recent years.","The acquisition of Metro Medical is expanding and strengthening our position in some important therapeutic areas including dermatology, nephrology, and oncology. These added capabilities make us an important partner in pharmaceuticals companies, try to deepen their connections to patients with distinct needs.","Turning to our Medical segment, revenues were up 2% to $2.9 billion. As we had noted in our fourth quarter call, we had expected our Medical segment profit to decline in Q1 versus the prior year a number we estimated to be in the high teens. Our fundamentals were stronger than expected, and in actuality, Medical segment profit declined 11% versus the prior year. We saw increased penetration in our Cardinal Health brand products, Cardinal Health at Home and in our service offerings. And we continue to see higher than market growth in our strategic accounts.","We've made meaningful changes in our Medical segment that allow us to create more value in more ways. Our intention here is to better serve customers, who've considerably more complex needs and more highly distributed system.","As we recently announced, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we closed our Cordis acquisition, which strengthened our ability to provide innovative, efficient and effective cardiovascular solutions for aging populations across the world. This is a key element in our physician preference item strategy. Our team did an outstanding job managing the many working parts across this global business to close the transaction dead on our timeline.","Our integration teams have been working very effectively and this enabled us to serve patients around the world on day one. Many thanks to that team and our colleagues at J&J for their partnership. We welcome the global Cordis employees and their terrific leadership team, so many of whom have joined Cardinal Health.","The modernization of our portfolio is particularly relevant as we see a system in which payment models continue to evolve. Now more than ever, it's critical that we have the ability to get patients the right care at the right time and in the right setting. That's why in August, we took a majority stake in naviHealth, a national based market leader in post-acute management for payers, health systems and providers. Through its predictive analytics and evidence based protocols, naviHealth helps determine the appropriate care plan for patients post discharge. This kind of predictive population management is a critical capability for Cardinal Health.","naviHealth will report through our Medical segment specifically as an expansion of our post-acute offerings. However, the capabilities represent broad based technologies and skill sets, which will serve Cardinal Health across our enterprise and many of our partners across multiple channels.","The recently announced proposed rule on mandatory post-acute bundling for hips and knees, CCJR and CMS's announcement last week requiring changes to discharge process, our two recent examples further evidencing a shift to value within our healthcare system. Combining Cardinal Health at Home's patient reach, our broad pharmacy capability, and naviHealth's predictive analytics at discharge positions us well to advance our value proposition of right care, right time, right setting and makes us the partner of choice for hospitals and health systems in the emerging value-based payment models.","Finally, I'll make a few comments about the continuously evolving healthcare environment, focusing on the U.S. where the activity has been to say the least very dynamic. A few things remain clear. Demand for healthcare will only increase with our aging population and continued challenges in public health. And there is no place in the world where more innovative and high-quality care can be delivered than right here in the U.S.","Having said this, the system needs and will continue to experience changes to make it more accessible, better coordinated, of consistently highly quality and more cost effective. As I mentioned earlier, it is also clear that we will see the emergence of some new payment models. This is one of the reasons that we're so excited about Cordis, as it further enables us to deliver both products and services, which help in the overall efficacy and efficiency of an interventional cardiovascular procedure.","All this catalyzes the industry as it adapts to these changes. And we're seeing moves across the industry among many players as they try to address one or more of these forces. Our Cardinal Health moves, both organic and inorganic, have been geared towards ensuring that we are uniquely positioned to compete not only in today's environment, but in tomorrow's.","In closing, I'm pleased to report an excellent start to our fiscal 2016. We feel confident we are well positioned for sustained growth well into the future. Our Cardinal Health people remain committed to creating meaningful and measurable value for our customers, our partners, patients, our communities and our shareholders. We look forward to seeing many of you later this month at our Investor Day in New York, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to be reporting an outstanding start to our fiscal year. During our fourth quarter call, I shared that I was confident, we had set the table well for this fiscal year, and this first quarter provides some validation.","In my remarks, I'll review our first quarter financial performance as well as updated expectations for our 2016 fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew 38% to $1.38. This was led by the strong performance of our Pharmaceutical segment and aided by better than expected performance from our Medical segment, both of which I'll discuss in detail later.","Starting with consolidated company results, revenues were $28 billion, a year-over-year increase of 17% and total company gross margin dollars were up 18%. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, primarily driven by acquisition. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $737 million, an increase of 30% versus the prior year.","Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense came in at $52 million in the quarter. This increase versus the prior year is primarily due to the increase in long-term debt to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and The Harvard Drug Group.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the first quarter was 32.9%, which is 3.6 percentage points favorable to the prior year rate. This was due to a few net favorable discrete items that totaled approximately $0.08. We still expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35.5% and 37%.","Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 331 million, about 9 million shares less than the same period last year. We did no share repurchases during the quarter, and at the end of the quarter, our remaining board-authorized share repurchase program was about $700 million.","Also during the quarter, we had net operating cash outflows of $52 million, our annual expectations for operating cash flow remain unchanged, as it is natural to see fluctuations and some shift between quarters.","We ended September 30 with a strong balance sheet, including a cash balance of $3 billion, of which $480 million were held internationally. As a reminder, on October 2, we used nearly $1.9 billion to fund the acquisition of Cordis.","Now let's move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Our Pharmaceutical segment performed exceptionally well this quarter. Segment revenue increased 19% to $25.1 billion driven primarily by growth in existing and new customers and to a lesser extent the acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. Because of this strong Q1 growth and the performance of our acquisitions, we now expect full year Pharmaceutical segment revenue growth in the mid-teens to high-teens versus the prior year. Pharma segment profit increased 46%, to $657 million, due to strong performance under our generics program, which includes the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing.","As you may recall, the first quarter of last year was the startup quarter for Red Oak Sourcing, and so there was minimal benefit in that quarter. As we lapped the initial quarter, we continue to be excited about the performance of Red Oak and the strength and positioning of our overall generics program. Segment profit margin rate increased 49 basis points in the quarter to 2.6%, driven by performance of our generics program and the acquisition of Harvard Drug. We're very pleased with this margin expansion. I do want to note that the impact of the launch and growth of certain brand products, like hepatitis C products, and the addition of certain customers will have a dilutive impact on the margin rates going forward, but are beneficial to the bottom line growth of our company.","As you think about the rest of the year, let me provide you color on a few unique items that were favorable to our assumptions for our Pharma segment in the quarter. These items together were worth about $0.11. First, we had $0.08 of favorability largely from benefits related to different competitive dynamics than we anticipated for a few key generic items. The dynamics have since adjusted to expected levels.","Additionally, through great execution, we were able to accelerate about $0.03 related to the integration of acquisitions ahead of schedule. Net-net, our underlying growth was really strong. As far as it relates to generic and brand manufacturer price inflation, neither were significantly different than we modeled.","On our fourth quarter call, we told you that we believe the generic inflation rate would moderate versus the prior year, and this was true for the first quarter. And while branded inflation rate was slightly higher than the prior year, it was generally consistent with a low double-digit range we anticipated. During the first quarter, our Pharma segment and the team continued to execute at a high level, all this resulting in an exceptional quarter.","Let's now go to the Medical segment performance. As I mentioned earlier, performance of the medical segment was better than we anticipated. Revenues for the first quarter grew 2% to $2.9 billion, driven by growth in Cardinal Health brand products and our at-Home business. Of particular note within our strategic accounts, growth of Cardinal Health brand products increased in the low double digits.","Also during the quarter, we had incremental revenue from a number of smaller acquisitions. However, the incremental revenue was essentially offset by the divestiture of our office-based physician business to Henry Schein. Medical segment profit decreased 11% to $101 million during the quarter, versus the high-teens guidance we had previously communicated.","The primary driver versus the prior year was a decline in our Canada business, which included some unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Remember that the prior quarter included the one-time benefit of the winding down of the Canadian CareFusion business. For some additional color, if you normalize for the winding down of the CareFusion contract and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, the underlying segment grew.","As George mentioned, we're very pleased to have closed Cordis on October 2 in line with our original expectation. We will continue to update you on the Cordis inventory fair value step-up. And while we don't yet have complete visibility, we feel very comfortable that this step-up will not exceed our original assumptions.","Turning to slide number six. You will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.23 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related cost. I'd like to take a moment to describe a minor technical change to the presentation of our financial statements, due to the recent acquisition of a 71% interest in naviHealth.","You'll note that in accordance with GAAP, we added lines called non-controlling interest to our applicable financial statements and schedules. This reflects the 29% minority interest in naviHealth and a few other immaterial minority interest. Historically, we haven't presented these separately. This reporting differentiates our earnings from those associated with the non-controlling minority interest. As a result, references to non-GAAP EPS will refer to non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to Cardinal Health.","Looking to the rest of the fiscal year, based on our strong first quarter performance, we've increased our initial non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range which was $4.85 to $5.05 to a new range, which is $5.15 to $5.35. Our new range implies growth of 18% to 22% over the prior year. While the first quarter has had a bit of a rebalancing effect on the full year financial performance, we are still expecting a cadence that slightly shifts the scale to the back end of the year.","There are a few other updates to our fiscal 2016 assumptions that I want to highlight. These changes are denoted on slide eight and slide nine. First, we now expect total company revenue growth to be in the mid-teens versus the prior year. Next, we've updated our weighted average shares outstanding assumption to 332 million shares to 334 million shares, which is lower than the initial range provided of 334 million shares to 336 million shares.","And finally, our assumption for acquisition related intangible amortization increased to approximately $277 million or about $0.52 per share. This change is due to acquisition that closed during the quarter and doesn't reflect the impact of Cordis and doesn't affect our non-GAAP earnings. All other FY 2016 assumptions provided during our Q4 earnings call remain unchanged.","In closing, we're excited about our performance in Q1, and what we see for the rest of our year. Operator, let's begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take the first question from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. You guys gave a lot of details. Just trying to get a better sense of how you're thinking about the balance of the year on the core business. It looks like you're raising the full year by about $0.19, ex the $0.11 that Mike referenced as more being one-time. You beat the Street pretty handily this quarter, even ex-tax. So, is there any other moving pieces or any updates you can give us just as far as better underlying assumptions as you think about the next three quarters relative to your previous assumptions?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Bob, good morning. It's George. I'll start and then I'll just turn it to Mike. Well, I think we're coming out of Q1 with some momentum. As Mike mentioned sort of the underlying performance characteristics for us have been feeling pretty strong over these last months. And so it really runs across our lines of business. Again, we mentioned our expectations from Med, we outperformed those. We're starting to see some momentum there.","Our Pharmaceutical distribution business is on a good pathway with strong momentum, and we feel like we anticipated some of the market shifts reasonably well. And I think as Mike mentioned, we modeled into our numbers some moderating and some of the pricing dynamics around generics, which we think is \u2013 we sort of got roughly right. So, Mike, I don't know what you'll want to that.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","No. I could just summarize, Bob, to maybe hopefully be hopeful. Yeah, so the $0.11 of favorability was really related to the Pharma segment. And then, from a corporate perspective, we had the $0.08 of the discrete items on the tax side, but while those are more defined as somewhat one-timers or thoughts that way, I would tell you that the underlying performance net-net of all the business is really strong and we're seeing really strong performance across all the businesses.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, that's helpful. I guess just one more as we think about the balance of the year, I think, it's well established, you guys had won a large managed care contract in the quarter. But just curious, it looks like you're raising revenue for the year, can you maybe just walk through if there was any changes around contract movement relative to your previous outlook?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I wouldn't say there was any real changes related to it. I think you're right that is a strong revenue top line business for us, but as we said before, we only expected it to be slightly accretive this year, when you consider all the start-up costs and everything that go along with a new live (24:17) contract like that.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","And we'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Sorry to stick on the point. I'm just trying to understand, in terms of the favorability, the way you described in terms of changes in the competitive environment, is this specifically pricing or is this some other element in maybe one or the other parts because we didn't hear this from the other players. I'm just getting a ton of questions to get a little bit more clarity on maybe not exactly what it was, but more a little bit of context.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ross, this is George, I'll start and again Mike can clarify or correct me, if necessary. So, I think what happens is, this has to do with everybody's own internal modeling. So, the way we modeled certain products, we expect X product have X competition at various stages. And so, that's just a nature of the way we model them. So, we may have modeled for example on a given product that there are going to be a certain number of competitors. If there is one or two or more or less, then that can change. And so, when we're talking about the competitive dynamics, it's usually the number and composition of those players.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then...","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","The one thing I would add, Ross, to maybe be helpful is remember our mixes can be different than our competitors' mix too. And this really just had to do with the way we modeled a few key generic items and what our overall margin rates would be on those items, and over the first quarter, those margin rates were just stronger than we expected, but they have more normalized as we expected towards the end of the quarter and that's why we don't see those being quite the same levers going forward.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks. I just want to make sure folks were clear. And then you've obviously closed on Cordis, can you talk just a little bit about sort of how the organization is responding to you bringing them in house? I'm assuming there's probably some good enthusiasm as you obviously take a little bit of a different bet on that business. And maybe talk a little bit about geographically some of the markets where you feel like you can help inflect maybe ex the U.S., any more than maybe you originally thought, because I think the original assumption was a lot of impact on the U.S. and then the sort of ex-U.S. is a little bit more left to itself. Any updated thoughts on the ex-U.S. business?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Let me get started again with the caveat, this is very, very new. We literally just closed this business a few weeks ago. But I would say the enthusiasm level is extremely high. Again, recognize that we are making this a high priority as part of our physician preference item strategy and we've had all the key leadership around the world join us. We've had meetings all over the world. The reception from the Cordis people to Cardinal has been fantastic, and really gratifying. So, I think from that standpoint, the energy level, the enthusiasm and I think the alignment with the strategy is really great, and part of that has to do with the service component of what we bring.","And the ability, for example, to bring other tools that go along with the product into new markets has been really exciting. And so if you had to say to the second part of your question, where have we been, maybe a little surprise is the enthusiasm for some of the service components ex-U.S. And I'll highlight China and EMEA where some of the markets see these opportunities to help manage inventory, for example as real value drivers for their customer base. So, we're \u2013 it's very, very early, but I would say the level of excitement here and among those Cordis people who have recently joined us is pretty high.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The only thing I would add is that, besides the \u2013 I completely agree with George, the excitement is really, really high. But just a couple of quick reminders. First of all, it did close on our target date. So, we had expected early October to be our target date from the beginning. So, we were dead on that target date. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, well, we don't have perfect visibility to every component right now of the inventory. We do have enough visibility to tell you that the impact of the inventory step-up that we had originally would be $0.13 to $0.15. We still expect that to be as a number and we do not expect any variance to the upside or it to be more expensive than $0.13 to $0.15 than we did before.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter. So, two questions here. First of all, obviously, there has been a lot of \u2013 we're hearing a lot about just inflation in general. You talked about your expectations for generic inflation. But can you share with us your thoughts about how you see Brent pricing inflation being impacted by all the political noise that we're hearing and also what's Cardinal's exposure to it? We've heard some different data points from your two peers last week.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, why don't I give you some quick thoughts, Ricky. First of all, good morning. Some quick thoughts on the environment and then maybe I'll let Mike just talk about our \u2013 what you call our exposure to a pricing dynamics. I'd start by the way, saying, this has been \u2013 we've a very robust and balanced portfolio and I think that always is helpful. So, let me just start, clearly, pricing in Pharmaceuticals has become a hot topic, particularly as we go full swing into the election cycle. And again, let's \u2013 with the caveat of the acknowledgement that a price of any drug could create a difficulty or hardship for any given patient, I think it's important to remind ourselves that from a system standpoint, Pharmaceutical care is still the most cost effective in the system.","And it's actually roughly around 10% of our national spend on healthcare, so it gets a lot of attention. But I want to try to put in context, the thing that I'd (30:33) put in context is that with about 85% of prescriptions filled in the U.S. being generic and mostly at lower price points than brand, that's a powerful tool for keeping system cost down. And so it sort of allows the head space (30:52) to fund innovation in the system. So again, having said this, this is a highly political issue, it's a highly personal issue. No doubt companies are looking at the environment very carefully, watching the public discourse and public debate on this and I'll just assume that that's going to influence the way they think about the environment. But it's really hard to predict exactly how any company is going to respond to that. But it certainly it's very much in the news. Mike, I don't know if you want to add in terms of...","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the only thing I would add is, remember that over 80% of the fees that we get on branded manufacturers are on the fee-for-service model, so, inflation actually doesn't matter on over 80% of the fees. So, on the portion where it does matter, we always have the option to work with those manufacturers to adjust those agreements. So if we're expecting a certain inflation rate with those suppliers and that inflation rate starts to drop, we will go back and work with those manufacturers to adjust those agreements to be able to make sure that we're earning the fees that we deserve with the services that we provide, because we still see what we do as incredibly valuable. They still see it as incredibly valuable. So there is definitely ways for us to continue to manage in an environment even if inflation rates were to moderate on branded products.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my follow-up relates to the EBIT margin for drug distribution. So, Mike, even when ex the fact the (32:25) generic benefit that you highlighted is one-time, we've seen some pretty meaningful expansion improved (32:30) year-over-year. I think we calculate about 33 basis points year-over-year if you exclude that generic benefit and also a benefit quarter-to-quarter I think. So can you just help us maybe sort it through it, I mean how did Harvard Drug maybe perform and how did they contribute on a sequential basis because what I'm thinking what was three months in this quarter versus last quarter? So if you can just help us understand the moving parts that helped drive that margin expansion?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. It's going to be hard for me to get into a lot of details there, Ricky. It's really what I was saying. It's really strong performance on our overall generics program. Obviously, Red Oak is an important piece of that, but also our customer mix, our ability to execute on launches, pricing, all the other components that make up our generic program. I will tell you that it wasn't generic inflation that was a driver in the quarter. That moderated as we said that it would moderate. And so, generic inflation was not really a driver.","Clearly, Harvard was also a component of our margin improvement, so generally \u2013 those are the two biggest as I've said before, but we have a lot of other things going on. We're highly efficient. We continue to drive efficiencies in our business, which is something that we will always do. We're a distribution company. So, we're never going to lose sight of that in our Pharma side in many components of our business. So, we'll always focus on efficiencies too.","Operator","The next question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Co.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Sorry I missed the first couple of minutes here. But when you guys talked about the guidance here, can you talk about what your assumptions are for in terms of timing for acquisitions by CVS such as like Target and Omnicare?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We really can't comment specifically on any of the acquisitions. The only thing I can say is what we've said before is that that's a decision CVS is going to have to make on where the branded distribution will go, but remember, all of the generics on those businesses as CVS has noted are going to go through Red Oak. And so, really that's the only piece to keep in mind.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Charles, we didn't build anything in. We don't have complete line of sight on transition timing. So that's really with CVS Health right now. So, we did not build anything in as it relates to additional value from the generic component, Red Oak component on those deals.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","So the Red Oak component is in there in the guidance, but the branded side for Target, that is not in the guidance just to be clear, right?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Just to be clear none of the branded volume is in our guidance or projections of revenue growth going forward.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","Good morning, guys. Maybe on the Medical side of your business, your guidance previously assumed a ramp in the medical partly from the launch of new and also the expansion of various product lines midway through your fiscal year. So was there anything that went ahead of schedule this quarter? And if it didn't, can you just update us as where you are regarding the timing?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I wouldn't say anything really was ahead of schedule. It was just a little bit better performance in several different areas across Medical. So our Cardinal Health branded products did a little better than we expected. They did some great work focusing on efficiencies and SG&A and the kind of dilutive impact that we've been talking about on the national brand products wasn't as great as we expected it to be in the quarter. So all those areas, good management over those three areas were really the key drivers.","Garen Sarafian - Citi Investment Research","Got it. And then maybe switching over to capital deployment and share buybacks. I thought last quarter you mentioned how you pulled in, I think it was $300 million or $400 million to buy back shares when it was around $88 a share. And you sounded pretty opportunistic in terms of buying back more. So today's $2 million lower share count sort of what you were thinking of or is there still more of an appetite to do opportunistic buybacks of shares that are around the same price range or if they reached certain thresholds? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. You're right. We did accelerate our share repurchases from this year into Q4 of last year. It was about $350 million of share repurchases that we did in the fourth quarter that we typically might have done this year. At this point in time, clearly, share repurchases are something that we will consider. Number one for us is going to be, continue to invest back in the business and we've said we would spend about $510 million to $540 million this year in capital expenditures, and we're still looking at that. We will also continue to have our differentiated dividend, and as always we're going to look at M&A and stock repurchases as opportunities. And so, there is \u2013 that's clearly on the table and something that we'll continue to look at for the rest of the year.","Operator","Next will be Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning. George, I just want to go back to your comments when you talked about the shift to value based care. And obviously looking at the legislation or what CMS is doing, they're talking about hips and knees and you're talking more about cardiovascular. So I guess my question is really two parts. One, do you expect that we're going to see cardiovascular shifting in the same kind of payment methodology in the near-term? And then secondly, has Cardinal thought about your hip and knee programs and things like that you could do to have more of a private label in some of those products?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Lisa. So let me do first generally the prospective on the bundled payment program. I think it is reasonable to assume that, again with the caveat that this is early stage, that this directionally is an area that's on CMS' mind. And so, it wouldn't be right for me to predict which therapeutic areas or which procedures are necessarily going to come under bundled program. But I think it's fairly easy to imagine that the discussions in CMS are looking at a number of areas. So, we feel like the tools that we've begun to build here are valuable and will have sort of transferrable value. As it relates to the specific product lines and the specific joints in hip and knees, obviously as orthopedics is an area we've begun to move on, has an interesting characteristics.","We are beginning to expand our program there. I don't really at this stage want to go into specific details about which product lines, but we do believe, as we have felt it in cardiovascular, there are opportunities to bring both the product and the service components to the market and for providers who may be living under a different payment model. Those value drivers that we create are actually even more important, that ability to help them manage that patient, the cost of the procedure, the controls in the OR or in the surgical suite and management of the inventory and even watching for that patient post-acute, those are things that I think are going to matter and we're devoting energy to those things.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so, George, when you think about \u2013 you are just putting all those tools in place to help the hospital manage, that process as we move to fee for value versus taking on and maybe I'm wrong here, but thinking about Cardinal taking on some level of risk around that patient in the future, is that correct?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I don't think, Lisa, I'd get into the question of exactly what model will be used as this unfolds. I think there is a lot of discussion around this system, around risk models and who bears the risk, and I think that it's very early in that process. We are developing I think tools that allow us to compete in any environment, whether environment looks a little bit more traditional or starts to evolve to some kind of shared risk model. So I think we're open minded, but building capabilities that I think are very important going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Mike, you had mentioned in your comments that the margin in the Pharma segment would see some pressure. Can you just quantify that a little bit? It was very strong in the quarter. Can we assume that the margin percent will be up year-over-year or perhaps not?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","It's hard to say for the whole year. I'm not going to give specific guidance for the year. But I would tell you that we felt obviously great about the first quarter. But I just wanted to make sure that I gave you guys a little color around just to remind you the stuff that we have been talking about and you guys have asked questions about in the past around the hep C drugs. Those will continue as they grow. They are much lower margin rates, so they are dilutive to our overall margin rates.","But again, there is a right type of things to do. We still make money on them. They're just at lower margin rates and they're very capital efficient. Same way with some of our customer mix. We have some wins that we've had that will be lower margin rates than some of our other ones. But the capital efficiency on those is outstanding as well as our SG&A leverage on those. And so, over time I just want to remind is, it's a balance. We think there is things going in the positive for us on our margin rates, and there is some things on the other side. Just wanted to try to give you a balanced view.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. John, this is really \u2013 again, this is George. This is the mix phenomenon basically. So, the fact is that the products and the customers that have been building into the portfolio, this is all good news. But the mechanics as you look at the margin rates will have this dilutive impact, but to the corporation, to the benefit, to our shareholders of creating these opportunities I think we're like 74% (43:07).","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up. The very strong top line growth in the Pharma segment, could you give us any more specifics around what you view as the key drivers there? How much of that came from acquired businesses? Perhaps what sort of underlying unit growth you're seeing versus inflation? That'd be great. Thank you.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Couple of different things. I would say obviously brand inflation is a key driver of the overall top line growth. Second of all would be our wins in our new customer business. We also feel like we're aligned with some outstanding customers that are existing customers and that their growth is very strong in the marketplace and so that's important to us. And then probably the fourth benefit is some of the launches of the new drugs like the hep C drug is a new category of expensive drugs. And so that's going to be another component. So, that's probably roughly four things and then I would also add acquisitions will have our component of our top line growth with both Harvard and Metro Medical relatively new this year to our overall revenue stream.","Operator","Next will be Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So I think I'll extend on that last question, and this is for both George and Mike. As you think about \u2013 we've now gone through several generic ways. We have the generic inflation benefit. Has your business model become much more tied to revenue growth and absolute gross profit will be the focus and we should have less concern relative to gross margin and maybe more concern on op margin? Do you think there has been a shift in the business at this point?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start generally and then Mike, he can be more specific on this. So I think there is a dynamic that relates to revenues that as Mike said has to do with who you serve. So part of it is we feel very good about our customer mix. There is also again a dynamic that we know relates to the pickup of some new business. So these are all sort of year-over-year contributors. As it relates to the top line being a better, which is I think what you're asking, is it a better measure than it once was given some of the dynamics. I think it's always a little bit tricky given that just the very nature of having generics in the marketplace.","So at any given moment of products that those from branded generic is going to change the revenue line and so I guess we always give the caution that in Pharmaceuticals, the revenue line is influenced by the shift from branded generic. Yes, it's true there were probably fewer launches than they were in 2008, but it's still a phenomenon that affects that number. We really are focused internally on every internal measure that we can have that indicates improvement of efficiency and productivity and customer positioning. So ultimately the way that flows for you frankly is the margin of the corporation growing. And the margin rate will be affected by some of these mix issues we talked about. But really internally, we're always looking at the individual components that drive margin and that are indicators of productivity.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I would just \u2013 I totally agree with George. I think revenue is a little tricky to say is a key driver. It's always going to be something we look at. Clearly, it's been important to us. The only thing I probably add is that when you have a large revenue base like we do and we have some of these acquisitions that we have that are at much higher margin rates whether it be in P or M, you cannot see significant revenue growth, but we're able to add gross margin dollars in operating income to the bottom line. So, again, revenue is just a tricky indicator, something to consider, but there is so many other components between efficiency, growing margin rates, mix, generics, sourcing, et cetera, that are drivers that you got to look at a large group of things.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And maybe the follow-up on that more specific to this quarter. You've mentioned Red Oak and the contribution now versus a year ago. Should we think of Red Oak as currently up and running? We know you've made the additional milestone. And when we look back to last year, is a relatively low contribution. How should we think about how that ramped up over the following three quarters, and what that does to your comparison moving off from here?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You're right. So the first quarter of last year, there was very little Red Oak benefit because that was our start-up quarter. And then Red Oak really ramped faster than we expected. The team just did an excellent job in our \u2013 which would have been our quarter two of really getting after all of the synergies and working with the manufacturers to sync up all of our purchasing agreements. And so, Red Oak has ramped up nicely in the back part of last year. As we've said in the past, we continue to believe that Red Oak will be a tailwind for us, and that it will continue to have upside. But clearly, this is probably going to be the quarter, where we're going to have the biggest year-over-year benefit just because it was essentially a start-up quarter last year.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","Your next question is from David Larsen with Leerink Partners.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Congratulations on a very good quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about naviHealth? And what sort of incremental in-sell opportunity is there into your hospital base and what value could this bring to your existing hospital customers? And how will you tie this into your overall sort of analytics platform that you provide to your IDN clients? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good morning, David. Yeah, we're excited about this new business. We think that again if you follow what's happening both in the public and the private sector as it relates to the attention devoted to particularly post-acute and how we mange patients in a post-acute setting, naviHealth provides us just great analytical tools. Know-how and actually field-based people that are helpful in managing the discharge and the patient follow-up.","So I think if you are sitting in the seat of an IDN or health system now and there is increasing attention on how you will manage those patients and how you will be responsible for those patients post-acute, I think that our value proposition with naviHealth and with the other tools that we have at Home, our pharmacy, medication therapy management, those really are an interesting combination of things. Hospitals are extremely interested right now in what we have and what naviHealth brings. And I think it's changing some of our conversations in a very positive way.","Just as a reminder, there are two components to the business, one that is sort of serving the payer side as well as the provider side. So I just want to make sure I highlight that. But I would say that it is changing the discussion with many of our customers who recognize this as an emerging area of attention and one where we can provide some value.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then Mike, did I hear you correctly that excluding CareFusion and currency, the operating income in Medical would have increased year-over-year this quarter? And can we assume that to be true for next quarter as well excluding the inventory step-up charge?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","So, yeah. Segment profit for the Medical segment would have been up year-over-year if you'd excluded the prior year CareFusion one-time payment as well as foreign currency unfavorability that we experienced in the quarter. So the Medical segment would have been up. As far as go forward quarters, I can't speak specifically by quarter on how Medical is going to do, but I will tell you that the Cordis step-up, we do expect to impact Q2 and Q3 for the Medical segment. And we've mentioned that before that we thought it would take roughly two quarters that that $0.13 to $0.15 would be essentially amortized over. And then by our fourth quarter, you would see that essentially go away, and you'd see strong performance from Cordis in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Next will be Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, George, and Mike.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","So I guess for me just a couple of additional questions on the brand inflation. And maybe first, just to try to better frame this, given that your antenna along with everybody's is obviously up now and just the potential for brand inflation to decelerate by let's say several percentage points in calendar 2016 versus the trend we're seeing in calendar 2015. Should we just assume this is something that would be more than absorbable within your $0.20 guidance range for fiscal 2016? And also Mike, when you said that you can go back to brand manufacturers and adjust the terms of fee-for-service contracts, are you talking, let's essentially in real time in a given quarter or is this more something that would have to be done at the end of the duration of an existing fee-for-service contract with the manufacturer? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So first of all, any deceleration that we might be assuming in our \u2013 for branded inflation rates in our Q2 through Q4 has been included in our current guidance range that we gave you. So we do expect \u2013 we still expect brand inflation to still be about what we saw last year. So, we're not necessarily assuming branded inflation will decelerate. As far as generic side, we still continue to believe that it will moderate versus the prior year. But on branded, we're still expecting it to be very similar to the prior year.","On the DSAs, you're right, we would have to wait till contract and typically with the manufacturers to adjust those rates. But remember we look at each manufacturer differently. So when you think about branded inflation, on many of the vendors, the branded inflation doesn't matter, because they're 100% fee-for-service. And so the inflation rates that are really most important to us are the inflation rates on the suppliers that are the ones where we have contingent margin on those.","And so as you can imagine, we talk to those suppliers quite often. We try to understand their point of view on inflation and we try to be proactive at managing those agreements if we think that we're hearing things that are going to change. So, to your point, it would be hard to change immediately, we would have to wait till the end of the contract. But over any long period of time, decelerating inflation in branded is not something that I wake up and worry about every day.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's perfect. Okay, all right. Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","We'll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I just want to get into the weeds just briefly on naviHealth. Is there a template for post-acute bundling that you are implicitly putting your models on or is it \u2013 how would you \u2013 how does this business model work under the various type of aggregator models?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good morning, John. It's George. I probably won't get into excruciating detail here or the weeds as you'd like. So again, we have two essentially customers in the naviHealth business. One is the providers, and one is the payers, and each of those contracts is different. But essentially what we are doing, the value proposition is to help them manage the optimal site of care for patients post discharge.","Today, again, we are \u2013 this is very, very new, so again, we're not broadening that line in other ways. We're basically using the model as naviHealth exists. What we are doing is sort of combining this with other tools that we bring in post-discharge management through Cardinal Health at Home and through our medication therapy management. But it really has two components to it, and one as a provider to \u2013 or support business (55:47) provider and one to the payer.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","Dave K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning. I'll add my congratulations as well. George, kind of bigger picture question as you look at some of the consolidation throughout different points of the supply chain right now. Can you kind of talk about your view of all that activity and characterize where you see Cardinal Health sitting today? And any kind of other strategic moves that you guys might need to make to kind of jive with the different movements in the market? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good morning, thanks. Yeah. And look at \u2013 as I said in my prepared remarks, it's been a pretty dynamic environment. And we feel really well positioned. We have scale, we've got reach, we've got tools that I think they are valuable today, but their value in some of these emerging \u2013 with these emerging trends and forces. We've seen consolidation in virtually every part of healthcare. And as I said earlier, I think it's a response to some fairly powerful forces.","We could debate the logic of any individual move that a company does, but it's clearly a chessboard that's been moving. We feel very well positioned to compete given some of the changes in the system. And we've been fortunate in that some of them that have been beneficial to us and some are neutral, but by and large, I think that we've been preparing ourselves over these last seven years for some of these forces, and it's certainly not hard to anticipate that we'd see continued consolidation. And we've seen it really along every subset of the healthcare continuum.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess Mike, just kind of a technical question to start. With the fee-for-service arrangements on the branded side, are most of Cardinal's fee-for-service agreements hard dollar or are they WACC-based? And I ask that because then are they \u2013 basically are they kind of inflation insensitive is the way I'm thinking about it?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Well, they're percentage fee-based type agreements. They're typically not fixed dollar agreements. They vary by manufacturer, but so they can be different. Some have score-carding components to it where you earn more if you perform at certain levels, some are more flat. They're all across the board, but generally their base is a percentage of the cost of the products and that's how they work.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then I guess either from Mike or George, I guess can you talk about how the rolling of the Omnicare business and the Target business into Red Oak impacts your economics? And maybe if you can, I understand there is a much history to look at, but I guess can you talk about how you're thinking about that and how \u2013 as Red Oak grows? If there is anything you can give us around kind of sense of severity around how much better Cardinal's purchasing economics get. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good morning. This really one that's hard to answer. Here's that I would say, we know that in generics, scale matters, global knowledge matters and know-how. And so to the extent that our business grows from the growth of Cardinal Health and from the growth of CVS Health in bringing more generic products to Red Oak, I think that's only a good thing for us. I think it allow us to do a great work for manufacturers in moving their markets. It allows us to provide great value to customers. But quantifying that or giving you exact picture of how those specific deals impact us would be difficult to do.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks very much. First off, just a housekeeping item, if I missed it, I apologize. Could you possibly give us the organic and actual growth for both the China operation as well as Specialty?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Well, from Specialty standpoint, we told you that we did a little bit of over $5 billion for FY 2015 and that we expect it to be over $8 billion in FY 2016 in terms of revenue, so strong growth in Specialty. And then in China, we do continue to expect that business to continue to grow in double digits.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Grow double digits. And then my follow-up, just shifting gears quickly. Medical, I didn't catch you mentioning anything about manufacturer price increases or any special situations in the quarter. Your largest U.S. competitor in acute care did mention and has actually mentioned for three of the last five quarters, some unexpected benefits from manufacturer price increases. I'm curious if you could give us your views on that and if you also had any similar benefits. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think a part of that could be a mix between their business and our business. It was not a driver for us in the quarter at all, and so again, this doesn't mean it couldn't be for them. It may just be the timing and maybe mix, but for us, inflation on medical surgical products was not a driver for our quarter.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Bob Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I actually jumped on late, but also to Eric's question on China, any potential for the one child rule being abandoned there? I guess it's 2 million more births a year. Do you see yourself as positioned for any step-up in healthcare consumption there?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not tomorrow.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Nine months?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It is the gestation period. Look, I think just broadly on China, because we didn't get a chance to talk about it much today. We still feel very excited about being positioned there. Obviously, China is going through some unique dynamics, certainly affecting the industrial sectors a bit more than the service and healthcare sectors. But I think in general, we talk about lifestyle changes, we'd now talk about an increased population about, Bob.","And I think continue over time, it's hard to imagine that we're not going to see this as a growth environment. We should probably acknowledge there was a little bit of FX issue in China naturally, but again to the overall picture of us, not a material impact. So, we like the positioning there and we think long-term, we'll see a growing middle class, are going to come through this difficult stage. We'll see a larger population and we're happy to be positioned there.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","And are you involved heavily in diagnostics there at this point, George?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not particularly. No. We do a little bit of lab supplies, but I would say it's a very small component for us.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Good morning, everyone and thanks to all of you for joining us. Allow me to start by being direct. Our first quarter of fiscal 2017 certainly had its share of challenges, but it came in much as we suggested to you that it would, with healthy and growing revenues up 14% versus the prior year and non-GAAP operating earnings down 9% versus the first quarter of last year. I will focus my commentary on the broad outlook for our business and our future and Mike will walk you through our financials for the quarter with more detail and specificity.","Let me frame the start to our fiscal year with two lenses: one, the operating performance of our integrated business lines and the other, the environment in which we compete. Our teams continue to demonstrate their commitment to strong operating performance. Our service levels are extremely high. We are experiencing very high rates of customer retention. And our enterprise-wide customer reach is expanding, including the on-boarding of some very strategically important customers in the med segment. We also continue to launch new products and service offerings, increasing our value to our customers as they navigate significant change in the industry. And as is embedded in our DNA, we are taking a disciplined and determined approach to managing our working capital. But make no mistake this is a very challenging near-term environment. This is particularly true for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business.","The public discourse around drug pricing has at least for the moment had a significant impact on the way pharmaceutical companies are pricing their products on both the branded and generic side. Combining this with limited generic product launches and significant reimbursement pressure on our customers, the competitive intensity has increased. As a result, price erosion during the period has been more pronounced than it has been in quite sometime for our industry.","Our commitment has been and will continue to be to providing world class service, tools, technology and solutions to help our customers thrive in a challenging environment and better serve their patients. This is central to our value proposition. At the same time that our retail pharmacy customers are experiencing unique dynamics, we are also working closely with our large integrated system customers to help them adapt to a changing environment. One more pressures to be efficient or relentless were the configuration of their own businesses and portfolios are more complex and where the need to operate across their own internal boundaries is a high priority. As a result, the historically siloed or departmentally driven operating model is evolving to one that places a premium on operating coordination across the system and strategic alignment with other healthcare players who can enable their strategies. This is who we are. Our focus is on finding more efficient and effective ways to create real value for our customers across our lines of business.","Today, our customers look to us for our integrated solutions to help them reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve quality. All of this requires deep, multidisciplinary healthcare expertise and real strategic partnership, which we deliver everyday for those we serve. These are the characteristics at the moment, some very encouraging, others creating short-term headwinds. Of course, I would like some of that to be different, but this is the environment in which we must compete now. We will play for the long game, with a strategic eye in the future, mobilizing the best talent and building the right lines of business to help our customers compete in this changing world. With this as backdrop and modeling in and adjusted for the current pricing environment, we are slightly lowering our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.60 from our prior range of $5.48 to $5.73. Let me be clear. We remain committed to navigating today\u2019s challenges, embracing tomorrow\u2019s opportunities for our customers and shareholders.","Within our Pharmaceutical segment, revenue was up 14% versus the prior year to $28.8 billion and segment profit declined 19% versus the prior year to $534 million. This was primarily driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing, reduced levels of branded inflation and the loss of Safeway, which we previously discussed. However, the work that we have done over the past few years has strategically positioned us to more effectively support our customers. The range of our retail service offering has never been stronger and the Red Oak Sourcing venture with CVS Health continues to be an effective, productive and profitable partnership. We see this as a long-term driver of value for us and our customers.","Our Specialty Solutions group continues to perform well driven by both our provider facing and biopharma offerings, once again showing strong double-digit growth. We are confident that our growing portfolio of services is well-aligned with and valuable to the strategies of our biopharmaceutical partners. I want to thank Jon Giacomin and his Pharma segment team for their commitment to navigating these challenging dynamics and remaining focused on our customers with a clear eye towards managing efficiency.","Our Medical segment had a strong first quarter across multiple dimensions. First, revenues for the Medical segment were up 12% versus the prior year to $3.3 billion. Second, segment profit was up 26% versus the prior year to $127 million. And third, our Medical segment customer base has been expanding, a testament to the value we created across our lines of business and the strong partnerships we have developed with our customers. Everyday, we serve customers focusing more on the total care of the patient and they recognize the growing shift to value-based reimbursement models. Discussions with our customers reinforce that they are looking to us as a broad-based integrated solutions provider and a source of expertise across the continuum of care.","Our Cardinal Health brand of products continue to be a driver of growth for this segment as we increase our account penetration and growth in our strategic accounts is outpacing the market. During the quarter, we on-boarded a large complex customer in our medical segment. We learned a lot from this rapid deployment and we are very grateful both to our employees and to our new partner for working together to move us towards the finish line.","October 2 marked the year since we closed the Cordis acquisition. Don Casey and his team have done a tremendous job leading the integration thoughtfully phasing in new systems and processes and building out an important platform. The integration of Cordis has proved to be an excellent example of how we can bring together best practices across borders. We have seen over this past year that taking the time to do things right is essential to best serve our customers. We have also seen growth in some important markets, including Europe where we believe that taking an integrated cohesive approach to our customers will position us for a measurable growth over the long-term. Cordis is also providing us with additional partnership opportunities to at our products, tools and services. As an example, we have signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Biosensors to bring their coronary interventional products to our customers in Europe and Japan as another offering in the bag to deliver even greater value.","While we are operating today in a tough and unique environment, we believe that we are well prepared to lead and quick to adapt by working with our customers holistically, driving our own efficiencies and delivering integrated effective solutions, we have developed strong partnerships with our customers. We remain committed to focusing our product lines and capabilities around the patient to position ourselves to capitalize on the changes in our industry. And to the collective drive and dedication of our 37,000 people, we will continue to deliver meaningful results and measurable growth for our customers, patients and shareholders.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mike for a detailed review of the financials. Mike?","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks George and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today to discuss the first quarter. I would like to begin by reviewing our first quarter financial performance and then walk through our full year fiscal 2017 expectations. Please note that with all of my comments, I will begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figures. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.","Our first quarter fiscal 2017 results were about as we expected, with GAAP diluted EPS at $0.96 and non-GAAP EPS at $1.24, a 17% and 10% decrease, respectively. In our August call, I mentioned this would be due to some challenging trends and some tough year-over-year comps, particularly on some key generic items in our Pharmaceutical segment, as well as discrete tax items, partially offset by strong performance in the Medical segment and that\u2019s largely what we saw. I will discuss both segments in greater detail later, but let me start with the consolidated company results. Revenues increased 14% year-over-year, totaling $32 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 1% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, primarily driven by strategic acquisitions. If you exclude acquisitions, SG&A was favorable for the quarter. Both consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined versus the prior year by 14% and 9%, respectively.","Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense was approximately $41 million in the quarter, a decrease versus the prior year. The GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.3%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate this quarter was 36.4%, which is 3.5 percentage points higher on a comparative basis, primarily due to several favorable discrete items that occurred in last year\u2019s first quarter. We continued to expect our full year non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35% and 37%. Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 322 million, about 9 million shares fewer than the first quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due to the benefit from our opportunistic share repurchases over the last 12 months, which includes $250 million of share repurchases in the first quarter. We have just under $800 million remaining on our Board authorized share repurchase program. In addition, we generated approximately $104 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. And due to efficient and effective working capital management by our teams, we ended September 30 with a strong balance sheet. Our cash balance including short-term investments was $2.2 billion, of which $622 million were held internationally.","Now let\u2019s move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 14% to $28.8 billion. This increase was from growth in net new and existing pharmaceutical distribution customers, driven mainly by the win of a previously announced large mail order customer and the impact of branded inflation. While a smaller driver, the strong performance of our specialty business also drove the revenue increase. Despite the revenue growth, segment profit for the quarter decreased 19% to $534 million. This decrease was a result of generic pharmaceutical pricing and to a lesser extent, reduced levels of branded inflation, as well as the previously announced loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing.","These same factors, as well as changes in our product and customer mix, mainly the on-boarding of a previously discussed large mail order customer, reduced our segment profit rate by 76 basis points to 1.86%. As a reminder, next quarter, we will fully lap the on-boarding of this large mail order customer. Getting back to Red Oak, as we have mentioned in the past, if it achieved certain milestones, it would trigger the second of two predetermined payments beginning in FY \u201817. Because of excellent performance, Red Oak met these milestones, so we have made our second and final $10 million increase to the quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment is $45.6 million for the remaining 8 years of the agreement.","Let\u2019s now go to Medical segment performance, which had a strong first quarter. Revenues for the quarter grew 12% to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by contributions from our strategic acquisitions and growth from net new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 26% to $127 million during the quarter due to contributions from acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products. Segment profit margin rate increased 42 basis points in the quarter to 3.87%, driven by acquisitions and Cardinal Health brand products, partially offset by the change in customer mix. This change primarily comes from the accelerated on-boarding of a new large medical distribution customer.","The recent wins in the Medical segment on the distribution side are exciting and very important. They add to our profitability, but are dilutive to our Medical segment margin rates. Specific to Cordis, it continues to meet our performance expectations and make real and measurable progress. As we mentioned last quarter, our integration team is on track to have our operations fully stood up and exit the TSA agreements by the end of this fiscal year, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple of years. Until we exit these TSAs, they can create some variability in our segment profit rate, although this quarter, it was about on track. Overall, our team has done an outstanding job driving strong, healthy growth in the Medical segment.","Before moving to our fiscal year \u201817 outlook, you can turn to Slide #7 where you will see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter. The $0.28 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition related costs. Next, I would like to discuss our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance range and assumptions. But before doing that, let me comment on Q2. While we don\u2019t typically provide quarterly guidance, we want to keep you informed when there are meaningful shifts. So as it relates to the second quarter, the generic pricing environment and to a lesser extent, the brand inflation rates lead us to now expect the second quarter fiscal 2017 Pharma segment profit decline to be relatively in line with the first quarter on a percentage basis.","Now you can follow along, starting on Slide 9 of the presentation. As George mentioned earlier, based on Q1 actuals, second quarter expectations and trends we noted, we are slightly lowering our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range we provided in August to $5.40 to $5.60 from $5.48 to $5.73. Let me give you some color around this adjustment by walking through our corporate and segment assumptions. Turning to Slide 10, all but two of our fiscal year 2017 corporate assumptions remain unchanged. First, we have updated our weighted average shares outstanding assumption to 320 million to 322 million shares, which is lower than the initial range provided of 324 million to 326 million shares. This new range reflects potential additional repurchases. Second, our assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization increased to approximately $385 million or about $0.79 per share that does not affect our non-GAAP earnings.","On Slide 11, there are three updates to our full year Pharmaceutical segment assumptions that I would like to take a minute to highlight. First, we have previously expected Pharma segment profit for FY \u201817 to be essentially flat. We now expect full year segment profit to be down mid to high single-digits versus the prior year due to the generic pharmaceutical pricing environment and while much less of an impact lower than anticipated brand pharmaceutical inflation. To clarify, when we refer to generic drug pricing, we are referring to a combination of all factors affecting generic selling price, such as manufacturer inflation and deflation and customer pricing. We now expect this to be in the mid to high single-digit deflation for the full fiscal year. Lastly, we have adjusted our brand manufacturer inflation assumptions to a range of 7% to 9% from approximately 10%. Overall, we still expect Pharma segment profit to be back half weighted.","Now, turning to the Medical segment, all of our fiscal year 2017 Medical segment assumptions remain on target and unchanged. We are still on track to achieve mid single-digit percentage growth in revenue and double-digit growth in segment profit.","Now, turning back to overall company guidance. Since we are slightly lowering our overall fiscal 2017 earnings guidance range to 3% to 7% growth from 5% to 9% growth versus the prior year, we have updated some of our original assumptions to achieve that growth on Slide 13. The line titled Business Growth is now assumed to be flat to 3% and capital deployment is now assumed to contribute 3% to 4% for the year. From a corporate standpoint, we are focused on expense management and other actions to achieve these results. Keep in mind that the benefits related to these important items are held at the corporate level and not reflected at the segment level. And while we aren\u2019t providing the EPS bridge slide we presented on our August Q4 call, you can infer that based on my comments about the generic pricing environment being more challenging, it would result in a decrease to that line item, while increasing our capital deployment assumptions would result in an increase to that line item. Net customer activity remains about the same, but our existing or remaining businesses bucket would increase as it includes the corporate actions I just referenced.","Additionally, we told you on our fourth quarter call that we were assessing the timing of the adoption of new accounting treatment for the tax effect of share-based compensation. Our 2017 guidance does not include this as we believe it is simpler to adopt the new treatment in our first quarter of fiscal 2018 according to the required schedule. So, as you can see, we have now aligned our guidance range given the current pricing environment I just described.","To close, let me highlight a few key points before I turn to your questions. First, while we are experiencing a tough near-term environment, we continued to aspire to the long-term goals we communicated before. In our Pharmaceutical segment, we do see generic pharmaceutical pricing, and to a lesser extent, branded inflation as challenges. However, we continue to see strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, continued focus on operational excellence and positive feedback from our robust customer base. In addition, Harvard Drug, Specialty and Nuclear are all delivering value for our customers and our business. On the Medical side, we have also won some important new medical distribution customers, which should help us gain scale and sourcing and leverage our cost structure to create greater efficiencies. In addition, we continue to see strong growth in our Cardinal Health brand products and services and above market revenue growth in Cardinal Health at home. Finally, Cordis continues to perform well and we are confident in both the fundamental and growth initiatives in that business.","Overall, it was a challenging quarter, but I want to acknowledge our team for their strong execution and focus in a tough environment. I believe this excellent execution and focus, combined with our broad portfolio and balanced capital deployment, will allow us to drive long-term sustainable growth.","And with that, operator, let\u2019s begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Jones","Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions.","George Barrett","Good morning.","Bob Jones","Good morning. George, you talked about the moderation in the pricing environment, but I think your comment seems largely focused on the buy side part of the business. I have just obviously want to get your views on the sell-side side of the business given your peer last week talked about more aggressive pricing in the retail independent channels? So, I just wanted to see what you are seeing there currently?","George Barrett","Hi, Bob. Good morning. Yes, actually my comments really were about the overall pricing environment. So, I was talking about sell side as well. And here is my perspective, there are, as I mentioned, number of factors coming together to make this a bit of a unique moment. So, we are not going to overreact to that moment. Our position, our plans for growth really aren\u2019t different than today than they were 6 months ago. Our value proposition is very clear. We are an extraordinary attentive partner to our customers. We have a unique ability to follow the patient across the continuum of care. The service offerings are extensive, that\u2019s what is part of our positioning. So, that\u2019s I think important to stay upfront. But no, I think we are describing some similar characteristics to what you described.","Bob Jones","Okay, great. And then I guess, Mike, if I could just go over to the guidance. Overall, it looks like the range is coming down by $0.11 at the midpoint. You talked a lot about generic inflation getting a little bit worse than previously thought and then modestly less branded inflation. But if I look at the guidance for the Pharma segment specifically, it seems like that take down in what you are assuming around profit margins there or overall profits there, mid to high single-digits, would actually indicate something more in the $0.25 to $0.40 headwind. So just trying to square those two things relative to the overall amount coming down compared to what you are suggesting is going on with the Pharma segment for the rest of the year?","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks Bob. Let me hit a few different things. I think, first of all, just to be clear, when we talked \u2013 when I was talking about generic pharmaceutical pricing, I wasn\u2019t really talking about the headwind tailwind you used to hear over the last couple of years of inflation and deflation on generic products, because that\u2019s about where we model it to be this year. We are not really seeing that. We expected it to be a net deflation environment and that\u2019s what we are seeing. So, that\u2019s not really the driver. What we are talking about is more the downstream pricing component of our generic pricing. That\u2019s where we are seeing the uptick in competitiveness or a little more erosion than we had expected to be, and that\u2019s really is the main driver of us taking down our Pharmaceutical Distribution numbers.","As I mentioned a couple of times, to a lesser extent, brand inflation. So, we have said about 10% before on brand inflation. We are now modeling in the 7% to 9%. That impact, I guess I will put it this way. If that were the only thing going on this year, then it wouldn\u2019t probably be adjusting guidance. It\u2019s more the combination of the generic pricing and then that on top of that. But I think that\u2019s the first thing I want to say. The second thing, I can understand why you maybe have a little trouble with your numbers. I can\u2019t quote exactly or comment on exactly what the number should be. But remember, I did make a comment in here that we have some significant initiatives around expenses and other initiatives that will be captured in our corporate numbers. And so those aren\u2019t going to show up in the segment numbers, because we don\u2019t push those down at the end of the year, so probably the piece that you are missing as you try to reconcile having Pharma down, capital deployment up, midpoint down, the last bucket that you are missing is that the corporate numbers we are going to have savings there that will be in the overall corporate bucket.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. ","Sally Curley","Hi, Charles.","George Barrett","Hello.","Sally Curley","You may need to take your phone off mute.","Operator","Hearing no response.","Sally Curley","Hey, operator, yes let\u2019s go back to Cowen if they get back in queue. Let\u2019s go to the next.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian","Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. So Mike and George, you guys just commented a little bit on the downstream, the sell side dynamics, but on the independent front, you guys aren\u2019t as active as some of your peers, so just wondering, what specific segments are you seeing that and if you can you just give a little bit more flavor as to sort of the more recent trends into this month as to sort of the dynamics and how they are trending, that would be great?","George Barrett","Garen, good morning, let me start and then Mike jump in. Actually, we have a very strong position with independents and have for quite some years. So the dynamic Mike described, we are seeing in that segment. So I don\u2019t have to add to that. Mike, anything?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. I mean we have a lot of programs, services. We continue to stay very, very focused on that bunch of customers. We continued to have very high retention rates. And so we feel really good about where we are positioned in the generic independent space.","Garen Sarafian","Okay. I guess do you sort of \u2013 are you seeing that in other segments other than just the independents or sort of the [indiscernible] kind of lead to or is it still just focused specifically and only on that segment?","George Barrett","Let me try. I think it\u2019s probably been the most intense there. We often have to deal on it. This is sort of a normal thing with re-pricing of contracts. Thankfully, as you know, we have not had a lot of big contracts up for renewal. But I think it has been a distinctly noteworthy environment in independents, would you say, Mike?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. I would totally agree with that. And I think you have to think about the way contracts are written and just certain customers contracts are written in ways that the generic pricing or the way it works is one way in the other areas, it\u2019s much more competitive for they haven\u2019t committed to buy all their generics and so they are constantly shopping them and that\u2019s where you are going to see and that\u2019s typically in independent space. And that\u2019s where you are going to see some more of these competitive pressures.","Garen Sarafian","Okay, that\u2019s useful. And then I just have a follow-up, on the upstream, on the branded inflation side with the branded manufacturers, the moderating inflation has been sort of a fact that has been discussed in prior quarters and I thought that at some point, there was an opportunity to go back to the branded manufacturers and sort to readjust and realign the contract so it benefits all, so I am wondering have you done that in between contracts yet or is it sort of still waiting until the contract renews where those conversations come up again? And I will stop...","George Barrett","Yes. Thanks. Good questions. And I would say that\u2019s really kind of across the board. It just depends on the individual manufacturer. As you know, about 15% of our branded margins are based on a contingent basis, which means that generic or a branded inflation is a piece of the driver of the value that we receive. And every one of those where we are not getting the value that we believe we should be compensated for the services that we deliver. We are having discussions with the manufacturers. Some of those are going to move quicker than others depending on contract date and based on prior discussions with those manufacturers on how those deals will arrive. And so you can imagine with every manufacturer where we believe we are being compensated less than we should have been or should be we are working with those manufacturers.","Sally Curley","Next question.","Operator","We now have Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Yes. Sorry about that earlier. Yes. Thanks George. You were talking in also your comments about \u2013 sorry, Mike, you were talking about your comments making the second payment to CVS as related to Red Oak, how much \u2013 can you kind of help us understand how much more of a benefit do you think you are getting right now this year on your generic procurement and how much of a benefit can we anticipate that we should get the rest of this year. And I guess the point I am trying to get at is, you talked about your overall estimate on generic deflation, how much is this procurement benefit do you think is helping offset, because I think George, in relation to your earlier comment to Bob\u2019s question, you did kind of mentioned that you are starting or you are seeing a similar kind of characteristics in the market relative to comments from last week? Thanks.","George Barrett","Yes. I would say clearly, the number one offset to what we are seeing in the competitive pricing generics has been and should continue to probably be Red Oak Sourcing. I continued to be impressed with the team there, the depth of talent that we have on the team, the way they are looking at things, the creative ways they are working with manufacturing partners. And CVS Health couldn\u2019t be a better partner working together with us to drive value at Red Oak. So Red Oak would continue to be a positive driver for us when it comes to offsetting that.","Charles Rhyee","And then is there any other things that we can think about that can be offsets or \u2013 I guess the other way I would say it is, when you think about the impact that you are seeing potentially in the independents, does your guidance kind of extrapolate out potentially what that might look like throughout your entire book of business or are you only kind of anticipating what you are seeing currently? Thanks.","George Barrett","Yes. We have said that we have lots of different things. One of the things that I think is really helpful for Cardinal in general is our broad portfolio. So while we are seeing pressure from generic pricing and as I have said, to a lesser extent, branded inflation, when you look across the rest of the P segment, whether it would be how we are performing particularly in specialty, how we are getting in working through with Nuclear and some of our other components within that business, we continued to drive value in other areas. As you can imagine, when you are in a challenging environment like that, everyone, whether you are in P, M or corporate, is focused on expense control and making sure we are very diligent on those types of things. And so we have that benefit. As I mentioned, Medical is continuing to do very well. We expect them to have a very good year. And they are going \u2013 moving along as planned. And so I do think our broad portfolio of having Medical being able to drive some initiatives at a corporate level, which are going to show up at the end of the year, as well as some of the other parts of Pharma, are what we will be able to use. And using our balance sheet too, from a capital deployment standpoint through M&A and stock repo is how we are going to continue to manage the rest of the year.","Charles Rhyee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher","Thank you. I am going to return to the question of the independents and pricing, it feels like there is a pretty big difference in the magnitude of pressure that we see in your guidance as compared to one of your peers. And Mike, I know you have been willing to go into some of the mechanics on items like brand inflation in the past, if we think about the mechanics of independent contracting, could you tell us a little bit about how much of the book is truly small and mid-size customers versus larger buying groups of independents and do you see significant differences in those. And maybe the last part of that would be do you have any major contracts that may be coming up or how much \u2013 how important are those?","George Barrett","Yes. Let me try a couple of things and feel free to follow-up with another question if I miss it, but a couple of different things. First of all, I hate to ever comment on our competitors\u2019 numbers. Well, I just want to be careful with those. But remember, mix matters. And what I mean by mix is how much of their mix may be brand and generic versus our mix. If you look at the other components of our Pharmaceutical Distribution segment with our growth in specialty, nuclear and other things, so it\u2019s hard to comment on all the various moving parts of any of our competitors on what\u2019s in those segments. Second of all, I think you hit on something which is customer re-pricings and we didn\u2019t have very few \u2013 we have basically a very few major re-pricings this year and obviously, over the next couple of years, we don\u2019t have a ton of those. We are in pretty good shape, particularly with some of our larger customers. And I think that may be a different thing as where we are seeing some of our competitors may or may not have more large re-pricings with some of their customers, which can affect each one of us in different timing within the years. And so I think it really gets back to mix of customers, timing of re-pricings. And those types of things can drive differences between each one of us, as well as maybe the expectations that we originally set at the beginning of the year and how we looked at things.","Eric Percher","That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up would just be having exposure to telesales and Harvard, has that changed your insight into the market and\/or your exposure to the market?","George Barrett","Yes. I think in some ways, a little bit of both, because a lot of their sales are into the independent market. You can imagine we are seeing some competitive generic pricing against our telesales business, which obviously is a little bit of a headwind for that group. But on the flipside, because we do have so many contacts into the independent and the regional chain space with our telemarketing business, it gives us a lot of competitive intel on what market price is. And we stay very focused to try and make sure that we are pricing at that market price and not trying to do anything outside of that, because we believe we have a great service offering that we don\u2019t need to price below market in order to win and compete effectively.","Eric Percher","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. So, you guys compete on the pharma side, right and the industry structure primarily is an oligopoly, right? So for many years, we haven\u2019t seen these sorts of spurts of aggressive competitiveness. And obviously, it\u2019s a tough environment. But when you look back at prior periods and talk to folks in the organization have been looking at this longer than probably myself. What are the key telltale signs of sort of the end of that, right? So looking for, okay, we saw flare up, something happened and then behavior returned back to more normal. I mean, is it \u2013 and then, so one, what should we be looking forward to judge whether or not this is sort of temporal? And then secondarily, how do you ultimately go back to that customer group and recapture some value, right, because inherently your business model has been delivering a ton of value to the independent base for a very long time. Obviously, the margin levels take a hit and then historically they have come back. And so help us think about those the sequence of sort of what happens next, I guess?","George Barrett","So Ross, why don\u2019t I start? First, let me start by saying we always operate in a competitive environment. That is the nature of our business. Obviously, I have been doing this as is Mike for quite some time. We have lived through multiple cycles for me and multiple parts of the industry. You see these periods. I mentioned that this is a bit of a unique moment. You have got all of the public discourse around healthier sides in Pharma, it\u2019s loud and it\u2019s emotional. And at the same time, healthcare is going through some changes. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s shocking that there is some near-term disturbance. Experience \u2013 my experience tells me that over time, you see some shifting out and just essentially settling of the dust. Sometimes, when aggressive moves don\u2019t result in a much change or a value creation, then things just sort of stabilize. And so we have lived through different cycles in the past and that\u2019s what I would expect here. For us, again, the important thing is for us to be creating new value sources for our customers and our manufacturer partners. And we work \u2013 you have heard the positioning that we have had over these last 7 or 8 years, it\u2019s really been about broad value creation and we will continue to focus on that as our priority. And I think ultimately, the reason that our business has been improving in recent years is, essentially, they build and create value. And so we will continue to focus on those dynamics. But we have seen occasionally these kinds of cycles for me over, unfortunately, many decades in different parts of the industries. So, that\u2019s my general point of view.","Ross Muken","That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just quickly, Mike, on the balance sheet, I mean you guys are in a pretty strong position here. You talked about dislocations a bit in some of the pharma service part of the market, I am assuming to private and other competitors that\u2019s they are also painful, I mean, what about the M&A pipeline at this point? And obviously, you are doing a lot on the repurchase and you have a healthy dividend, but there is a lot of balance sheet capacity there. Could we see you guys get more active again?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. Couple of comments. I think it\u2019s good to hear you mention the dividend, because that\u2019s something I would like to stress, because I think we have a very differentiated dividend and it\u2019s something that we continue to be committed to our 30% to 35% payout. And I think that is a very much a differentiator between us and others. And so I agree with that on one side. Again, I would tell you that when it comes to the deployment of capital, we would love to find great M&A targets that\u2019s probably where we would lean overstock repo, but we are going to stay disciplined. If we can\u2019t find the right target at the right price and it has the right culture that fits into our business, then we are not going to move forward. And if that means there is some excess cash on the balance sheet, then we will take a look at deploying that in the stock repo. So, I think our pipeline is still decent right now. As you can imagine, we look at dozens of items before we ever purchase one. And so it\u2019s always hard to tell exactly when something might come out of that, but we continue to be very active in the M&A front, but won\u2019t trap cash on the balance sheet either if we can\u2019t find the right opportunities.","Ross Muken","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Next, we have Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hey, good morning. So, couple of questions here. First of all, does your guidance assume any additional step down in distribution sell-side pricing offering independent books? So, did you assume that a step-down in the pricing that you are seeing in the marketplace today will spillover to your entire independent book?","Mike Kaufmann","Well, I guess the only way I can respond to that is, as I mentioned in my remarks, our guidance includes not only what we saw in Q1, what I have kind of foreshadowed in Q2, but also that it was based on some of the trends we are seeing in Q1 and in Q2. So yes, it does include some continued challenges with generic pricing and branded inflation.","George Barrett","Let me just add to this, Ricky. I mean generally, market price is a very effective market, very efficient market. So, the market just tends to be the market. And so you can\u2019t think of this as necessarily individual customers.","Ricky Goldwasser","So \u2013 but George, doesn\u2019t that mean if there is risk that you may have to lower your prices in the future to match a new lower price point in the market volume? So, I guess the question is, is there any lower price point in the market?","George Barrett","We are always lowering our pricing in the generic market. It always has been that way. And so generally, you constantly are competing on generics. All we are saying is that, right now, it\u2019s just a little bit of an unusual period of time where we are seeing a little more aggressive re-pricing. But there is always some re-pricing built into your go forward. We are always going to price the market. We are not ever trying to leave the market down, but we are in the \u2013 we believe the best competitive position from a cost standpoint that we can always stay competitive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners.","Greg Bolan","Great. Thanks, guys. So, if I could just maybe qualify what you said here is, on the distribution side, your margins on the buy side are about the same, your margins on the sell side downstream have got a little bit worse. And so that\u2019s a). And then b), Mike, if we could go back to this time last year, I mean, if I remember correctly, you guys were already kind of dealing with a little bit of a difficult comp on the distribution margin side. If I remember correctly, you guys got about, I think called out $0.08 of incremental tailwind from generic pricing this time last year, and I think about $0.03 from synergies from acquisitions. So, could you maybe talk a little bit about that and kind of how much of this year-over-year difficult comp kind of played into 1Q? Thanks.","George Barrett","Yes, thank you. I did mention that in my remarks that part of the reason for our Q1 is the comps and that\u2019s why we called out Q1 being down was. And you were right on with that. We did have $0.08 last year that we called out favorability largely from benefits related to certain competitive dynamics on a few key generic items that we thought we are going to deflate last year that didn\u2019t and they stayed up. And since then, they have deflated. And then, as you mentioned, $0.03 on accelerated integration of some acquisitions. So those were favorable items last year. As well as from an overall basis, remember, we had a favorable tax component last year too. And then in last year, we did see the first quarter branded inflation was a little higher than we had anticipated. So, that\u2019s right. Those were the positive things. You also summarized accurately the generic piece. When you really break it down into two components, one is the manufacturing actions, which is then either raising or lowering price. We are seeing, for instance, less inventory inflation on generics, but it\u2019s really no different than we had originally anticipated. As you mentioned \u2013 as we mentioned in the past, FY \u201814 was a good year, \u201815 was a solid year and then it started coming down in \u201816 and we kept calling down and we said we expected that to be down and that\u2019s how we essentially budgeted and looked at it for this year. So again, we are not seeing anything real different when it comes to what the manufacturing actions are related to inflation and deflation. It is the competitive environment downstream in our actual pricing out for the customers.","Greg Bolan","That\u2019s great. And then just real quickly, if I kind of think back to Kinray 6 years ago now and what you guys have been able to do there, what Kinray and other kind of worked in or sort out on the community pharmacy side, I think you guys are now one of the largest, if not the largest, in the independent pharmacy space, with high 20% market share. And then as I think about the competitive dynamics around that market, I mean you guys have kind of lived in a world where you have been constantly trying to take share and been successful at that, it doesn\u2019t sound to me like this \u2013 it certainly doesn\u2019t sound as to what you are saying today is as draconian as maybe what we were kind of \u2013 what I was set up for going into the weekend and so \u2013 I mean is \u2013 if you think about \u2013 you keep saying short-term, you think it\u2019s transient, George, I mean what needs to happen over the next say, years for you guys to kind of maybe mitigate this \u2013 on the downstream margin side and kind of how you are positioned to continue to maintain or even grow market share going forward? Thanks.","George Barrett","Yes. So Greg, let me start. This is really important. Our market share, I mean our independent has grown over years basically. It\u2019s not a sudden phenomenon. Actually, right now, it\u2019s relatively stable. So it\u2019s possibly growing over the 7 years of this team\u2019s leadership here. Obviously, the Kinray acquisition gave us a very significant boost there. So that\u2019s not a sudden thing. It\u2019s been a thoughtful and purposeful strategy to make sure that we have a good balance to our business. And we really feel like we create a huge amount of value for those independents to the service offerings and product lines, especially as the world is unfolded as it is. So start by that. I don\u2019t think there is a discrete moment of change. We are obviously in the middle of a lot of things. So the election cycle clearly is creating an enormous amount of discussion and noise, which I do think has an effect on the way people behave. I do think generic cycles come in lumps and we see that they tend to have some cyclicality. We will see some growth coming from biosimilars, which will affect the market probably each product differently. And I think again, most times in competitive moments, you have companies just adjusting to what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. And so that\u2019s my experience over a lot of years. And so I think at the moment, right now, has a lot factors coming together to make for a tough environment, but we are going to stick to our value proposition and our long-term view as to how we compete in the market and how important service and product offerings are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Thank you and good morning. George, I just want to go back to your comments around the branded side and that primarily everything today is driven more on the generic side and pricing competition, but you brought the branded expectation down from roughly 10% down to the expectation of 7% to 9%, can you talk, is that what you are seeing right now, is that kind of your future look, we have heard from a number of manufacturers that they are lowering their expectation into what their price inflation will be in calendar \u201917, so I want to understand that, number one. And number two, I just want to understand because the way that I have historically thought about this is that 15% that\u2019s on a contingent basis was probably more profitable than a fee-for-service contract and so drug price inflation would have a bigger impact on that component of the business, I just want to know if I am thinking about that correctly?","George Barrett","Mike, do you want to start on this one and then I can jump in?","Mike Kaufmann","Sure. So actually, the 15% piece was margin dollars, it wasn\u2019t number of contracts. So it was assumed to be \u2013 of our margin dollars generated. I wouldn\u2019t say that, that group was a lot more profitable. A lot of the folks that are in there are obviously the smaller manufacturers, but so it\u2019s going to have an overall a little higher average rate because just by the nature of being smaller manufacturers. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big component of it. As far as what we have seen so far, I would tell you that what we have seen so far has been pretty light when it comes to manufacturer inflation. But that all being said, really January, as you know, our Q3 or the first quarter of our calendar year is always a big quarter for the branded manufacturer price increases. And the 7% to 9% is really an average for the entire year. So while it\u2019s a little lighter than we would have expected now, that\u2019s what we are building and to why we are lowering is that we would expect it hopefully after election and looking all those other components, we will see a little bit more normalcy, probably not as high, obviously as what it used to be, but we think we will get back into that 7% to 9% range. If that adjusts much differently than that, then we will have other updates after that. But right now, that\u2019s what we are expecting.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill","Hey. Good morning guys and I appreciate you taking the questions.","George Barrett","Thank you.","George Hill","I guess Mike first off, if we think about the change in the guidance on the generic side, are you able to quantify I guess kind of from down mid-single digits to mid to high single-digits, how much of that change is due to the underlying pricing environment of the drugs themselves, the deflationary environment versus how much of that is the sell side margin pressure. And then my second question would be you started to run down the rabbit hole of purchasing compliance a little bit, I guess could you talk about what you are seeing in the contracting environment and how that help \u2013 how pricing is leading into \u2013 how pricing is tying into the purchasing compliance discussion?","George Barrett","Yes. So as far as the adjustment from mid singles to mid singles to mid to high single-digits net deflation, really that entire adjustment is due to what we are seeing in the generic pricing environment. As I have mentioned, we are not really seeing the inflation-deflation piece to be significantly different than what we modeled. So you can assume all of that is essentially related to the generic pricing. And then as far as...","George Hill","The sell side part?","George Barrett","The sell side part, that\u2019s right. And as far as compliance goes, that\u2019s highly contract dependent, when we have customers, we are very diligent about the way we write our contracts. So if we have a customer contract that says that they have got to buy x percent of the generics from us, then we monitor that and we make sure that they do. And on the piece that they don\u2019t have to directly buy from us in order to make that deal work, they can shop that piece and we have always known that. And so that\u2019s the component that we would see, obviously some more pricing pressure on.","George Hill","Okay. And maybe if I could just still a real quick follow-up for George, when we talk about this increase in the sell side competitive environment, I guess how far off the normal are we if you think about historical spikes and when we have seen heightened competition?","George Barrett","I don\u2019t think I am able to give you a specific number here. What I can say is the kind of erosion that we have seen typically and it\u2019s been relatively predictable, has just been different over these last couple of months. And so it is different and noteworthy and I think is the largest component as to why we are adjusting our model for the year. The branded part, as Mike said, is much smaller. But I can\u2019t quantify that for you, George, but it is noticeably different.","George Hill","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny","Good morning guys and thanks for the details so far.","George Barrett","Good morning, Mike.","Michael Cherny","So I think those pharma questions have been kind of be in the desk, so all these facts got on the Medical side, you guys talked a little bit about the recent share gains you have, obviously Kaiser is a very notable contract win, can you maybe talk, especially with Cordis anniversary over the last year, as you think about now your go-to-market strategy versus maybe 2 years ago, what are the biggest differences, obviously Cordis is one component, but in terms of being able to gain a competitive scale, what\u2019s changed the most or at least most improved your competitive win rate?","George Barrett","Michael, thank you for the question. So, you are making Don happy on a question about Medical. So let me just give you a perspective. Our go-to-market model over recent years has really been focused broadly on a couple of really important changes. A lot of our customers are getting much more complex. They are bigger systems. So what historically might have been a single hospital is now a academic medical center plus some community hospitals, plus a few surgery centers and oncology clinics and now some doctors offices. That requires a different partner. I think our ability \u2013 and we have seen this. We have built our business around that expectation. And I think what\u2019s happening is our ability to serve across that continuum of care to create value in different ways or systems the are much more complex than they once were is important. And one of the shifts I want to describe is a little bit more of an elevation of those conversations, away from the purely departmentally driven ones into a conversation that\u2019s more broadly at the system level. I think that\u2019s playing to our strength. Now again, we have to be very strong in each of the departments. We have to be content experts and we are still that. But I do think that the reason that we have been growing, I think is largely that we are positioning well to adapt. And we anticipated these changes in the way that these big health systems were going to look and I think that\u2019s been beneficial to us.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that is I think a part of that growth is the really measured and smart approach I think we have taken to expanding our portfolio in the medical segment. And so our reps are able to leverage a lot more products in the bag. And so when we call on a customer, we have more to sell them, we can leverage our expense structure, we can be more meaningful to them. And I think it would be \u2013 I don\u2019t think we should also ignore the fact that we have given a lot of energy to the Cordis business. So, we have put some great people in charge there. It\u2019s a business that we are paying a lot of attention to. Don himself has a lot of experience in this area as David Wilson who is running it. And so I think there is a lot to be said for when you have people that are excited know you are investing in the business, really are committed to that and we have hired some great people. I think that\u2019s driving some of the things we are seeing in Cordis, too.","George Barrett","If I could I just want to add one more piece, because we are talking primarily in this context about the medical, but it does connect our pharmaceutical business and our medical business and many of these customers are part of that overall offering. So, I didn\u2019t want to miss the opportunity to share that.","Michael Cherny","Thanks, guys. I will let you go with rest of the queue.","George Barrett","Thanks, Michael.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen","Hi. Mike, can you talk a bit about your efforts to improve your cost structure in the corporate division? What\u2019s going to drive that? And any sort of quantification could be around that would be very helpful? Thanks.","George Barrett","Yes. So, good question and I mentioned that it is a big driver when you think about that EPS bridge, as we mentioned with the generics slightly are going down and net customer activity staying the same. We needed to actually have a real focus on that expense initiative. So, a lot of us \u2013 lot of the corporate departments across the company are all located in corporate. A lot of the initiatives and things that we fund, we fund out of corporate. And so all of those things we are taking really good hard look at, making sure we are investing in the right things. We are being very targeted on those things. And just driving discipline throughout our corporate departments in all lines of our P&L to make sure that we can help contribute to offsetting some of the decline we are seeing on generics pricing.","David Larsen","Okay, great. And then can you just remind me again sort of the 2Q operating income expectations for the pharma division? Pretty significant change there relative to commerce last quarter, just could you remind me what\u2019s driving that? And then what\u2019s going to sort of cause the reacceleration in growth in the back half of the year?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. So, Q2 was really being driven by the same trends that we discussed. When we take a look at that, the trends that we saw in Q1 related again to generic pricing as well as branded inflation rates being lower than we had anticipated are the two key drivers in Q2 and why we gave you some early information that it would be similar to the percentage decline we saw in Q1. As far as what\u2019s going on back half weighted, some of it has to just do with comps and things that are going to happen in the Cordis, like branded inflation tends to always be stronger in our Q3. And we have a lot of other initiatives that we are working on that we believe will deliver value in the second half. Remember, we have the step up in Cordis that impacted our Q2 and Q3 last year that doesn\u2019t impact our Q2 and Q3 this year. Plus, we will have a full year of growing and getting after that business as well as on-boarding some other customers. So, we think we have enough initiatives in the back half to be able to get us to where we need to for the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Willoughby with Credit Suisse.","Bob Willoughby","Good morning, George and Mike. While we know absolutely no one speculates on inflation anymore, it did appear your competitor bought some inventory in the inflationary market last year, liquidated this year. You bought less year-over-year, maybe the medical skews that somewhat. But isn\u2019t it safe to assume there are some pocket of profits that have fallen out of the model here year-over-year?","George Barrett","Well, I think in the sense of \u2013 if we are relating it specifically to branded manufacturing, when you do have less branded manufacturer inflation, you do as I have mentioned a couple of times, when that happens quickly, you have those immediate adjustments where that 15% of your portfolio that is dependent upon that inflation sees less inflation. So, you do have to go through and renegotiate your agreements with manufacturers, but \u2013 so, that\u2019s the first important piece. As I mentioned, we are doing that with manufacturers. Any time you see a sudden change, you have to go do that. As far as specking on generics or on brand, again, that was something that we could do a long time ago, several years ago because of the nature of our relationships with generic manufacturers, on the \u2013 with Red Oak as well as our agreements on the branded side specking is minimal to almost none of an impact.","Bob Willoughby","And Mike, can you reaffirm a cash flow target for the year or is that not to call today?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. We don\u2019t as you know give cash flow targets for the year, but again, there was nothing I would say that when I look at what\u2019s going on in our business that would make me think that we are not going to be able to deliver strong cash flow this year.","Bob Willoughby","Thank you.","George Barrett","Thanks Bob.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","Hi, thanks very much. Could you give us an update on what\u2019s sort of brand inflation you are seeing within the specialty bucket and what sort of assumption you are making in guidance for that category?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. We don\u2019t break that out specifically. Generally, inflation on specialty tends to be a little bit lower, because they are higher priced items than in the overall bucket. But our overall 7% to 9% target is across the board for all branded pharmaceuticals, including specialty and what\u2019s going through our normal Pharmaceutical Distribution bucket.","John Kreger","Thanks Mike. And one other one on the medical front, can you give us a sense about what your organic revenue growth was in the quarter? Now that you are lapping quarters, we are thinking about 6%, is that about right?","Mike Kaufmann","I can\u2019t give you the exact number, but I would definitely tell you that we were positive growth in the medical segment without Cordis. We do still expect Cordis to deliver $0.15 for FY \u201817. And so yes, if you were to back Cordis out, you would still see nice growth, a healthy growth in the medical segment.","John Kreger","Great, thank you.","Mike Kaufmann","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America.","Steven Valiquette","Thanks. Just one more here on the sell side customer pricing, I guess I am just curious, is there any evidence that a change in the actual price methodology in the market being offered by some wholesalers? And the reason why I ask was that there was some chatter about maybe a shift to a cost plus pricing model on generics as opposed to just random spot pricing? Thanks.","George Barrett","Mike?","Mike Kaufmann","Well, I think all the time people are always trying to be creative on how they price and how to work with customers and different customers have different needs. So, I don\u2019t see a wholesale change though in the way people are pricing in the market. The majority of the areas where we are seeing the pricing pressure just in that normal day-to-day pricing, whether or not that\u2019s changing our larger deals, it\u2019s hard for me to speak to our competitors on how they might be doing that. And deals can get often very complicated on how you compare one to another, but I wouldn\u2019t notice any notable change at this point in time.","Steven Valiquette","Okay, great. Okay, thanks.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks.","George Barrett","Well, at first, thanks to all of you for your good questions and for joining us today. I know that we will be seeing many of you in the coming weeks and we look forward to that. And with that, we will close the call. Thank you, all.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s presentation.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our third quarter call today. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, and we have now completed 9 months of excellent overall growth and progress in our areas of strategic focus in FY 2012. ","Revenue for the third quarter was $26.9 billion, up 3% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased by 6% to $524 million. Our non-GAAP EPS grew 16% to $0.94 from last year's $0.81. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered 9% profit growth and a revenue gain of 3%. The Medical segment achieved top line growth of 8%, reinforcing our improved positioning in the market, but as we had expected, the segment recorded a year-over-year profit decline of 17%, primarily due to residual commodity cost pressures.  The team had shown great focus, offsetting much of its headwind with solid performance in the underlying business. ","I'd like to walk you through the performance highlights of these segments.  First, Pharmaceutical. Revenue increases came from multiple classes of trade. This growth outpaced the market in virtually every channel. Our focus on creating value for the specific needs of each customer in this dynamic environment remains a top priority. Our customer base remains strong, and the mix continues to evolve along our strategic pathway. Our non-bulk sales were up 7.6% versus prior year. ","Profit was fueled by the continued strength of our generic activities and solid performance with our branded partners, whose needs continue to evolve in changing markets.  Our strong generic results reflect the continued focus in this important industry driver and the impact of new and recently launched products, a number of which launched in the prior quarter.","I want to take a few moments to comment on our nuclear activities, as this part of the industry has been going through some change. We see distinct market dynamics at work from the 2 different nuclear product lines. On the low energy side, our legacy business, demand remains soft. Although we continue to provide market-leading products and services and the supply of raw materials to us has been reliable, the number of nuclear cardiac procedures is considerably below historical norms. ","Part of this can be explained by general economic conditions and part is likely associated with payer and employer policies designed to continue growth in medical procedures. We've been making the necessary modifications to our business to adjust to what may be the new normal from a cardiac-procedure perspective. I should note here that demographics should, in the long-term, generate some upward pressure on demand.","As you know, our activities in the PET area are at a different stage of evolution. We were excited to see the FDA approval of Lilly's Amyvid and high-energy products used in PET scanning as a diagnostic product for patients being evaluated for Alzheimer's disease. We have been an innovator in this area, a partner in the development of this product, and we will be an important part of the team as a manufacturer and distributor of Amyvid from our specialized facilities.","From a business-model perspective in nuclear, while I would love to have been able to synchronize the slowing of the legacy low energy business with the growth coming from the new category of diagnostic products, we do recognize that Amyvid is the first product in a category of drugs, and because of this, we'll take some time to position and to build. Nevertheless, we believe that PET, and in particular, this new class of drug builds excellent promise for the future. As a reminder, Amyvid is the first of the over 20 diagnostic products in which we are actively involved in clinical trial.","As you know, and have heard us say repeatedly, we believe a growing presence in specialty is very important to our strategic position. Our emerging Specialty Solutions group delivered an outstanding revenue growth in the quarter versus last year, driven by our provider distribution services. Approximately $150 million in revenue growth was generated from new and existing distribution customers. We also find another $100 million in annualized distribution revenues, including several large oncology customers. ","Having said this, we are still in the stage in specialty where any bump in the road can have an impact on the specialty numbers in the near term. Unfortunately, we did have an issue with a customer in the P4 legacy operations that resulted in the loss of some of our business with them, primarily affecting margin. And Jeff will touch on this in his comments. All in all, our Specialty Solutions group is picking up customers, creating new products for providers and payers. And we've built an outstanding management team. I'm very pleased with the momentum we are gaining, the innovation coming out of this team and the promise of continued progress.","I'd like to take a moment to comment on the overall pharmaceutical environment. These past few months have been active in the pharmaceutical arena. The dispute between Walgreens and Express Scripts has had some impact on end markets. The VA contract was awarded and Medco and Express Scripts consummated their transaction. ","We are well positioned to complete and deliver value in this environment. We have developed dedicated tools to support the needs of large and highly integrated customers and feel good about those relationships, each of which, I might add, is unique. At the same time that we've increased our range of options for the smaller chains, hospitals and independent pharmacies that depend on us every day.","Finally, before I leave the Pharmaceutical segment, I want to provide an update on the VA situation since we last spoke on February 3. At that time, we discussed our contingency planning, specifically transitioning the distribution of controlled substances from our Lakeland facility to our Jackson, Mississippi facility and other distribution centers. Since that time, we've put the plan in motion. ","Litigation is continuing with our show cause hearing before a DEA administrative law judge scheduled to begin on May 7. We have been investing and will continue to invest in people, tools and systems designed to detect and prevent diversion of controlled drugs. And I know our people are committed to this effort.","Turning to our Medical segment. We continue to show good revenue growth in a relatively flat medical market, a strong validation of our value proposition. Sales grew by 8%, helped by growth across customer channels as well as from the Futuremed acquisition in Canada. Although systemwide physician office visits were down, we continue to see double-digit growth in our ambulatory channel, fueled by our business with surgery centers. And similarly, our work around preferred products produced double-digit growth rates, outpacing the balance of the portfolio. ","We had a number of new product launches during the quarter, including the introduction of the Dura Blue sterilization wrap, a hydrogel-coated version of our protective surgical glove, a plasma soldering device and flexible masks, all of which came out of our innovative -- innovation teams. ","And just a few comments on our MBT go live. We are now up and running. Given the scale of this initiative and the complexity of the implementation, it has gone extremely well. I'll share a few statistics to give you a better sense of this scale. On a daily basis, our Medical segment processes an average of 5,000 customer calls, 31,000 orders and 35,000 invoices, and I might add, MBT had to revise millions of lines and code and billions of rows of data. Even with all of this, we are barely off our previous customer service levels, about less than 0.5% change. ","We are most appreciative of our customers who have worked closely with us on this major initiative, and particularly those who have had to endure some of the glitches that can occur in projects of this scale. I also want to thank the thousands of employees who have worked tirelessly on this program, many putting off vacation and family time to ensure that every issue is addressed and that we deliver significant customer benefits on this investment.","We are now through most of the heavy lifting at MBT. We have absorbed some considerable commodity headwind and strengthened our value proposition. We now anticipate that our Medical business will return to positive bottom line growth in Q4 and into our fiscal 2013.","Finally, on Medical, as you know, we announced 2 weeks ago that Don Casey will be joining us to lead this important segment of our business and that Mike Lynch will be leading Cardinal Health. I will come back to Mike in a few minutes, but a few words on Don. We are thrilled to get an executive of Don's experience, insight and drive. He brings to us more than 2 decades of strategic and operations work in healthcare, having touched virtually every area in the industry. We welcome him and his family to Cardinal Health and look forward to introducing him to those of you who do not already know him.","In the past few quarters, I've taken just a few moments to comment on our work in China, which crosses segments and businesses, and I'd like to do the same today. I recently returned from a visit to China, where I had the opportunity to meet with local and national leaders and policymakers. I came away from this trip confident that our team is focused on the right drivers of growth for Cardinal Health, but this visit also reinforced for me that we're well aligned with national priorities as spelled out in China's 12th 5-year plan. These priorities include improving the public health and access to affordable healthcare and the development of a vibrant service sector in the economy, which will play an important role in promoting domestic demand. Jeff will provide commentary specific to our business in China when he comments. ","In summary, I'm pleased by our performance this quarter and over the first 9 months of our fiscal 2012. And based on the information we have today, we're raising the lower end of our guidance, resulting in a revised range of $3.15 to $3.20 for fiscal year 2012 non-GAAP EPS. ","Finally, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, Mike Lynch will be leaving the company after a distinguished 28-year career with Cardinal Health and its predecessor company. Mike's fingerprints can be found throughout our operations through the strategies he developed and the people he mentored. We wish Mike all the best as he moves forward. And we thank him for his many contributions and his readiness to work with Don and the medical team as they transition over the coming months. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll explain our financial trends and drivers in the third quarter, then I'll touch briefly on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2012.","Let's start with Slide 4. During the quarter, we grew our non-GAAP EPS by 16% to $0.94 per share, driven by 3% revenue and 6% non-GAAP operating earnings growth. There's low favorability in our non-GAAP effective tax rate. ","Interest and other expense came in $3 million favorable to last year, driven by changes in the value of our deferred compensation plan. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 35.6%, lower than prior year and our second quarter of this year. This quarter's rate was favorably impacted by the mix of foreign and domestic earnings and net favorable discrete items of approximately $3 million. This $3 million includes 2 sizable and largely offsetting discrete items that I wanted to highlight. ","First, approximately $45 million relate to the final settlement of certain open audit years, which favorably affected the rate. Second, we had a $44 million negative impact triggered by settlement discussions for other open-audit periods and the resulting measurement of unrecognized tax benefits.  As a reminder, last year's Q3 rate was abnormally high, driven primarily by changes in Puerto Rican tax law. ","Our share count in Q3 was about 349 million diluted  average shares outstanding versus 353 million in the prior year's quarter. I would like to point out that our fiscal '12 share count guidance is now approximately 350 million shares. Favorability in our share count versus last year continued to be driven by the $300 million of share buybacks we completed in Q1. As a reminder, we still have $450 million of share repurchase remaining under our board authorization.","Let me pause here to reiterate our position regarding capital deployment. You may want to reference Slide 7 as I do so. As we've consistently emphasized since redefining our deployment strategy at the time of the CareFusion spend, our objective is to have a balanced approach that begins with maintaining and growing our differentiated dividend. In fact, just yesterday, we announced board approval of a 10.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.2375 per share or $0.95 annualized. This dividend represents a key move, 70% increase from the per-share amount we're paying at fiscal 2009 prior to the CareFusion spend and represents a current yield of about 2.2%. ","Second, we make sure that we are investing appropriately in our capital expenditures to support and drive organic growth. In this regard, we continue to expect to invest $250 million to $270 million in FY '12 with the majority of that in IT-related processes and systems.  ","Beyond that, we don't have a fixed formula. Our goal is to ensure that we are positioning for sustainable competitive advantage and to create shareholder value.  Clearly, over the past 12 to 24 months, acquisitions have played a role in positioning us for sustained growth. Over that time, we have also continued to buy back shares on an opportunistic basis. ","Before shifting the discussion to segment results, let me comment on a few items from our consolidated cash flow and the balance sheet. Our strong earnings performance, coupled with reductions in networking capital, led to excellent operating cash flow of nearly $900 million in Q3, bringing the year-to-date amount to approximately $1.3 billion. ","We did have a few unique items affecting our working capital metrics in the quarter. Days sales outstanding were higher this quarter versus last year due primarily to certain issues related to our Medical Business Transformation go live in early February. While the MBT implementation was overall a definite success, as one would expect with the implementation of this size, we did encounter a few problems. Specifically, there were some temporary back-office issues, including invoicing, which we are still in the process of resolving. This affected our quarter end AR balance, and in turn, our DSOs. Days inventory on hand was higher in the quarter, due to the on-boarding of a customer in pharma and the timing of this quarter end.","We ended Q3 with approximately $2.4 billion in cash, of which approximately $200 million was held overseas. This cash balance does not include our investments in health and maturity fixed income securities, which totaled approximately $90 million at quarter end.","Now let's move to Q3 segment performance, referring primarily to Slides 5 and 6, starting with the Pharma segment. Revenue in the segment increased 3%. Overall, growth with existing customers was a primary driver, but let me walk through a few more of the details. As George said, non-bulk sales were up 7.6% for the quarter and reached 60% of total segment revenue. We again experienced strong growth in our generic programs, up 18%. And Specialty Solutions continues to add new distribution customers, growing revenue this quarter, 59%. Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 10 basis points compared to the prior year's Q3, in part, reflecting continued mix shifts with both customers and products. In fact, we saw margin rate growth in virtually every one of our pharma distribution classes of trade. ","We continue to see significant contribution from the ongoing success of our generics programs, including the favorable impact of recently launched generic products, with equivalent to LIPITOR, ZYPREXA and Lexapro, contributing strongly. ","Generic deflation rates continue to be below historical norms, with deflation this quarter roughly in line with Q2 and the prior year's Q3. While we do not believe the industry dynamics moderate generic deflation will necessarily change in the near term, we do expect the overall deflation rate on our portfolio of products to increase next quarter and into next year, as certain recently launched items pass their exclusivity period. ","As you know, our nuclear businesses has had a rough stretch, and we continue to be challenged by the low energy market softness we described in our last 2 calls. We continue to take actions within that business to mitigate the impact of this. One of these initiatives did result in inventory write-off we mentioned in last quarter's call. This write-off lowered segment profit by $11 million or approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter. ","As George said, we did have some positive developments on the positron emission tomography side of the business recently with Eli Lilly and Amyvid, a PET diagnostic agent, which we have previously highlighted, receiving FDA approval on April 6.","Regarding our DEA-related issues in Florida, as George mentioned, we have been transitioning distribution of controlled substances from our Lakeland, Florida facility, primarily to our Jackson, Mississippi operation. For the quarter, we did incur some incremental cost associated with the DEA issue which totaled over $4 million. This amount includes legal and other external fees and was recorded in the Pharma segment. Our expectations for any continued negative impact are reflected in our guidance.  In summary, the Pharma segment had another strong quarter, resulting in a 9% increase in segment profit to $446 million.","Now turning to our Medical segment. For the quarter, revenue increased by 8.2% to $2.4 billion. Let me highlight a few items driving this result. We saw another good increase in revenue from our preferred products with 11% growth in the quarter. As we've highlighted in the past, this is a key growth and margin expansion opportunity for us. Our ambulatory channel, another important focus area for us, also had another strong quarter with 11% revenue growth.  Cardinal Health Canada had a strong quarter with 16% revenue growth, including the contribution from the acquisition of Futuremed during the period. ","Consistent with the last quarter, I wanted to quantify a couple of unique items which contributed to our reported Medical revenue growth this quarter, although I would note that they had a relatively insignificant impact on segment profit growth. First, as the ongoing effect of having transitioned our business with CareFusion to a traditional branded distribution model, a move that we highlighted in our Q3 earnings call last year, this change added 2 percentage points or $46 million to revenue.  As we have now lapped this transition, this will be last time I quantify its impact on Medical segment growth. ","The second item, the impact of the refinement we've made in the way we report results for our international commercial operations, which I discussed in detail on our Q1 call, this change contributed 1.9 percentage points to the Medical segment revenue growth rate in the quarter.","Now turning to Medical segment profit, which, as we expected, declined 17% to $89 million. Consistent with the forecast we provided on last quarter's call, commodity prices negatively impacted our Q3 cost of products sold by $20 million versus last year. For the full year, we're still expecting a headwind of slightly under $70 million. ","On the issue of commodities, I want to remind everyone that due to the 4- to 6-month lag between price movements and the corresponding impact on our cost of products sold, further changes of commodity price levels during this fiscal year will have more of an FY '13 and FY '12 impact. On that note, let me comment on what the information we have available to us today says about the impact for next year. ","Currently, we anticipate the commodity headwind we've been facing, which range from $60 million to $70 million in FY '11 and FY '12, to significantly lessen for FY '13. Although the price of oil remains fairly volatile, based on today's information, we expect the gross headwind to be closer to $5 million to $15 million next year -- it's $5 million to $15 million next year, although that will clearly fluctuate over time.","Also as I mentioned on last quarter's call, we saw approximately $8 million of incremental expense associated with the Medical Business Transformation launch as we began to depreciate the assets and incurred additional spend associated with the national implementation. We're currently forecasting a similar level of incremental expense in Q4. Partially offsetting the effect of the negative items I just mentioned was the positive margin benefit of increased sales of our preferred products.","Now I'd like to follow-up on George's comments regarding Cardinal Health China. Our revenue in China was again strong, and we continue to see outstanding growth from our local direct distribution business, which grew its revenue by 45% during the quarter. And at the end of Q3, we have expanded to 10 distribution center sites in China and the service area covers more than 250 million people. We remain excited about the opportunity we have in China to partner with brand pharmaceutical and medical device companies, and progress in this regard continues to gain momentum. And we continue to move forward well in the new business areas we've initiated over the past while, including consumer healthcare products for retail pharmacies, direct-to-patients specialty distribution and medical device distribution. ","Let's turn to Slide 8, which I'll just summarize. In total, GAAP results in the quarter include items that had a positive $0.01 per share net after-tax impact. This compares to a negative $0.10 per share net impact in our GAAP results last year.","There are 2 unique items recorded in Q3 related to our specialty business, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results. The first is related to the P4 Healthcare earnout contingency. We updated our forecast for future EBITDA generation, which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our total contingent consideration obligation, bringing the remaining earnout liability from the P4 acquisition to $23 million. ","You will see this appears in approximately $55 million or $0.10 per share gain in acquisition related costs. The reduction in our forecast and corresponding earnout liability is largely driven by the revenue loss and a significant customer of the P4 Healthcare legacy business, which given the nature of this services business, has a relatively high margin impact.","Separately, the other item related to specialty is tied to our decision to rebrand our Specialty business with Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions and to largely discontinue use of the P4 trade name. This resulted in a $16 million write-off recorded in the impairment line. And again, to be clear, neither of these 2 unique items relate to specialty, which net to a positive $0.07 per share, are reflected in our non-GAAP results for our Pharma segment numbers we've been discussing.","Keeping in mind that we have about 8 weeks left in our fiscal year, our FY '12 guidance range takes into account some key factors that could still change, including generic launch values, generic deflation and branded price increases. And to be clear, our new guidance range of $3.15 to $3.20 assumes we do not have a LIFO charge in Q4. ","I'll also point out that we made some minor changes to our full-year assumptions for share count, interest and other and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as shown on Slide 11. Note that we have left our full-year tax rate assumption unchanged despite the lower rate we had in Q3.","Now I'm going to turn it over to our operator to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","George, if we look ahead for fiscal year '13, can you provide us any guidance for fiscal year '13 on generics? And what's your expectation for total revenue growth for the year?","George S. Barrett","At this point, we're not prepared to guide. We're still looking through our planning process. I can give you some color on what we see on generics going forward, and hopefully that will be of some help. I'll start with this. We expect our generic business to grow. I would probably say that the number and value of generic launches in our fiscal '13 is probably lower than in our fiscal '12. And as Jeff mentioned, some of the products that launched, let's say in the last 4 to 5 months, will lose their exclusivity. So we expect to see some deflation on those products, but it's sort of an extraordinary time in the industry. We're probably looking at the potential of total system-wide generic penetration exceeding 80% sometime next year, which is really a sort of mind-boggling number. And so this will help fuel, and the work that we're doing in our generic program, in general, we think will help fuel continued growth. But that's probably the general color I could give you at this stage.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Ricky, I think there might have been a second question there about revenue growth for next year, which I assume was overall growth. Then again, we're still going through our planning process, so I don't want to be too specific here. I think we all recognize that FY '13 is going to be an interesting year with respect to revenue just due to the sheer volume of large branded products that have and will come off patent in this fiscal year. The obvious is that could very well result in flat to negative revenue growth in Pharma and the overall company next year. Although, as you know, that can actually be good for our gross margin. So that's our early thinking, but there's still a lot things to play out over the next couple of months.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So from our regard, we should think about like flattish to negative revenue growth but continued margin expansion as generic compliance increases. Is that fair?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Again, I don't want to get too specific on margin, but I would say, if you look at the impact of the products going off patent, there's 2 impacts. Just looking at those in isolation, they will tend to dampen the revenue, and I think an assumption of flattish to slightly down is probably reasonable. And they generally will be positive to our gross margin rate, so...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","There's, obviously, been a lot of talk in the marketplace around customers and turnover and renewals and potential customers that are coming up for renewal. And so I was wondering if you can make any comments on maybe your top 5 or so customers and their status? And how you're sort of thinking about renewals or contracts over the next year or so?","George S. Barrett","Yes, it's George. I'll start with this one. Again, we are generally -- provide somewhat limited information on specific customers, but some of this, I think, is fairly available out there in the public domain so I can comment on a few of the contract renewals and just general timing. So couple of things to say. We have renewed a couple that you may know with Kmart and Kroger, have now been renewed in terms of long-term contracts that extend beyond FY '15. That's always helpful to us in terms of long-term stability, and we'll continue to work closely with these customers. I think you all know from other calls that the status of the Express Scripts contract is extended, that current agreement, until the end of September, and are in the process of responding to an RFP, which is there to include the entire Express plus Medco business. There's not much we can say, honestly, about that in terms of the outcome other than to say we've been a very solid and I think outstanding supplier to Express Scripts, and we look forward to continuing that relationship. Both CVS and Walgreens contract run through this summer of 2013, so still over a year away. Not much to say about that other than those are 2 very important customers and outstanding relationships. And one which we've been getting some questions about and questions we probably should comment on, which is that we did pick up Safeway, we've been asked this and I thought we should confirm that, for a multi-year agreement. So we really are excited about this. We view this not just not just as a new customer but as a terrific partnership going forward. So that will probably give you some color on the contracts that we would typically make some comment on.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Just 2 quick follow-ups. Do you have any idea about timing on when you might hear on the Express situation? And since you did confirm Safeway, is there any color you can provide as to maybe the dynamics around that contract change?","George S. Barrett","No. For the first 2 parts of the question. I don't think I can provide specifics on when we'll hear regarding the RFP on Express Scripts. I suppose it is possible that we could here by the time we speak with you again for our year-end numbers, but no certainty at this point. The second part -- I'm sorry -- on Safeway. Yes, there's not much color I can provide for you here. Obviously, each agreement that we have with our partners is, obviously, quite proprietary. And as I've said earlier, they're quite specific and distinct. I can say that it's a broad-based agreement, and it covers branded lines and generic lines, and we're excited to be with them.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Jim Elliott from Robert Baird.","Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a quick housekeeping question here. Can we get the profitability split between bulk and direct store delivery?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Sure. This is Jeff. The bulk rate for Q3 was 59 basis points, and the non-bulk rate was 2.64%. Let's put that in a little bit of context. As we said before, we don't think looking at these particular margins on a quarterly basis necessarily tells the complete or accurate story. So we think the most appropriate comparison is over multiple quarters, like kind of smoothes up quarterly blips, et cetera, that often occur. So in that vein, let me give you the year-to-date figures. Year-to-date bulk margins are 40 basis points, and non-bulk are 2.52%. And for comparison to last year, last year's rates in that same period were 35 basis points and 2.40%, respectively.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Marsh from Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, I'd like to maybe get you to frame kind of where you sit on MBT. Obviously, as you said George, your go live process is in motion. You spent some incremental funds this quarter, which ended up with a result that's a little better than I was thinking for this quarter. But as you think about this full year and next year, how should we frame the overall cost associated investment with MBT versus benefit this year, next year? And then sort of how  do we think about it as a go-forward basis? And then as we sort of think about next year, is there -- with the, I guess, medical device tax to go into effect next year, how do we think about impact in our models?","George S. Barrett","Why don't I let Jeff touch base on this.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","So I'm kind of chuckling a little bit, as I get the MBT question, because I'm recalling John Ransom's accusation of me giving an essay question, an essay answer to a math question last time, so let me try to be a little bit more math-y with my response this time, John, if you're out there. So and I will, now that we've completed the go live, I do want to provide a few more details regarding -- with the expense impact and future benefits. So first of all, let me talk about fiscal '12. For the full year, we'll incur about $32 million of expense related to both project implementation expense and depreciation. And it's about equally divided between the 2. On the benefit side in FY '12, as we said before, there are very few benefits realized this year. We're really focused right now on cleaning up any remaining problems and ensuring customer satisfaction, and that will continue to be our focus for the next couple of months. Now beginning in fiscal 2013, and I'll start on the expense side here, we have a full year depreciation which kicks in, and that's worth about $34 million next year. Because MBT was really replacing systems that are quite old, there isn't much in the way of elimination of depreciation expense for the systems being replaced. And then there'll also be a relatively modest amount of ongoing annual costs to sustain the system and do enhancements. Now on the benefit side, we do expect the income statement benefits to begin in 2015 and ramp up over time. Bottom line, though, we expect the financial benefits resulting from MBT next year to exceed the ongoing annual expense in the system. So in summary, the project will be net accretive for fiscal 2013 and beyond. We also expect that net benefit to increase over time as we fully utilize all the benefits of the new system. That pretty much answers the MBT question. On med device tax, as you all know, the medical device tax is currently scheduled to kick off on January 1 of 2013, assuming that the medical Health Care Reform continues as scheduled. Now you should know that there has -- there still is considerable debate around the exact final regulations as it relates to the medical device tax. But based on our current interpretation of those regulations and our current product mix, we estimate the half year impact next year to be somewhere in the range of $13 million to $23 million. I know that's a wide range, but the size of that range is really being driven by different assumptions regarding which of our offerings this tax will be applied to. And until we get some further definition of that in that regard, we'll be looking at that sort of range, again, $13 million to $23 million for the half year of impact next year. Now I should also point out that this is a gross impact, and that's before any mitigating actions that business takes to minimize its impact on us. And I guess just a final point of clarity, from an accounting perspective, this tax will appear as SG&A on our income statement.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. Just a quick follow-up then on that point. I mean, to the extent that tax, it raises price to your customers so, I guess, you're suggesting you don't anticipate any ability to offset that with raising price to your customers. And then, maybe just a follow-up on Medical with Don coming on board. George, you may have covered this, but when do you hope to have him in a position to kind of comment on his initial views and perspectives of where he wants to take the business here, once he's on board fully?","George S. Barrett","First, let me -- just a quick comment on the question with the hypothesis you gave Jeff in terms of our ability to mitigate the tax. But first of all, as you probably know, there's also still considerable discussion around medical device tax. And I won't go into a long treatise as to whether our products of the nature that we sell, that are competitive should be taxed at all. And there's still some action around this. As it relates to our ability to mitigate, I don't think we should preclude any option for us. Jeff is trying to give you the gross impact. And obviously, it will be for Don and team to think about what strategies we can deploy to make sure that, that is fairly -- that we have to experience that it's fairly distributed across those in the channel. And I think that's one of the things to consider. Don is on board. He is up to speed and as we expect will not be shy about giving you his perspective on where we are. Obviously, Jeff is getting into the business now and Don is on board working closely with Mike. And so I'm hoping that probably by the time we get a chance to talk with you all in August, he's probably going to feel a lot more comfortable with life with Cardinal Health and with the business, will have gone through our planning process, that will actually be up and extremely a fast learning experience there, in terms of the nature of Cardinal Health and what we're doing. So that's it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen from Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","In terms of the DEA situation, I mean, several years ago, there was some impact on your sales. And I think what I'm hearing is, there's really -- there really have -- sales have been going very well, and there has not been any negative impact due to the current situation. Is that correct?","George S. Barrett","I would just say that at this point, our customers have been tremendously supportive. And we've, I think, put in a very effective contingency plan, and we're doing everything to make sure that customers are served. So that's what I will say.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And there's a Defense department contractor, I think that should be ramping up in May for the Medical segment. Is that still on track for the May start?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, it is. That process is still expected to continue this month. As a reminder, we initially had expected that to start transitioning in February. But at the request of the DoD due to systems implementation they were making, it got deferred to May. So it will be a gradual ramp up as we bring on the various elements of that. But the timing you described is still accurate from the beginning of that ramp up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","George, I was wondering if you could maybe just give us some comments around pricing that you're seeing on the generic side? I think Watson last week on their conference call or earlier this week noted that they would expect roughly 4 to 6 generic manufacturers for Lipitor post-180 days of exclusivity, but were expecting price to drop pretty substantially. What do you see? And what are your thoughts on -- as we have the outlook for generics over the next several months, will some of these bigger drugs lose their exclusivity period?","George S. Barrett","Right. Good question. It is -- it's hard, obviously, to know exactly what it's going to look like at the expiration of that exclusivity. But I think we probably have the same perspective in terms of the number of players that we're seeing on that particular drug. So here's what I'd say, in terms of the overall environment, you almost have to have to look at this in 3 buckets. You have the products that are sitting in exclusive periods, that will sort of go through the binary change when competition ensues. And then you have this enormous basket of thousands of products. And then you have some individual products that essentially suggest inflows. And I would say, in general, in that middle bucket, we're not seeing any particularly noteworthy change in the pricing environment. It looks quite as it did last -- last quarter. Obviously, we will see some of these big products that go from being alone, or alone with generics, to 4 or 5, 6 players. And I think once you get into that range, then it will be reasonable to assume some fairly significant deflation.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just as my follow-up, I just wanted to clarify that I heard a couple of things correctly. On the nuclear, did you talk about an $11 million write-off in the quarter around nuclear? And then secondly, on DEA, did you say that, that cost roughly $4 million in the quarter? So if we think about the next quarter, shall we anticipate that there'll be another roughly $4 million cost associated with DEA?","George S. Barrett","Yes. First of all on the nuclear issue, yes, you did hear correctly. That was an $11 million inventory write-off. As you may recall from last quarter's call, Lisa, I sort of foreshadowed that, that was a possibility. As we are taking actions to mitigate some of the demand softness that we've been experiencing, a result of one of those initiatives was to write-off some of some inventory that we had, and that was exactly that. So I think I had sized it as $0.02 or $0.03, so when I talked about it last quarter, ended up being $0.02 of the $11 million that I described. And Lisa, regarding the DoD cuts, they were slightly over $4 million this quarter. I'm not going to try to forecast exactly what they may be next quarter, other than to say that I think any reasonable range of possibilities is reflected in our guidance.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. I probably would answer that, just recognize we're sort of in the middle of some -- it's been a relatively tense legal period so some of that, of course, is associated with just the work around the legal, operational numbers are smaller.","George S. Barrett","I wouldn't expect a dramatically different number than what we experienced in Q4 -- in Q3, at this point.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, George, I mean, would I characterize this correctly in the fact that you kept both of these costs that will be more onetime in your numbers that the margins in the quarter were actually probably slightly better than what you would've anticipated? I mean, I know you knew about nuclear, but core business is even slightly better than what you printed today? Is that the right way to think about it?","George S. Barrett","There's always a unique event in every quarter, right? But yes, the $11 million was reflected in the Pharma segment. You could argue, absent that, margins would've been better. And the roughly $1.4 million of DEA cost was also reflected in the Pharma segment. Now whether that's onetime or not, I guess, we'll see as we go forward, depending on the ultimate resolution of that. So yes, there were a couple of somewhat unique items, and they ended up here in the Pharma segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Actually, just had a big picture question on the Medical side. Outside of the expected commodity headwind, that business continues to perform well. Your largest competitor in the acute care space has been talking about a shifting in leverage towards the customer, particularly as these larger IDNs get larger. I was hoping maybe you could just weigh in on what you're seeing from that customer base? And has there been any notable pressure as a result of the consolidation that has been going on at your customer base?","George S. Barrett","Well, I would start with certainly confirming that -- the notion that there has been consolidation among the customer base. There's no question that we're seeing hospitals either under a lot of pressure and anticipating significant pressure going forward. And they're finding and looking for ways to create value. That can create some present pressure for sure. It also for us creates an opportunity to be able to deliver a message around how to create value for them. Price is one element in the way you create value. We have a broad portfolio of products and services that we can bring to bear to the market, particularly a highly integrated IDN. And so our message to them is really about our ability to create value for you in an environment that is -- has quite a number of pressures. So we'd never dispute that there is pressure that comes from large customers, but I would also say that in some ways, this enables us to articulate our value proposition about how we can create value for them.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And, I guess, just my follow-up, moving over to P4, which, I guess, I should refer to it as Specialty Solutions now. Outside of the write-down of the earnout liability, which sounds like it was largely linked to just one loss. I was wondering, George, maybe, if you could just take a step back and maybe just share your experiences in specialty today maybe versus what you thought originally, and maybe just talk to some of the challenges that exist in that business, relative to maybe where you guys were when you first entered with P4.","George S. Barrett","Sure. It's a good question, probably deserves a larger answer than we'll put in, in this call. But let me give you a quick overview. The answer is we felt strongly that our moving into specialty strategically has been important to us. We recognize the med acquisition that we are buying a business that essentially had 3 -- sort of 3 legs to the stool, basically, 3 components to the strategy. One which is it's a business activity that provide tools to oncologists and other specialty practices, that has now expanded. A second part of the stool, that was really supporting the payer community with products and services. And the third which is the area in which we had this loss of business, was really in what I'd call marketing services about Pharma. We've typically seen, we are really pleased with the progress in our tools to support the provider community. And those tools include a much more robust position in -- in the distributional specialty, and you can see that scenario will impact [indiscernible]. And we also -- if you remember, it was an area that was off to a pretty slow start, so really pleased to see that momentum. I think our work with the payer community particularly around [indiscernible] is actually very interesting and I think was quite innovative in that area. And always in the biopharmaceutical services, it's not a large customer base. So in this case where we lost some business from one customer, we can actually feel it, because it's the chunk of the high margin business. So that's sort of how I describe where we are. I'm really pleased at the evolution of the team. We've got some just terrific talent in that group. I think the kinds of innovative approaches that we're taking to the market recognizing that this is a world undergoing a lot of changes is pretty exciting to us. So it's just been a little bit of a mixed bag. And I hope we've been pretty transparent about which parts have been going well, which parts have been more challenging and the progress. But I'm really looking forward to the future with that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger from William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up to Bob's question on Specialty. George, would you be willing, given the puts and takes, just to size that business, if we think about '13 and beyond?","George S. Barrett","No. I'm sorry, John, at this point we've got to keep this in a perspective of the segment and is reported as part of the Pharmaceutical segment. As I said, I mean, the overall mix is still a relatively small business.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And a similar question, it sounds like the top line growth from Specialty improved sequentially. How about the profit growth in the business? How's that doing?","George S. Barrett","Well, I think, again, the profit growth in this particular case was hampered significantly by the loss of the time margin, sort of consulting marketing services part of the business.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","If you think about '13, should we -- can we assume that profit growth and revenue growth in Specialty should be pretty comparable?","George S. Barrett","Yes. As we continue to ramp -- this is Jeff, by the way, John, thanks for the question. As we continue to ramp up our distribution business, I think we feel very good about the revenue outlook for specialty. However, I think, due to the loss of this unique customer, probably the margin dollars will be somewhat challenged in the next 12 months or so, as we work to replace that business and as the other parts of the business continue to grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But just in relation to the DEA, I'm assuming there are some additional operational costs you're incurring to use that backup facility in Mississippi. So I'm wondering, is that material and quantifiable, or is that just really so tiny that doesn't matter? Just trying to get a little more color on that.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","That -- the incremental operational cost was included in the $4 million of incremental cost that I described earlier. And that $4 million is composed of legal fees, other outside consulting fees, additional compliance costs and incremental transportation costs. So it's a portion of that $4 million.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the 4Q -- the implied 4Q guidance. If you're kind of telling us that you swallowed an incremental $0.03 this quarter in DEA and in the nuclear business, it kind of makes results, obviously, look that much better than if you look at the sequential decline in earnings power you're now expecting 4Q, it just kind of doesn't make sense. And so I'm kind of curious, outside of the obvious, some of the key generics losing their exclusivities, is there anything in particular that you want to call out for 4Q that'll be a headwind that maybe we're not thinking about?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","First of all, and to put things in perspective based on the range of guidance that we've given for the year, that implies the EPS growth rate for Q4, somewhere between low to mid teens to low 20, which I would still describe as a pretty robust rate of growth. And I'll also say that traditionally, Q3 -- in terms of sequential dollars, Q3 has always been our strongest quarter traditionally, and that remains the case. So one would naturally expect Q4 to be sequentially lower. And on the one-timers you described, I would agree that nuclear was somewhat unique to Q3, but I wouldn't describe the DEA issue necessarily being unique to Q3. Most of those costs are continuing this quarter up until today, and absence some sort of resolution will continue. Just stepping back and sort of talking about what are some of the major drivers of what would drive a sequential decline in dollars in Q3 to Q4. And again, some of this is quite typical, for example, by margin decline, and I would describe that as sort of our typical seasonal pattern that we see most years.","George S. Barrett","I also expect the tax rate to return to a more normalized level in Q4, the Q3 rate was somewhat low for the reasons I described. Third issue is the one you referenced. With LIPITOR and ZYPREXA coming off exclusivity, we do expect those to start deflating, and that should have an impact on some of our generic dollars. And then the final issue, we've talked about, is the impact of the special loss of business with one customer. That happened during Q3, so we'll feel the full impact of that in Q4. So those are the things I would point to, but again, I would come back to the point that our guidance implies teens to low 20s growth in EPS.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And Jeff, maybe if I could just ask one follow-up then. Obviously, you reported a couple of quarters in a row here, decent upside, but yet the quarters didn't have any share repurchasing at the past 2 quarters. So what's your thought there given the remaining $450 million on the authorization? I mean, when do you expect to start to get active on that front again?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I think it's a great question. But as you know, we would never tell exactly if and when we're going to be repurchasing shares. I will say it's always an option, right? We do have that $450 million less -- left, I'm sorry, we do intend to be opportunistic about it. And depending on market conditions and us having an available window to purchase, et cetera, I think it's an option at any point.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So there's no debt maturities, or there's no reason you're taking your leverage down or anything along those lines? You're just kind of waiting to be opportunistic?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Correct. We have no intention of changing our debt level at this point, or reducing our debt level at this point, let me put it that way. So no, it's really just a matter of being opportunistic and flexible.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But maybe a couple of clarifications. Jeff, you kind of said on the Medical, when we think about the expenses versus benefits. You said that fiscal '13, we're going to have a full depreciation then plus the ongoing annual cost that you said the benefit should exceed the annual cost. But is that to say that it doesn't exceed both that and the depreciation?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","No. When I was referring to annual cost, I was including depreciation in that.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So still our net benefit in '13 is positive?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Correct.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the commodity headwind, you said $5 million to $15 million, right?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, that's correct.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. As we think about the distribution, though, through the year, is it fair to think that we are looking at sort of a net benefit in the first half of '13, but then maybe it turns a little more headwind in the back half of '13? [indiscernible]","George S. Barrett","I don't want to get too specific at this point until we work through our final budget. And quite honestly, it's really only the first 3 months or so that we have really good visibility, so we're basing the rest of year off of forward range, et cetera right now. So I wouldn't like to be too specific about the seasonal pattern at this point. I think I'll just leave it at the overall impact of $5 million to $15 million. And probably as we get to August, we'll give a little bit more detail in terms of quarterly impact in that regard.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe the last question, just going back to P4 here. So this contract that you guys lost, can you talk about what occurred that made the contract move here or that the people lost it? And does the market gain, sort of this consulting side of the business, remain important to the specialty strategy?","George S. Barrett","Again, I'm not going to be able to share. We didn't actually lose -- we lost business with a customer, so we didn't lose a customer. We lost business with the customer. It just happened to be high-margin business. And as I said, it's sort of -- we're at that stage where we can feel this kind of bump. I would say right now that even the marketing services, they're still part of the strategy, I think Meg and team have continued to -- will look at the areas of greatest potential for us. We are -- in some ways, we have a disadvantage in being a little bit of a smaller business, and we have the advantage of being a smaller business, which is that we can do a lot of course correction and forward-looking thinking about how to evolve this business. So just remember that we've actually picked up a fair amount of new business in Specialty. But the margin impact of a loss of this part of this customer's business is meaningful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My other question is if we step back and look at the business, and I'm talking about the distribution business, say the intermediate term. Let's say we're in a world where maybe 5% of the drugs have gone generic and that caliber slows down and we're in a deflation cycle. What was the -- in your mind, George, what does the profit picture look like for the business intermediate term? Are we just kind of stuck in a profit deflation cycle, and you've got to be clever with using capital and continuing to diversify around other businesses?","George S. Barrett","Yes, John. I wouldn't say we're stuck in a profit deflation cycle. We will see cyclical pricing on generics, which certainly affect the business. But by and large, our generic business through the cycle is growing, and the profit that comes from that business is meaningful, continues to be meaningful. And so much of that has to do with the way we run the program, that has to do with our ability to penetrate accounts, our sourcing models, our ability to use scale. And so, yes, I wouldn't translate the -- necessarily, the deflation of the product, they come out of exclusivity to a long-term sense of stagnation, that's not the way I see it.","Operator","And with no further questions in queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to George Barrett for any closing remarks.","George S.

I think it's safe to say that this has been a full year for all of us at Cardinal Health, concluding with a strong fourth quarter. And for the year, we exceeded virtually all of our financial goals. Our non-GAAP operating earnings were up 10% to $2 billion. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.73, up a robust 16%. This included a favorable tax settlement of $0.18 per share in the third quarter. In addition, our organization did a great job of driving capital efficiency, generating $1.7 billion in cash from operations for the year. We returned over $800 million to shareholders in fiscal 2013 through both our differentiated dividend and share buybacks. We finished our fiscal 2013 with financial strength, scale, a strong customer and product portfolio and a deep bench of organizational talent, and we accelerated the strategic repositioning we began several years ago. Based on all of these dimensions and in a time of great change within the industry, it was an excellent year.","Over the past few years, you've heard me say that healthcare is an incredibly exciting place to be. I feel the same today as we've closed out another fiscal year, but it's with a clearer sense of what is going to make it exciting.","We are in the early stages of an unprecedented demographic wave, which is bringing nearly 10,000 people per day to eligibility age for Medicare. Even if we put aside the political implications surrounding that reality, the fact is that we have an aging population, many of whom suffer from at least one chronic illness and whose life expectancy has already increased by nearly 9 years in less than half a century as a result of medical innovation, and the needs of this population will only increase over their lifetime.","We have built our strategies and our actions around 5 key principles: first, demographic, economic and industry forces will require a healthcare system which places a high priority on efficiency and cost-effectiveness; second, care will need to be more coordinated and delivered in multiple settings, leaning towards those settings which are most cost-effective; third, people will want and need care in the home, and they will become increasingly knowledgeable and involved in their own healthcare; fourth, our healthcare system will need continued innovation of pharmaceutical and medical products, but also cost-effective alternatives to mature products; and fifth, as part of the system shift from fee-for-service to payment-for-outcomes, hospitals and IDNs will increasingly look to partners with specialized expertise in this new environment. With that as a backdrop, I'll provide further color on our 2013 performance.","Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered another strong year of profit growth and margin expansion, while growing our customer base, expanding our generic programs and broadening our specialty offerings to providers, biopharmaceutical companies and payers, and I'll touch on all of these. We've also been making the appropriate organizational and strategic adjustments in anticipation of the end of the Walgreen contract, which expires on August 31. We are, of course, pleased to have renewed our supply agreement with CVS. And this, combined with other customer renewals and wins, and with outstanding work by our Pharmaceutical Distribution team, have strengthened and diversified our customer portfolio.","We completed the acquisition and integration of Dik Drug, adding to our independent pharmacy base, while we strengthened our position with hospitals and institutional pharmacies. We expect pharmaceutical demand to increase in the coming years. This is among the most efficient components of our U.S. healthcare system. And from a value standpoint, our system gets high returns in outcomes from the 10% of healthcare spend, which goes toward drug costs.","Our evolving product mix in our Pharma segment closely aligns with the trends in the pharmaceutical industry. Generic drugs are assuming a greater position in the overall pharmaceutical pie with each passing year, now accounting for 83% of total U.S. prescriptions. We've grown our position and our scale in generics, and we work closely with generic companies around the world to bring value to them and to the market. This has been a strong contributor to our overall Pharmaceutical segment profit margin expansion of around 30 basis points for both the fourth quarter and for the year.","At the same time, we realize that an increasing portion of pharmaceutical research and innovation is going into specialty drugs which address unique medical needs. Further, biopharmaceutical companies are studying and targeting smaller subsets of patients who need to be served in an integrated and high-touch way. Supporting this, our Specialty Solutions group has continued its steep revenue growth. Our confidence continues to grow that a valuable approach to working with providers of care, biopharma companies and payers to encourage that these drugs are delivered and used in a patient-centered model, and one which acknowledges the need for cost-effectiveness.","Before I leave the Pharma segment, I'm sure you saw in our press release that we're taking a substantial impairment charge associated with our Nuclear Pharmacy Services division. Jeff will discuss this in more detail, but let me say that Nuclear Pharmacy had contributed almost $1.6 billion to the company's profits over the past decade. But the change in demand dynamics for a number of these products has resulted in a lowering of its future financial output. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge to reflect our analysis of the estimated fair value of the business. I should remind you that we are the industry leader in this business and we will continue to work closely with our large and broad base of customers who depend on our radiopharmaceutical products and our expertise in this field.","2013 was a very important year for our Medical segment. We took significant steps in repositioning this business to align with the evolving marketplace, including completing major investments to rebuild our IT infrastructure, reorganizing and redeploying our assets, both human and capital, and ramping up activities in areas of strategic priority, which I'll detail in a moment. And of course, we completed the very significant acquisition of AssuraMed, which enables us, for the first time, to follow the patient to their home. These efforts led to margin expansion of 25 basis points and double-digit segment profit growth for fiscal 2013 for the Medical segment.","We've been very clear that we place a high priority on anticipating the changes in our marketplace and on taking the actions necessary to continue to deliver value to hospitals, IDNs and alternative sets of care, as well as to our manufacturing partners.","We've reconfigured our go-to-market model and our offerings so that we can work with medical device and lab equipment companies and with providers to get products to patients more efficiently and throughout the continuum of care. The acquisition of AssuraMed was a major step in that direction. Over time, more care will be delivered in the home. All of us are likely to experience this directly ourselves or with members of our family. And integrated healthcare systems and payers alike recognize that patients who are well cared for at home are less likely to be readmitted to the hospital. So we're excited about the acquisition of AssuraMed. The integration is going extremely well and it's exceeding our expectations.","Our efforts around our preferred product portfolio address the continuing need for lower-cost alternatives to mature medical devices, and our activities in this area accelerated during the year, increasing overall penetration and opening the opportunity for greater growth. This past year, we've broadened the reach of the portfolio by adding over 150 products in 9 categories.","As it relates to medical utilization, we've now seen a somewhat sustained period of soft utilization in the U.S. market. We've all heard the debates around whether this is the result of consumer caution, a byproduct of our slow recovery from recession, or a more structural slowing of utilization linked to changes in benefit design and incentive systems and a more consumer-like patient. I'm not sure that we can really be precise in answering that debate, but we do believe that while these trends will tend to moderate per capita utilization, the inescapable and overwhelming force of demographics will continue to be a driver of overall growth for our business in the long term, and the composition of our product and service lines should give us the opportunity to grow our profits even in a slow-growth, short-term environment. Many of these same healthcare forces are at work in other markets, and we recognize the opportunity to expand our healthcare expertise.","Specifically, in China, we've been using our capabilities, scale and unique value proposition to build a strong and sustainable reputation and enhance our strategic alignment of biopharma and medical device companies essential to participating successfully and for the long term in this rapidly growing healthcare system. This year, our revenues in China grew 45%, reaching $2 billion. We're tremendously excited by the opportunities to broaden the scope of our business model, to match the needs of that market and to support our manufacturer partners who want to grow their businesses there. So with this as a backdrop, let me put some context around our expectations for 2014.","For the Pharmaceutical segment, we expect revenues to decline in fiscal 2014, primarily due to the expiration of the Walgreen contract. That said, you will see a continued emphasis on building generic scale and capabilities as we further enhance our ability to move market share for our manufacturer partners and to assure best-in-class availability of quality and pricing for our customers. This should continue to drive both generics' profitability and our overall segment margin due to utilization, customer and product mix, and our program strength.","We also see opportunities to grow both our specialty and biopharma businesses through innovation and new business models that create additional value for providers and manufacturers who focus on high-touch, high-cost disease areas. This will include the continued introduction of new technology solutions such as our PathWare tool that, along with payer and physician collaboration, can create standardized clinical pathways to improve the quality and the cost of caring for patients with complex diseases.","We will continue to strengthen our offerings to our independent pharmacy customers in fiscal 2014. We're starting the year off with a gathering of thousands of owners and pharmacists at a retail business conference next week. The focus is on sharing best practices, networking, continuing education and providing the latest tools and technologies available to help these critical members of the healthcare system improve their patient -- improve patient care, efficiency and profitability of their businesses. And we will increasingly bring our experience to hospital systems who can benefit from our expertise in clinical pharmacy.","Switching to our Medical segment. Our ability to serve across the continuum of care with a broad line of products and services has never been more important. We are working closely with our diverse set of customers and manufacturers to help them thrive in a changing landscape. Our preferred products portfolio will be ramping up. And throughout fiscal year 2014, you will see accelerated new product introductions designed to bring quality, value and enhance clinical benefits to our customers. We know there are significant opportunities to increase our services to hospitals, ambulatory settings and the home, and we will be aggressively pursuing the cross-enterprise opportunities, which leverage the AssuraMed acquisition and our supply chain management expertise.","In summary, our Medical segment brings many tools to drive efficiency for our partners, whether it's a unique 3PL supply chain offering or a specialized surgical kit which reduces movement around the operating room in the likelihood of a safety event; or a set of offerings geared toward systems which are focused on increasing healthcare coordination; or a lower cost alternative to a trauma product; or now with AssuraMed, our ability to adjust patient needs in the home, we are positioning our Medical segment for growth.","In China, we look for another year of strong revenue and profit growth, as we continue to expand our geographic footprint in 2014, and add new business partnerships and programs in areas like consumer health and direct-to-patient distribution. Cardinal Health, as a brand, will become more important not only to healthcare providers, but to consumers as well, as we continue to grow our direct-to-patient specialty pharmacy business there. We believe we have already both strong equity as a trusted partner, a partner who can offer strong and compliant business practices that are critical in this transforming marketplace.","So putting this all together, given our ongoing momentum, we are projecting fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $3.45 to $3.60, an increase from our initial expectations we provided earlier this spring.","So we turn the page on fiscal 2013, a year that was anything but ordinary, one which we regard as an important inflection point in our strategic and competitive position. I want to express my appreciation for all of our colleagues, all 34,000 of them, and to our customers, our manufacturer partners and our shareholders, who have supported us through a year which had more than its share of twists and turns, but from which we emerged stronger and more confident in our future.","I'll end with a reminder that the notion of being essential to care is not just a tagline to us, it's what drives us. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Jeff to provide more details on the quarter and the full year, and guidance for fiscal '14.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review the drivers of fourth quarter and full year performance. Then I'll provide additional detail on our fiscal '14 guidance, including some of our key expectations and underlying assumptions. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","I'll start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported an 8% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter versus the prior year's period. This was driven by a robust 11% non-GAAP operating earnings growth, partially offset by a higher tax rate and additional interest expense.","Let me go through the rest of the income statement in a little more detail, starting with revenues. Consolidated revenues were down 5% to $25.4 billion, which was better than our expectations. The decline was due to the expiration of the Express Scripts contract at the beginning of Q2 of this fiscal year. Gross margin dollars increased 10%, with a rate up 66 basis points versus prior year. As a result of our strategic initiatives, including our efforts to drive favorable customer and product mix, we have successfully expanded our year-over-year gross margin rate every quarter for the past 3 years. SG&A expenses rose 9% in Q4, driven by recent acquisitions, which comprised 6.1 percentage points of this growth and investments in certain strategic priorities.","Due to our continued focus on cost controls and efficiency of our operations, our core SG&A costs were essentially flat versus last year. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 27 basis points to 1.86%. You will notice that our net interest and other expense came in higher in the fourth quarter than in prior quarters, primarily due to the new $1.3 billion of debt associated with the AssuraMed acquisition. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was about 37% versus the prior year's 36%. Our non-GAAP diluted average shares outstanding were 345 million for the fourth quarter, approximately 4 million favorable to last year. As I indicated in our third quarter earnings call in May, we expected to complete at least $250 million of share repo in the subsequent months. We did accomplish that during Q4, which brought our full year share repurchases to a total of $450 million. We had $400 million remaining on our board-authorized repurchase program at the end of the quarter.","During fiscal 2013, we also returned another $353 million to shareholders in the form of dividends.","Now let's discuss consolidated cash flows in the balance sheet. We generated $300 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, ending the year with approximately $1.7 billion in cash flow from operations. This was much better than our original expectations, driven by earnings performance, product mix, our continued focus on working capital management and timing.","At the end of Q4, we had $1.9 billion in cash in our balance sheet, which includes around $425 million held internationally. During the quarter, we also repaid $300 million for the 5.5% notes that matured in June, leaving our year-end debt balance at $3.9 million. Our working capital days ended the quarter virtually flat versus prior year, with increased days inventory on hand, offset by higher payable days, primarily driven by product and customer mix.","Now let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss Pharma first. In line with our expectations, Pharma segment revenues decreased 6% to $22.8 billion due to the expiration of the Express Scripts contract. This decrease was partially offset by revenues from expanded customer relationships. Of particular note, sales to non-bulk customers continued to increase, up over 5% for the period, and contributed close to 70% of Pharma segment revenues.","Our generic programs, once again, performed well. And we continue to see continued brand inflation in the high-single digits, about as we expected. Pharma segment profit increased by 11% to $395 million, driven by the overall strong growth in generics and strong performance under our branded pharma contracts. With respect to generics, we did, as expected, see less contribution from new generic launches in this year's quarter versus Q4 of fiscal 2012. Sequentially from Q3, generic deflation moderated slightly to the lower-single digits. Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 28 basis points compared to the prior year's Q4, a reflection of the strength of our generics programs and our focus on margin expansion, including customer and product mix. In addition, within customer categories, margin expansion in Pharma Distribution was strong across most of our customer classes of trade.","Before wrapping up my discussion on Pharma, I want to spend a few moments on Nuclear and then touch on a Pharma-related reporting change. As George mentioned, the challenges stemming from lower forecasted demand from the radiopharmaceutical industry have increased. In conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated year-end financial statements, and as an output from the completion of our annual planning process in June, we recently completed our annual goodwill impairment test. As part of this annual test, we concluded the entire goodwill amount of our Nuclear Pharmacy Services division was impaired, resulting in a noncash impairment charge of $829 million or $799 million net of tax.","As background, the majority of the goodwill of Nuclear was acquired through our acquisition of Syncor International Corporation in fiscal 2003. Before the impact of the impairment charge, we had a total of approximately $1 billion of invested capital in nuclear accumulated over the past 12 years. Over that same time, excluding allocated corporate costs, nuclear has contributed almost $1.6 billion in profit to the company and been very margin-accretive to the overall company results. However, as previously disclosed in our second and third quarter 10-Qs, nuclear has been experiencing significant softness in the low-energy diagnostics market.","During the second half of fiscal '13, we experienced sustained-volume declines and price erosion for the core low-energy products provided by this division. In addition, we saw reduced sales for some existing high-energy diagnostic products, lower-than-expected adoption of new high-energy products and recent reimbursement development that may adversely impact the future growth of these products. Using this information, we adjusted our outlook and long-term business plans for this division in connection with our annual budgeting process, which we recently concluded. This update resulted in significant reductions in the anticipated future cash flows and estimated fair value for this reporting unit. I should note that this impairment charge does not impact our liquidity, cash flows from operations or compliance with debt covenants.","Before I leave our discussion of the Pharma segment, I also want to make you aware of a Pharma-related reporting change going forward. For some time now, we've been reporting bulk and non-bulk revenues and margins. Given that a large portion of our bulk business either has been, or will soon be, removed from -- through the expiration of 2 contracts, bulk margin is no longer a relevant data point for our business. Therefore, beginning in fiscal 2014, we will no longer be breaking out bulk and non-bulk revenue or margin. Our fiscal 2013 10-K will be the last reporting period showing this data.","Now moving to the Medical segment performance. Medical revenue growth was up 11% versus last year, an increase of $265 million. The AssuraMed acquisition was the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. In addition, we're pleased to report 31% Medical segment profit growth in Q4. The AssuraMed acquisition was a primary driver of profit growth. I'll note here that the full year net accretion impact of AssuraMed, including the related financing costs, was $0.04 versus our original expectations of $0.02 to $0.03. Our preferred products were also a positive contributor of profit growth in the quarter, as we focused on product improvement and cost efficiencies. As George discussed, we again saw a procedural volume softness in the U.S. market, which had some moderating impact on our segment results. Also partially offsetting the Medical segment profit growth was the year-over-year increase in incentive compensation, much of which is based on total company performance and allocated to the segment.","Finally, Cardinal Health China, which spans both segments, posted strong revenue growth of over 70% for the quarter. As George mentioned, China achieved a $2 billion revenue figure this year. I am very proud of our management team and employees in China, who continue to drive results and expand into new geographic areas and product lines.","Turning to Slide #8, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter, which include items that reduce our GAAP results by $2.51 per share compared to non-GAAP.","Included in this figure is the exclusion of $2.32 worth of impairments, almost all of which relate to the previously mentioned goodwill impairment charge in the nuclear division. Also included is $0.11 of acquisition-related costs, which reflects $0.09 of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and $0.06 of restructuring costs.","In Q4 last year, GAAP results were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP results, primarily related to acquisition-related costs. While on the topic of GAAP results, I'd also want to point out our usual GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 in the year, which were primarily driven by the goodwill impairment charge in nuclear, most of which had no tax benefit.","I have one final housekeeping item related to our GAAP results. Due to the loss of continuing operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal '13, per accounting guidance, we used the basic share count when calculating both the basic and dilutive Q4 GAAP earnings per share.","Now let me make a few comments about 2013 in total. For the full year, non-GAAP operating earnings were up 10%. I am very pleased with our excellent progress on margin expansion with both the gross margin rate and the non-GAAP operating margin rate increasing versus last year, up 65 basis points and 29 basis points, respectively. As reported, our FY '13 non-GAAP EPS of $3.73 represents 16% year-on-year growth, which you may recall, includes an $0.18 favorable tax settlement in Q3. Excluding this settlement, we reported double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. I echo George's comments about our achievements this past year, and thank our employees for their contributions. We had a strong financial finish to the year, marked by significant progress on our strategic initiatives. And again, our results enabled us to return over $800 million to shareholders in fiscal '13 through both share buybacks and our differentiated dividend. Our performance in fiscal '13 provides a solid foundation from which we've launched 2014.","Now I'll move to our fiscal 2014 outlook. As you know, we provided some early thoughts on the year on our May call. And at that time, we indicated our preliminary target for fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share was to be at the high-end of the range of $3.42 to $3.50. Today, having completed our budget process, we're providing formal guidance and are raising our range to $3.45 to $3.60. We do expect revenue will be significantly lower as the Walgreens contract will only contribute 2 months during the year and Express Scripts will anniversary its 1-year expiration on September 30.","I'll now walk through our corporate assumptions for the year. Our anticipated diluted weighted average shares outstanding are approximately $343 million benefits from the $250 million in recent share repo I mentioned earlier, and assumes a small amount of additional repo. We will continue to assess further opportunities for share repurchases as the year progresses, keeping in mind our cash balances, possible strategic investments and market conditions. We expect net interest and other expense of $145 million to $155 million, which approximates our current run rate and reflects the AssuraMed financing.","For fiscal '14, we expect capital expenditures in the range of $245 million to $265 million, with the bulk of that spending on our strategic priorities and IT investments. We also expect amortization of intangible-related assets and prior acquisitions to be approximately $180 million or $0.33 per share. AssuraMed is the primary driver of the increase versus last year. We're projecting an overall non-GAAP tax rate in the range of 34.5% to 36%. This tax range reflects our expectations of further discussions and potential settlement of outstanding audit periods, as well as the benefit of our tax planning efforts. The range is wider than our typical assumption in order to capture the range of outcomes for a few large moving pieces this coming year. We expect the discrete nature of resolving or clarifying certain items to result in quarterly variability in our tax rate.","Finally, although we do not provide specific cash flow guidance, I will remind you of my comments regarding the expiration of the Walgreens contract. We anticipate a net after-tax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2014 of more than $500 million based on the expected working capital decrease, loss after-tax earnings and other cash tax impacts.","Finally, let me comment on a few segment-specific assumptions beyond those which George or I may have already mentioned. In Pharma, we're planning for the brand inflation rate to be similar to fiscal '13. Generic programs are projected to grow in profit contribution despite an expectation of lower year-on-year contribution from new generic launches, and we do not expect a LIFO impact during the year. In Medical, clearly, we plan for a strong contribution from AssuraMed. We'll also be continuing to invest aggressively in the development and rollout of our preferred product portfolio. We expect the headwinds -- we expect a flat utilization environment and approximately $10 million of incremental expense related to the medical device tax.","In addition, since I often get asked about the impact of commodities, based on our current forecast, we anticipate a year-over-year cost of goods increase in the range of $10 million to $20 million. Finally, a word on any anticipated growth from the Affordable Care Act. This is very difficult to project for either segment. Therefore, in our assumptions, we have not include any associated change in demand for fiscal 2014 at this stage. We plan to keep our operations lean and utilize our flexible model to capture any upside as it materializes.","In closing, I feel very optimistic as we head into fiscal '14. We're excited about our customer and product portfolio and the potential of our strategic priorities, and we'll continue to focus on actions that lead to margin expansion and earnings growth.","With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Stephan calling in for Bob. Maybe you can touch on how your customer conversations have been? It's been a couple of months since losing WAG. Anything changed there, particularly with the independence?","George S. Barrett","Stephan, it's George. And as you know, we've been devoting a lot of energy over the last years to strengthening our position in the independent market. That continues to be an area of focus for us. Our conversations are very good. We devote most of our energy to what we can do to make them a more competitive and thrive in their marketplace, don't -- devote a lot of energy to that particular change. I would say right now, many of these customers are sort of wait-and-see mode to see what implications of various industry transactions mean. But we are really feeling good about our position with our independent customers, very committed to their growth and devote considerable energy to them.","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I guess, lastly on the share count. It's a bit higher than we were expecting for 2014 if you were to assume a normal course of buybacks. You did note a small amount of buybacks in the expectations. Any reason to think that they could be lower than a normal course, normal year from a course of buybacks?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Stephan, this is Jeff, thanks for that question. So we finished the end of Q4 with about 343-ish million shares outstanding on a diluted basis. And that reflects the $250 million of shares we bought back in Q4, which was really a pull ahead of some of the shares that we expected to buy back in '14. As I said, we expect the average rate over the course of '14 to be about that same 343 million, which really means that the additional repo that we'll do in '14 will largely be allocated towards offsetting any dilution from the issuance of shares over the course of the year. And that's what's reflected in our guidance. That all said, as I said in my prepared remarks, we have a strong balance sheet. We're going to continue to generate good cash in fiscal '14. And as opportunities permit, based on our cash balances, based on the attractiveness of other strategic opportunities, there's nothing to say that we wouldn't pursue additional repo over the year, and I would view that as an upside.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So a couple of quick questions here. First, you mentioned you expect continued softness in nuclear in fiscal '14. But I think, for us, we're just trying to figure out is there any sort of ballpark approximation of the EPS impact year-over-year of the softness in that unit. Are we talking about just like a $0.05 of EPS or something greater than that? Just trying to frame how much that hurts you year-over-year. And that's obviously excluding the impairment charge when thinking about that?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, thanks for the question, Steve. As we said, we have seen a continued decline in the nuclear business to an extent greater than what we had been expecting perhaps earlier in the year. And at this point, our forecast assumes that decline to continue, both in terms of the overall market demand and some of the pricing impacts we're seeing related to that. It is a negative impact next year, again, versus FY '13. I think quantifying it in the $0.05 range is probably a reasonable approximation at this point. And that's probably -- that's net of some of the cost-reduction actions that we've taken to attempt to offset some of the impact, but it doesn't totally offset it. So I think your approximation is reasonable.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick big-picture question for George, since this topic came up on a few of your competitor calls. Just curious on any thoughts you have, big picture, around your appetite for global generic procurement collaborations? It seems to be coming up on the press, et cetera. I'm just curious to get your big-picture thoughts and anything you could say about that.","George S. Barrett","Lots in the press. As I said, we really -- we like our positioning. Our generics business is very strong, has great scale. We're growing. We are already very globalized in our procurement systems and the way we work. I guess what I'd say, we never dismiss any opportunity to continue to improve our business. But as I said, we're in a good position right now. We'll continue to compete aggressively and effectively, and always keep our minds open to ways to improve our business. But nothing I can say more than that.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Muken from ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So obviously, George, you talked about on the call, it's been an eventful year. You've had some time to reflect post sort of the WAG loss and obviously, you've been sort of dealing with Express for some time, and now we've had AssuraMed on board for over a quarter. So as you think about sort of what's transpired in the business, you sounded pretty resilient on your remarks. And I'm curious, just in general, where are you most focused in terms of where you want to drive this business? What are your kind of key takeaways from what you've learned as CEO from all this sort of trials and tribulations the last 12, 18 months? And how do you sort of wrap that all together in terms of the forward plan?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Thanks, Ross, how much time do we have? It's a great question. And I'll try to give a concise answer as much as I can, because there's a lot in there. Let's start with -- it's been a hell of a year, obviously, and I would say a really great year. But putting it all into context, which is, I think, what you've asked me to do here, I think if we go back even just 3, 4 years ago, I think it would've been hard for us to imagine that we could have done enough repositioning to be able to absorb the ending of a major contract like Walgreens. Our organization has done a fantastic job and really disciplined work to add strength and balance to our business and to our portfolio. We've had consistent growth, even with some turbulence around the system like what we've experienced this year in nuclear imaging, and honestly, I think we're forecasting a pretty strong fiscal 2014 while absorbing that nonrenewal. So in context, I feel really good about -- we are stronger, better balanced, better equipped from a talent perspective and better positioned, given some of the changes in healthcare. And some of which I described in my prepared remarks, we know that, that care is going to be changing. We know that some of the payment systems are going to reform. We know that there's going to have to be both innovation and competitive alternative products. And so I'm really proud of both our group and the work that's been done over the past years to sort of reposition us for growth. I think we know what we want to do. We're going to have to continue, as Jeff described earlier, to be really flexible and nimble and quick because the world is changing rapidly in healthcare. But I hope that gives you a little perspective.","Operator","Our next question is from Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jeffrey Bailin","This is actually Jeff Bailin in for Glen. If we could just talk for a moment on the Medical segment about the Medical Business Transformation, we haven't talked about that in a little while. Can you guys comment on if you're realizing some of the hoped-for benefits and maybe how the underlying legacy Cardinal Medical segment performed in the quarter?","George S. Barrett","Why I don't just -- why don't I start, Jeff, in answering that a little bit in sort of generally on the business transformation, and then I'm going to turn it to Jeff, who can probably walk through a little more of the detail. But let me start with this. I would just say the medical system is now fully integrated into our Medical business, which is great, and we'll continue to drive the effectiveness of this program in helping us serve our customers. We had -- got us a little bit of a slow start in the year with some change management issues. But as we worked our way through the year, I think we finish with most of our metrics, particularly the important one of service levels, exceeding our pre-transformation, pre-implementation levels. So from that standpoint, we're where we need to be. Jeff, if you want to add to that at all?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. For the quarter, the Medical Business Transformation was a net add to the profitability of the Medical segment. For the full year, it was essentially a wash. As George mentioned, we started off the year with some negative impact from it, really as we were cleaning up the remaining change management issues and getting the system fine-tuned. As we've gotten to the second half of the year, we've been focused on finishing up any remaining cleanup items, but really, more importantly, driving the benefits of the system not only in terms of some of the costs in inventory benefits that were expected early on as a result of the implementation, but much more importantly, by driving the use of the system through our sales teams, through our operating teams so that we can drive the longer-term strategic benefits with our customers, which is really why the system was meant to begin with. And we're beginning to see some of those benefits in the way that we can sell our preferred products, for example, to customers. Those benefits will continue to materialize in FY '14 and beyond. And at this point, we feel very good about the positioning of the system in terms of our ability to use it to drive those benefits. With regards to your second question about underlying performance of the medical business, if you strip out the AssuraMed benefit, I would say it was sort of a mixed story. Very happy to see increased contribution from the preferred products priority, which will continue to be a very, very key strategic initiative for us this year and beyond. Offsetting that was the continued procedural softness that both the George and I referenced. That's sort of become a reality, at least for the near term, that we're dealing with. And we feel we have lots of tools to deal with that and continue to grow earnings in a flat utilization environment. But then I also mentioned, this is more of a sort of technical accounting issue, but as we trued-up our incentive comp for the year, which is largely driven by consolidated performance, particularly as it relates to our 401(k) contribution, those true-ups got pushed down to the Medical segment, and that tended to have a dampening impact on segment profit as well. But all things considered, actually, we feel pretty well about how Medical ended the year and how they're positioned heading into FY '14.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","George and Jeff, when you think about nuclear, does, strategically, it makes sense to continue to have it in your portfolio, given just the grimmer reimbursement outlook and the declining profitability?","George S. Barrett","So Ricky, I'll start and then if Jeff wants to, he can jump in on the financial side. We are still serving a great number of important customers. And so as you think about the basket of services that we might, for example, provide a large integrated academic medical center, our ability to support them is multifactorial. So we have many dimensions of how we serve them. And so I think, for us, this is an area where we continue to serve, and it's still a contributor to our business. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Jeff?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. First of all, Ricky, I'd say this is sort of margin-accretive business to the overall consolidated results. We continue to believe that there are scenarios in the future where, particularly in the PET technology space, there are opportunities for the cash flow forecast to improve from our current scenario. And I'll also say, like all parts of our businesses -- and this isn't unique to nuclear or anything else in our portfolio. We continually assess the value-add from keeping the business in our portfolio versus other arrangements. And at this point, we believe keeping it in the portfolio is best for the company and shareholders.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then I think in the prepared remarks, you said that AssuraMed in the quarter was -- came in ahead from your initial expectation. So when you think about the fiscal year '14 guidance, do you assume higher accretion from AssuraMed than what you've kind of like communicated earlier on?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. So we -- at the time that we announced the deal, we said that we expected AssuraMed to be at least $0.18 accretive in FY '14, net of financing costs. As we gone through our budgeting process and had 4 months now of actual results, we are very confident that the accretion impact in FY '14 will be at or above that $0.18.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallucci from Lazard Capital.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Jeff, 2 questions on the numbers, if I could. First, you mentioned the incentive comp and I was just trying to get an understanding of sort of the underlying growth within the medical-surgical segment, it was -- can you quantify that incentive number that had dropped down into that area?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, it was close to about $10 million of negative year-on-year impact from the incremental incentive comp.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then obviously lots of moving parts to next year. You sort of gave us your big-picture views. Would you care to, I guess, do 1 of 2 things: With respect to the drug segment, lots -- even more moving parts, can you give us any idea of what sort of margin ranges maybe you're expecting there? Or with the ramp down of Walgreens, and then I assume some cost-cutting in relation to that, how should we think about maybe the cadence of the quarters in the drug segment versus what maybe we've seen historically?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Sure. Well, let me handle those in reverse order, if I could, Tom. First of all, keep in mind that we still have Walgreens for the first 2 months of fiscal '14. So obviously, 2\/3 of Q1 has the benefit of continuing to support Walgreens. So I mean, that gives you a bit of an idea of quarterly cadence. Beyond that, I wouldn't get too specific. With regards to margin expansion, I mean, this is clearly focus #1, 2 and 3 for us as we go through '14, and it has been for the past 3 years, to make sure that we have the strategic portfolio and the operating focus on both the products, customers and the internal part of the business to ensure that we're driving margin expansion. We've had great success there for the past 3-plus years. I expect us to continue to drive that in FY '14 and beyond. I don't want to get too specific about the segment profit margins, but I think almost implicit in the guidance that we've given is a continued margin expansion overall for the company in FY '14.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kreger from William Blair.","Roberto Fatta","It's Robbie Fatta in for John today. If I could stick with AssuraMed, can you give us any updated thoughts on the competitive bidding front and how you think that might impact results in fiscal '14 and beyond?","George S. Barrett","Yes, it's George. We've sort of built this in, as you know, when we announced the acquisition. We did talk about the dynamics from a competitive bidding and that we had made some assumptions associated with that. We feel pretty good about those assumptions. One of the things that we might see around the market, and we are seeing some signs, if you look at some of the customer base in the DME area, I think we might see somewhat of a shakeup there and some consolidation among those customers who are doing DME. And I think that's, to some extent, attributable to competitive bidding and the dynamics around the market. But I think we had done a fairly good job of anticipating this, and feel good about how we're beginning 2014.","Roberto Fatta","Great, that's helpful. And then maybe longer term, it certainly sounds like the medical business is becoming a much more important part of the mix. As you look maybe 3 years out, how big of a percentage of operating income would you envision the Medical segment contributing?","George S. Barrett","Robbie, I don't think at this point we're comfortable giving a 3-year forecast on segment distribution at this point. I think it's safe to say we really feel good about both of our segments. We'll continue to invest in both of them. I think the medical area around healthcare is, obviously, in our national spend, obviously, a much bigger component. And while that presents some challenges, it also means there's more opportunities in some ways, because there's just such enormous activity in that area. So we're trying to stay very thoughtful about those changes, make sure our portfolio is diversified so that we can take a punch if one component of the portfolio is getting affected. And so we feel good about it. But I do not want to diminish, in any way, our commitment to our pharmaceutical work. It is a huge part of what we do. We do it extremely well. We've got a great team that we're building with the increasing know-how, particularly around clinical activity in the pharmaceutical side.","Operator","Our last question is from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","George, I had a couple of questions around generics. My first question would be that, clearly, in the quarter, you call out generics as being better than expected, although there were less new generics in the market. Can you talk about penetration within your customer base and where you are today and where you see it going? And then also, along those lines, have you changed your contracting at all with manufacturers that are driving this increase in profit? And should we expect that to continue into '14?","George S. Barrett","So there are couple of questions sort of built into that. It has been a strong period for us in generics. And you're correct, it hasn't necessarily been all about new launches. We have to be able to thrive in an environment where those come and go. I think we have continued to grow our general penetration, but I'd say at this point, it's pretty stable. We are at a very competitive position to anybody in the market. We will continue to try to inch that up. Some of it is also about penetration in the overall system. But I would say, from the standpoint of how we deal with each of our customers, we've probably done a good job over the last 3 years of really getting to a market-leading competitive positioning, and feel good about that and feel good about that going forward. More on generics, I would say, as you know, the environment in pricing tends to be, in the overall when you aggregate it, it tends to be affected by 1 or 2 big product sets, inflate or deflate, and that's certainly still true. But I would say in the overall mix of products, as we look at the broad basket of several thousand products, that environment is sort of as it was last time we spoke, which is a pretty good environment for us. And so I think that's probably a little bit of characterization on the pricing side. But as it relates to our work with manufacturers, we're trying to be very strategic about it, very thoughtful about not just where our customers are going and what they need in this marketplace, but also where the generic manufacturers are going and what they face, whether they're vertically integrated, nonvertically integrated, what's strategically relevant to them. So we try to build our strategy with each of them or around the things that we understand about their businesses. And we've tried to take a very thoughtful strategic approach to thinking about the upstream and how we work with our partners.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then George, I guess my second question would just be that people are all focused around this generic global purchasing. But my question has to do with really thinking about drug distribution globally. Clearly, China was up 45% this year. You've done really well in China. How do you think about the global market and are there other areas that you think are similar to China, and you think Cardinal will go in that direction internationally in the next few years? How should we think about that?","George S. Barrett","Yes, look, it's a fair question. Obviously, China's been a high priority for us, and I think we've done a really good job there. But it's hard, it's really hard to look at that as a global distribution market. I would say it's a global procurement market in many ways, but global distribution is a sort of different notion. Markets have very distinct characteristics. Some are very mature and completely saturated, some are government-controlled in terms of pricing, some are still in their early nascent period of -- and growing, but with financing dynamics. So we will be very disciplined. Thankfully, we've got a team with good knowledge of the global pharmaceutical and medical device world, and we're going to be very disciplined about how we look at international opportunities. If one had the characteristics of a market like China, of course, it will have some attraction to it. But there are others that we've looked at and see and just do not seem attractive and would not serve our shareholders as well.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to George Barrett for closing comments.","George S.

We hope to see many of you at an upcoming event.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We reported a strong quarter this morning, wrapping up an excellent first half to our fiscal 2016. Our second quarter revenues increased 23% to $31.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 14% to $726 million and we reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.30, an increase of 8% over the prior year.","Our organization continues to demonstrate the discipline necessary to compete in a very dynamic environment and the capacity and readiness to take the actions to position us to sustain growth over the long-term. We are confident about our position and our ability to create value for health systems experiencing change, and we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $5.15 to $5.35. This range represents an 18% to 22% growth rate over our fiscal 2015.","Both of our reporting segments demonstrated strong operating performance in the second quarter. Specifically, the Pharmaceutical segment reported significant profit growth and the Medical segment showed strong underlying performance, largely masked by the Cordis-related inventory fair value step-up. Adjusting for this, both segments reported robust revenues and double-digit growth in segment profit.","Turning to our segments. Our Pharmaceutical segment continued its momentum with a very strong second quarter. Revenue for the Pharma segment increased 25% to $28.3 billion and segment profit increased 16% to $627 million. Over the past few years, we've referred a number of times to the importance of having deep expertise in two specific areas in our Pharmaceutical business, in our drugs, which represent the vast majority of prescriptions filled in the U.S. and specialty pharmaceuticals, which account for many new launches and a significant number of development projects in the pipeline of the pharmaceutical industry. As you know, these products tend to require very distinct capabilities. We continue to show excellent progress in both of these areas.","As it relates to generics, we continued to grow our base of customers spanning independent pharmacies, chain, mail order, institutional and hospital pharmacies. Our generics program is designed to meet the needs of our pharmacy customers who recognize that generic drugs are extremely important to support their patients. And our program has strengthened through the purchasing capacity of Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health. While our generics program is an important offering for all of our customers and for us, it is also the broad and deep range of services that we provide to these customers, which enabled pharmacists to provide clinical support both to their patients and to the physicians with whom these pharmacists will increasingly be coordinating.","As more precision medicine emerges from the pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry, our specialty solutions group built the linkages between biopharmaceutical manufacturers and physicians and to help manage the complexity in delivering this important care to patients. Our specialty solutions business continues its steep growth trajectory, growing both in our base of provider customers we serve and in the tools that make us an outstanding partner to biopharmaceutical companies. We're confident that our specialty solutions sales will exceed $8 billion for our fiscal 2016.","Our Medical segment continues its repositioning and is adding value through reinvigorated distribution businesses, new product lines and services as well as new channels inside and outside of the U.S. Revenue for the Medical segment was up 9% to $3.2 billion. Segment profit declined 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. And remember, that this is the first quarter that includes the impact from the Cordis-related inventory step-up. Excluding that impact, Medical segment profit growth was 10% versus the prior year. Mike will provide more color in his commentary.","The work that we're doing in consumables, physician preference items, medical supplies to the home, our service offerings and discharge management all align with the trend toward value-based payment models. Related to this, it's our ability to bring our increasingly complex customers the full Cardinal Health portfolio across both our Medical and Pharmaceutical segments that will help as new payment and delivery models begin to emerge.","Our business in China continues to grow at double-digit rates. Of course, China has been a subject of considerable economic news over these past months and while the economic slowdown has significant impact for many industrials, the impact in the services sector has been more muted. Healthcare specifically continues to be a national priority. China's policy reforms, aging population, public health issues and expanding middle class have created increased opportunities for scaled healthcare solutions, and we expect the healthcare market in China to continue to grow.","Finally, a few words on Cordis. As you know we closed the acquisition of Cordis on October 2, 2015. This is not a simple integration process and our teams are doing an outstanding job managing all of the many moving parts across multiple markets. The integration of Cordis has gone well and is on target. Of greatest significance, on day one, we were ready to serve customers and their patients seamlessly in markets across the globe. Our new Cordis leadership team is off to a strong start and this reinforces our optimism that Cordis will serve as a platform for growth.","As the healthcare market introduces fee-for-value models, our physician preference items strategy is designed to help our customers meet this challenge. Our offering of products combined with business model innovation that includes services and analytics creates real value for our customers. Cost effective, meaningful and measurable solutions, this is at the heart of our value proposition.","We closed out the first half of fiscal 2016 with strong results and well positioned for long-term growth. Ours is an organization that internalizes its mission. And seeing our people work to serve our customers through the extreme weather of the last few weeks is a reminder of their deep commitment, not only to our customers but also to their patients. And I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their work.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. As George mentioned, we had a strong quarter. And halfway through our fiscal 2016, we're off to a good start. We feel comfortable reaffirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. In my remarks, I first want to review our second quarter financial performance in more detail, and then I'll end with some additional color on our expectations for the full year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Second quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.30, growth of 8% versus the prior year. Starting with consolidated company results, revenues were $31.4 billion, growth of 23%. Based on what we've seen through the first half of the year, we are updating our full year revenue assumption from mid-teens to mid- to high-teens percentage growth versus the prior year.","Total company non-GAAP gross margin dollars were up 13%. Consolidated company SG&A increased by 13% versus the prior year with the vast majority due to acquisitions. We remain focused on disciplined management of our core SG&A to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $726 million, an increase of 14% versus the prior year.","Below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $43 million for the quarter. This is an increase versus the prior year, primarily due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and The Harvard Drug Group.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 37%. While this is three percentage points higher than the prior year, it is common for the rate to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. For the full fiscal year, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 35.5% and 37%.","Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were nearly 332 million shares, slightly fewer shares versus the second quarter last year. We did not repurchase shares in the quarter and had about $700 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. As I've said in the past, we will continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically in the context of our overall capital deployment strategy.","In the quarter, operations generated cash flow of nearly $1.5 billion. As a reminder, quarterly operating cash flows can be affected by timing. It's more representative to look at operating cash flow over a longer period, such as the first half of our fiscal year. Operating cash flow for the six-month period was $1.4 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we had a cash balance of $2.3 billion with $394 million held internationally. Overall, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet.","I'll now review segment performance starting with the Pharmaceutical segment. In the second quarter the Pharma segment increased revenues by 25% to $28.3 billion. This was a result of continued growth in our existing and new customer relationships, and to a lesser degree, the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. Segment profit increased 16% to $627 million, driven by growth from existing and new customer relationships, which includes strong performance from our generics program. The acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical also contributed to segment profit growth in the quarter.","Segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 17 basis points versus the prior year. As we previously mentioned, our new relationship with a large mail order customer, while positive from an earnings and capital standpoint, was dilutive to margin rates.","Our integration of Harvard Drug continues to go well. And while still early, we are on track to achieve our accretion targets of greater than $0.15 in this fiscal year and greater than $0.20 for fiscal 2017. Our specialty business had strong double-digit growth which includes the contribution from the acquisition of Metro Medical, which is also going well.","Of late, many of you been asking us about branded and generic manufacturer pricing. I'll share our current view, which is consistent with what we recently communicated at a mid-January webcasted event. We continue to model that branded manufacturer price increases will generally be similar to historical levels. This would be in line with our FY 2016 assumptions.","As it relates to generic pricing, over the last 18 months, our commentary and assumptions have been that generic inflation would moderate. In our fiscal 2015, that moderation was about as we expected. When we provided assumptions for our fiscal 2016, we communicated that we expected further moderation. In fact, we are seeing moderation in generic pricing. Although as we recently shared, it is somewhat steeper than we had originally modeled.","That being said, generic manufacturer pricing is only one piece of our overall generics program, which in total, we still see as meeting our expectations. Our solid work in sourcing, attracting new customers, penetrating existing customers, utilizing data and analytics, as well as executing on new item launches has been key in our overall success. I continue to be excited about our overall generics program and the different components we have created to ensure long-term sustainability. Overall, this was another solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment, and while there always puts and takes, the quarter was largely in line with our assumptions.","Now, let's go to the Medical segment performance. Second quarter revenues grew 9% to $3.2 billion driven by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Our at-Home business, which grew double digits, also contributed to top line growth for the segment. Segment profit decreased 8% versus the prior year to $106 million. As a reminder, this was the first quarter that included the acquisition of Cordis and the related impact of the inventory fair value step-up. Excluding the step-up of $21 million, the Medical segment profit grew 10%. The total step-up came in at about $0.08, which is lower than the $0.13 to $0.15 of EPS impact we had anticipated. We expensed $0.04 in Q2 and we will do the same in Q3. There will be no inventory fair value step-up to recognize in Q4.","In this quarter, the favorability of the step-up as compared to our original guidance was offset by some one-time items resulting from the execution of the transaction as well as FX. Looking to Q3, we expect the step-up favorability and FX to be a wash. Setting those non-operating pieces aside, as George mentioned, Cordis is off to a good start with all key personnel in place and day-to-day operations up and running. As we integrate the Cordis business through the remainder of our fiscal year, we continue to be excited and will work to drive efficiencies. As we previously shared, in FY 2017, we still expect the transaction to be greater than $0.20 accretive and increasingly accretive thereafter. We are also working towards achieving the $100 million of annual synergies as we exit our fiscal 2018.","Switching to other pieces of our Medical business, as expected, from an operational standpoint, our Canadian business has stabilized, though foreign currency created a bit of a headwind. The team there continues to work diligently to ensure we position our business for the future. Our Cardinal Health brand products continue to grow over and above the incremental increase from Cordis. Notably, we saw this growth in our strategic accounts, which are those customers that we have identified as key partners in the continually evolving healthcare landscape.","Turning to slide number six, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.32 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, as well as a $39 million LIFO-related charge. With the first half behind us, there are two variables I'd note that probably have the most impact on us achieving the very high end of our guidance range for the full year.","The first is generic manufacturing pricing levels, and the second is the net impact of foreign currency exchange rates related to our specific businesses. These items moving in our favor would push us toward the achievement of the very top end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $5.15 to $5.35 that we reaffirmed this morning. As a reminder, this is a growth of 18% to 22% to the prior year.","While there are a few moving parts, our overall breadth and presence across the continuum of care provides us with the confidence to deliver on our commitments. I believe we have positioned ourselves well in the first half. We continue to be focused on our customers and have the talent to drive results and execute against our strategic priorities.","Operator, let's now go to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. As a courtesy, please allow yourself one question and one follow-up question. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we'll take our first question from Eric Percher from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. With FX called out as one of the key elements to hitting the higher end of guidance, could you speak a bit to the exposure in FX now with Cordis under your control, and some of the elements of scale or maybe impact at the top end \u2013 top line as well as offsets at the profit line and maybe also touch on Canadian exposure?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Mike, why don't you \u2013 good morning, Eric. Mike, want to grab that?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Eric. As you can imagine with a company with our breadth, not only in our commercial operations overseas, we also have manufacturing operations overseas. We are seeing FX being both positive and negative depending on which country we're talking about and whether or not we're talking about on the manufacturing side or on the commercial operations. And so, clearly with Cordis, we are getting some additional exposure with FX with 70% of that business being overseas, but to be able to actually get in any detail about how that FX will be impacting our business exactly, it's really difficult to do that, and not something at this time that I'd be comfortable with talking about. But it's something that we'll take a look at as we go forward and decide how much more color we can provide.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is there \u2013 as you're considering that color at this point, is there a general rule of thumb that you've thought about, maybe even pre-Cordis in terms of when you see the exchange rate moving how much is naturally upset because of their location of operations?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","No, I wouldn't say there's a general rule of thumb because as one moves in one direction, often other ones could be moving in other directions so it's very difficult. Also as you can imagine with us just starting up with Cordis, we're just beginning to ramp up our hedging strategies and taking a look at all the things we can do in terms of hedging to be able to make sure that we have more consistent earnings. So it's just so early with the changes in the mix of our business, it's hard for me to be able to provide you a lot more detail than what I said, which is that right now, we see FX as a little bit of a headwind in the second half of the year, but other than that, I really can't give you more details.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question.","Operator","Thanks. We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. Mike, I think you mentioned that to arrive at the high end of your guidance, generic manufacturing needs to be at the a certain level. Can you just give us more color on your assumption at kind of like the high end of guidance range around generic pricing? Do you assume that it's going to accelerate from current levels, stay the same? And also, at the low end of the guidance range, what are you receiving for generic inflation?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ricky. I would tell you this. I think what we are trying to communicate there was that right now we're assuming that the moderation of generic pricing is steeper than we originally modeled at the beginning of the year. So generic pricing we expect to be a little bit more of a headwind in the second half than we had originally anticipated.","Now as I've mentioned, there's other things going in the direction which is why we reaffirmed our overall guidance. But the two things that we think that would need to go back to more similar to the first half would be FX and generic pricing. If they were to return to more similar levels as where they were in the first part of this fiscal year, then that would enable us to get to the very high end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Ricky, it's George, as a reminder, and I know I do this probably every call, but it's really important. This is a huge number of products in this line, so it doesn't take \u2013 that's one of the challenges always in modeling is that it doesn't take that many products moving to alter the overall equation. But in the big sense, it tends to be driven by a small percentage of the overall total of products.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just one follow-up, just because there are a number of moving parts in the quarter. So can you quantify for us what same-store top line growth for distribution segment after you normalize for Metro and for Harvard and for the new outcome (24:08) business. And also on the EBIT line, just what we think about with (24:13) normalized growth for the distribution segment.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","That would be hard to do, Ricky. Clearly, Harvard, Cordis, Metro Medical are all providing revenue uplift for us but other than the fact that we said they are one of the components of our revenue and earnings growth, we still are just having really robust activities in growth with our existing and new customers, and to split that apart would be difficult and not something I think would be right for us to do right now.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, I would probably add, if you look at the revenue line, the contribution is not overwhelmingly coming from the forces (25:01), it's really our core business and our customers and new customers.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question.","Operator","Okay. We will take our next question from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning, guys. It feels on the Medical side like we're trending kind of in a much better direction. And if you think about on sort of the base, (25:24) so let's put Cordis aside for a minute, it seems like the home piece is doing well. On the traditional base business, if you look at maybe ex what happened in Canada, where do you see the sort of key trends that are kind of moving in the right direction? And where do you feel like you've sort of met plan versus are there any areas in that piece where you actually feel like you've sort of exceeded plan?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, good morning, Ross. This is George. I'll take that and Mike, jump in. I think the underlying characteristics actually feel as good as they have in some time. I think partly the value proposition across our lines of business, Ross, helps us to sell the individual lines of business, because I think what \u2013 we're going to our customers who basically have very new kinds of strategic and financial needs with a line of products and services that I think touch those hot buttons. And I think increasingly, that just allows us to strengthen the position of each of the lines. So our underlying business feels like it's going pretty well. Of course, it's always competitive out there, but I think we've done a good job of articulating that value proposition. We've also done a good job, I think, Ross, in some of our legacy lines of improving efficiency and reducing cost where necessary, and I think that was also an important thing for us to do over this last year. So I think in general, we feel good progress along many of the lines in the Medical segment.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful, George. And again, just sort of sticking on Ricky's theme, because I think the heart of what everyone's trying to figure out is, amongst the three players, each of you obviously have slightly different generic businesses and transact slightly differently. And so can you help us understand? It seems like Cardinal has sort of weathered the storm, at least relative to one of your peers better in terms of a change in the market and you've had a more balanced portfolio in generics. Could you just help us philosophically understand maybe some of the differences at least as you see it for Cardinal relative to the peers?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll try to speak to Cardinal. It's really \u2013 it's tricky for me to try to speak for peer group and I shouldn't and probably won't. I think \u2013 what I would say is that as you guys look at peer groups \u2013 again, we have many different competitors in different lines of business, and I always have to remind you of that, but I think every business is different. Everybody's product line is different, their product mixes are different, and their customer mixes are different.","So from our standpoint, we've devoted a lot of energy over these last seven years to positioning ourselves both in terms of product line and in terms of customer mix to be on what we think are the right side of trends. And so again, this is not for me a comment on anybody else, but on our business. I think our teams have done a good job of segmenting our markets, understanding what their needs are and how we can attach value from our work to theirs. It's been a long process, but I think we're generally doing that fairly effectively. So it's a hard question to answer as a comparative answer, but I think I can describe our organization, which is very much focused on certain key trends and we have been for quite some time, and then really disciplined execution around priorities that tie to those.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and I would just add that I think that we've been really focused on the day-to-day blocking and tackling, as well as the strategic priorities that we're on. So when it comes to things like focused on our SG&A to really making sure that we're investing in the right places and controlling that, staying insanely focused on the customer to deliver value to them and listening to what they need, I really like what both the M and the P teams are doing there, and then you take a look at the acquisition on \u2013 the acquisitions in how we're performing on those has been excellent, and then overall, just execution against our strategic priorities. So all those things also, I think, are helping contribute to our success.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","And as a reminder, please allow yourself one question and one follow-up question. And we will now take our next question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions here. George, I know you mentioned earlier about your physician preference item strategy here and the shift to value-based care. Can you talk about, though, where your customers are at in this progress? I mean, if you look at sort of targets from CMS and, et cetera, it looks like there's aggressive targets out there, but hospitals might be moving at a little bit of slower pace here. Can you talk about how they are viewing it and how that fits into your strategy, and we could maybe see an acceleration and driving into your numbers? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I'll try. Good morning, Charles. This is a process. Obviously we have an enormous healthcare system that's been operating with a certain financing model for many, many years. So change doesn't happen overnight and we don't expect it to. So I think what's going to happen is we're \u2013 it's a process, we'll be living in a world in which both the fee-for-service model exists and alternate models are emerging. And I think again you can look around the country indifferent health systems and they're all responding differently. There are, of course, pressures from, as you said, the public and the private sector to move to some new financing levels models, which focus more on outcomes than activity. And I think everybody is at a different stage of adapting to that. What we've tried to do is make sure we're in a position to compete in either model.","In a fee-for-service model, we know how to do that, and I think, as Mike said, we're very disciplined about that, but we've started to build some tools that allow us to be a valued partner in models that are emerging. So I think as you're describing it's a mixed bag around the system but the pressure is to move towards some kind of value based exists and that's probably true here, and it's probably true elsewhere in the world as well.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Can you talk about M&A opportunities then as you keep trying to build out your capabilities here, how do you see the landscape understand you capabilities to attack on it? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that for us this is very hard to comment on. I would say this, as Mike highlighted in his commentary, we're got great financial capability, but for us it's always a question of strategic positioning, whether or not we see opportunities to enhance the capabilities, the scale, the efficiency of some operation we do or some market that ties onto some value that's really connected to a customer need. We'll continue to be op been minded about that as we have been. I don't think our view has changed as it relates to the overall balance of our capital deployment. We will look at that is one of the tools, and we'll continue to look if the opportunities are right. But we have the financial flexibility to do that and I think organizational capacity.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I agree. Our capital deployment policy hasn't changed. We still believe that CapEx is obviously number one on our list and then continuing with our differentiated dividend, and then we're going to look opportunistically at both M&A and share repurchases. And as George said, we're going to stay balanced and disciplined on that.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. George, just really want to follow-up, or Mike, want to follow up on thoughts around the Medical segment. Mike, I think you made a comment that Cardinal Health products grew again this quarter. Can you give us an idea of what you've seen from a growth rate perspective? And then secondly, I think you have this roll-out in the marketplace around where you can get the margin on the Medical segment over time. If I back out the one-time item around inventory, a step-up in the quarter, it looks like the margins are trending just above 4%. So can you talk to us about how do you reach that goal of above 5% over the next couple of years? Is that the private label product? What are the things that we need to see in that segment, and do you feel like you're on target for reaching that goal?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Let me start with first a couple things. I think first of all, our Cardinal Health brand product, even if you pulled out Cordis still we're able to grow. And so we were excited about the execution of the team being able to sell those products. So important to note even without Cordis, the Cardinal Health brand products did grow.","As you know, there's many margin initiatives in Medical that we can get to go after getting to our aspiration of 5.75%. And as you know that by definition, an aspiration means it's something you can think you can achieve, but it's hard-to-reach and it's something that you've got to get out and execute and get a lot of things done to do and we're not backing away from that aspiration. But it's not only growing the Cordis product, it's the other Cardinal Health brand, it's growing the at-Home business, which also had a nice revenue growth this quarter. It's also our services business, which tend to be higher margin rates. And we've always said all along that to get to that rate there would probably be additional M&A to get there. And so we're going to continue to evaluate in a very disciplined way other M&A opportunities to reach that goal.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","If we think about the comments that you made, additional M&A around tip to recycle, but do you feel like operationally you're where you wanted to be as we think about the margin today? Or do you see more enhancements that you need to do in your core business outside of acquisitions?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(35:26).","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I don't think whether it's Don or John or George or I or any of us are ever operationally where we want to be. We're always striving to get better. I mean, that's what I think makes us as successful as we have been lately is that we're always focused on getting better. But I do like where we're at on the Medical side as far as how they're executing on all those things I mentioned earlier like services, like the current products businesses, launching new products ourselves on our more commodity like lines, as well as driving our higher physician preference items. So I don't know. George, do you have anything else?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think that's right. We're going to be \u2013 I think one of the things that you hopefully will see for us as we have tried to adapt quickly where we need to, so for example, we talked about the legacy business on the Med-Surg (36:15) side, we had to make some moves, I think, really to tighten the reins there in certain parts of it, manage the expenses differently, but also manage the mix differently. And I think a lot of this is about that kind of discipline to manage both of the expense side, but certainly of the mix of products. I think that's an effective and important tool and we can still get better.","Operator","We will take our next question from George R. Hill from Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Mike, I wanted to follow up on Ross's question little bit. When we think about generic inflation, I guess, can you qualitatively talk about the buckets? Will you guys monetize either the inflation or the deflation, the buy side margin, the sell side margin, the carry margin? And how should we think about the importance of each of the buckets or the sizes of each of the buckets?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Obviously, George, I won't be able to get into lots of detail, but I'll give you a little bit of information to see if I can be helpful. First of all, we can make money in both an inflationary environment on generics or a deflationary environment. Historically, generics has been a deflationary environment and we've been able to make money in that. And so I look at it in two ways. Think about it this way: when generics are going up in price, you do make some inventory reevaluation income or some people call that buy side-margins. And so, in a deflating market, you don't make the upside on the inventory inflation but you're protected from any inventory exposure. You get floor stock adjusted.","So you basically, in an inflating environment, make the money on the \u2013 the extra bucket of money on the inventory inflation, but in both environments, you're able to reprice to the customer and be able to adjust your pricing in order to work on your margins. But I think one of the keys you have to remember whether you're in an inflationary or a deflationary environment, every single day, our goal is to keep our customers competitive. And our pricing is based often \u2013 it's not often \u2013 is based on what we need to do to be able to sell the products and keep our customers competitive as they look at things like reimbursement that impact them every single day. And so that's really important to us.","There's a lot more levers than just generic pricing. As I mentioned before, our ability to launch drugs effectively, penetrate current customers and existing customers. Red Oak has clearly been a driver of our ability there. There's just a lot of pieces to go together and it's hard to disconnect any one of those and try and quantify those when it's all blended together.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. Then maybe a quick follow-up on one of the other levers is. You hear a lot of also small and mid-sized brand drug manufacturers complaining about the fees that they pay to the wholesalers to access the channel. I know that brand drugs are the portion of the margin, as a portion of the total segment margin are a smaller piece. But how should we think about how important those fees from the smaller and mid-sized branded guys are, and what's to the risk to that segment of the business if they're consolidated away? And I'll hop off. Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think all of our manufacturer partners are important to us. We work really, really hard to make sure no matter what size you are, whether you're in Medical or in Pharma, that you're seen as important. I think that's one of the things that Red Oak has done a good job of also is working hard to treat every manufacturer like an equal partner.","But as you think about the pricing, sure, I think most suppliers were always going to say that their fees are too high. But we're very, very disciplined about how we charge our fees and we look at things like line extensions, whether they're controlled drugs, whether they're refrigerated drugs, all those different costs that we incur that they would have to incur that if they were to go direct, we look at those to understand what we should charge as a fee. And so, we work incredibly hard to make sure that we don't charge fees to manufacturers that would be more expensive than them going around us.","And so, I feel really confident with our model and our pricing that we're the most efficient way of getting products through the supply channel. I don't see any more country that's more efficient or any supply chain that's more efficient than the United States. And I think the other piece is \u2013 I can't even remember the last time there's been any other significant slot supply chain integrity issue in the U.S., and so that to me is incredibly important.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","George, I'd like to follow up again just having had some experience outside the U.S. The supply chain for pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is the most efficient, has the highest line item fill rates, is the safest, and is the most secure the world. So I think that this is something that is important to our partners. We actually generally hear very positive things from them about that work, and that's important in terms of our value proposition.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Operator, next question.","Operator","We will take our next question from Dave Francis from RBC Capital Markets.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and sorry to keep going back to the pricing well, but given the focus everybody's had on it of late, I had a couple more questions. First, from your seat, George and Mike, how are you seeing your end customers in the marketplace, whether it be health systems or PBMs or retailers, how are they reacting either strategically or operationally to the changing price dynamic in both the brand and generic baskets? And how is that affecting your business particularly?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Dave. It's a hard question to answer because it really depends what seat you're in. I do think that, as Mike described, all of our customers are influenced by the reimbursement dynamics, how they are compensated, and that companies are from the private sector or the public sector. I think what can be worrisome to them is when there's lags between how they get compensated in reimbursement or how they're \u2013 not just time lags, but lags in general between what their costs look like and what their reimbursement looks like.","So we just try to stay very close to it. It can vary by product and it can vary by different classes of drugs. But I do think it's an environment, which is, as you guys have all said, a lot of attention on this. We try to stay very close to it. I think we pride ourselves on having a certain intimacy with our customers and understanding where they are. So we try to make sure that we do everything that we can to put them in a position to be successful in serving their patients. But certainly, a lot of it has to do with reimbursement dynamics and what's happening around financing models in the system.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I think also, Dave, just so you know, I think while cost and reimbursement are obviously incredibly critical to our customers, there's a lot of other services that we provide that are helpful to them. Helping them take capital out by helping them manage their inventory, helping giving them a broader array of private label products or physician preference products or helping them with various types of programs to run their business are also critical. And so we try hard to find more than \u2013 while we focus incredibly hard every day on getting, being \u2013 have the best cost to provide great pricing, there's a lot of other pieces that are critical.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just to add one piece to that, one of the things that we find is that the absence of standardization around healthcare is often a source of inefficiency. And so one of the things that we've been able to help many of our customers do is standardize, for example, around consumable products. So when they do that, that tends to be much more cost effective, and so that's one of the tools that we use.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And as a quick follow-up, just to put a fine point on it, understanding there are a lot moving pieces in it, but would you characterize the overall generic basket today as still being moderately inflationary? Or have you seen it gone deflationary?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","It's clearly moderated significantly, so I would say it's very close to right almost a wash in between right now what we're seeing right now. So it's hard to say whether it's slightly inflationary or slightly deflationary, depending on the day of the week and where you are. But it has clearly moderated steeper than we had said. But again, while it's moderated more than we expected it to, we're doing really well overall in our overall generics program and like (44:50) the other components that are delivering valuable.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dave, as a reminder, because you described the overall basket, again just as a reminder, the overwhelming majority of products are moving the way they typically move. And then what tends to swing the total or the net aggregate is just a relatively small basket of products. And so I think that's probably worth noting all the time that you have thousands of products that are moving fairly typically.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question, operator.","Operator","Okay. We will now take our next question from David Larsen from Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk a little bit more about the Pharma operating margin itself? I mean it looks like revenue was good in the quarter, but according to our model, it looks like an 18 basis point contraction year-over-year and a slight decline in operating profit itself on a sequential basis. Just \u2013 I mean any more color around that? I mean is that new customer starts or is it all generic inflation or have you changed the way that you're pricing new business, sort of what Dave Francis was asking about? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No real fundamental changes to the way we're pricing or the competitive environment or anything like that. This is merely, the 18 basis points is really, the majority of it is the addition of a new customer that was added in the quarter that was at lower margin rates. And remember, we talked about this and that this is a situation, while the margin rates are lower, the amount of capital that we deploy is incredibly efficient. And so we're willing to take lower margin rates when we have the ability to manage our capital effectively.","As far as the sequential drop, remember last quarter, we did mention that there was about $0.11 in that quarter that we said were kind of like one-timers, part of it being those generic items that were operating a little bit differently than we anticipated. And then also, we had the acceleration of some of the benefits of our M&A in the quarter that was a little bit better than we thought. So, if you think about $0.11 of kind of extra in last quarter, the reason we talked about that then, it was to give you some insight that, that was kind of a way to think about how this quarter would be. So this was very much in line with what we expected for this quarter.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. And then you made some comments I think on the Cardinal home health business growing I think double-digits year-over-year. Is that the top line organic growth rate, the home health business growing over 10% per year on the top line? Is that correct?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that's top line.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question.","Operator","Okay. We will now take our next question from Garen Sarafian from Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone. On branded pharma contracts and inflation, Mike, you had mentioned last quarter that you try to proactively manage those agreements and I'm assuming you had at least some contracts that were up for renewal at calendar year end. So could you elaborate a bit on how those conversations have changed in any way even if I think you mentioned that they were broadly in line in the prepared remarks?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Garen. I wouldn't say anything's different. I'm not getting a different sense from the manufacturers. There's always a good negotiation every time one of these happen. Everybody wants to pay lower. We want to get paid more. We spend a lot of time talking about the various dynamics of the manufacturers' mix and whether their line extension's gone up or down, whether or not they've changed their mix as far as controlled drugs or refrigerated items. And so we work through all those. We have incredibly productive relationships with our manufacturers. And so I would tell you that the way these are going, still trending the way they have historically and they're still about 80% or so of the margins are coming from a non-contingent standpoint and roughly 20% or so are coming from what we call a contingent basis, which means that inflation can drive the actual value of the dollars when we talk about contingent versus non-contingent.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Great. And then, apologies if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but on you having raised the high end of sales guidance, did you mention which segments or specific businesses you're seeing evolve more favorably? Thanks a lot.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Our revenue overall was an overall revenue guidance increase. But as you can see, obviously, the Pharma segment has performed well but with the addition of Cordis and some other good activities. Medical also had a good top line growth, so but that was an overall to go from mid-teens to mid- to high-teens.","Operator","Okay. We will now take our next question from John Kreger from William Blair.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Robbie Fada (49:55) in for John today.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning","Unknown Speaker","Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned earlier in the call that there were a few things on the generic side that are offsetting the inflation rate moderation. Can you flesh that out a little bit, perhaps give us a sense of what percent of customers are currently still buying direct versus how many have shifted to buying through the channel?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I won't be able to do that. I know that's a question but go ahead, George, do you want to comment or?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Why don't you take the first part which is the moving parts?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Yeah. From a movings parts standpoint, I would tell you that the two things that we said would moderate the shares, as we've talked about a couple times, was generic inflation, and as I've mentioned, it's moderated a little bit more than we had modeled. We expect generic launches for this year to be slightly less than this past year. But in terms of overall, our ability to source products is doing better. Our ability to penetrate existing and new customers is going very well. Our use of data and analytics and how we price our products is going really well. So, when you wrap it all together, I still feel like our overall generics program is performing about as we expected. But they're \u2013 it's just coming in a little bit differently. Other than that, I really can't split it down more. It's actually \u2013 even if I wanted to, it's incredibly difficult because they're all so interrelated on how we work with customers. It's very difficult to split it apart.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Robbie (51:20), I'll try to touch base \u2013 I'll try to touch on one part of your question, which was those customers that source generics from us. I think if you look at our numbers, it's pretty clear that, that has increased for us. I do think the market recognizes that, particularly given the strength of our capacity in working through Red Oak, that we're a very attractive partner. And so I think there are many customers in the system that actually have done for years a blend of buying generics, some directly, some through distribution partners. And so even small swings in those percentages can be beneficial to us. We think our value proposition is very strong, as Mike said, and getting increasingly strong. So we're hoping that we can continue to attract those customers.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks very much. And one quick one on Medical, if I could. Is there any update on what kind of commodity-related tailwind you might see in the coming quarters if oil remains low?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, remember, too, the oil price that you see every day is more of a spot market versus more of the forward curves. But at the beginning of the year, we had mentioned that we thought commodities would be a $10 million to $20 million good guy for us this year and that's still tracking essentially as we said it would at the beginning of the year.","And then the other thing to remember is that we've employed a lot of \u2013 a host of hedging strategies. We've renegotiated our contracts over the last several years with manufacturers as well as, if you look at the overall supply line and our commitment to inventory, it takes about six months before any type of changes in commodities will have an impact on us. And then the last bucket is, is that we have a lot of different commodities and not all move with oil. And so, where probably five years to ten years ago, oil was a much better proxy for how our commodities will go. It's very different today when you look at our mix of commodities that we buy. Many of them do not move in correlation with oil at all.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","We will take our next question from Steven Valiquette from UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Steven (53:42).","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","So I guess just for me, one question that we keep getting from investors, this kind of relates to Red Oak a little bit, but without going into specific details, investors keep wondering is there anything maybe mechanical about Red Oak that perhaps smoothes out your generic profits where perhaps Cardinal made a little bit less profit during the big generic hyperinflation quarter but maybe it shields you a little bit on the way down on generic pricing? Or if there is a better smoothing of generics profits for Cardinal versus peers, as some investors perceive, does it maybe have nothing to do with Red Oak in your view? Just curious if you want to offer any additional color on that. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think it's maybe \u2013 it's a little bit Red Oak, but really, this was really pre-Red Oak, was that probably about four years or so ago when we were reevaluating our overall way we buy generics. We made a very conscious decision that we would cut back on our spec buying and the way we managed inventory with generics. And we really want to focus on how can we be the best possible partner for our generic partners and trying to manage inventory more from a supply standpoint versus a pricing standpoint was the way that we felt that it would go. It was better for the manufacturers and we thought over the long run it would improve our relationships and hopefully make them stickier as well as lead to a better everyday low price for us.","And so we did that. And that philosophy was also shared by CVS when we formed Red Oak is that our focus is, at Red Oak is how can we be the absolute best partner to our manufacturers? Obviously, we want get a great price, but we want to be transparent. We want to be easy to do business with. We want them to want to come do business with us, and one of that way is helping smooth out fluctuations in the supply chain, which is something that we've done for a while that I think maybe has made us a little different from an exposure standpoint to declines in pricing.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So maybe just a little bit less forward buying versus your peers that again doesn't necessarily have to do with Red Oak, but to the forward buying?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","It's hard for me to say what my peers were doing. I won't comment on what they were doing. But I can just tell you that for us, managing inventory more around being a great partner and making it efficient in the supply chain was the focus for us versus other types of activities. Thanks, Steve.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","Okay. We will take our final question from Eric Coldwell from Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much. Good morning. First question is around Pharma, very strong growth in the quarter couple of billion of upside versus Street, seems like that was probably your net wins driven. But can you give us a sense on the M&A impact in Pharma in terms of percentage points of growth and also maybe your best estimate of what your same-store trend might be excluding net wins and losses?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I would tell you that the majority of our growth was growth from our relationships with new and existing customers. Acquisitions were a smaller contributor of our overall growth but that's the best I can give you in terms of trying to size the two.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Eric, just a reminder, we have tens of thousands of customers. And so, again, small movements in those customers can be meaningful. And of course, as you know in the branded side, over the last \u2013 you've seen a lot being driven by some of the important new products in the system. And so we shouldn't ignore that as well.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, that's fair. Just a quick follow-up on \u2013 we didn't hear much about the Henry Schein relationship and I'm just curious if you can give us a sense if that was a driver of your Cardinal brand growth in the quarter and how that's tracking to-date?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, again, plays with the relationship, I wouldn't say economically yet a big driver, but definitely positive to be able to sell many of our Cardinal brand products through these additional channels. So we really look forward to greater growth there and it's \u2013 again, it's early, but it's off to a pretty good start.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, is anybody else in queue?","Operator","No, there is not.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","George?","Operator","And I will turn the call over to George Barrett for closing.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you, Bethany. Again, just closing summary, I think we're off to a really good start to the first half of our fiscal 2016.

Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health's first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by George Barrett, Chairman and CEO; Mike Kaufman, CFO; and Jorge Gomez, CFO of the Medical Segment.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of risks and uncertainties.","Today's press releases and presentation are posted on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. During the discussion today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures and reconciliations to GAAP are included at the end of the slide presentation and press release.","We would like to remind you that we will webcast our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders this Wednesday, November 8 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time.

As always, feel free to reach out to the IR team after this call with any additional questions.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Before we turn to the earnings, let me offer a few words about the succession plan we announced today. You all know Mike and I know you can appreciate why the board and I are so pleased that he will succeed me as our next CEO. As our press release said, Mike will take on the CEO responsibilities in January and I will continue to serve as Executive Chairman through the Annual Meeting of Shareholders a year from now in November of 2018. At that time, Greg Kenny, our Independent Lead Director, will assume the role of Cardinal Health's next Chairman.","Mike is a veteran of Cardinal Health, having been with us for 27 years. He knows our business inside and out. In addition to serving as our CFO, Mike has held senior leadership positions at both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments and has been instrumental in many of our key strategic initiatives. As everyone here at Cardinal Health knows, Mike lives our mission and embodies our values. He shares my view that it is a privilege and a responsibility to lead our company in service of our customers and their patients as well as the best interest of you, our shareholders. Mike has been a superb partner to me. I'm extremely excited for him and for us and I know that the transition will be seamless.","As Mike takes on his new role, we're also delighted that Jorge Gomez, currently CFO of our Medical segment, will succeed Mike as our next CFO. Jorge was a natural choice for this position. He had served as CFO of both of our segments as well as the company's Treasurer and Controller. He brings a deep understanding of our business and global financial experience to his new role. Mike and Jorge will make a great team, and this is a natural evolution of the partnership they've already established.","While my role will shift in January, my ongoing commitment to Cardinal Health is deeply felt and unwavering. I look forward to supporting Mike and our board and to spending more time focusing on the public and health policy issues critical to Cardinal Health, our industry and our communities.","With that, let's now turn to the performance for the quarter. We're off to a solid start to our fiscal 2018. We'd expected that our first quarter numbers will be down year-over-year. While that was the case, our business performed somewhat better than we had anticipated and we continue to see progress across most of our lines of business.","For the first quarter, we achieved revenues of $32.6 billion, non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.09 and generated a robust $1.2 billion in operating cash. Our Pharmaceutical segment performed largely as expected. Our Pharma Distribution business did extraordinary work for our customers, particularly in light of the devastating natural disasters that have affected multiple communities around the country, including Texas, Florida, California and, of course, Puerto Rico. And I'll return to this subject later in my comments.","As a reminder, our revenue comparison year-over-year was affected by the loss of a large mail-order customer, Prime Therapeutics, which we had previously disclosed. At the end of our fiscal 2017, we noted that the deflation rate on generics seem to be stabilizing. We still hold that view, noting that the rate of deflation is less today than we saw at this time last year, and Mike will touch on this more in his comments.","Our Specialty Solutions group continues its robust growth. We've grown to a stage of significant scale, deepening our value proposition as we continue to bring on new biopharma clients and acute care customers. As a result, we are seeing growth both in the downstream provider side and in the upstream biopharma services side. We believe we have a significant value proposition in the specialty space, not only in retail and physician office settings, but also for large acute care and IDN customers who are increasingly responsible for these critical medications.","Turning to our Medical segment, the team had a solid start to the year. As expected, our numbers this quarter were adversely affected by the year-over-year comparisons associated with the previously disclosed loss of a large portion of a VA contract. We do, however, continue to see good growth across many lines of business, specifically our naviHealth, Cardinal Health at-Home, Kitting and Lab businesses performed particularly well, and our strategic account work continues to grow as we become increasingly valuable to our partners.","The Cordis business performed as we expected this quarter. We continue to make progress building out our product portfolio, most recently, signing an agreement with Medinol where Cordis has exclusive distribution rights in the U.S. to their coronary stent portfolio, including a drug-eluting stent upon FDA approval. We are also distributing the Tryton Side Branch Stent to treat bifurcation lesions. This is the first dedicated bifurcation device to receive regulatory approval in the U.S.","Finally and, quite significantly, we closed the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business this quarter and our integration work is off to an excellent start. Our sales forces have been combined and realigned and product training across the group is going extremely well. We are seeing great opportunities to create mutual value between historical product lines and channels of Cardinal Health and these new product lines and channels that have come to us through this acquisition. We are thrilled to have our new colleagues on board. They've shown great enthusiasm as they've joined the Cardinal Health family.","It would be incomplete to have a conversation with you without addressing the drug abuse issue that is affecting this nation. Cardinal Health continues to take an active role in the dialogue and the hard work associated with helping to tackle this national crisis. As I've said before, this is an issue that is large, it is complicated and, most important, it is tragic and personal.","I believe most of you know that we have spent nearly a decade continuously enhancing our best-in-class suspicious order monitoring tools and analytics to keep pace with the ever-changing shape of this crisis, but we've been doing much more than this. Because we know that professional training and prevention education is critically important in this area, we've committed heavily to this.","Over the last nine years, we have been proactively educating pharmacists and students through our Generation Rx program, which was created in conjunction with the Ohio State School of Pharmacy. To-date, our Generation RX materials have been used by more than 1 million people. We've been working for many months on ways to expand this successful program to provide emerging physicians training, expanded drug take-back programs and in coordination with local law enforcement, a Narcan distribution strategy for the emergency treatment of a known or suspected opioid overdose.","As a wholesale distributor, we do not manufacture, promote, market or prescribe these drugs. We do, however, take very seriously our responsibilities to serve our health care system. Our anti-diversion systems and controls are substantial, they are well-funded and they are best-in-class. I'm enormously proud of the work that our people do in their communities to help phase down the challenges of the misuse and abuse of prescription medications.","I've never worked with an organization so mission-driven, which brings me to the recent natural disaster we've seen in various parts of the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We have more than 8,700 colleagues across Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Florida, Texas and California. They have been truly heroic in the work they've done and continue to do to assist in emergency relief efforts and to serve our customers and the health care needs of their patients, particularly at a time when many of them are personally vulnerable or affected. Our employees have also generously supported one another through our Cardinal Health Foundation employee assistance fund to provide financial support to the Cardinal Health families affected by these storms.","Related to this, I'd like to share a quick story with you. Last week, the leader of our Puerto Rico organization shared with me that not only did we have an overwhelming percentage of our employees working within 24 hours after the hurricane hit, but that our people and our operations served as the key logistics provider in collaboration with HHS, the CDC, the local Department of Health as well as several NGOs.","Given our capabilities and footprint, we were in a unique position to provide aid even on products and in areas we don't typically serve. The sense of community that permeates our colleagues on the islands has been inspiring. As one colleague said to me, Cardinal Health values are not a plaque on a wall somewhere. They live right here in what we are doing every day to help each other and our customers here in Puerto Rico. It's difficult to find a way to adequately thank them for their extraordinary and heroic work. This is an untold story, but this is the Cardinal Health that I see every day and of which I am so proud to be a part.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for the kind words, George. I'll also share a few brief comments before we get into the financial results for the quarter. Let me start by saying how excited I am to take on this new responsibility. I've been with Cardinal Health for 27 years and, as you can imagine, this company, our people and our mission are very important to me. It's an extraordinary honor to be selected to succeed George as CEO and I am grateful for the trust and confidence that the Board of Directors is placing in me. Given the close partnership George and I have had over the past nine years, I look forward to what I know will be a smooth transition as I will continue to benefit from George's valuable perspective and ongoing contributions as Executive Chairman.","The strategic steps we've taken this year and over the past several years put us in a strong position for the future. I believe that we are well-aligned with the trends in both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments of the health care industry. I don't expect to be making dramatic changes to what we've built and we'll certainly plan to take full advantage of the many opportunities that our robust portfolio has to offer. While there'll always be challenges, I feel very good about how the company is competitively positioned and believe we are on the right track.","I also want to say how excited I am that Jorge Gomez will become our new CFO. We have worked closely together for many years and I am glad to have a partnership with Jorge similar to the one I have enjoyed with George. Jorge brings a depth of experience and I'm thrilled he has accepted the role of CFO.","Finally, I just want to say that one of Cardinal Health's great strengths is the enormously talented and dedicated team of professionals we have in place. Together with our team, I look forward to building on our strong foundation while always keeping in sight our ultimate goal of supporting our partners in the critical work they do each and every day serving patients and their families.","With that, let me turn to the review of our financial performance for the first quarter. As always, the financial results that I provide this morning will be on a non-GAAP basis unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. Slide seven of the presentation includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the first quarter.","Overall, our first quarter fiscal 2018 results came in ahead of our plan. Operating income was somewhat ahead of expectations due mainly to the timing of certain expenses. Diluted EPS of $1.09 benefited from share count and the timing of a few discrete tax items. Revenues increased 2% year-over-year totaling $32.6 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 5% to $1.7 billion versus the same quarter in the prior year.","Given our recent acquisitions, most notably the Patient Recovery business, our consolidated SG&A increased 15% versus the prior year, as expected. Consolidated operating earnings were $610 million, a 9% decline versus the prior year. This was affected by the inventory step-up in the Medical segment, which I will cover in greater detail later on.","Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense came in as expected at $83 million in the quarter. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by the interest on the debt issued to finance the Patient Recovery acquisition.","Our effective tax rate this quarter was 34.1%, a 2.3 percentage point decline versus the prior year. During the quarter, we did see a couple of small favorable discrete tax items. As we have stated in the past, the quarterly effective tax rate will have some variability. We still expect our full year tax rate to be unchanged from our plan.","Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 318 million, about 4 million shares fewer than the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We had $150 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and we have about $300 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.","Our operating cash flow for the quarter came in strong at $1.2 billion. If you recall, in our fourth quarter, the operating cash flow reflected the impact of nearly $400 million of vendor payments that were made early due to some changes during the Pharma IT refresh implementation. As expected, this impact was recaptured in the first quarter and contributed to our strong operating cash flow performance. Given that we benefited from this and other timing items, we still expect annual cash flow to be in line with our original expectation.","Our cash balance at September 30 was $1.2 billion with roughly $600 million held outside the United States. The reduction from our fourth quarter cash balance reflects the funding of the Patient Recovery acquisition in July.","Now let's move to segment performance. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 1% to $28.9 billion. This increase was due to sales growth from Specialty and Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which was partially offset by the previously announced loss of a large mail-order customer, Prime Therapeutics, which George mentioned in his comments.","Segment profit for the quarter decreased 13% to $467 million, in line with our expectations and what we shared on the fourth quarter call. This was driven by our generics program performance and the cost related to the ongoing investment in our Pharma Distribution IT refresh project. This project, which we refer to internally as P-Mod, is progressing well and is on time and on budget. As an additional reminder, our generics program includes the benefit of Red Oak Sourcing as well as Pharmaceutical pricing and volume changes.","Let's now go to Medical segment performance, which came in largely as planned. Revenues for the quarter grew 14% to $3.7 billion, primarily driven by contributions from acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, new and existing customers.","Medical segment profit increased 1% to $129 million during the quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the contribution from the Patient Recovery acquisition net of the inventory step-up. This was mostly offset by a reduced contribution from the previously announced loss of a large portion of a VA contract.","The Patient Recovery acquisition, which closed on July 29, was successfully on-boarded and performed operationally in line with our expectation. As I just noted, performance in the quarter included a $42 million inventory step-up. Excluding this, the Medical segment profit growth would have been 34%.","While we have yet to finalize the inventory step-up calculation, our current estimate is that the remaining step-up to be recorded in Q2 will not exceed what we saw in the first quarter, which is in line with our expectations. With regards to Cardinal Health brand, the majority of our product lines performed as expected in the quarter. However, we did see some supply and commodity challenges, primarily in our exam glove business.","Before moving to our fiscal year 2018 outlook, you can turn to slide number seven where you'll see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the quarter. The $0.73 variance was primarily driven by two factors. First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs were $0.40 in the quarter. This includes all acquisitions closed as of September 30. Note that the year-over-year increase is a result of the Patient Recovery acquisition.","Historically, we've utilized third-party distribution partners to help get our products to market in countries where we haven't had a sales force and back office infrastructure. With the Patient Recovery and Cordis acquisitions, we now have a platform to distribute directly. Consequently, we deployed $125 million to regain direct distribution of our self-manufactured surgeon gloves in certain markets. This charge is reflected in the $0.27 in restructuring and employee severance.","Now let's talk briefly about total year financial assumptions on slide 9 and 10. First, we are reaffirming our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $4.85 to $5.10. With respect to quarterly cadence, we still expect the first and second half to be as we originally modeled. Consequently, the timing benefit in the first quarter should reverse in the second quarter.","Second, given the recent share repurchases I referenced earlier, we are revising our full share count projection to 318 million to 319 million shares. And, finally, we are updating the guidance for amortization and acquisition-related intangibles to $560 million to include acquisitions that closed in our first quarter, most notably Patient Recovery.","Our Pharma segment assumptions on slide 11 remain on target and unchanged. However, let me give you a little more color on our generic and brand assumptions. Based on our first quarter, generic deflation is trending as expected. Remember that our generic deflation calculation is a year-over-year point-to-point measurement of average selling price. We recognize that companies measure this differently. We continue to believe that we have appropriately risk-adjusted our assumption for the year.","In addition, as it relates to brand inflation, while it is still early in the year, we remain comfortable with our full year assumptions. Furthermore, if actual inflation falls below this assumption, we expect it can be absorbed within our EPS guidance range given that over 90% of our contracts are now fee-for-service.","Our Medical segment assumptions for fiscal 2018 can be found on slide 12 where we have no updates to report. We continue to feel we are well-positioned, especially with the recent on-boarding of the Patient Recovery business.","To close, with one quarter behind us, we feel good about our overall positioning and our ability to execute throughout the remainder of the year.","With that, I'm going to turn the call back to George.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. Before I turn to Q&A, I'd like to say a few words about Cardinal Health's unique value proposition in today's rapidly evolving health care landscape. Our health care supply chain capabilities are second to none, but being truly essential to care requires much more than that. We possess a unique set of skills and industry knowledge, which when combined with our significant scale and a portfolio that spans the entire health care continuum, ideally positions us for continued leadership in the health care system.","For example, we provide a wide range of critical services, negotiating on our customer's behalf to secure highly regulated drugs from around the world, working for them to secure inclusion in restricted networks, providing clinical pharmacy support and medication therapy management. We also provide population health tools to identify optimal pathways for post-acute care, medical product knowledge and scale to allow medical providers to standardize their product selection and utilization, and performance improvement services that reduce waste, improve efficiency and increase patient safety.","These jobs require deep understanding of the health care system, of hospitals, clinics and pharmacies and this in-depth knowledge of an extremely complex regulatory framework. This expertise combined with our relationships and understanding of the intricacies of how health care is delivered has been honed by a team of thousands of professionals here at Cardinal Health over the past many decades.","Furthermore, we have built our portfolio with the conviction that our ability to provide solutions on both the medical and pharmaceutical delivery of care would be uniquely valuable to the system. This is why we remind you that while we are organized in reporting segments, we often go to market as a broad suite of solutions across the enterprise. And this is why we are so confident that Cardinal Health will continue to grow while playing a vital role in health care.","Before we get to the Q&A, I want to express my deepest thanks to all of you and the investment community for your support, confidence and input over the years. I also want to thank our people, 50,000 strong around the world for the amazing work they do every day, living our mission as they serve our customers and their patients. I'm honored and humbled by their dedication.","With that, let's now turn to the Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now we will take our first question from Ms. Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, ma'am. Your line is now open.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. It's actually Mike Minchak in for Lisa this morning. Just a couple of questions. With respect to the outlook, I was just hoping you could talk about some of the key factors that could drive the fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS. I understood you uppered the lower end of the guidance range. And then just as a follow-on to that, last quarter, you previously discussed a target of at least $5.60 in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2019, just wanted to know if you had any comment on that at this point.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. A couple things. First of all, as far as FY 2019 goes, that was just some early guidance that we gave and we are not planning on updating that at this time. As we get through our work early in our Q3 and Q4 and when more appropriate, we'll come out with some further guidance and thoughts around FY 2019.","As far as opportunities and risk in our FY 2018 guidance, I would start with the good news, first being is I don't see anything at this time that would be a huge mover in either direction, but I do see some things that I would probably say fit in the category of opportunities, risk and things that can maybe go either way. As far as the opportunities, I would say share count is in the opportunity. Some of the over-performance that we've seen in the Pharma segment in Q1 and part of that being our Specialty division, I could see that to continue throughout the year. And we're seeing some excellent performance in our post-acute solutions business and could continue to see that to possibly be an opportunity for the year.","As far as risks go, I would say that our Cardinal brand products area has some risks, and that's really, to what I mentioned in my script, around the exam gloves. We are seeing some commodity and supply issues in that particular area, so that could be a little bit of a risk to the year. If our China exit happens sooner than we expected, as I mentioned, we said we have it in for the full year, if that were to get done and approved and exited before the end of the year, that could have a little downside risk. And then, of course, while we don't believe it from everything we're hearing, if the medical device tax were brought back, that could be a negative.","And then the things that I would say could go either way, effective tax rate was favorable in Q1. We expect to see puts and takes all year. So we still feel comfortable with our full year guidance, but that could always go a little bit either direction. The Pharma pricing around generic ASP deflation, that could be a positive or maybe, if it gets a little worse could be a negative. Timing and magnitude of the customer initiatives that I mentioned in the first quarter, those are with existing customers. As I've stressed before, we continue to see good progress in those discussions, but have not finalized anything there. And so depending on how that goes, that could be a little bit of potential upside or maybe a little bit of down.","And then finally, the Patient Recovery performance, again, we feel really good about that, but it's early. And so, all of those things I would say could go either way, but I want to stress none of them we see as significantly concerned that they would be a large driver one direction or the other.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate all the detail.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Absolutely. Next question.","Operator","And our next question is from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And my congrats to Mike and Jorge on the new roles. And, George, it's been obviously a pleasure working with you.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So just I want to go back to some things you guys talked about last quarter. You discussed $0.16 of investments related to customer initiatives and investments in tax and opioid prevention. But on the customer investment specifically, I was wondering if you guys had an update on that opportunity both on the cost side and maybe when you could come to an agreement or be in a position to communicate around what those investments were specifically related to.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. So I would say the tax planning initiative is going as planned. The opioid one was one of the timing items that we're really talking about that we expected to be spend some of that in Q1, and we see that more as the expenses being spent in Q2, which is why we have a little bit of upside in Q1 over our expectations.","But then specifically to your question around in customer investment, again, those discussions continue to go well. Nothing has been finalized there. We would expect that those discussions would probably have clarity by the end of our Q2. And at that time, at our next earnings release, we think we ought to be able to give folks some clarity around whether or not there's some upside to this year if those don't happen or whether we've decided to expand upon those and do anything. But right now, I'm more anticipating that those will be about as planned or would provide some upside if they don't actually happen this year.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, just on the Pharma segment, your margins came in better than at least we were expecting. But there's, obviously, still a lot of debate in the market around generic pricing and some of the recent data points I would say from the generic manufacturers would probably point to a worsening environment. I know you guys have talked about this in the past, but could you maybe just give us an update on what you saw with regard to generic pricing in the quarter both from a buy-side and sell-side perspective?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, Bob. Good morning. Let me start and then I will turn it to Mike. As we said in the comments, if you compared where we are today to a year ago, the rate of deflation is less dramatic. So we had seen some stabilizing of that rate as we came to the end of the fiscal year for us. And I would say that that continued. It is always difficult to comment on others observations about price because as a manufacturer, you've got your own portfolio, which is actually unique to those products. And as you know, various of us who report publicly actually use different methodologies. But ours has been consistent, as Mike said, on a point-to-point basis. And so we feel fairly good about our forecast for the year. But maybe, Mike, you can jump in on that.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I would add is, as I've mentioned before in both my prepared remarks and before is our discussion of how we describe generic deflation is the point-to-point year-over-year related to the average selling price. And everything that we see that we're forecasting for the current year still would say that our assumption of mid single-digits down would still be accurate.","And I've also said in the past the other important thing is not only how you see your selling price, but also how you're doing on the costing side. And for us, that is, obviously, mainly Red Oak, and Red Oak continues to perform at or above our expectation. So we feel good on both sides, both from a selling standpoint and a costing standpoint, which they both need to work out for you to get where you want to be, and we feel good about both of those at this point in time.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for all that. I appreciate it.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Absolutely.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.","Liza C. Garcia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Liza on for Ricky this morning. Just a quick one. So we're fielding a lot of questions around Amazon. Can you maybe provide your thoughts on how you see Amazon in terms of maybe competition on the medical supply side? And do you see an opportunity to work with Amazon if they were maybe to try and enter the drug supply chain?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, so...","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Hey, Liza, let me just \u2013 it's sort of broad issue for us. As I've said in past calls, we never dismiss any competitor or a potential competitor. It's something we always take seriously. I think the thing that is worth noting if you think about the comments that we made during the course of the call today is the nature of what we actually do. And so we're sort of this critical interface between a highly regulated system of providers, manufacturers and a regulatory system. And so I think the heart of our competitive profile is really our ability to serve the health care system with a very complex and important suite of products and services that they need in order to be health care companies and providers. And I think that's at the heart of what we do. So it's very difficult to describe how we see that competitive landscape. We basically know what we do and what our value proposition is.","As to working with them, at this point, we work very closely with our providers, our manufacturer partners. There's no particular plan right now to do anything distinctly with them, but our primary goal and our focus is making sure that we create value for all of these customers with products and services that they very much need in order to do their work for patients.","Liza C. Garcia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you so much.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. I'm curious kind of how you're maybe applying some of the lessons you learned from Cordis on the Medical side of the business and what you can leverage or apply to the Medtronic patient protection business that you acquired. Can you kind of give us an update on the integration process? And any sort of surprises in the initial days there? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Good morning, Erin. It's George. I'll start and then I'll turn it to Mike. I think every integration is its own learning experience. And I think, for us, the Cordis integration required a lot of international work, some of which we had people on the ground doing and in other places we had to build that out. We also had to do some work in that integration with a third-party, which is the partner that sold us the product line. So that requires a lot of interfaces, moving parts and great disciplines. And I think we've, over the course of the year, honed that increasingly.","I think Don and his team have done a great job in the Patient Recovery business of planning well ahead, of thinking carefully about that integration and of leveraging the work that we've already done, particularly outside of the U.S. So I think each one of these is an opportunity for growth and learning. And I think Don and team have done that extremely well. We're off to a really good start. Mike, I'll let you jump in there.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I would say a couple things. Part of the learnings from the Cordis acquisition that we applied to the Patient Recovery business is not only around the execution things that we knew that we had to put the right things in place, but also about estimating what those costs would be. And so, as we gave our guidance and thoughts around Patient Recovery, we took a lot of those learnings, such as the amount of startup cost it would take, the amount of SG&A that we would need to put into the business to make sure that we were estimating those right so that we were giving the appropriate guidance around that business.","So I feel really good about what we put out there as our goals from a financial perspective for the Patient Recovery business, but also on the learnings on the execution standpoint. So whether it be in the area of managing inventory or working through the SG&A cost structure or whether managing the PSAs with our partner, in this case, Medtronic, I think the team is working well on all of those.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on P-Mod, just your efforts there, do you think they're running ahead of plan? Or how should we be thinking about kind of the recurring nature of some of those incremental investments? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. As related to P-Mod, I would say things are going really well. We're on time and on budget on that project. The Pharma team is doing an excellent job of managing the cost, managing the scope, putting the right talented people on that project to deliver. So it's going really well.","As far as the cadence for P-Mod goes, as we've mentioned before, we expected to be a headwind in our Q1. As we just said, we expect it to be a headwind in our Q2 just from a year-over-year expense standpoint with some of the implementations that we did last year going live, it creates depreciation expense this year, and then we expect it to become essentially neutral in our Q3 and our Q4.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for questions.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Coldwell from Baird. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. Thanks very much. Two quick ones in Medical. The first one, to regain control of the exam gloves internationally, you had, obviously, a sizable outflow. Are there going to be other outflows for other product lines? Or how do you treat other product lines ex-U.S. in terms of regaining control of distribution?","Second of all, and this is for Mike. Mike, you know I've talked about this, I'm still a little concerned about Medical revenue for the year, with the VA loss, the slow market, annualizing Kaiser, various challenges that have been brought up. Can you just be more specific on what your interpretation of high-teens revenue growth is, what that range is, in your mind? And just make sure we all understand how broad that range is. That's it. Thanks so much.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Eric. I'll start on the first one and maybe Mike can take the second one and we'll sort of tag team this. The move that we made to regain the rights in Europe really was very specific to an old agreement. That really was a reflection of the product line that we had some years ago. And so, these are a series of products for which we had no commercial operations ex-U.S. and so we depended on third-parties to do that. And so now that we have operations in virtually all of these countries, it was very logical for us to want to have the rights back to be able commercialize our own product. So it was specific to a set of products. There's nothing else to be forthcoming as it relates to other products, but we were able to close off this sort of legacy agreement and glad that we're going to be able to commercialize our own products.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. And that was really \u2013 our surgeon gloves, which is what we manufacture ourselves and have just an excellent reputation and an outstanding quality and acceptance throughout both the U.S. and overseas. It was really the one product that we were selling significant amounts overseas. Now, obviously, with the addition of Cordis and Patient Recovery and commercial operations overseas, we plan to sell other products of ours that we feel really good about, but that was really the only one that we had significant sales that would create any type of restructuring charge like that.","As far as Medical revenue goes, I really can't say more than the fact that we still feel good about the high-teens revenue growth \u2013 percentage increase in revenue for this year. Our early looks at the Patient Recovery business, while the first couple weeks were a little variable; after the first couple weeks, the business has looked very much as we expected for the year and the team is doing an excellent job. So, to your point, well, I have mentioned the VA is a significant year-over-year headwind, we still feel really good about our high-teens guidance.","Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks and from myself also, Mike, congrats, and George, pleasure working with you. I had a question following up on Bob's question earlier. When we think about the generic deflationary comments we're hearing from manufacturers and then we also look at the market data. When we, as investors, and when we're looking at this, what do you think is a better guide to look at externally besides, obviously, your comments on what you're seeing directly as we try to evaluate your comments and those of others? Do you feel that the aggregate market data is reflective \u2013 is more broadly reflective, or is there any limitation to that? How should we kind of handicap the comments coming from different \u2013 or the data sources that we can get our hands on it?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for the question. Yeah, this was tough because really or anybody that really understand the impact on our financials or probably any distributor's financials is really have to understand both sides, both how you're affecting your sell price and your cost side. And, for us, to give exact numbers and guidance on both of those is probably not smart from a competitive standpoint. So we have always tried to give \u2013 as you know, our definition is really around the sell side of this.","And so, to me, I think you have to look at both. I think you have to look at what we are saying from the standpoint of what we expect our sell price erosion to be and then you have to take a look at what the manufacturers are reporting because those are probably good indicators of what we're able to do on the costing side. And that when you look at the difference between our sell price going down less than what we're able to get on the costing side as a percentage, then that's probably the indicator that we could see a positive move, and that's what we're seeing this year is that we're seeing a nice balance between what's happening on the sell side versus what's happening on our cost side. George, would you...?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Charles, I guess that you've been doing this a long time so you know the challenges of using public data. And I think the way I've heard you describe it is what I think has to be done. You sort of have to triangulate between all the various inputs. There are a lot of moving parts on this, but we'll try to be transparent with you about what we see in our numbers. And then to the extent that we can, we'll give color on the tone of the market. But I think you're right in pointing out that it's very difficult to get a perfect signal from public data. You have to work across multiple sources and triangulate. But we understand and we know \u2013 again, we have been at this a long time, as have you, I would say. It's always a challenging thing to get precise numbers.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. And just to be clear, right, I mean, Mike, if I understand what you're saying is that when we think about manufacturer comments, all things being equal, that's really your acquisition cost of drugs. And as long as you're not \u2013 it's not 100% passed through to your sell side margin, we're actually earning money on that deflationary comments. Is that fair?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","That's right. And, remember, the cost is coming off of a lower base because your cost is lower than your sell. So the percentage decline off of the sell is going to be from a dollar standpoint worth more than a percentage \u2013 the same percentage decline off of a cost. And that's why you want to see a spread between the two \u2013 between what you're saying on sell versus cost and that's what we feel good about at this point in time.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. I will leave it there. Thanks a lot.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Kevin Caliendo from Needham & Company. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. And, Mike, congratulations. And, George, for someone who's known you since the Teva days, good luck, and it's been a pleasure talking with you for all these years. Guys, any update on the $0.16 of EPS spend? I know you obviously kept your guidance the same. So I'm assuming that, but is there any update on when we might get some more visibility on that?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Again, three components of that on the $0.16. One was the spend on the opioid piece, which I mentioned earlier is one of the timing, things where we expected a chunk of that spend to happen in Q1. And we're really now more ramping it up in Q2. So we really saw no spend to speak of in Q1 and we expect it to happen in Q2. So we still expect the full year impact of that to be what we thought, it's just the timing move from Q1 to Q2.","As far as the tax initiatives we put in place, those are in place, those are delivering what we expected and was built into our guidance for the year. And as far as the customer initiatives, again, we're continuing to have good discussions, and these are, again, with existing customers, which is important to know. And it's still too early for me to call it on that, but I would expect that we would have some clarity by the end of our Q2 that we would be able to communicate to folks on that. So, no change in how those will impact our guidance for the year at this time.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. A quick question on Red Oak. There's been some sort of \u2013 some debate amongst investors and myself with regards \u2013 given now that we have WBAD and Claris One are all out there and the Big Three are purchasing a huge chunk of the generics in the marketplace. Can Red Oak continue to grow? And if so, is it simply doing what they're doing now or would they expand into other products like OTC or other opportunities outside of the U.S.?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I think, first of all, I would just say our relationship with CVS continues to be incredibly strong and our interactions at the board level and working together have been incredibly positive. So, yes, we think Red Oak is an absolute asset, not only in the generics side and something that we still feel will continue to deliver incremental value year-over-year as the years continue on it, but also we'll constantly look at that asset, both of us as two companies, and determine if there's other opportunity. So, little too early to say what those might be, but it's absolutely on our mind to always think about what could we do to continue to create benefits for both Cardinal and CVS.","Kevin Caliendo - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Absolutely.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","And our next question is from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.","Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. I guess, circling back to Amazon real quick. They've been in the more low-end medical supply business for years and, I guess, more recently began into getting more complex regulated devices and supplies. I guess, could you provide any color on if you've started to bump into them with any particular provider type or any particular product category?","And then, I guess, a follow-up to that is thinking more long term, when you have a competitor that, obviously, largely competes on being the lowest cost provider, what are the strategies that Cardinal can pursue in order to maintain and grow the relationships with existing customers?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Good morning, Bryan. Bryan, it's George. I'll take this. So I described in my commentary a little bit about the work that we do. Let me start with actually answering the first part of the question, which was, do we bump into them, have we seen them, and the answer is not really. Again, we know that they've been talking about health care to some extent and, obviously, we follow that. But in terms of practical impact, it's not something that we see on a daily basis.","I think the key for us is the value proposition, what do we actually do, and I described some of the activities in my commentary earlier. But just sort of filling the blanks in some of the things that we do, Red Oak, our ability to source global generics across the world probably at unprecedented scale to understand that regulatory framework, to link our work in our Specialty business with the connection between the pharmaceutical manufacturer, their innovation on the science side and a very distinct customer need on the downstream side, work that we're doing in the continuum of care as we see these transitions of care and helping IDN direct patients to the optimal site of care, our ability to aggregate demand across hospitals to provide scale and consumables at great efficiency, our work in terms of working across their networks. These are all very distinct health care capabilities and they really reside here at Cardinal. They've been residing here for decades and we just continue to build on those things. So that's really at the heart of what we do. And I think that, in some ways, is the best protection and the best insurance as it relates to our value proposition and we're very excited about the work that we do in that regard.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","The only thing I would add is even on the area where I think people think is just pick, pack and ship and where we would compete, just think about the things we do on that area besides all the value-added that George has been talking about because we are talking about delivering in pellet loads, truckloads, large quantities, managing formularies, 24\/7\/365 emergency shipments. We're tied to their systems electronically, the past invoicing and help them build per department and all those types of things as well as managing all the regulatory.","So, even in what I think people think are the basic areas of pick, pack and ship that the playing field may be leveled, we don't even think they are even leveled in those areas for what we do. And I would say that we're incredibly cost-effective, so I don't think the assumption that they would be more the lowest cost provider when you look at the infrastructure we have in place every day to deliver to our customers, I feel really good about our cost position also.","Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, we have time for one more call.","Operator","And our next question is from John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is now open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much, George and Mike. Just a question about the Medical business broadly. Can you maybe speak to the volume trends you're seeing across acute versus ambulatory versus home? How is that trending versus your expectations?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, John. Good morning. So I think we've said this before. It's a little bit difficult at times to get a good demand signal on utilization, part of it because what we're seeing is some shifting sites and also market-to-market variation. So we have customers who are gaining share and others that are losing. In general, the trend that we've seen is one that we should expect, which is more care moving to ambulatory settings.","Having said that, we do have some of our IDN customers that are actually having pretty strong volume in their hospital setting, so it really varies from hospital to hospital. But, in general, I would say we feel fairly good about what we're seeing on the demand side. Now, again, we are probably gaining some share over these last two years. And Don and the team have done a good job of really providing that value proposition that seems to be encouraging some of our customers to want to grow more with Cardinal Health.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I would add and I think George said it right there is that just be a little helpful generally, as George said, in the acute space, it's really dependent on the customer, but generally in the flattish area. But we are seeing, say, low to mid single-digits in the ambulatory care space and in the home space where the care is shifting. And the nice thing is that we're highly represented in all three of those spaces. So, as share does move between those three, we're able to take advantage of that with our broader set of offerings.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And maybe just one quick follow-up relating to the Patient Recovery business. So I think that was a business that was kind of flat to down a little bit and, obviously, you guys think you can grow it better as being part of your portfolio. So, are you willing to maybe quantify the step-up in growth that you think you can have on the asset and just how you intend to do that? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, John. I won't quantify that for you. That's not something we can do at this point and it's obviously very early. I will say that the key for us is building that product line into now a very broad product line of products and services. And so we think the opportunity to create value between our historical product lines and channels and theirs is really palpable.","As an example, they're much stronger in long-term care historically than we've been. That opens up doors for us and so we see those opportunities. And I think for us also we have product lines inside that business that will fold very naturally to sort of the economic model that we deliver, and there are other products that are much more clinically attribute-driven and our product teams know how to do that really well. So I think we're extremely excited about the fit into our portfolio and I think the ability to leverage our channels is really the opportunity here.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","That will conclude today's questions-and-answer sessions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks.","George S.

So, please make sure to visit the site often for updated information. We hope to see many of you at an upcoming event.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone. And thanks to all of you for joining us for this morning's call. I know it's an incredibly busy morning for all of you, so please allow me to start by being direct. Cardinal Health had a hell of a year in fiscal 2015. Here are the facts.","First, revenues climbed back over the $100 billion mark, growing 13% year-over-year. Second, we delivered the largest non-GAAP operating earnings in the 44-year history of Cardinal Health growing 15% year-over-year. Third, we generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow. And fourth, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through expanded dividends and share repurchases.","And I'm proud that our organization was able to generate this financial performance while making sound and strategic moves in drug distribution, generics, specialty, small office practices, consumables, physician preference items, all putting us in a forward position to sustain meaningful and measurable growth into the future. So, again, a hell of a year.","Of course, the year was not without its challenges. Year-over-year, our Medical segment was essentially flat adjusting for some non-operating compensation push downs. But we have been disciplined and determined in modernizing the portfolio of drivers in our Medical segment building off our expansive footprint, our deep customer relationships, our global manufacturing and sourcing experience and the extensive cross learnings from our work in Pharmaceuticals.","To be clear, every component of this new portfolio drives growth while leveraging the strong legacy and platform of our Medical Surgical distribution. This has been a multi-year process but we expect to largely come through this transition as we exit fiscal 2016.","We've crafted a strategy which allows us to serve the needs of the market today but positions us to address the ongoing needs of patients, medical providers, hospitals, retail outlets and all of our partners in a system undergoing change. Long-term value creation is our true north. Our healthcare system is at a key inflection point and with the ongoing convergence of historically disconnected players, customers increasingly see Cardinal Health as an integrated and effective healthcare organization, not a collection of individual business units.","The strong performance of the enterprise wasn't the product of a single business unit or function. It was rather the collective energy and dedication of 35,000 people who are extraordinarily committed to their customers, to patients, to our business partners, and to the performance on which they know investors have come to depend. We will not rest on our progress; as we begin our fiscal 2016, we expect to continue our track record of growth and value creation.","So, let me make a couple of quick comments about the fourth quarter, which Mike will cover in more detail, and describe specifically how we see our positioning in the market and why we expect to continue our growth trajectory. We finished fiscal 2015 with a very strong fourth quarter. Revenues increased 20%. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased 33%, and we recorded non-GAAP earnings per share of $1, an increase of 20% over the prior year.","Also, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire Harvard Drug, which strengthens our capabilities in generics, broadens our telemarketing reach, and of course, adds scale to our Red Oak joint venture with CVS Health. Of particular note, our Pharmaceutical segment had an exceptional quarter, which you've seen in our press release and which Mike will cover in a few minutes.","This is truly a remarkable time in healthcare and Cardinal Health is poised to excel while the industry evolves. We're now beginning to see a clearer picture of how our newer industry dynamics might affect the future. Let me describe some of these forces and link them directly to the work that we're doing and how we position our business portfolio, our product lines, and our capabilities to grow in alignment with these dynamics.","First, there's a noteworthy and increasing bifurcation in the Pharmaceutical world. We see continued growth in the utilization of generic drugs and a new era of innovation in Specialty Pharmaceuticals addressing the needs of unique patient populations that require a very integrated approach to patient management. Recognizing this, we expanded and continue to grow and diversify our customer base; in particular, we are broadening the number of customers who source generics from us. And of course, we established Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health, which was fully operationalized this fiscal year. This is an effective, productive and profitable partnership, and we see this is as a long-term driver of value for us, CVS Health, our manufacturing partners and of course, our customers.","We've significantly grown our Specialty business and completed the acquisition of Metro Medical, enhancing our reach and expanding the therapeutic areas we serve. And we continue to deepen our relationships with biopharmaceutical manufacturers with valuable offerings in regulatory sciences, patient access and support, and health economics outcomes research.","Second, we are seeing retailers, big and small, continue to expand their offerings and enhance their role in healthcare. Increasingly, they have become places where care is actually delivered and where healthcare counsel is provided. These retail pharmacies need to operate at significant scale or leverage the scale of a partner to ensure efficiency and access.","With the proven strength of our brand and generic programs, Cardinal Health offers the opportunity to aggregate demand for our customers. We provide access to innovative tools, technologies, specialized services and solutions, including network inclusion. We now have nearly 6,000 customers in our Pharmacy Services Administrative Organization, we call that PSAO; we re-contract on their behalf for network inclusion. Without question, Red Oak Sourcing provides tremendous support enabling a world-class generics program for our customers.","Third, we are seeing hospitals and health systems become increasingly complex, multi-site and multi-provider. This creates new challenges for them and puts a priority on coordination, efficiency, and standardization around various needs, including pharmaceuticals, consumables, physician preference items, and the accompanying services around these products. This creates unique opportunities for us. Partners like Cardinal Health who can serve these needs across a highly distributed system and who can help ensure the right care in the right part of the system will be highly valuable to our manufacture partners and providers alike.","Integrated delivery solutions group works across health systems to build formulary capabilities and offer medication therapy management to ensure that each patient starts and stays on the right medicine. Our consumables portfolio addresses the need for efficiency and standardization, and our Cardinal Health branded products continue to grow.","Our acquisitions of AccessClosure, Innovative Therapies, and, of course, the planned acquisition of Cordis offer real solutions around efficiency and standardization, combining products and innovative services and technologies. Simply put, we can eliminate waste and improve outcomes in the physician preference item area. And we are very excited to have joined forces with Henry Schein to more efficiently and effectively serve small physician practices, many of whom are now affiliated with IDN.","Combining our tools with Schein's world-class capabilities and servicing office-based practices makes us a stronger partner for integrated system and allows us to move more of our Cardinal Health branded products through more channels.","Fourth, as the baby boom population moves into their 60s and now their 70s, many are living with multiple chronic diseases and therefore, need new and different forms of care. These patients are being treated indifferent and what we internally refer to as peri-acute settings. The moment of discharge is a unique moment in our healthcare system and transitions to post-acute settings are extremely important. We know that many of these patients are best cared for in their own homes where they can have the dignity and support they deserve.","The strength of our Cardinal Health at Home platform continues to grow bolstered by increased penetration of Cardinal Health branded products. And we are in the process of launching our Hospital Quality at Home initiative which allows consumers the opportunity to purchase a product they've used in clinical settings from retail outlets.","And finally, we are seeing payment models changing, shifting the focus to outcomes rather than activity; results, not effort. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services set clear goals and timelines to shift Medicare to value-based models. In recent weeks, CMS announced their first mandatory targets for bundled payments starting with lower extremity procedures.","The move to expand our position in cardiology with products offered by Cordis and AccessClosure, in wound management with Innovative Therapies, and then trauma with Emerge all align perfectly with these developments. Our ability to serve these bundles with products and innovative services now across multiple therapeutic areas is a key differentiator; highly valuable to our provider partners and will be key driver of growth for us.","With a strategic eye on the future, identifying and embracing evolving industry dynamics, Cardinal Health is uniquely positioned to create value in this new environment. We are an integrated healthcare company delivering solutions to our customers across the entire continuum of care, addressing critical challenges around efficiency, costs, quality, access and outcomes.","So, what do we expect going forward? This morning we provided FY 2016 guidance of $4.85 to $5.05 which represents an 11% to 15% growth rate. We expect to see growth along multiple dimensions. Without question, generics remain an important strategic focus for us, and we expect that Red Oak will continue to generate meaningful value for us and for our customers. As I mentioned before, we closed the acquisition of Harvard Drug in early July. This will further fuel our growth in generics.","Our Specialty business continues its strong growth, and we expect that Specialty Solutions will finish fiscal 2016 with revenues in excess of $8 billion. We expect our Medical segment to grow at mid-single-digit rates and finish the year with momentum. Of note, the Medical segment will have a challenging first quarter as a result of some discrete items, the largest being the wind down of a post-spend CareFusion contract in Canada which Mike will cover.","Nevertheless, we continue to expect higher than market growth in our strategic accounts and double-digit growth in our Cardinal Health branded Medical products. We anticipate outgrowing the market in Cardinal Health at Home and look with enthusiasm to closing the acquisition of Cordis likely in our fiscal future.","China continues to represent a significant opportunity. The healthcare market in China is still in its early phases of growth and our large and expanding footprint will be increasingly valuable to us and our global Pharma and Med Tech partners.","Finally, having made some important moves in these last 18 to 24 months, we will prioritize and focus on execution and performance management around these strategic priorities. And because of this, expect that our capital deployment approach in the near term will be weighted toward reinvesting in our existing businesses and enhancing enterprise capabilities to ensure that we maintain the kind of impressive earnings growth we've experienced over the last one, two, and five years.","We come out of fiscal 2015 with a strong track record of financial performance and a balanced, well-positioned portfolio. We have high expectations and I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver robust growth demonstrated by real and measurable results.","Let me finish by thanking all of you for your support, all of our customers and business partners for their trust, and all of our employees who work incredibly hard day-in and day-out to set the industry standard of excellence. Great people make great companies, and great companies make for great communities and in that regard, our people set a high standard.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for a detailed review of the financials. Mike?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George. I'm extremely pleased to report such an outstanding quarter and a terrific fiscal 2015. The financial performance of the enterprise along multiple dimensions: revenue, operating earnings, cost control and EPS growth all point to tremendous attention to high performance by our team. At the same time, we continued a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment which served us well this year and in the years to come.","Now, let me review our strong fiscal 2015 results. I'll focus on our Q4 performance and provide select full-year highlights then I'll offer our fiscal 2016 outlook including some of the underlying assumptions. You can refer to the slide presentation on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Starting with the consolidated company financials, Cardinal Health had a strong finish to an excellent year. For the fourth quarter, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1, a 20% growth versus the prior-year quarter. This contributed to full-year, non-GAAP EPS of $4.38, a year-over-year growth of 14%.","Fourth quarter revenues came in at $27.5 billion, or a growth of 20%, and full-year revenue grew 13% to $102.5 billion. Gross margin dollars were up over 16% in the fourth quarter and increased 11% versus the prior full year. Gross margin rate in the quarter compressed slightly due to the Pharmaceutical segment growing at a faster rate than the Medical segment. SG&A expenses in the quarter and year increased largely as a result of acquisitions.","We drove strong growth in consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings, up 33% in the quarter and 16% during the year. Non-GAAP operating margin rates expanded 20 basis points in the quarter and 7 basis points for the full year. Net interest and other expense increased as anticipated versus the prior year's quarter primarily due to the new debt issuance to fund the Cordis and Harvard Drug acquisitions.","As we expected, the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was unusually high at 42.2% due to certain federal and state tax matters. The full-year rate was 37.2%.","Our fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 333 million. Full-year diluted weighted average shares were 335 million, nearly 10 million lower than the last year. During the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to pull forward fiscal 2016 share repurchases and bought $350 million worth of shares. This brought our fiscal 2015 share repurchases to over $1 billion. At fiscal 2015 year-end, we had about $700 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.","Moving on to consolidated cash flows, we generated $868 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the full year cash from operations to over $2.5 billion, a result of strong contributions from both segments.","Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, including a cash balance of $4.6 billion of which $423 million were held internationally. As a reminder, our cash balance included $1.5 billion in proceeds from our recent debt issuance, which in combination with an additional $1.5 billion of cash on hand, will be used to fund Cordis and has been used to fund the Harvard acquisition which closed in early July. In addition, remember that we like to keep $1 billion to $1.5 billion of cash on-hand as the scale of our business can require large daily fluctuations and cash needs.","Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. The segment had outstanding performance in the quarter and the year. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 23% to $24.7 billion driven by growth in our existing and new customers. Full year Pharmaceutical segment revenues were $91.1 billion, an increase of nearly 14% versus the prior year.","Segment profit increased by 42% in the fourth quarter to $535 million. This performance was driven by our generics program, which included volume growth in our customer base, as well as excellent execution by our colleagues at Red Oak. On the year, segment profit rates expanded 12 basis points to 2.3% driven by our generics program and continued focus on expense management.","Moving to our Medical segment; this quarter, revenues grew 2% to $2.9 billion due to contributions from acquisitions and growth in our Cardinal Health at Home platform. This was partially offset by declines experience in Canada. For the year, revenues grew 4% to $11.4 billion.","Fourth quarter Medical segment profit increased 7% to $103 million. This growth came from the expansion of our Cardinal Health brand products and services through a combination of acquisitions and organic efforts, coupled with targeted cost reductions. For the year, segment profit dollars decreased 2.6%, and the rate compressed to 3.8% due to the portfolio mix George discussed earlier as well as the impact of the Canada business.","Let me share a quick note on Cardinal Health China, which spans both of our reporting segments. Our business in China generated over $3 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in strong double-digit top and bottom line growth. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic moves and we continue to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 healthcare distributors in China.","If you review the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on slide number eight, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.12 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs which reduced our GAAP results by $0.18 per share. We also had proceeds of $56 million in pre-tax antitrust settlements that are included in the $0.08 net litigation recoveries line. These were excluded from non-GAAP results.","With a strong fiscal 2015 behind us, let's turn to our fiscal 2016 outlook. In early June, we provided you with our preliminary fiscal 2016 guidance range. I'll now go through our refined outlook including our current expectations and relevant, underlying assumptions. We expect consolidated company revenues to grow in the low-double digits and as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.05.","While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do expect our earnings to be more back half-weighted in fiscal 2016. This will become clearer as I walk through the segments. Let me first start by providing Pharmaceutical segments' specific expectations and assumptions.","We expect robust revenue growth in the low-double digits versus the prior year. The anticipated drivers of revenue include branded manufactured drug price increases similar to what we experienced in fiscal 2015, the incremental increase related to new customer wins and healthy growth from both Specialty and the China Pharmaceutical business.","For our generics program, overall we expect a positive year-over-year earnings contribution. This growth will be driven by several factors such as current customer penetration, new customer wins, execution of new launches, the manufacturing pricing environment, and of course, execution at Red Oak.","Speaking of Red Oak, it has been a great success. As we've mentioned, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger pre-determined payments beginning in fiscal 2016. Because of excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones and we will be making our first $10 million-additional payment to CVS Health in this first quarter of fiscal 2016 for a new total quarterly payment of $35.6 million.","Our fiscal 2016 outlook also assumes overall generic unit growth versus the prior year as a result of growth in existing customers as well as the incremental impact of the new customers that we on-boarded in fiscal 2015. In addition, we are assuming a lower year-over-year contribution from new item launches as well as the moderating generic manufacturer drug pricing from what we observed in fiscal 2015.","Again, we feel very positive about our outlook for our generics program and expect the second half to be stronger based on the way we see the various components of our program shaping up.","Fiscal 2016 will also include a full year of the Harvard acquisition, which closed in early July. We expect this to ramp through fiscal 2016 resulting in non-GAAP EPS accretion of greater than $0.15 per share net of the $0.03 to $0.04 of its interest expense for the related debt financing.","As I just mentioned, we expect Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions to be a solid contributor to performance in fiscal 2016. Last year, we told you that Specialty was on a trajectory to exceed $5 billion in revenues in fiscal 2015. The business surpassed that goal and we continue to expect robust organic growth. Along with the acquisition of Metro Medical, we now expect to end fiscal 2016 well in excess of $8 billion in revenues. Rounding out our Pharmaceutical segment assumptions, we are also planning for double-digit growth in our China business.","Now, let's talk about our expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal 2016. We expect revenues to grow mid- to high-single digits, driven by Cardinal Health brand product growth which includes Cordis, our China Medical business, and Cardinal Health at Home. For the full year, we expect mid single-digit segment profit growth due to the same drivers.","Now let me give you some additional insight into the cadence of the Medical segment performance as we work through a year with multiple moving parts. The segment profit growth I just mentioned is significantly back-half weighted due to the anticipated timing of the close of Cordis, lapping of the previously-mentioned contract losses in Canada, and the timing of the continued ramp of Cardinal Health brand products which includes the launch of both new products and expansion of existing product lines midway through our fiscal year.","Let me expand a little bit on these items. First, regarding Canada, for the first quarter we expect a $10 million discrete year-over-year headwind related to the winding down of the CareFusion contract that George mentioned earlier. Also, there are other smaller puts and takes that, combined with the wind down, will result in a first quarter year-over-year decline in the high teens for the segment. Even with these factors, the Medical segment will grow segment profit by mid-single digits. So while the first quarter and half will be down, our strong second half will result in full-year growth.","Since Cordis is an important contributor to our stronger second half, I'll provide the assumptions included in our fiscal 2016 guidance. We expect to close the Cordis acquisition before the end of the first half of fiscal 2016 and we expect an inventory fair value step up of $0.13 to $0.15 that will reduce non-GAAP EPS in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2016 and be substantially complete by the fourth quarter. Based on this timing, we would expect meaningful contribution from Cordis in the fourth quarter.","Let me finish by highlighting a few key corporate assumptions for the year. We expect net interest and other expense of $195 million to $210 million which reflects the mid-June debt issuance related to the funding of the Cordis and Harvard acquisitions. We are projecting an overall non-GAAP tax rate in the range of 35.5% to 37%. As a reminder, we only provide full-year guidance on tax rates as they can have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discussions with state, federal, and international authorities.","We also expect amortization of intangible-related assets from acquisitions closed as of June 30, 2015 to be approximately $194 million or about $0.36 per share. This does not include amortization for Harvard or Cordis. We will update this assumption throughout the year as that information becomes available.","Moving on to capital deployment, for FY 2016 our strategy remains consistent with recent years. As we have stated, we view reinvestment in the business as a priority. During the year, we expect capital investment to increase to the range of $510 million to $540 million. This is higher than our historical run rate as this year we have identified opportunities to invest in strategic priorities, refresh our information systems in our Pharmaceutical segment and support our recent acquisitions.","While we regularly evaluate opportunities to redeploy capital into the business, longer term we expect capital expenditures to return to historical levels. We also remain committed to growing our differentiated dividend in line with our long-term, non-GAAP EPS growth rate. We will also continue to explore opportunities to pursue strategic M&A with a bias towards executing on the integration of the recent acquisitions. And as always, we will continually evaluate opportunistic share repurchases as part of our balanced capital deployment approach.","For fiscal 2016, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding between 334 million and 336 million. As I mentioned, this reflects a pull forward of approximately 350 million of share repurchases that were just completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.","I know we just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions, so please, please feel free to ask any clarifying questions. In sum, fiscal 2015 was an excellent year for Cardinal Health and I'd like to acknowledge our team for the work they've done and continue to do to make us successful. I feel confident with our plans for fiscal 2016 and look forward to the year ahead.","I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And for our first question we go to Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess I'll start with the obligatory generic inflation question. I know your directional assumption around generic drug manufacturer pricing to moderate versus fiscal 2015 is in line with what you guys have been saying, but I guess I am curious just around order of magnitude. Have you guys seen anything change in the marketplace more recently that would've made you think of this as less of a tailwind and for your fiscal 2016 than what you guys had been kind of signaling to us over the last couple of quarters?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bob. It's George. I think, why don't I let Mike start with that and then maybe I'll follow up with a little bit of color. But Mike, you want to just start with it?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, absolutely. Hey thanks, Bob, and good morning. As we said in the past, these are generic inflation can be incredibly lumpy. It's not very consistent month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. So while we are telling you that we believe that it will moderate for our fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015, we're not really seeing anything, in large changes in the environment. All the things that we've seen in the past such as the launch schedule not being where it was in the later 2000s, delays for product introductions, we're not seeing lots of new competitors necessarily in the marketplace. All those types of things that we've talked about in the past, we're not really seeing any changes, we're just trying to probably be a little bit conservative to let folks know that we do expect it to moderate a little bit over the next year.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me just echo a little bit of this. I don't know that I'd be able to describe, Bob, a meaningful change since we last reported, other than of course some very large announcements of transactions among the manufacturers. So just \u2013 I'm always reminding people on this question that you have to remember each product is sort of its own market with its own characteristics. How complex is the drug that's being manufactured? Is there plenty of raw material? Where is the drug used? How many players? What's happening for their overall business? So, there are a lot of moving parts in this but I think our general perspective is, and I think we've said this last quarter, but just to moderate our assumption going forward a bit.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. I think that's fair. And I guess just my follow up on the cash balance, Mike, I appreciate the breakdown you gave of where you guys are and what's earmarked for what. But I guess if I go through some of the adjustments and then factor in the CapEx guidance you gave, it doesn't really look like you have too much flexibility for deployment. Anything you can share on cash flow generation expectations and I guess if my math is right, when do you guys feel like you'd be back in a position to either pursue meaningful deals again or meaningful buybacks?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Really fair question. As we take a look at it, a couple of things. I would say that I'm very comfortable with our ability to continue to do acquisitions even today if we needed to. We have access to a lot of different sources of funding, I wouldn't be uncomfortable with putting more debt on the balance sheet if we needed to if we found the right strategic opportunity.","Again, that all being said, we're going to really be focused on execution this year. We've really set the table well, I believe, this past year with some really key acquisitions; particularly Harvard all ready and Cordis to close. We're going to focus on that execution and we're going to be really balanced again in our approach with capital.","And so, I know, George, you'd probably like to say a couple...","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just really quickly. Bob, I think we've done, generally over the last years pretty well in terms of our ability to generate cash, and our team is incredibly good at managing working capital. So, I think we feel confident about the way that we'll generate cash and, of course we'll think carefully and opportunistically about ways of deploying that capital should that occur. I also just want to finish that last part just to remind you that we recognize how hard it is for you all to model generics. And so I know it's frustrating, we've tried to do as best we can to get some general color, but I just want to acknowledge that.","But again, I feel our general strategy on capital deployment has not changed. We feel very good about the way we'll be able to generate cash and to the extent that we're generating more cash, we'll be thoughtful and creative and certainly opportunistic.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate all the comments. Thanks.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob. Operator, next question?","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks and good morning. Hey, George. I just wanted to follow up on some comments you made in your prepared remarks. I think you seem to suggest that your capital deployment would be weighted towards your existing businesses and I just want to be clear on exactly what you're seeing. Do you believe it's just going to be CapEx, internal CapEx, towards the businesses that you've already bought or are you somewhat suggesting that you'll also consider doing acquisitions that may complement some of the existing businesses that you have internally?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good morning, Glen. Thanks. Yeah so a couple of things. One is we want to make sure that you all know that we've got a very high priority on executing the business, particularly on some of the moves that we've made. So, we want to make sure we're all over those and that we're doing the things that we need to do to make sure that those things happen the way we want. We will, of course, continue to look for opportunities that we think drives strength in the businesses that we have. So, that's largely what we're saying.","Again, number one, a high priority on execution. We've deployed some capital, we want to make sure that we do that very efficiently. And second, of course we're always looking for those opportunities to sort of double down and get stronger in areas. But I hope that answers the question.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Maybe if I just follow up with a question for Mike on the guidance. Mike, it kind of sounds like listening to the way you characterize it, there is no capital deployment really built into your new guidance assumptions. If we're not going to model acquisitions and it seems like based on the share count that you're providing you're assuming no share repurchase as well. Is it a fair characterization to assume that the guidance includes no capital deployment?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, it's a+ fair question. When you take a look at the assumptions, obviously, you can take a look at the fact that I mentioned that we were planning to do about $350 million of capital deployment this year in FY 2016, but we decided to go ahead and pull that forward opportunistically into the fourth quarter. So it is a fair assumption as you take a look at the metrics that we've put out and assumptions that we would have obviously a limited amount of capital or stock buyback this year.","But again, you have to remember that's very early in the year. We're going to generate strong cash flows this year and we're going to take a look at all of our capital deployment policies and if there's opportunities in the year to buy back stock opportunistically we won't hesitate to do that.","Operator","Our next question, we go to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, and congrats on the quarter. So, my first question is around kind of the generic programs. In the prepared remarks you emphasized kind of like the growth and momentum that you're seeing there. So, can you quantify for us how fast is your generics program growing and how it compares to what you're seeing market growth is? And how does Harvard fit in? So, when you think about fiscal year 2016, do you separate the \u2013 is the Harvard accretion includes also the contribution to generic or do you think about it as kind of like supporting your growth of your generic program separately?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Ricky. I would say Harvard's really both. I mean, Harvard brings to us generic scale, which is always important particularly with the excellent performance we're seeing from the Red Oak team. It also brings to us new telemarketing skills and teammates. It also had some private label brands that we're going to take a look at how we can continue to leverage those in the acute space. So Harvard brings several different capabilities to us that we're excited about and we've had an excellent team in the telemarketing, in that packaging area, over the last couple years that have executed incredibly well. So, I would say it brings both capabilities as well as generic scale to us.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Broadly, Ricky, good morning it's George. Our generic program is doing very well, and I think we can safely say we're outgrowing the market. There are a lot of components to that. I think we've gotten a broader base of customers who see us as a primary source for generics. And I think we're doing well with them getting better share of wallet, meaning I think we're creating value for a very, very broad percentage of their overall mix.","We've had a little bit of customer growth. The overall picture has been very encouraging and as Mike said, I think Harvard will just add to that. One other thing to add on Harvard, we do really have some interesting synergies because we're very, very good at this today and so this sort of goes right into our sweet spot where we can leverage capabilities that we have in telephony and salesforce productivity in that \u2013 in our telemarketing group. So, we're really excited to sort of bolt that into the system. But it'll very much fold in. But we are calling out a specific accretion that we see from that acquisition.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my follow up will be on the Specialty side again. Seems like a pretty impressive step-up in revenue contribution right from $5 billion to $8 billion. So, can you maybe share some more detail on what you're doing, kind of like what's the revenue model, how are you working with manufacturers, are you also kind of like earning fees from manufacturers for the support services or is it just kind of like for the distribution? So, as much color as possible would be great given that significant step up that we've seen in the contribution...","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Ricky, let me start and with more general comments then but I'll let Mike give a little more detail. Specialty has been a really good growth story and much of that organically. Now Metro Medical, as Mike said, will contribute a lot to those increased revenue numbers as we go from $5 billion to $8 billion. But a lot of this has been organic. Most of the revenue growth has come from the provider side, just growing the number of customers that we supply across therapeutic areas. That's been the primary driver over these the last couple of years.","I do think that we've increased the capabilities that we have to serve Pharma and Biotech and those tend to be less impactful on the top line but more impactful in terms of margin rates to different kinds of services and more consulting kind of revenues. So, I think it's been a good mix of components. But I would say a lot of the revenue has come from expanding our provider base. Mike, what else?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I'd absolutely agree with that. And I think that's really coming from our service offerings in that space. I think that the team over the last several years has done an excellent job of creating offers that we think are best-in-class for either the oncologist, rheumatologist and nephrologists that we're serving and we have a lot of participation with them where they come here, often to Columbus, work with us to help us develop our products and services. I think we're doing an excellent job of listening to what they need and delivering the types of services that they need to get them comfortable to turn over their distribution to us.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Oh, yeah, thanks for taking questions. First, just had a quick clarification, I know you said that in the reconciliation of the non-GAAP, you backed out the litigation recovery. Is that the same when I look at the presentation for the Pharma segment that excludes also the gain there as well?","And then my follow-up question really is more about China actually. When you talk about the China Medical, just curious what's in that part of your business? What do you do on the Medical side in China? Mostly, we've talked about the Pharma distribution there, just curious, and Specialty in China. Just understand in what's there and what percent of the mix in China that kind of represents? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Great. I'll start on the settlements and then turn it over to George for a little discussion on China. Yeah that $56 million of funds that we received in the antitrust settlement have been excluded throughout all the numbers that I talked about. They're not in our overall non-GAAP numbers, nor are they in any of the results of the Pharmaceutical segment. We see these as generally non-recurring hard-to-predict type of items and we have carved these out for years. They have always been carved out of our numbers historically and it's just a consistent pattern that we've had over the past.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Charles, I'm sorry, did that get what you needed from...","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, absolutely.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","That helps.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On China, just a couple of quick observations. We started in China acquiring a business that was roughly $1 billion and growing to nearly $3 billion at the end of FY 2015. It's really been growth along multiple dimensions. Certainly, our Pharmaceutical distribution is the biggest generator of revenue for us in China. We are doing \u2013 increasing med tech work and sometimes just as a 3PL player for medical device companies. I think increasingly people see us as a broad-based healthcare partner in China. And you've seen that in Specialty where we've set up some pharmacies to actually deliver Specialty products direct to patients. We now have 30 of those direct-to-patient pharmacies in China. So the growth has been along multiple dimensions. But again I'd say probably in terms of revenue, the primary revenue growth driver is still in the Pharma segment.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","For our next question we go to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys. Hey, George, a high level question for you. In the past, you haven't been too enthusiastic about entering the distribution space in some parts of the world as others. But how does the ongoing consolidation among Pharma manufacturers impact your view and if it's not in M&A, how does manufacturer consolidation influence your thinking in any other meaningful way?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Garen. Manufacturer consolidation is not really a new story. It's certainly accelerated a lot in the last couple of years both on the branded side and on the generic side. It probably has not changed our view about the opportunities that we have to grow our business both in the U.S. and globally. We look very carefully and I think we've got pretty good experience, line of sight, and discipline around how we see the opportunities of our markets. And our relationships with our Pharma and Biotech partners are very deep; like we're talking regularly about opportunities. So we'll continue to look at opportunities around the world, but we'll do it with a very disciplined eye to make sure that we really believe that there's value creation there, that we bring something to the table and that it's a necessary growth driver for us.","China's been a great opportunity. We now have a platform with Cordis to grow certainly on the Medical side in a number of markets and we'll continue to look to see whether or not there are opportunities ex-U.S. that are attractive to us. But I do think when we look at service businesses in multiple markets, you need to do that with a very, very discipline eye; for example, Europe is not Europe, it's probably got four different kinds of markets inside that broad economy. And so we'll look very carefully at those and with I think a very experienced set of eyes.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. So, it sounds like more of a status quo. And then secondly you could elaborate a little bit on the Red Oak milestone payment? The $10 million that you mentioned, (51:39) you had mentioned that based on the savings that there would be additional milestone payments. But is this something that is a quarterly payment and is it more of an automatic payment for this amount once the savings have been captured or is it as a percent of savings where this amount could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","That's a great question. Let me give you some color and transparency on this arrangement with CVS Health. So the way the deal is structured so that at the beginning of FY 2016 there was a milestone where we would do a measurement. If we were able to exceed that milestone, then a $10 million per quarter payment would kick in to CVS. It's a very binary event. It's either pass the milestone, pay $10 million or you don't and you pay $0. So, there's no proration or anything about it. It's just either pay the $10 million or you don't. This milestone is tracked each quarter. It's run every quarter and so it could, theoretically, we could pay one quarter and not pay the next. But our anticipation is that we will pay the $10 million per quarter each quarter this year. So our payments, to be very clear, are $35.6 million per quarter for FY 2016.","For FY 2017, then there's another calculation at the beginning of FY 2017. It is also another binary event. If we pass that additional milestone, we would pay another $10 million per quarter. And so, now, it's too early to talk about that milestone, we'll wait until the beginning of 2017. We'll measure it at that time but if it's surpassed, again, it's a binary event; it would either be $0 or $10 million per quarter, additional for 2017.","So, our payment could go as high as $45.6 million per quarter starting in FY 2017 and then that would be the maximum for the life of the deal. There's no other milestones. There's no other additional payments. And just also to emphasize, there's no adjustments for volume up or down, whether CVS wins or brings in more business or Cardinal wins or loses business; it is a fixed payment for the rest of the life of the deal.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I'd probably just add to that. The good news is that both of us have been actually contributing nicely to the capacity and the volume going through Red Oak. So, it's been hopefully a rewarding deal for both of us and, of course, for our customers.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And a quick follow-up on that milestone though. Does that milestone \u2013 does it become a more difficult milestone per year or does it become an easier bogey to hit just because maybe the low-hanging fruit was captured first so the milestone just becomes easier for \u2013 just easier overall?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean just think about it this way. It's just, again, a level of savings and we build it such that you would want us to pay the additional $10 million milestone next year. And we're, again, very confident in the execution of Red Oak and we'll get back to you in 2017 as we do the calculation and when we set guidance for 2017 and discuss it. We'll let you know whether that milestone was achieved.","Operator","We go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. I just had a couple of follow-up questions, Mike, on the guidance as we think about the two different components. First, on the distribution side of the business can you maybe just talk about what your assumptions are around the underlying organic growth? And then secondly, I didn't hear you discuss at all margins and how to think about margins in that business as we move towards 2016.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","So are you talking specifically about the Pharma segment, the Medical segment?","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Let's start with the \u2013 like, I just want to understand the organic components around each so what are your assumptions for each of them for the underlying organic and then more specifically to the Pharma, do you have anything built into your anticipation based on some of the announcements that CVS has made around acquisitions that they're contemplating in your guidance for 2016?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I guess...","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","So I guess first of all, we would not comment on any acquisitions related to CVS other than what comments they've made which is that they fully expect the acquisitions that they do, the generics there, to be sourced through Red Oak in the future. But other than that, I can't speak to that component of it.","As far as revenue assumptions for the segments, on the Pharma side, we did talk about really \u2013 first of all, we expect branded inflation which is a key driver of revenue in the Pharma segment to continue to be similar to what we saw in FY 2015. We expect to see double digit growth from China and Specialty in the Pharmaceutical segments and we expect to see growth from our existing customers as well as we'll have full-year onboarding of some of the new customers that we won last year. So those will be the big drivers on the revenue side and we don't guide to margin or margin necessarily rates on the Pharma side but that from a revenue perspective, those will be the key drivers for Pharma.","On Medical, we're also, as we mentioned, we're going to see mid- to high-single digit percentage revenue growth versus the prior year and that's going to be driven by growth created from the Cordis acquisition as well as growth in our branded products through some of the internal efforts that we've had to grow those lines, launch new products as well as some of the efforts we've had around acquisitions.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Sorry \u2013 what I'm really trying to get at is \u2013 so first on the Pharma side, what's your expectation in your existing book of business maybe around utilization? So I understand all the components that you talked about with brand and new wins, Specialty, et cetera, but I'm just trying to understand like the core underlying business. What's your expectations as to where that's growing right now?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Lisa, let me start, first of all, good morning. It's hard to sort of break out underlying business. Let me give you some general broad perspectives on what we see in the market. Pharmaceutical utilization continues to go up, so prescriptions are going up. At the moment, it appears that we have been outgrowing the market a bit. That's probably a little bit of increased customers. It has to do with the way our existing customers are doing in the market. So, the underlying health of that actually looks quite positive.","On the Medical side, we're continuing to see a little bit of a trend of movement of care from acute care to ambulatory settings. So, we're not projecting a lot of increased utilization in the acute care setting; although actually if you talk to some hospital systems versus other, they're seeing it. So again, it is choppy and it varies from system to system. But we are seeing a general movement of care into the more ambulatory setting.","So, our general position, our strategic accounts, for example, we continue to do very well. We did well this past year, our expectations for the year going forward are positive on that. So, the underlying characteristics of how we're doing in our market to me all sort of go green, they look pretty good.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then I think the reason I was asking about the margin expectations are \u2013 just is there anything unusual or anything we should be thinking about differently between the two segments because you're not giving guidance around it? Just as we're modeling going into 2016. So if there's anything you want to call out, great. If it's just kind of what we've seen historically, that's fine, too.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll let Mike start and then I might...","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I mean a couple of things, I think first of all, we'll continue to see growth in the Specialty space like the Hep C drugs, which we said have been margin dilutive. So, we would expect to see some continued growth there. Most of the customer wins that we talked about last year that were margin dilutive are generally being lapped this year. So, we don't have as many \u2013 those types of wins like the Catamaran and some of the other business we mentioned last year. So, I wouldn't say there's anything generally different on the Pharma side for the environment.","And then obviously, on the Medical side, Cordis will have a very positive impact on our margin rates after we get through the $0.13 to $0.15 of inventory fair value step-up, Cordis is going to have a significant impact on our margin rates. But again, you're not going to see that until fourth quarter because it will be masked by the step-up.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly. Let me just again, I want to be very specific. The second part I think that Mike said, obviously, Cordis has this \u2013 once we get to the step-up, this impact.","I want to just make sure on the first part of what Mike said, what's happening is the revenue growth that's coming from certain kinds of branded products tend to be margin dilutive on a rate basis. So, I just want to make sure \u2013 that's the dynamic that I think all of us are dealing with which is when you see the revenue growth from some of these products, they can be dilutive to overall segment margins and because of the size of them, to total margin rate. But that's just a by-product of mix.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And remember this growth is very capital efficient for us too and while it might be low-margin rates, it does produce dollars very capital efficiently for us.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks. Operator, next question. We're going to try to keep going to be efficient in the call.","Operator","We go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, I just want to follow up on Lisa's question pretty succinctly just to be clear. For fiscal 2016, there's no inclusion from servicing Target or servicing Omnicare in the guidance.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Right.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","There is no assumptions for that. No distribution assumptions for us in our guidance.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, George, kind of a crystal ball question for you. In the last 90 days, we've seen a ton of moves on manufacturer consolidation and payer consolidation in the drug supply chain. If you look forward, what do you see around retailer consolidation? You're obviously well positioned with your partnership with CVS, maybe outside of the CVS kind of tell us what do you think happens and how do you see Cardinal positioned? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is a great question. Obviously, we've seen extraordinary consolidation in multiple segments across healthcare. Retailers are pretty consolidated today. Now, again, there are going to be areas and again there are others that are probably far more qualified retailers to comment on this. So, there are probably some areas where you could see some. You might see some, for example, among mass merchants or grocery combo, grocery pharmacy companies. So, I think it's an environment in which we should expect we'll continue to see some movement here.","Again, regulatory constraints are always ones that everybody needs to consider in terms of what kind of can't be done here. But I think we're really well positioned. Our value proposition to small customers is really strong, but our value proposition to these big customers is also actually really good. And so, we fell pretty well positioned.","Operator","For our next question we go to David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes, congratulations on showing growth in the Medical division's operating income on a year-over-year basis. Can you maybe just talk about Cordis like maybe the types of products that Cordis sells and how you expect to continue to grow Medical's operating income really sort of in 2H 2016 and then into 2017? And what's sort of most exciting about that asset as it rolls onto your books? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, listen, the exciting part about this is really thinking about the evolution of the system. We've seen and as I highlighted in my comments some really shifting sand in a way procedures are done the way they're compensated, the way the reimbursement systems work. We believe that in a couple of areas, cardiovascular being one, orthopedics being one, wound management being one, that there's real efficiency that can be brought to the system.","And that's not just about the products, although obviously the acquisition of Cordis really enhances the strength of our product line. But it's also around the service components that are combined with this. And so, if I'm a provider, and I'm now being compensated at a set price for a given procedure and I'm going to be penalized, for example, for someone returning to the hospital with a complication, I'm going to be very conscious of the most efficient way to do that. How do I bring value, how do I make sure that the entire procedure is done in the most efficient way, in the best way with the best outcome with the least likelihood of a return visit. So, I think Cordis represents a really unique opportunity. It has represented a real opportunity to take a major step forward in this.","I'll just add a couple of pieces. The integration work, thus far is going really well and they're recognizing that we're two separate companies still. And there are certain guard rails that are required. We've got very strong dedicated integration teams. They've been fully deployed and the preparation work that we're doing is great. I would also highlight a really critical factor, which is at this point, we feel that we basically have the entire management team filled on a global basis. And this is a group with extremely deep immersion in med tech around specific procedures and real great knowledge of their local markets. So, I think strategically it's a very good fit particularly given some of the trends. I think our integration work is going well. And just a reminder, which we often have to tell people, remember we've been a player in Medical activity in global manufacturing for many years. And so, we have some natural capabilities in this space that I think we'll be able to bring to bear.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. And then just one quick follow up. With your relationship with CVS, I mean, is there any ability to grow there especially with Cardinal HomeHealth now that Walgreens is obviously being serviced by a competitor of yours? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, again, I have to do this carefully. Our relationship with CVS is great. We really do believe that we're creating value from one another and we'll continue to look for ways to do that and beyond that it'll be hard to give any more information.","Operator","We go next to Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So, maybe just two quick mechanics relative to Cordis and the Medical strategy. I guess one of those is we had some view that you would look to launch some new areas in ortho and cardio prior to Cordis later this year. Now, with Cordis expected to close in the first quarter do you expect that there'll be a joint launch of a more full bag? Do you wait until Cordis is online for that?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure what you mean joint launch, I'm sorry. First of all, good morning.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Of course. So, as you think about bringing more products to market, you talked about having 70% of the ortho bag, I believe, by the end of the year. Do you now launch toward the end of the year? Do you wait until Cordis has closed? And do these become Cordis branded products in the future?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No. We're moving forward. Again, think of these a little bit as two separate things. We've been moving forward on the ortho line. And I would say in the fall, in the trauma specifically we're going to be starting to roll out more effectively. Cordis, we expect to close in Q2, and then that will, again, that will be its own sort of line of activity. So, I think you can think of them as conceptually they're in the same idea around helping our healthcare partners do this more effectively. But they really are two distinct lines and they've got their own timelines associated with that.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","The only thing I would add to that is you mentioned about the bag and the full bag is that the team has done such an excellent job of launching products organically of where we are \u2013 have teams that are launching products. As I mentioned, it's going to be a growth factor for us in the Medical segment. So, we have a very complete bag as it is and continue to grow that bag outside of the just the Cordis acquisition with all the efforts we have going on internally.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. And then the follow-up is relative to getting Cordis stood up outside the U.S., how much of that will be as a independent Cardinal entity? Will there be much support ongoing from J&J?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good question, Eric. So, some of this \u2013 it's going to vary by market. So, in some markets we will have a transition services agreement that facilitates the handoff from one to the other. In other markets, we've got some capabilities that are ready and we'll actually be able to fold it in. And then in some markets we're standing up some activity where that part would've been \u2013 J&J needs to keep their existing organization. We'll do some essentially stand up of, let's say, an order-to-cash capability in certain markets.","So, think of it as three kinds of buckets: one where we just have transition activities, one where we stand up some activities where we have existing operations. Good news is that we have shared goals which is that we want to make sure that we have a common customer who's well-served. So I think we're well aligned I think with J&J on is.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","We go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","David Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just one real quick one. George, as it relates to China and some of the turmoil that we've seen over there, both capital markets and liquidity wise, do you guys see any specific risks to the business given some of the economic activity over there in the short term? And conversely does the turmoil create potentially some opportunities that you might not have had otherwise to grow the business through capital deployment? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's an interesting question and I know we're running late, so I'm going to go as quickly as I can. We really don't see much change in the healthcare market as result of this. Remember, the Chinese government is really committed to getting more of its people access to healthcare and I think that drive continues to be there. So, we continue to feel very optimistic. As to whether or not this creates new opportunities, it's an interesting question and certainly one we're thinking a lot about. I think we're well-positioned there and healthcare is in a little bit of a different place than what people are seeing in the overall industrial economic conditions.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","We go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Can you hear me?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","We hear you, John.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It looks at this point like Specialty is about, what, 8% of your revenue. I know that was a big focus of yours, George, when you started with the company a few years ago. Is that number in line with your goals? Do you think there is a capital efficient way to move the needle up? And I'd just appreciate any other thoughts on that topic. Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hey, John. Well, I'd say this, we're really encouraged by the rate of growth, particularly in the last two years, I would say, that the first year or two were a little slower than, as we told you, than we'd like. But it's begun to ramp pretty nicely. We will always look for opportunities to strengthen our positions and activities where we think we have a real right to play and win. Again, that doesn't mean you always find those right opportunities, but we're growing organically. We certainly will be open to opportunities that exist in the market to strengthen our positions, but nothing specific to point to.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","Operator","And we go next to Bob Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Quick one. What's left on the payables and receivables front? You've had some success managing those line items. And what can you get out of Harvard from a working capital standpoint?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I would tell you it was an excellent year on working capital across all of them. We actually performed well on essentially really every lever: DSO, accounts payable, receivables, inventory, et cetera and delivered well on all of those. And now, having said that, I still think there's always opportunity in the future for us to do that. So, those will continue to be focus areas for us. You know that we've always been incredibly attentive to working capital and our balance sheet and that's not going to change. We're going to continue to have a focus in all those areas.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Can you size the Harvard opportunity though inventory-wise?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I mean it wouldn't be material in the sense of inventory dollars to the overall organization. So, really can't size it, but there's nothing there that I would point to that would be a driver.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank, Bob. Next question?","Operator","And we go next to John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. I had a follow-up question on the Medical business. If you look at your branded products portfolio as it exists now, what sort of organic growth are you getting?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So again, this varies period to period. We continue to grow this and I'm not sure that we've given specific rates. I will share with you that we're outgrowing the market and I would expect that over these coming years, those numbers are going to continue to increase.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, George. And maybe along the same lines, so once you get through the noise of the first half of fiscal 2016 and Cordis drops in, what sort of normalized growth do you think you can get out of the Medical segment on the bottom line longer term? What sort of objectives do you have?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, again, we're not providing any new long-term guidance, John. Here's what I would say, we've got \u2013 I've told you last quarter and as we highlighted a little bit of this upcoming first quarter. We had to get sort of a couple of lumpy things here. The general characteristics of the growth drivers in that Medical business feel really right. Like we feel like we've got the talent, we've got very clear goals internally and how we're going to go after those. We think we're aligned with trends in the market. So as we start to come to the year-end fiscal 2016, I start to feel sort of a more normalized rate of progress there. And as I said, I like that portfolio and how it's shaping up. And I really do think we can leverage the strength that we've had historically in Med Surge by driving these lines of business and products.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And for our final question, we go to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","So just a few kind of quick rapid fire questions. First on the Red Oak, I just want to confirm that the JV should be accretive to your earnings every quarter within FY 2016 relative to the size of the payments, hopefully there's no annual resets or on the mechanics or something that would cause them to have big seasonal fluctuation, just want to confirm that first.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. There's still no issue related to that.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then quickly on Medical, I'm not sure if you hit this or not, but one of your peers earlier this week disclosed a meaningfully-sized contract loss for later this year. Just curious if you guys were maybe on the winning end of that or if that maybe went to another competitor?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's improper for us to comment on someone else's call here. So for, yeah, hard to comment on this. Certainly, if we had something that we need to say that's material to us, we'll try to make sure that we highlight it. But again I probably can't comment beyond that.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And finally a real quick one, for the $0.15 Harvard accretion, can you remind us just roughly how much of that again is just financially driven purely on your financing costs versus the EBITDA you're bringing in the door versus how much is more synergy-driven? Just a rough approximation on the breakdown of that through this upcoming fiscal year. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So again, the accretion we expect to be at least $0.15, there's $0.03 to $0.04 of interest expense against that. And we expect the synergies to not only come from the sourcing side, but also we think we have some real efficiencies in the way we run the business. There are some cost synergies between the various telemarketing businesses we have. We have some incredibly good metrics and analytics around our calls, and pricing in those types of things. So, it comes from several different areas where we just have a team that has a great history of execution in this area.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Steve.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. I think...","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions on our roster. Therefore I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. George Barrett for closing remarks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, folks, I know it's been a long call. So, we'll conclude by thanking all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing all of you in the very near future. Thanks again.","Operator","And again, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"4402":["Cardinal Health, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you, Lynette. Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health's first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann; and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez.","During the call we will provide details on our first quarter results, full year outlook and an update on our strategic initiatives. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties.","During the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for the first quarter can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. In addition during the call we will provide an update to our FY 2019 outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP effective tax rate.","During the Q&A portion of our call, we ask that you limit your questions to one with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional questions.","I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. As Lisa mentioned, I'll open up with some comments on our first quarter of fiscal 2019 and then provide a brief update on the six strategic initiatives we have underway to best position Cardinal Health for future growth. I'm proud of the hard work our team is doing, and we are on track as we execute on these initiatives.","The first quarter provided us with a solid start to the year. Non-GAAP EPS came in at $1.29, up from the $1.09 we reported in the first quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter grew 8% to $35 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were $542 million and operating cash flow was $365 million. Overall, operating performance came in about as expected.","On the bottom line, we saw a large benefit from a lower tax rate. This was composed of the expected benefit from tax reform and roughly $0.18 of discrete benefits that Jorge will discuss in more detail. Based on our current assumptions, we are reaffirming our previous earnings guidance for the full year.","Turning to the Pharma segment, let me share a few comments. On the top line, we are pleased with the revenue growth of nearly 9%. This increase was driven primarily by growth from existing customers. I believe that we are well aligned with customers who are growing, and this is being reflected in our increased volume.","As it relates to segment earnings, the primary reason for the year-over-year decline is the previously communicated performance of our generic programs. Of note, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Specialty business which once again delivered outstanding results.","Looking ahead, as we focus on driving the profitability and long-term growth of the Pharma segment, we are pleased to welcome Victor Crawford, who will join us as CEO of the Pharma segment beginning November 12. Victor is a proven leader with a strong track record at world-class companies, including Marriott, Pepsi, and most recently Aramark. He brings a wealth of knowledge and strong strategic relationships with many of our partners in the acute care space and serves on the advisory board of a larger acute care hospital.","Victor knows what it takes to successfully manage a high-volume, low-margin distribution and services business and he inherits a very experienced team of leaders and a business that is well positioned with strong fundamentals. We look forward to benefiting from his experience and insight as he takes on his new role.","Turning now to the Medical segment, overall, Medical delivered profit growth of 5% on revenue growth of 2%. Let me touch on a few highlights. Patient Recovery continues to perform well, and the integration of this business is on track. We are seeing solid progress on selling our expanded offering and leveraging the Patient Recovery team's category management skills across our portfolio.","At Cordis, we continued to generate sales growth during this quarter, particularly in Asia, and we are making good progress in addressing the cost and inventory challenges we've experienced. Both our national brand distribution business and our services business continued to do very well, driven by solid demand for both. And finally, Cardinal Health at-Home delivered a strong first quarter, continuing its success in a growing market.","Headwinds for the quarter were the expected impact of the China divestiture and reduced contribution from naviHealth, following our divestiture as a result of our partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. In addition, we experienced product cost increases in a few areas in our Cardinal Health brand which reduced margins.","So all in all, while we still have work to do in the Medical segment, I am pleased that we are moving in the right direction. Importantly, we are growing in key areas of the business while taking steps to address other areas where we've had some challenges. No doubt, our expanded product breadth has provided us with new opportunities to enhance our value to customers and patients, and we are focused on taking advantage of this potential to drive long-term profitable growth.","On our last call, we shared with you six strategic priorities that our team is laser focused on in fiscal 2019: cost structure; Cordis; Patient Recovery; the Pharma model; our business portfolio; and capital deployment. We are making good progress in each of these areas. Let me touch on a few highlights and Jorge will provide further detail in the course of his financial review.","In terms of cost, we are on track to deliver targeted annualized cost savings of $100 million in fiscal 2019 and in excess of $200 million by the end of fiscal year 2020, and we continue to take a hard look at how we can operate even more efficiently. At Cordis, our stabilization program is on track. The team has made meaningful progress, and we are seeing improvements in inventory management, demand planning, and cost. At the same time, the team is taking steps to optimize Cordis' product offering and global footprint to drive higher profitability. We remain confident that Cordis will be on a path to profitable growth by the end of fiscal year 2019.","With respect to Patient Recovery, we exited our TSAs with Medtronic for North America, Latin America, and the global supply chain in late July. In addition, we exited the TSAs for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa regions in late October. So far, while still early, things are going according to plan. We appreciate the hard work of our team in meeting these important milestones. We intend to exit the remaining TSAs in Asia-Pacific in early calendar 2019. At the same time, the team is keenly focused on continuing our momentum in the business of the business.","As it relates to our Pharma model, we are continuing conversations with both our upstream manufacturer and downstream provider partners. We are discussing the industry dynamics that are impacting each of us in evaluating new models where appropriate. For example, we continue to push for differentiated pricing models with providers and less contingent margins with manufacturers.","With respect to our portfolio, we have made some progress, including the exit of our China business early in the calendar year and our naviHealth partnership. We continue to actively assess the scope and mix of our businesses, consistent with our overall objective of focusing on where we can win and driving long-term profitable growth.","And finally, regarding capital deployment, we are reinvesting in our business to drive future growth as well as returning cash to our shareholders. Jorge will discuss our balanced and disciplined approach in more detail.","All in all, we are very pleased that we are making significant strides in all of our initiatives, and we look forward to building on this progress over the balance of fiscal year 2019.","In closing, I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in getting fiscal year 2019 off to a good start. And as I said before, everything is on the table when it comes to delivering long-term growth, enhancing shareholder returns, and serving our customers and their patients. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency, and we are focused on achieving the goals we set in the months and the years ahead.","With that, let me turn it over to Jorge to discuss our financials, provide additional detail on our strategic initiatives, and comment on our outlook for the balance of the year. Jorge?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you, Mike, and thank you all for joining us. This morning I will cover our Q1 results, elaborate on our full-year outlook, and share some detail on a few of the key initiatives that Mike mentioned.","Starting with our first quarter results on slide 4, overall, these results were in line with our operating performance expectations apart from the tax rate, which was better than expected this quarter. I will discuss this shortly.","Total company revenue increased 8% versus prior year to $35 billion. This increase was driven by growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers. Total company gross margin was essentially flat at about $1.7 billion. GAAP operating earnings for the quarter were $816 million, which includes a pre-tax book gain on the sale of naviHealth of $508 million. Non-GAAP operating earnings were $542 million. Our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.29, an 18% increase from the prior year.","Our Q1 effective tax rate of 14% was lower than expected due to favorable discrete items of approximately $0.18. This is included in our Q1 EPS of $1.29. These discrete items include primarily the continuing work to alleviate the tax rate pressure created by Cordis financial performance in certain jurisdictions. We completed the majority of this work in Q1, as we anticipated and shared with you last quarter.","For Q1, SG&A increased 6%, primarily due to opioid-related expenses and a one-time stamp duty incurred in Switzerland related to international legal entity changes for Cordis. These changes were a key driver for the more favorable tax rate in Q1. I will discuss the opioid-related expenses when I cover the Pharma segment results.","Shifting to our cost optimization initiative that we introduced last quarter, we are making strong progress and seeing results. Our initial labor savings and policy changes took effect in late August and early September, and we achieved the savings milestones we set for Q1. The benefits from this and additional actions will continue to ramp up throughout the year.","I'd like to be clear. This is not a traditional cost reduction exercise. We are looking at our enterprise with fresh eyes. We are taking a holistic approach to create a sustainable operating structure, supported by meticulous cost management. As Mike has said, everything is on the table. I will cover more about this work to drive long-term growth when I revisit our full-year assumptions.","Returning to our overall results for the quarter, interest and other expense were about $80 million, a slight decrease versus the prior year, driven by a lower debt balance. Q1 average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 306 million, about 12 million fewer shares than Q1 of last year. Recently we completed a $600 million share repurchase program. We included both the amount and the timing of this program in our fiscal 2019 assumptions.","Yesterday, our board approved a $1 billion increase to our share repurchase program. We now have $1.3 billion remaining under share repurchase authorization. Separately, our board approved our quarterly dividend, which will be payable to shareholders on January 15, 2019. As we mentioned last quarter, we remain committed to thoughtful capital deployment, which includes delivering a strong cash flow yield to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.","Our continued focus on cash flow generation and diligent working capital management resulted in Q1 operating cash flow of $365 million. We ended Q1 with a strong cash balance of $2 billion, even after funding a large share repurchase program, dividends, and capital expenditures. This cash balance includes approximately $600 million held outside the U.S.","Now I'll turn to segment results, starting on slide 5. Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 9% to $31.4 billion, driven by sales growth from Pharmaceutical distribution and Specialty customers. This increase was partially offset by the divestiture of our China distribution business.","Segment profit for Q1 was $409 million versus $467 million in the prior year. As anticipated, this decrease was driven by the negative impact from our generic programs, contract renewals, and the divestiture of the China distribution business. Partially offsetting these headwinds were strong results from our Specialty Solutions business. As Mike said, we are very pleased with the performance of Specialty. It continues to be a contributor to growth through higher volume and better mix.","Let me elaborate on the opioid-related expenses I mentioned earlier that are included in our Pharma SG&A for the first quarter and full year. First, as you may remember, last quarter I mentioned the potential impact of the New York Opioid Stewardship Act, which created an aggregate annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors who sell or distribute certain controlled substances in New York State. This assessment is retroactive to calendar year 2017.","We recently received a preliminary invoice for calendar 2017. Based on this estimate, we accrued $34 million for amounts owed through Q1 of fiscal 2019. Of this number, $29 million is excluded from non-GAAP results because it relates to the catch-up accrual for sales in periods prior to fiscal 2019, and the remaining $5 million relates to our first quarter this year. Our Pharma segment profit outlook for the year now reflects our current view of this assessment's impact going forward.","This matter is complex and there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the State of New York has indicated that the preliminary invoice amounts for calendar 2017 may change significantly. Second, this newly adopted law is currently being challenged in court. As we monitor both of these factors, we're actively exploring a number of mitigation plans.","Also included in our opioid-related expenses are the costs associated with litigation in multiple legal cases where Cardinal Health is a party with our distributors, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and retail pharmacy chains. These legal costs have exceeded our initial expectations and are included in our Pharma segment results as well as in our fiscal 2019 outlook. Excluding the $29 million accrued for prior periods, we expect our total expenses in fiscal 2019 for both the New York assessment and the ongoing litigation to be about $80 million. We will continue to share more information as it becomes available.","Continuing with the Medical segment on slide 6, segment revenue grew 2% to $3.8 billion. This top line growth was driven primarily by contributions from new and existing customers. We saw strong growth in national brand distribution, Cardinal Health at-Home, and services.","First quarter segment profit increased 5% to $135 million. As a reminder, in Q1 of fiscal 2018, our results included an inventory step-up charge of $42 million for Patient Recovery. This quarter, the non-repeat of that charge was mostly offset by increased costs related to Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis.","The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, excluding the effect of the step-up, did not meaningfully impact segment profit in the quarter. As a reminder, after the close of our partnership, our share of naviHealth is reflected in other income and expense rather than in the Medical segment.","Regarding Patient Recovery, as Mike shared, we are pleased with the performance of the business and the progress on the integration. In late July we exited the TSAs for North America, Latin America, and global supply chain, which account for the majority of the overall business. We successfully worked through a few of the typical bumps seen in large integrations.","Additionally, while still early, we are pleased with the progress on the second wave of TSA exits completed in October, which include geographies in EMEA. Overall, the Patient Recovery business is performing as expected. We're on track to achieve the accretion goal we shared previously.","For Cordis, we saw top line growth in Q1, particularly in Asia-Pacific, and we continue to see the commercial health of this business improve. We mentioned last quarter that our team is executing a multi-faceted strategy to stabilize this business. This includes category optimization and geography rationalization. We successfully transitioned manufacturing lines and exited 14 countries based on profit profiles. This work will allow us to focus on the major and growing markets for this business. We are seeing positive metric trends, including improved fill rates, increased service levels, and lower back order rates. Overall, we have greatly increased our demand planning capabilities and inventory visibility and this business continues to stabilize.","Next, I'd like to direct you to our full-year assumptions on slides 8 and 9. We are on track to finish fiscal 2019 as we indicated in August. With only one quarter completed, at this time we have no changes to our corporate or segment assumptions for the year.","Current industry and business dynamics for the rest of the year will continue to evolve. We are weighing the potential impact of several factors such as brand inflation as well as the generic deflation trends. In addition, we are looking at other factors, including the final true up of our provisional tax estimates under tax reform, the value capture of our cost and structural initiatives, and the net impact of changes within the businesses of a few of our Pharma customers.","We expect our second quarter to reflect many of these elements. We continue to see good top line growth for the Pharma segment and strong performance at the top and bottom line for the Specialty Solutions business. This has been offset by some headwinds I discussed earlier as well as the renewal of Optum. Our second quarter and full-year results would also reflect the year-over-year impact of these positions.","Given all the considerations above, we expect Q2 operating earnings performance for the company to be somewhat in line with the performance in our first quarter. We will meet and likely exceed both of the savings estimates we shared with you in August. We are realizing near-term improvement that will drive us toward and beyond the $100 million of annualized savings for fiscal 2019 and likely increase the aggregate $200 million in savings by fiscal 2020.","In parallel, with this savings capture, we're implementing strategies that will empower all of our employees to practice sustainable diligent cost management well into the future. At the same time, we are actively evaluating strategies to leverage new ideas, tools, and technologies to simplify our internal operations and drive efficiencies across the enterprise. This includes opportunities to optimize resources, infrastructure, and geographies. We are developing large-scale roadmaps for this work, and we are rapidly entering the execution phase for certain work streams. We will share more progress as this work continues.","These approaches will allow us to substantially improve our cost structure and efficiently modernize our internal operating model to fuel profitable growth as we adapt to a rapidly changing industry. In light of all of these initiatives and factors I just discussed, we are not changing our full year guidance at this time.","In closing, we are pleased that the performance in Q1 align with our expectations. We're also pleased with the momentum we have gained regarding the numerous initiatives in flight that are squarely addressing the key opportunities and challenges on our horizon. We are laser focused on creating sustainable growth and delivering value for our shareholders, customers, and partners.","With that, I'd like to open the line and invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll hear first from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Mike, I guess we don't spend a lot of time typically talking about revenue, but the top line in the Pharma segment grew significantly and was obviously well above what we were anticipating in the quarter. And yet, as you guys mentioned, it didn't really have the same incremental or commensurate impact on the operating profit for the segment. So I was hoping maybe you could just go back and spend a little time helping us better understand the dynamic at play there, just what was driving what seems to be well above average top line growth and maybe not seeing the flow-through on the operating profit side within the Pharma segment.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. It was strong revenue growth in the quarter. As I mentioned, it was really because we're aligned with I think some very strong growing customers. So it really wasn't materially new business. It was really coming from existing customers who had strong revenue growth in the first quarter.","And as Jorge said, it was several things. It's just a little bit too early for us to be looking at these as trends because we know there are some upcoming headwinds with some things we're lapping, as we built into our plan. So at this point in time, we're pleased with the first quarter, but again, a little bit too early for us to call it out as a trend, but we'll continue to evaluate that.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then I guess, Mike, just to follow up there, embedded in that was just why not the commensurate impact on operating profit. Obviously, you're aligning yourselves with these customers that are driving significant or above-average top-line growth, but yet you're not really necessarily seeing that carry through to the profit side. Any further explanation just on that dynamic?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I think we obviously did see some drop-through from it. It's coming from larger customers that are going to be lower margin rate customers, so that's one thing to keep in mind. A lot of it's going to be on lower margin branded business because it's higher dollars, and so that doesn't have as high a margin rate. And as Jorge said, there are some other puts and the takes in the quarter such as extra opioid spend and a few other things that are all netting out. So we did see some drop-through, but there are several different puts and in the quarter. Thanks for the question.","Operator","We'll move next to Charles Rhyee from Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Hey, I just wanted to get a couple clarifications. Jorge, in regards to the tax rate, you talked about legal entity changes. Can you clarify? What does that mean? Are we consolidating the global footprint for Cordis and rationalizing that? And then you also talked about the increased cost rate of the Cardinal Health brand, including Cordis. Is that related to commodities? If you can just give us some more details around that, that would be great. Thanks.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Sure. On the first question about tax and Cordis, if you recall, back in Q3 our tax rate was \u2013 Q3 of last year our tax rate was very high as a result of some issues that we experienced with international legal entities for Cordis and how the profitability was looking at that time. We took pretty decisive action at that point and we began a process to restructure the legal entities that basically are the basis for the business of Cordis outside the U.S.","We began the first set of execution of steps in Q4. And as you may recall, we had actually a very favorable tax rate in Q4 of last year, and that was the result of the first steps that were executed. At that point, I also indicated that we had not finalized that project; that we would finalize it in Q1, which in fact we did. And as we completed the final steps in that restructuring, we also experienced some further discrete items that benefited the rate in Q1. So that process related to restructuring those legal entities is now finalized, and we basically went back to the place we wanted to be of the structure of legal entities outside the U.S. So that's what happened there.","With respect to Cardinal brand cost, there are a few things going on. And as you probably have heard from others, there's some substantial increases in market cost of commodities and other supplies in that business. So that has created some cost pressure. We also had in the quarter some elevated costs related to TSA-related expenses, the assets from TSAs with Medtronic, those supply chain costs, and FX was a slight headwind in the quarter net-net for the Medical segment as well.","And then finally, I'd say as it relates to cost within Cordis, we have talked about this a couple of times, but in manufacturing we have some headwinds, primarily manufacturing outsourcing costs. As we have indicated before, we have a very good plan to bring inventory balances for Cordis down to the levels that we think are sustainable and reasonable for this business. And as a result of that, production levels have come down, have slowed down, and that creates an accounting impact related to absorption that is reflected as a headwind from a cost perspective in that business.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","If I can follow up, is that to continue through the rest of the year when we think about modeling out Cordis? Because you talked about greater than expected savings, and obviously you had better tax this quarter but were reaffirming guidance. Should we think about then the difference would be more just a flow-through on the Cordis side here through the rest of the year?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I think we're thinking about this cost pressure not only related to Cordis but commodities and other parts of our cost basis within Medical. That will continue over the next few quarters. There are issues around nitro prices and other commodity prices. We're doing a lot of things to manage that exposure. We hedge where we can. We're managing inventory levels. We are trying to use pricing as possible to offset some of those pressures, but we expect that it will continue over several quarters. But again, all of those cost pressures are captured within our assessment of our guidance for this year. So all of that is contemplated and it will be a headwind, but it's included in our guidance.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","We'll move next to Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Jorge, one question of clarification. When you talked about next quarter, were you referring to EPS enterprise operating profits or a specific segment?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","My comments about Q2 was enterprise-level first, and I said that we expect the performance in this quarter, in Q2, to be in line with Q1 from an operating earnings perspective. That was my comment. From an EPS perspective, there's the tax rate. It's something that, as we have indicated before, it can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. But overall for the year, we still think that the tax rate is going to be very close to \u2013 within the range that we talked about before. But operating performance in Q2 we believe sequentially is going to be very similar.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And should we think about it in an absolute dollar value; i.e., the operating earning number that you reported in the quarter, or is it growth rates?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Correct.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No problem.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, Mike, you talked about a potential new payment model, as did your peers on their calls. How should we think about the potential transition to a model where rates are determined product by product or by product class? Should we think about this type of changes happen upon contract renewal, or is this something that's going to happen all at once? If you can give us some color there and your thoughts about the time it's going to take to make that transition.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, so since I'm not 100% sure whether you're referring to upstream or downstream, I'll just address both to be helpful. Downstream-wise, as we've said in the past, we continue to evaluate our pricing models to make sure that we are looking at the various product classes and pricing them appropriately. So basically, while we will always continue to bundle price to some degree on the Pharma side, we're trying to break that bundle down as appropriate to drive the right behaviors and protect us from margin erosion and make sure that contracts going forward are both we're getting paid appropriately and mix changes don't impact us as much going forward. And so we're working and continuing to do that. I know you've heard us and many others talk about things like Specialty and those. We're continuing to just refine that pricing model downstream.","Second thing is, if you go upstream, it would depend on the manufacturer. I'm very comfortable with the current model priced on black, like it is with the DSAs as long as we're being paid appropriately and the dynamics work as they're supposed to. The area where we're most likely to change our pricing models upstream is in the contingent margin agreements with manufacturers. If the manufacturers are going to have lower price increases or different price increases than expected per what we calculated to be our fair payment, then we're going to have to adjust those models. And we're constantly having conversations with those manufacturers to make sure not only this year we'll be paid appropriately, but going forward that those deals reflect a proper value of what we provide to them. Thank you, next question.","Operator","We'll hear next from Steven Valiquette from Barclays.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning, Mike and Jorge. So just another question on the commodity costs on the Medical business. I guess in your 10-K, you guys help us out as you give the math on the hypothetical 10% inflation on your $425 million direct exposure. And just back of the envelope calculation, it seems like that would be about maybe a $0.10 EPS impact. But I guess I'm curious to hear more color on what you're seeing on the actual inflation trends in the real world right now on this key basket of inputs so far in this fiscal year, whether that's trending below 10%, above 10%. Just any color on that might help. It's hard for us to know all the inputs in that particular component. Thanks.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Hi, Steve. Thanks for your question. Yeah, it's hard to give an overall inflation rate for the entire basket of commodities because of timing issues and all the actions that we take, and so it's hard to give an overall number. But I would say that the inflation pressures on those items are high, and we are working really, really hard to minimize the impact, but it's something that in the last several months has increased substantially. But as I said before, based on our projections, when we look at each of the products and the projections for the rest of the year, we believe that based on the forward curves that we see of inflation for those products, we can certainly manage that within the guidance for this year.","Steven Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The only real quick follow-up, just if you have a one-liner on, you sort of changed talking about the direct and indirect impact. Now you just talk about the direct impact in that 10-K discussion. Just any quick color around the thought pattern on the change there?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah so clearly, we are exposed to both direct inflation on the products that we buy to make our products, but we also have the exposure related to finished products that we buy. So the best example is exam gloves, which has experienced a lot of inflation in the last several quarters, first due to supply disruptions, and now it's more about the actual cost of the raw materials. So we track both. Obviously, the direct exposure is easier to hedge and to manage. The indirect exposure we try to handle through contract negotiations, inventory levels, and other operational actions.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question?","Operator","We'll move next to Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. Could we talk a little bit about the underlying Medical trend? Because if I adjust for the $42 million from the prior year, the implied on the base is obviously pretty negative. And I know we've talked about Cordis and some of the input costs, but I'm just trying to understand more the magnitude of how we're going to get from what looks like down double digits underlying right now back to growth, and what are the biggest buckets of that driver. I know you called a few things out, but I'm just trying to understand magnitudinally what the biggest push is on that to get particularly to the back half numbers given what you said already about Q2.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for the question. I'll let Jorge go through the details. I just want to say, though, remind everybody, we are very excited about the way Patient Recovery is going so far off of the TSAs, and we are seeing very good performance there and making some good progress. But there are some puts and takes that I think would be helpful that Jorge will give you a little more color.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, Ross, the first thing I would say is, so we have been very transparent about the performance of the Medical segment. And excluding Patient Recovery, the step up, we are down in the quarter for the Medical segment.","Mechanically, if you remember, first you need to deduct naviHealth and China. So those are two elements that deduct from the growth in the quarter. Then we have several businesses within Medical that are actually performing really well. I mentioned at-Home services. Those are businesses that are growing. And so, as you think about the rest of the year and the ramp, we believe and we are forecasting those businesses to help out the next several quarters from a growth perspective.","When we go down to Cordis, Cordis from its top line perspective has grown for the last few quarters, and we are expecting and we're seeing that all the actions that we are taking in that business will contribute over time, over the next several quarters, to ramp the earnings of the Medical business.","Patient Recovery, Mike mentioned this before. It's performing as expected, progressing well the integration. And as I said before, we feel very comfortable with respect to meeting the accretion goals that we talked about in the past. We have the challenges from a cost perspective. And I mentioned commodity, I mentioned supply chain costs. Net-net, including all of the puts and takes, we are comfortable with the trajectory of the Medical segment this year, and we think it will continue to ramp to deliver the numbers that we indicated in our guidance, the growth rate that we presented for the Medical segment. We feel good about that despite the cost challenges that we saw in Q1.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And just to follow up, relative to your comment on Q2 being flat on an operating earnings basis, if I look back historically at Cardinal, that wouldn't be an unusual outcome in prior years, flat to probably up modestly, and Q2 was fairly typical. But last year, partially given the full onboarding of Patient Recovery and maybe a little bit less of the inventory, you had a much bigger sequential step-up. And so the Street was looking for that this year.","I guess if I think about that flat guide for Q2 or color, am I to think that most of that comment or the delta is probably on the Medical side, or is it also contemplating the pricing reset from United, which seems to be happening next quarter? I'm just trying to get magnitude where the Street in your mind was probably most off.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","What I can tell you, Ross, is sequentially, if I look at the magnitude of the earnings and the puts and takes from what is seasonal and what is not seasonal from Q4 to Q1 to Q2, we are not seeing anything that I would call out as special that could yield a result that was not based on our expectations, so we see a trend from Q1 to Q2.","When I look at all the puts and takes from quarter to quarter, I don't see anything that is unusual from an operating earnings perspective. It is in line with our expectations, with the trends, with the progression that we are seeing for each of the businesses, including obviously the headwinds that we indicated we would have this year, including the headwinds related to generic deflation, customer contract renewals, those types of things. So all things considered, everything we shared with you guys and what we see in terms of drivers of the business, there is nothing unusual there from Q1 to Q2 that we would highlight.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll hear next from Michael Cherny from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, thanks for the question. I apologize for this. Maybe it's a fuzzy line, maybe whatever it is. I just want to make sure it's clear as possible. There are a bunch of questions that have been coming into me. Q1 to Q2, this is dollars that are similar, not growth rate on EBIT, enterprise EBIT?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Correct.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. If that's the case, when you think into the back half of the year, I know you reiterated guidance. In terms of that delta, what is the biggest thing in your mind, either across Medical, across Pharma, or across corporate that really gets better, especially because I know there are some concerns as we start the \u2013 into fiscal 2019 that there might be lower branded price inflation than we've seen given all the political rhetoric that's going on.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I'll mention a few things and then, Jorge, if I miss anything. First of all, remember, our Q3 is always seasonally high. And at this point in time, we are still expecting the amount of branded inflation that we essentially originally forecasted or budgeted for the year in Q3. And we have had a lot of conversations with the manufacturers that are contingent and still continuing to believe that that is the right assumption. We've said that if we're off by a couple percentage points, that could be absorbed within our guidance range. But at this point in time, we are still assuming that based on conversations that we're having and compared to what we plan to have. So remember that Q3 tends to be bigger.","The second thing is that we are ramping up our cost initiatives. And so those grow and create benefits for us over the rest of the year. And then we have some other initiatives that we continue to work on. And I don't know, Jorge, if you would add anything else to that.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No, I think, Mike, you covered all the key points there.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you so much.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No problem.","Operator","We'll hear next from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks. Can you detail a little bit more on where you were at in the progress of your cost structure initiatives? What are those next steps maybe that help us reconcile with that quarterly progression a little bit more in terms of how that or when that will materialize more meaningfully here? And given you mentioned that could exceed your initial expectations, are those higher expectations embedded in your 2019 assumptions? Thanks.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Erin. So we indicated that we are targeting to achieve this year annualized cost savings of about $100 million. Those savings actually began to accrue in Q1. We implemented some labor initiatives as well as some spending policy initiatives as a first step, and those are in flight. They were implemented. And in Q1, whatever we had in budget we actually exceeded in Q1. Those initiatives will continue to ramp throughout the year, and there are other initiatives related to operating model and other zero-based redesign operating model in each that are kicking in, in Q2 and Q3.","And as I said in my prepared remarks, I feel very comfortable about achieving the target that we set for fiscal 2019. I believe we will be actually overachieving that saving, and it will continue to ramp. When we exit fiscal 2019, we should be on or above $100 million in annualized cost reductions for the enterprise. As Mike indicated, everything is on the table. We're working on labor policy, zero-based redesign, all of those things, and we feel good about it.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. And then on capital deployment, how should we be thinking about the timing and magnitude of the debt paydown as well as share buyback with the new authorization announced today? Are you active on the buyback quarter to date?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","The first thing I would say is we just completed a $600 million share repurchase program. We paid out a dividend of close to $150 million. So our commitment to returning cash to shareholders I think is very clear. We will continue to balance our capital deployment following the same principles that we have followed in the past. We want to reinvest in the business when it makes sense.","We'll continue to pay our dividend. We'll continue to do share repurchases depending on valuation and depending on excess cash. We are not going to sit on idle cash, and we want to keep up all of those options available to us, always with the intention of having a very prudent reasonable capital structure, financial flexibility, and returning cash to our shareholders. I don't think you should expect to see any changes, any significant changes from what we have been doing for the last several quarters and years.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question.","Operator","David Larsen from Leerink, your line is open.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk a little bit more about your expectations for costs related to opioids? I think you mentioned maybe $100 million or so for the year is what's expected. How much of that is actually included in your adjusted operating results? How much of that is related to the State of New York? And if it spreads to other states, what sort of exposure are you thinking about? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for the question. I'll start and then turn it over to Jorge. First of all, I just want to step back from this whole thing and tell you that Cardinal just cares deeply about this whole opioid abuse issue and the impact it's having on families and communities. We understand it's a complex and multi-faceted problem. Many parties are involved, and we're working with all of them to help find solutions. We want to be part of the solution.","We're sure, as complicated as it is, we're going to continue to focus on that. We do want to continue to always remind folks that we're not the ones that control the supply or demand for opioids. We don't promote. We don't manufacture and we don't prescribe. So I think just stepping back for a minute, that's really important. Specifically to the costs that we're incurring and expect to incur this year between the opioid and litigation spend, let me have Jorge give you a little bit of detail on that.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, Mike. So just to clarify, the number that I mentioned in my prepared remarks was about $80 million of expenses related to both opioid litigation or opioid legal fees as well as the New York assessment that we are contemplating for the next few quarters. Within that number, I would tell you the majority of that number is related to legal fees.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then if it expands to other states, is that included in this $80 million estimate? And based on what you know now with your discussions with your attorneys, is that a possibility or not?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","It is too early to make any comments on that.","Operator","We'll move next to John Kreger from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Courtney Owens for John Kreger, but our questions were answered, so I'll just hop out of the queue. Thanks, guys.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","We'll move next to Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, good morning. Mike, I just want to go back to your comment earlier in your prepared remarks. So you said everything is on the table. You clearly talked about what's happening on the medical supply component of your business and continued challenges there. You've talked about some of the other elements of your business. What do you mean exactly by that comment, number one? And number two, what's the review process that you're going through today to look at what businesses make sense for Cardinal on an ongoing basis?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for the questions. I would say it comes from a couple different angles. First of all, from an expense standpoint, we're saying everything is on the table. And as it relates to there, just because we've been doing something this way in the past doesn't mean we're going to continue doing it. We're looking very aggressively at things such as putting robotic automation in place to be more efficient, looking at blockchain, other things like that. So we are looking at all types of automation and activities, streamlining, spans, and layers to get aggressively after our cost structure. We're also looking aggressively at the way we contract both upstream and downstream. And just because again we've been doing something one way in the past, we're looking hard at that.","And that's not just what we typically talk about, which is the Pharma segment, but very much so also in the Medical segment. We are very much looking at the fact that we need to do category management in a much more disciplined and aggressive way than we ever have, because we believe that it's actually not only just better for us, but much better for our customers, because when we carry fewer SKUs and can drive higher service levels and better costing, it allows us to operate more efficiently in our distribution centers. It allows us to be a better partner with the manufacturers that we partner with. And most importantly, we can provide better service levels and better costing to our downstream customers in Medical. And that is something that we need to be aggressive at and look at. It's not something you can change overnight, but it is something that is clearly on the table.","And then I would say in the third bucket is around the businesses. We are putting a lens on every business that we have. We are being dispassionate about how long we've had it, why we've had it, where it's at. Can we win, are we best positioned to be a winner with that business, and what are the growth prospects of that business? And we are doing, as you can imagine, a very detailed analysis on each one of our businesses. And we look at them, and when appropriate, we will work through the appropriate either exits, partnerships, or growth if we think it's an area for us, then we want to double down. And so we are being very fact based and not emotional or stuck to anything that we do.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just as my follow-up, Jorge, I think that we continue to get the question, I know you answered this several times as we think about first quarter to second quarter. It is EBIT that you expect to be flat first quarter to second quarter. Is that the right way to think about it?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","That is correct. Yes, Lisa.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No problem.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","George Hill from RBC, please go ahead.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Jorge. I'm going to get on the guidance merry-go-round one more time. And I guess as I look at the guidance for the Pharmaceutical segment, you're talking about low single-digit revenue growth and high to low single-digit EBIT growth decline for the year. Q1 put up, as Bob noted earlier, very strong revenue growth. I don't see a reason why that would shift in Q2. It looks like something flips in the mix significantly in the back half of the year because the implication would be revenue growth slows down pretty dramatically while margins would have to somehow improve given the guidance. I guess is there any more color that you can give us around the moving pieces in the drug segment as it relates to the EBIT and the guide? And I have a quick follow-up, if we have time.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, I'm going to repeat something that Mike said with respect to revenue, so let me start with revenue. Clearly, we had a very strong Q1 with a growth of 9%. At this point, we don't want to extrapolate from that number. Our largest customers are growing really fast. They had a good quarter. That benefited us. Mike talked about that. When I look at the progression of the quarters, we expect the top line to have a healthy growth, in line with what we indicated in our guidance. And within the businesses, we have Specialty great Q1, and we're seeing good performance for the rest of the year.","And the other pieces, we talk about that. You'd have branded inflation. Q3 is the key quarter for us. At this point, we don't have any reason to believe that that number that we have in the budget for Q3 is going to be different. I think we feel good about that. And then generic deflation will continue to be a headwind for the rest of the year, as we indicated in our guidance, and that's what we're seeing today. So there is no \u2013 in totality for the Pharma segment as well as, yeah for the Pharma segment in totality, what we are projecting now is in line with what we had initially contemplated for that segment.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","One thing I'll add that just might be a little bit helpful is remember, some of our larger customers also they still warehouse and buy the products from us. So it's hard to over one quarter when they can be adjusting their inventory levels up or down to all of a sudden determine that's a trend for a whole year. And so as I said, we're comfortable that we're aligned with strong growing customers. Remember that sometimes just on the days of the week or the timing of some of their decisions around inventory, it can cause revenue to fluctuate a little bit, and we just want to be prudent to let some more time pass and feel that it's a little bit early.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess if we look at the brand side of the business, we've seen the authorized launch of a generic \u2013 or we're about to see the authorized launch of a generic drug in hep C, and we've seen Amgen take a steep price cut on a cholesterol drug. As you guys think about the changes to the branded side of the business, do you think your unit economics can stay the same or your unit profit can stay flat in an environment where manufacturers are taking price of their own accord or (61:16)?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, absolutely. We're having very active conversations with manufacturers. Whether it is launching an authorized generic but that acts actually more like a brand that we are looking at the unit rates that we are making and adjusting the percentage fees appropriately with those so that we don't lose net dollars. And we are having very positive and proactive conversations with manufacturers related to this because the value of what we do does not change as they make these large price decreases, and that we still need to get paid for the services that we provide. So we're having very appropriate, proactive, and I think good conversations with manufacturers around those types of items.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question? Operator?","Operator","Eric Percher, please go ahead.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. Maybe back to the conversation around everything being on the table, we learned this quarter that you're exiting the Specialty Pharmacy business. Could you speak to what was behind that and the commitment to Specialty distribution?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Absolutely, thanks for the question on that. I guess first and foremost, we're incredibly committed to Specialty. We've said that we had another really great quarter with Specialty. The business continues to perform very well, and it remains one of our key growth drivers. We've done exceptional job of growing the business, consistently double digits, both upstream and downstream to providers and manufacturers.","I do want to emphasize, though, we still possess specialty pharmacy capabilities. We still have a full service specialty pharmacy that complements our Metro Medical dialysis products business, and we also have a non-commercial specialty pharmacy that is part of our Sonexus hub services business. This was just an individual specialty pharmacy that we got through an acquisition in the past that represented a very, very small portion of our Specialty Solutions business, and that we just didn't feel that we were in the best position to grow that particular piece of business. It was incredibly small, and to continue to grow it to reach competitive scale just didn't make sense for us.","So it's very consistent in how we've talked about evaluating our portfolio around simplifying, playing where we can win, and being dispassionate about those types of things. But I want to stress that we are deeply committed to specialty, invested in several areas in specialty in this area, and continue to have scale in all the tools we need where we need to be and want to be in specialty.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","So I should take from that that in supporting your current customer base, you feel like you have those capabilities, but you're no longer looking to create a significant specialty pharmacy presence for its own purpose.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I think if I understand that right, that would be right. Everything that our current customers need, whether it's a provider or really manufacturer, we can service them. But having just a separate standalone specialty pharmacy and competing in that environment with these dynamics just didn't \u2013 it was again, incredibly small, very minor to our earnings that it just didn't make sense to continue to hold on to that. And we believe that we sold it to someone else that can do very well with that and add to the scale they already had.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, I think we have time one more question.","Operator","Your last question will come from Eric Coldwell from Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, I get the scraps today. Thanks, guys, for letting me in, just a couple of quick technical ones. First off, on the New York stewardship, the opioid situation, have you changed how manufacturers ship to you, or are you considering doing so such that they pay the fees and not you?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","As you can imagine, we are looking at that. We have communicated to manufacturers that there will be some changes in the way we would expect to operate going forward. We plan to work with them and with our provider customers. But we will and have \u2013 we will be making changes and have had discussions and communicated with manufacturers around that. Specifically what the details are, I'm not comfortable going into those exact details. But as you can imagine, we would expect to mitigate the cost of that assessment going forward.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sounds good. Now the $80 million of opioid cost in non-GAAP guidance, how much of that is incremental from the original guidance this year?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Over half of that is incremental to our original guidance this year.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kaufmann for any additional or closing comments.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you very much. I just want to end with thanking all of you for your questions. And most importantly I want to wish you all some enjoyable time with family and friends over the holidays. Take care, and I'm sure we'll be seeing many of you.","Operator","That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation."],"4264":["Cardinal Health, Inc.

Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call.","Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, and welcome to Cardinal Health's second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call.","I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann; and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of risks and uncertainties.","Today's press release and presentation are posted on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.","During the discussion today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures and reconciliations to GAAP are included at the end of the slide presentation and press release.","During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit your questions to one with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional question.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Mike Kaufmann.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we report on Cardinal Health's performance for the second quarter.","I'll begin with an overview of the results and then touch on our outlook for the balance of the year. Then, Jorge will provide further details in his remarks. Having worked with Jorge for many years, I couldn't be happier to have him as my partner and our CFO.","Before we turn to the quarter, though, I'd like to take a moment to thank George Barrett. As you know, I took on the CEO role on January 1. We have had an incredibly smooth transition, and we look forward to George's continued guidance and contributions as Executive Chairman.","Also, I am excited that Jon Giacomin has assumed leadership of our Medical segment, and we're thrilled to have him in his new role. Jon is a veteran of Cardinal Health with a proven track record as an operator. His knowledge of our customers, enterprise strategy and focus on execution will be invaluable in his new capacity. I'd also like to thank Don Casey for his contributions to Cardinal Health and we all wish him well in his new endeavor.","Let's now turn to the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with the results. Performance across the vast majority of the business was at or above plan, and this translated into the numbers, with 6% revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the benefit of tax reform, of $1.31, ahead of our expectations.","Among the highlights this quarter was the Pharmaceutical segment performance, where results were better than expected. And in the Medical segment, the Patient Recovery, at-Home, and naviHealth businesses all performed well. On the flip side, we have some work to do in a couple of discrete areas, specifically in exam gloves and at Cordis, and we are on it.","Turning first to the Pharmaceutical segment, revenue was up 5%, driven by better-than-expected results in Pharmaceutical Distribution and continued strong performance in the Specialty and Nuclear businesses. Generic market pricing continues to trend as expected and Red Oak has continued to perform very well, delivering better-than-planned results on the cost side. I continue to be impressed with the talent, strategies and execution of the Red Oak Sourcing team and appreciate their partnership.","On the brand side, I am pleased to report that based on both Q2 results and increases we saw in January, brand inflation remains in line with our expectations.","And finally in Specialty, with another strong quarter, this business remains on track to deliver double-digit top and bottom-line growth for the year. So in sum, I'm very pleased with the results of the Pharmaceutical segment.","In the Medical segment, we also delivered solid performance across most of the business. Revenue was up 19% for the quarter, driven primarily by the benefits of the Patient Recovery acquisition. In addition, we saw growth in our new and existing customers reflecting the appeal of our differentiated offer. In fact, we achieved sales growth in all product categories except exam gloves. This was our first full quarter with the Patient Recovery business having closed the transaction last summer. We are thrilled with the job our new associates around the world are doing. The integration is on track and we are excited about the long-term potential of this business.","As I noted, we also saw excellent results from services, Cardinal Health at-Home and naviHealth. In fact, all of these businesses were up double digits for the quarter, driven by growing demand and solid execution.","While most of the Medical segment performed well, we did see some challenges in exam gloves where, as we previously discussed, commodity pricing and supply disruptions have created headwinds. We're actively exploring avenues to minimize this impact in the future. Also, at Cordis, the good news is we continue to generate top-line growth. However, profitability has been softer than we expected, reflecting higher than anticipated cost as Jorge will address. As a result, we now anticipate Cordis results to be lower than previously expected for the balance of the year.","Let me assure you that Jon Giacomin and Pat Holt, the new leader of Cordis, are already on this and working with the team to improve the performance and produce the kind of results we believe Cordis is capable of. As you know, this is a higher-margin business for us, and once we address the current challenges, we expect to see meaningful leverage as we grow sales.","I would also note that we are excited about the recent FDA approval of our partner Medinol's innovative drug-eluting stent for the treatment of patients with narrowing or blockages to their coronary arteries. In January, the first commercial cases using the stent in the United States were implanted successfully. As Medinol's distribution partner, Cordis can now provide this novel stent and delivery system as part of our interventional vascular portfolio for customers. This is a significant addition to the portfolio and Cordis remains committed to bringing new technologies like this to the market to provide even more treatment options for clinicians and their patients.","Let's turn now to our outlook. For the full fiscal year, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook by $0.40 to $5.25 to $5.50 to reflect the benefits of U.S. tax reform. While the following items net to zero, this revised outlook includes better-than-expected performance in the Pharmaceutical segment, lower expectations for the Medical segment due to Cordis and exam gloves and a $0.05 impact from the sale of our China distribution business, which was completed on February 1. Jorge will cover the details of all of this in a few minutes.","Having grown the China business over the past seven years, the timing was right for this transaction. To be a market leader in China and get the type of returns we expected, we recognized that significant scale was required. Shanghai Pharma brings the strength and scale necessary to position that business to better meet the needs of patients throughout China. We appreciate all of the good work that was done by our talented team in China to build this business, which is now poised for further growth.","As we announced, the gross proceeds from the transaction are $1.2 billion and the net proceeds are approximately $800 million. We will be evaluating the use of the proceeds as well as the benefits from tax reform as part of our overall capital allocation strategy. We remain very committed to the balanced capital allocation process that we have followed for many years. Of course, we'll continue to invest in the business to ensure that we have sustainable growth and we will continue to carefully manage our short and long-term debt obligations.","At the same time, we have a differentiated dividend that is very important to us and we always look at strategic M&A opportunities. In addition, we have a track record of utilizing share repurchases to return cash to shareholders at appropriate times. Toward that end, as you saw in our press release issued this morning, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program.","In summary, it was a strong quarter, and as I look ahead, I am very excited about the outlook for our company. With the breadth and balance of our portfolio, Cardinal Health is well positioned for the future. We have an excellent foundation on which to build. We are a valued partner to our customers across the healthcare continuum. And as our strategies have taken hold, we are poised to capitalize on the trends taking place in the global healthcare environment from the aging population to the continued shift of care to more efficient settings.","As an organization, we are focused on continuing to innovate to improve the delivery and efficiency of healthcare. As always, our talented team of nearly 50,000 colleagues around the world are the core of our success and what truly differentiates Cardinal Health. It is an honor to represent them as CEO. I thank them for their hard work this past quarter and their continued commitment to our company.","Let me now turn it over to Jorge.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Mike. I'm delighted to begin this role and to join my first earnings call as CFO.","Now, before I share about our performance, I'd like to give just a few thoughts. As I enter my second month in this role, I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us. I look forward to partnering with Mike, our leadership team, our Board and our investors to drive sustainable growth for Cardinal Health.","Now, let me review in detail our strong financial performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The financial results that I provide this morning will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. Slide 7 of the presentation includes our GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the second quarter.","As Mike said before, we are pleased with the second quarter results. Based on the performance year-to-date, we feel confident about Cardinal's outlook for the year.","Starting with EPS, diluted EPS for Q2 was $1.51, a 13% increase versus the prior year. This includes a reduction of the federal tax rate, resulting from the recent U.S. tax reform. I will discuss this in detail in a few moments.","Revenue increased 6% versus last year, totaling $35.2 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 16% to $1.9 billion versus the same quarter in the prior year.","Consolidated SG&A increased 24% versus last year in line with our expectations. This increase was driven primarily by our recent acquisitions, most notably the Patient Recovery business.","Consolidated operating earnings were $730 million, which represent 4% growth versus the prior year.","Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense was about $81 million in the quarter. The increase versus the prior year was driven by the interest on the debt issued to finance the Patient Recovery acquisition.","Our effective tax rate this quarter was 26.2%, an 8 percentage point improvement versus the prior year, mainly driven by the recent tax reform.","Second quarter diluted average shares outstanding were approximately 316 million, about 3.5 million fewer shares than the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Yesterday, as Mike mentioned, our Board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, and now we have about $1.3 billion available for share repurchase.","Operating cash flow for the quarter came in at about $300 million, in line with our expectations.","During the first six months of the fiscal year, we generated approximately $1.5 billion in operating cash flow.","Our cash balance as of December 31 was $1.2 billion with about $500 million held outside the U.S.","Now, let's move to segment performance. The Pharmaceutical segment delivered revenue growth of 5% in Q2. Revenues were $31.1 billion in the quarter. Sales growth was driven by both pharmaceutical and specialty distribution customers. This segment revenue increase was partially offset by the contract expiration of a large mail order customer, Prime Therapeutics in May of 2017.","While exceeding our expectations, segment profit for the quarter decreased 4% to $514 million. This decrease was driven by costs related to the ongoing investment in our Pharmaceutical IT platform as well as the net performance of our generics program. We anticipated these headwinds and they were partially offset by strong performance in the Specialty business. Once again, the Specialty team delivered strong top and bottom-line growth in the quarter. The Pharma IT project continues to progress well and is on budget. Excluding this costs in the quarter, the Pharma segment profit would have been flat.","As Mike said, generic market pricing and brand inflation performed in line with our expectations this quarter. Based on this, and what we saw in January, we continue to be confident in our full-year assumption. As a reminder, our generics program includes the impact from average selling price, volume changes, and the benefits of Red Oak Sourcing.","Now, let's go to the results up in Medical segment. Revenue for the quarter grew 19% to just over $4 billion, primarily driven by the Patient Recovery acquisition and, to a lesser extent, new and existing customers. I'm happy to share that this is the first time this segment revenue exceeded $4 billion in a single quarter.","Medical segment profit increased 38% to $220 million during Q2. This increase was driven by contributions from the Patient Recovery business, which was partially offset by the performance of Cardinal Health Branded products, including Cordis.","Please note segment profit for the quarter includes a $22 million inventory fair value step-up expense related to the Patient Recovery business. Excluding this expense, Medical segment profit growth versus last year was 52%. I remain close to the integration of Patient Recovery. I am very happy to report that while still early, this business is performing on plan. Our teams are working very well to ensure a successful on-boarding.","Also, I'd like to call out that Cardinal Health at-Home distribution services and naviHealth all performed very well and were all up double digits in earnings for the quarter.","Now, I'd like to mention a few challenges we continue to address. As Mike mentioned, our exam gloves business has continued to see supply disruptions and commodity challenges similar to what we noted on our first quarter call. Our sourcing and commercial teams are pursuing several projects to minimize the impact from these dynamics.","With respect to Cordis, let me provide some additional details around the ongoing performance and overall trajectory of this business. Overall, we are encouraged that in each of the last two quarters, Cordis revenue grew driven by our business outside the U.S. And we are excited to see the acceleration of our product partnership agreements. As you may recall, these partnerships have grown more slowly than expected. However, we are now seeing improved momentum in both product breadth and financial performance.","Notably, as Mike said, we are excited that our partner, Medinol, received FDA approval to launch a new drug-eluting stent in the U.S. market through Cordis distribution. This is a key addition to our portfolio. While we continue to make progress on the commercial front, the overall earnings performance of Cordis was impacted by inefficiencies in the global supply chain and elevated SG&A outside the U.S.","The team is fully focused on these issues and we have implemented robust remediation plans to address both inventory and SG&A challenges. We recognize it will take a little time to work through these items but we are moving expeditiously. The Cordis business remains a top priority for me and for the organization. We have great leaders in that business who have support from the entire enterprise to put this business on a capital-efficient growth trajectory.","Transitioning back to our Q2 performance, on slide 7, you will see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter. A $1.82 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS was primarily driven by the transitional tax benefit of $2.83 offset by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, impairments, and litigation.","I now like to move to the topic of tax reform. I will quickly outline the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our second quarter and full fiscal year. While we have completed our initial analysis of the tax reform impact, keep in mind that these amounts are provisional and we may require adjustments in future periods. I think it is helpful to show you the performance for the quarter and the full year with and without the benefit of tax reform.","If you look at slide 9, in the first column, we have provided a walk from our second quarter reported non-GAAP EPS of $1.51 to our non-GAAP EPS excluding the impact of tax reform of $1.31. The $0.20 reflects the benefit of the lower blended federal tax rate applied to our year-to-date U.S. pre-tax income. As a company with a June 30 fiscal year-end, we have a blended U.S. statutory sales tax rate of approximately 28% for fiscal 2018.","Now, let's talk about the total year EPS assumptions in the second column. Our new non-GAAP EPS guidance range is $5.25 to $5.50. The walk to our original full year guidance includes a full-year benefit of $0.40 resulting from tax reform. This reflects the benefit of applying the lower blended sales tax rate of 28% to our full fiscal year forecasted U.S. pre-tax income. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance range excluding the impact of tax reform remains $4.85 to $5.10.","As I noted earlier, there is a benefit of $2.83 resulting from tax reform, which is excluded from our non-GAAP figures. This is the estimated net benefit from both the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings in foreign subsidiaries. I think it is important to note that there are certain provisions of the new tax law that do not become effective for us until the beginning of our fiscal 2019.","Provisions that could be a headwind for us include the elimination or repeal of certain U.S. deductions and the addition of new international provisions. Despite these headwinds, we expect our non-GAAP ETR for fiscal 2019 to be lower than fiscal 2018.","Moving on to slide 10, you can see there are no changes to our fiscal 2018 revenue assumption and we have included the updated non-GAAP EPS guidance range.","Now, turning to slide 11, for our full-year corporate assumptions, you will see that we have made three changes. First, given the recent tax reform, we are updating our non-GAAP ETR to a range of 29% to 31%. This is consistent with what I shared at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in January.","Second, we are revising our full-year share count projection down slightly to a range of 316 million to 317 million shares. And finally, we are updating our acquisition-related intangible amortization to $576 million or $1.16 per share. This is excluded from our non-GAAP EPS.","Our Pharma segment assumptions are on the slide 12. We have one change to these assumptions. As you may have seen, we completed the sale of our distribution business in China on February 1 earlier than anticipated. As a result, we estimate a $0.05 per share negative impact to our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS. As Mike mentioned, we can absorb this in our current guidance. Also as a reminder, the China distribution business reported in both of our segments by contributing more to the Pharma segment.","Our Medical segment assumptions for fiscal 2018 can be found on the slide 13 where we have one update to report. Given the challenges with Cordis and exam gloves that I discussed earlier, we expect the Medical segment profit, excluding Patient Recovery, to be flat to down for this year. One thing that I'd like to note is that on January 22, the medical device tax (sic) [medical device excise tax] (25:23) was suspended for two years in line with our fiscal 2018 expectations and existing guidance.","From a capital allocation perspective, we are continuously looking at the most optimal deployment of capital. We will review cash benefits from tax reform and the proceeds from the China divestiture through the lens of optimizing sustainable and capital-efficient growth. We are committed to deploying capital in a balanced way through organic growth and differentiated dividend, value-creating M&A and share buybacks.","In closing, we are pleased with our Q2 performance and excited about Cardinal's overall position. We're confident in our ability to execute throughout the remainder of the year.","With that, I'd like to open the line and invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll be taking our first question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research.","Clayton Meyers - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Clayton Meyers on for Eric Percher. It's just \u2013 a good quarter on the Pharmaceutical segment. I just wanted \u2013 a few questions on that business. Particularly, it sounds to be (26:51) if I'm reading correctly that you performed better than expected on the buy-side via Red Oak. And then particularly I'm just wondering as you think about the generic market, if there is a difference in pricing between different generic categories, most notably, in oral solids and injectables, and maybe that's what we're seeing some noise from the manufacturers over the last couple of months. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Clayton, thanks a lot for the questions. Yeah. You're right, I think we had a very good quarter in the Pharmaceutical segment, it absolutely exceeded our expectations. And as we mentioned, a lot of it had to do with Red Oak in its performance on the cost side. As I mentioned, the generic deflation is trending basically about where we expected it to be.","As far as your question on solid orals and injectables, yes, the majority of our generics that we sell and when we talk about our higher margin source program are our solid orals. Most of the injectable generics that we sell are through the GPO non-source programs, which are a lower-margin business for us. So that could be a little bit difference of why you might hear some different messages from pharma manufacturers. But we feel very good about where the Pharma segment is, particularly as I mentioned, Pharma distribution, but also Specialty and Nuclear continued to perform well for us.","Clayton Meyers - Nephron Research LLC","Great. Thanks. It's very helpful.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Clayton. Next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. So I'm just trying to dig in a bit on the Medical side to just sort of understand some of the underlying. The color was helpful. But we've got a euro that's better that should help a number of the businesses and it looked like the inventory step-up was probably a little bit less then what you originally guided, and so those should've been I think a bit of a net benefit. And so as we're thinking about the headwind, Cordis, you called out but there, you've got a product launch and it seems like that's a pretty good product launch, and that's helpful. So where really is the magnitude of the delta I guess in the traditional business coming from? I'm just trying to tease out some of the parts.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Ross, for the question. A couple different pieces. The first thing I want to really emphasize, and then I'll let Jorge go through some of the details of the moving part, is the overall Medical segment is doing very well that when you take apart the business and take a look at how our post-acute businesses are doing, the at-Home and the naviHealth businesses, our services businesses, our product lines, they all are doing really well. So we feel good overall about the segment, but I'll have Jorge talk a little bit about the challenges and see if we can give you maybe just a little bit more color.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, Ross. As we said before, in addition to Cordis, exam gloves is a headwind for us right now. It's been for a quarter or so now and the challenges will continue for a little while. One thing for you to remember also with respect to the core business is that the loss of VA that we had last year, we are still dealing with that headwind. Beyond that, as Mike said, the other businesses, and I indicated that on my prepared remarks, are doing really well.","Your comment about FX, FX is not a headwind for us right now. As you said, it's probably a little bit of a net benefit. But remember that we have long exposures from a sales perspective but we also buy a lot of products and materials in foreign currency and so that offsets some of the benefit from FX.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. And maybe just a quick clarification on the tax rate. So in the deck, the ETR, you kind of quoted as 29% to 31%, and then in the press release we had 28%. I'm just trying to understand the difference between the delineation of those two definitions and then really understand kind of what the trajectory is into 2019 because I recall at JP, you talked about a number more in the mid-20s.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","That's a good question. The 28% that is the federal corporate tax rate. So that's a clean rate. The 29% to 30% is the effective tax rate, which includes not only the federal corporate tax rate but also all our taxes like state tax and things like that. So there is a little bit more to it on the effective tax rate. So that's the difference between those two.","With respect to the second question about 2019, and I indicated that on my prepared remarks as well, we are experiencing a step-down this year is blended given the difference between the first half and the second half of the year, but we also expect a further step-down in 2019 as we experience the whole benefit for the full year of the 21% tax rate. Remember, there is also some provisions that kick in in 2019 that will offset some of the further step-down in 2019. But net-net, you should expect to see our ETR in 2019 to be lower than in 2018.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","We'll take our next question from George Hill with RBC Capital Markets.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. It's Stephen Hagan on for George. So just kind of a housekeeping item on the inventory step-up costs, with the lower impact this quarter, what's the expectation now for the full-year impact?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","So Stephen, this quarter, in Q2, was the last time that we had the step-up expense. So going forward, we won't have that effect anymore.","Stephen Hagan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then on the Pharma segment, what kind of drove the strength this quarter? Was there any pull-forward of future benefit, or was it really also the Specialty and the other things you pointed out?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","It was really just better-than-expected results on our generic programs in Pharmaceutical Distribution and then strength in both our Specialty businesses and our Nuclear businesses.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks and good morning. It's Mike Minchak in for Lisa. I guess first question, in the past, you had talked about $0.16 of investments related to customer initiatives and spending related to opioids. Just wondering if you had any update in terms of that commentary and sort of how much of that ramped in the second quarter and what's the expectation for the full year?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes. Sure. So a couple of pieces. As it relates to the opioids, we started to see some spending in Q2, but it was actually very minor. We took a little bit longer to get that ramped than we expected. We still expect to spend the full amount that we said we would. So you saw a little bit of a timing benefit in Q2 on not spending it, then you'll see more of a catch-up full spend in Q3 and Q4. And we actually are starting to see that spend already in January and February. So we feel good now that we're on track to see the spending go the way we expected it to now for the rest of the year.","As far as the customer investments, I still feel like, as you can imagine, we did \u2013 they're still included in our outlook for the second half of the year. So we still are having ongoing conversations with the customers. And as I've mentioned before, I reiterate these are existing customers and these are some strategic initiatives that we're working through with them. And while I was hoping that we might have those finalized by now, I would still \u2013 I still feel like we will sometime this quarter.","Michael R. Minchak - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then as a follow-up, can you talk about utilization and volume trends in the Medical segment across both the acute ambulatory and home segments and sort of how we should think about the strong flu season is impacting the results and expectations for the year in both the Pharma and Medical segments?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. With respect to utilization, that is always a difficult, I guess, metric to track and because it depends on manufacturers. And so for us, the way we think about it is we look at our customer base and how they are doing. And what I can tell you is that our businesses are performing well in terms of sales. The majority of our customers are growing and as you see more consolidation in the medical space, there will always be some winners and some losers. And so utilization for us is a function of that. We see a good growth in our key accounts in the Medical front and that's reflected on our revenue growth performance so far.","With respect to the flu season, in December, we saw some activity, and we believe in January, it's picking up a little bit. From a financial standpoint for us, in Q2, flu was not really a driver but we know that over the last few weeks, it's picking up.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Liza C. Garcia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. This is Liza on actually for Ricky. Just clarification on the tax rate for this quarter. Can you maybe dive into \u2013 is this a lower federal tax rate assumed for the December quarter in the $0.20 and also why the $0.20 is outsized relative to the expectations for the next two quarters?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. That's a good question. The way it works is the ETR is a projection for the full year. So the projected ETR is in the 21% to 31% range. So if you pick the midpoint, the first half of the year is adjusted in a way that it's kind of a catch-up entry so that the average for all of the quarters' results in a 30% rate. The first quarter rate was kind of a typical rate of 36%. And so the entry in Q2 needs to average the two quarters such that the average for the entire year is a 30% range that we're talking about. So it's a mathematical adjustment to average the rate for the entire year.","Liza C. Garcia - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. I guess I know you've touched on kind of a lower tax rate going into fiscal 2019, but I guess how should we think about that relative to the 5.60% (38:09) that's been called out?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Remember the 5.60% (38:13) was an early outlook that we gave a while back and we have a lot of moving parts that we're going to be taking a look at. We still feel it's early to really talk about FY 2019. Clearly, tax rate will be one of the movers that we'll take a look at as we put together our guidance for next year. We're going to continue to take a look at our Patient Recovery business and how it's doing. So far, it's tracking as we expected it to be, but it's only been a few months, so we're going to want to get a little bit more time under our belt there.","Obviously, the continued impact of the exam gloves, how Cordis is going to ramp up for us next year. And then, we'll take a look at generic programs and the net impact of customer wins and losses. Those are some of the things that we want to still play out for a few more months and another quarter or two. And then as we have in the past, in August, we'll come out with our guidance for 2019. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk a bit about margin expectations for the Medical division? I know that we had talked about with, I think, 5.75% margin long-term at one point. Any thoughts on that? Thanks.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Dave. Yeah. If you look at the margin rate for this quarter, which was about 5.4%, that rate includes actually the inventory step-up expense related to Patient Recovery. So if you adjust for that expense, that is not going to happen on the second half of the year. We are very close to the 6% margin rate expectation that we have for the second half of this year. So we feel good about being on a path to get into those margin rates for Medical that we discussed before.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's great. And then just any thoughts on commentary from Washington around drug pricing reform, any thoughts on what the administration might do or not and how that could impact the business? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, and thanks a lot for the question, Dave. And just a couple of things about that. When I think about price reform and its impact on us, I'd kind of break it down into generics and branded drugs. And from a generic perspective, I think we can all agree that it tends to be the vast majority of those items are deflating and that they're roughly 90% of prescriptions in the U.S. are generics. And so from a cost effectiveness for the entire healthcare system, generics continue to be very, very cost effective for the system. So it's hard for me to imagine something in the area of generics that would be materially in the terms of the drug pricing area based on just the overall economics and the trends we're seeing in generics.","As far as it goes to the branded side, as we've seen both in our guidance and others is that we're now only expecting to see somewhere in the neighborhood of 7% to 8% inflation from branded drugs. So the branded manufacturers themselves have cut back significantly on the amount of inflation or price increases that they've had. We continue to see that. And then as you're translating that into how it impacts us, as we mentioned in the past, we expect to be, and from everything we're seeing right now will be more than 90% of our branded margins are going to be non-contingent to inflation.","So if you put that around, less than 10% of our branded margins are contingent to inflation, which again is down to 7% to 8%. So for us, as Cardinal, I think that this is an area that we feel good that we ought to be able to manage through very effectively however it goes in Washington.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. A lot have been asked but just maybe going back to, on Red Oak. Can you talk about sort of longer-term, when you think about the contribution here, obviously, we're talking about sort of a lower contribution year over year expected this year versus last. But as you kind of look at over the next couple of years, we do have some more launches coming. Can you think about \u2013 can you give us a sense on how maybe as we think about 2019, how that contribution could vary as we go forward? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. We're continuing to feel really good about Red Oak. It's not just about the fact that our scale and our ability to source, but that team is just \u2013 first of all, it's a great group of folks. They're very strategic. They're constantly thinking about new ways to approach and work with our manufacturing partners, thinking about the pipeline of launches. So I feel really confident in their ability to continue to give us year-over-year benefit.","As I said, it might be a little bit less going forward year over year as we continue to work through the items. But anytime we see launches and stuff, I fully expect that Red Oak will put us in the best position possible to compete in the marketplace and have the best cost position. So continue to feel really good about all the work that they're doing and the benefits that will continue to drive going forward.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Is it fair then as when we just look at the calendar of launches, is that a good proxy then just to think about sort of the incremental change in benefit from Red Oak? Or do you think we should think about Red Oak continuing to perform maybe better than what the market would look like?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question. There is so many things that go into it. So clearly, the launches are an important piece of it, but each launch is so different. Depending on whether it's a 2-player or a 5-player, whatever number market, the type of drug, how hard it is to make, the timing of the various launches, when other players come out on current drugs that might be 2 or 3-player markets, they get continued competition. So it's hard to really pick any one item and predict it.","And so as we get closer to giving 2019 guidance, we'll give you some more color around the benefits that we expect from Red Oak. But whatever the environment is, I expect that we'll be in the best position to compete with just the team we have there. Next question.","Operator","We will move on to Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. Yeah, so just I know you've kind of answered this a couple of different ways. I just wanted to go back to make sure I understood the back half of the year. Big beat in the quarter even if I adjust out the benefit for tax from both the quarter and the guidance, and yet it looks like you're really not raising the back half at all. So I guess the question really is, are you anticipating some areas getting worse? Is there something you have visibility into the back half? I know you mentioned China but that's not all that significant in the grand scheme of what you did in the quarter and then you're not really raising the guidance outside of tax?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks. I appreciate the question. So let me just give you a few thoughts on that. First, for me right now it just feels a little bit early to be raising guidance. I mentioned there are some small timing type of things that we'll be absorbing like the opioids that I mentioned that had less spend in Q2 and we'll have some more spend in Q3.","As Jorge mentioned, we expected Cordis profits to ramp up in our original projections, and those are ramping up as quite as well as we would have liked them to. And then also the exam gloves has been somewhat of a challenge and we're still working through our various solutions there.","And then as you just mentioned, we have the $0.05 from China. So you have all those, and then as a positive, as we've said, we feel really good about where the Pharma segment's at and that we do continue to expect it to be better than expected. But at this time, when we take all those puts and takes and put them together, we just feel the right thing to do is just to at this point in time maintain our guidance adjusted for the impact of tax reform.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And I guess just one quick follow-up on Medical. And I feel like you do get this question at least the last few quarters, but your largest peer there focused on the acute space continues to struggle quite a bit. And one of the main areas they talk a lot about is a very challenging end-market, yet that doesn't seem to be the case even if we kind of parse out Medtronic and Cordis around what the message is that you're sharing on that core business. So is there anything, any light you can shed on this for us as far as market share shifts, maybe just a different type of customer mix, because it really has become quite divergent between the message from your core Medical business and your largest peer?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question on that, too. I appreciate that. I don't want to comment on competitors' actual results. But I will say a few things. First of all, I think there has been some supply disruptions in the market for sure. But those items for us, from a profitability standpoint, have not been that significant of a driver in our Q2. And while we still see that there'll probably be some supply disruptions in three and four, we also don't expect that to be much of a negative driver for going forward for us.","Now, we truly understand how difficult this is on our end-customers, and we know that it is making their lives tough and we are working incredibly hard every day to get after supply and make sure that we are on top of those things. But as far as the profit driver, it's not big. I think the big difference for us is that we made a decision years ago that we were going to change our value proposition. And that while distribution would always be part of our core and something important for us that we really needed to have a product strategy and that was going to differentiate us that we could take advantage of those rails going to those customers every single day and that we would be able to then drive our product mix and improve our overall profit. So I think the real difference here is our value proposition. And we've seen that play out in some of the recent wins over the last year or so. So I think it's really that is the difference in our value prop.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thanks. A quick follow-up on the customer initiatives you mentioned in the previous quarters as well as earlier on the call. I guess given we still don't have so much clarity there, would these expenses get pushed out into fiscal 2019? And can you just give us some greater color on what these initiatives entail? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks. No. We don't expect them to get pushed into 2019. The amount that we had set aside and had given some early color on, we still would expect to happen in the second half of our fiscal 2018. And as far as more color, I can continue to really only say that it is with existing customers. It's something that we're working on with them that both sides would really be important long-term valuable opportunities for us. And other than those two things, I really can't speak more about it.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. And on Medical, can you speak to some of the broader drivers across the international markets? Where did you see sort of pockets of growth on a geographic basis? And I think you briefly mentioned this but what's truly embedded in your guidance as it relates to the foreign exchange impact? Thanks.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Hi Erin, this is Jorge. I'm going to take that question. I would break down the international markets between Cordis and Patient Recovery. I think for Patient Recovery, what I would say is right now it's early to tell. We are on track with our deal model with respect to sales expectations in the international markets.","With Cordis, it's a lot easier to see the performance in those markets. And I can tell you that the Cordis business is doing very well in Asia Pacific. We've seen tremendous growth in markets like China. We've seen a good turnaround of trends in other markets like Japan and we see some growth in places like Korea and Australia-New Zealand. For EMEA, we also see, in certain buckets, a fair amount of growth.","The assumptions that we have with respect to FX in the forecast, we alluded to that before. FX is a little bit of a tailwind for us and that's what we have included in for the balance of the year, but it's not a significant driver.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC","Hey. This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. Just a quick one on the generic deflation front. I know you've kept the mid-single digit assumption unchanged for the fiscal year. But, I guess, are you seeing anything materially different trend-wise on the buy-side and the sell-side as we've moved into 2018? And then kind of where do you envision that's going as we get into the back half of the fiscal year in comparison to the first half? Is it still in that mid-single digit range? Or was the first half slightly more deflationary? And then are there any material contracts, or RFPs, coming up on the sell-side for 2018?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Great. Remember, our calculation for generic deflation is a point-to-point calculation. So we basically look at the end of last year and to the end of this year, and we still expect, at that point, to see mid-single digits as our ultimate deflation number. And so we still feel good about that estimates and are trending there as far as \u2013 as we look at our continued trends.","The piece, as I mentioned before, that's doing slightly better which is helping us is on the cost side. So deflation is tracking about where we expect, cost is tracking a little bit better, and that's driving some upside for us in Pharmaceutical Distribution. And as I mentioned, Specialty and Nuclear continue to perform better than we expected.","As far as RFPs go, we don't actually really have any large account RFPs that we're renewing in our fiscal 2018 and those that are out there that are large, actually don't renew until the end of our fiscal 2019.","Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. I tried to back out when all of my topics were covered. So thanks very much. I'm good here.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","All right. Thanks, Eric.","Operator","And we have time for one final question with John Kreger with William Blair.","Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Courtney Owens on for John Kreger. Just a quick question. So can you provide us with just a little bit of an update on naviHealth? I heard you guys say that it performed pretty well during the quarter, but just would like an update kind of on what your expectations for that portion of the business going forward, and kind of what's been like the recent client uptake on that service. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. The business \u2013 we really are excited about the business itself. It's got a really good team. I think they're on trend. We're continuing to see both providers and payers looking for help in the post-acute space and we think we have a unique model that combines both software and analytics with clinicians to be able to really provide a top-notch service to those customers. So we continue to feel good about that business. We're making continued investments in that business, because we do see it as a business that we see growing going forward. But other than that I just, again, feel really good about it and feel good about the team.","Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC","Awesome. Thank you.","Michael C.

George?","George Barrett","Thanks Sally. Good morning everyone and thanks to all of you for joining us on our second quarter call. I am pleased to report a very strong second quarter, bringing to completion an excellent first half of fiscal 2015. I'd like to take a moment to welcome Mike Kaufmann to his first quarterly earnings call as the CFO of Cardinal Health. Mike and Jack have worked closely during the transition and I appreciate their collaboration. Mike brings tremendous operating experience to our financial team and has adjusted quickly to his new role.","Total revenues for the second quarter were $25.5 billion, an increase of 15% versus last year second quarter. We were pleased to see sales growth from both existing and new customers. Our second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20, up 33% from last year's $0.90. Remember that our same quarter last year included a $0.16 expense related to a tax item. When we adjust for tax item, our second quarter FY15 non-GAAP diluted EPS increased by a robust 13%. At the same time we returned $438 million to our shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends during the second quarter bringing the total amount returned to our shareholders for the first half of the fiscal year to over $900 million. Based on our results for the first half of fiscal 2015 and our perspective on the back half of the year, we are now raising our guidance to a full year EPS range of $4.28 to $4.38.","As I typically do, I'll provide some color on the segments, but before I do that I'd to offer a slightly different perspective on being Cardinal Health. Our health system is going through significant changes, not the least of which is a continued blurring of the lines between healthcare players and channels. Our approach to addressing the market has been aligned to this trend, bringing the full range of Cardinal Health capabilities in a holistic framework to address the needs of these increasingly integrated customers.","With this as a backdrop, I'll speak about the segments, but please recognize that in many instances we are going to the market not as a Pharmaceutical segment, not as a Medical segment, but as Cardinal Health, an integrated source of strategic solutions and the creation of our strategic account teams will only expand this enterprise wide effort.","Now to the segments, first our Pharmaceutical segment. Second quarter Pharmaceutical segment revenue was very strong. Sales for the quarter were $22.6 billion, an increase of 16% over the prior year, showing positive signs in nearly all of our business lines and in all classes of trade. Our organization has been unwavering in its commitment to ensure that our customers see us not only as extraordinarily reliable, but also able to help them adapt to the changes in the system. A couple of notes here on revenues. On a year-over-year basis we were pleased to pick up some new business crossing all classes of trade, but including one larger mail order customer, which as you know historically contributes to our margin rates.","And as many of you know, the treatment of hepatitis C has evolved into a major therapeutic class, and one which has changed dramatically over this past year. The distribution of these products contributed meaningfully to our revenue growth, but has a dilutive effect on our margin rates. The overall performance of our generic programs remains strong and Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with CVS Health is clearly an important strategic initiative for us. We are increasingly excited about this partnership, and are very pleased about the way our collective talent has fully integrated as one team. They've been working hard to make sure that our supplier partners feel that they are part of something that creates value for all stakeholders. We feel confident that the Red Oak model was designed thoughtfully and built to prioritize execution and simplicity and I can report at this stage, we\u2019re tracking somewhat ahead of our plan to transition manufacturers to the Red Oak program.","Of course sourcing product is only half the story. We have seen continued growth in our base of customers and increasing number of home source generics from us, and our range of products and services continues to attract pharmacy customers. Our specialty solutions organization continues its track record of excellent revenue growth. You will remember from our last earnings call that we expect sales for this unit to attract $5 billion for the year and we are increasingly confident that we will exceed that number for our fiscal year. We continue to look for opportunities to expand or reach to a broader range of therapeutic areas.","We have positioned our specialty business at the nexus of biopharma, payer, provider and patient. We\u2019re committed to keeping the patient at the center of our strategy and our enhanced patient access and support reinforces that focus. Upstream we continue to look to look for opportunities to broaden our pharmaceutical and biotech relationships and to expand the tools we offer these partners who serve unique patient population.","So next one Medical segment. We reported revenues for the quarter of $2.9 billion, an increase of 4% versus prior year. Our Medical segments top-line was driven by recent acquisitions and growth in existing customers. Our profits were affected by continued challenges in Canada and the year-over-year customer loss in surgical kitting referred to in our calls.","One important financial note, our Medical segment profits were significantly impacted this quarter by increased incentive compensation, a byproduct of raising our enterprise wide forecast and the Company expenses to the segment. Having said this, our strategic initiatives in the Medical segment continue to send positive signals, each of which is critical to our overall positioning.","We\u2019ve spoken consistently about the movement of care migrating into more ambulatory settings. Our collaboration with Henry Schein addresses an important link in the chain as we serve highly integrated health systems, whose networks now include many smaller physician practices as well as independent practices.","Combining Henry Schein\u2019s logistics and service capabilities with Cardinal Health's strength in other channels will enable us to serve these customers more efficiently while increasing the flow of Cardinal Health products into these new channels. The partnership is off to a good start. Meetings with our two sale organizations have gone well and they're working hard on the implementation of the integrated selling effort.","We\u2019ve made our first customer presentations as a combined selling organization and here at Cardinal Health we\u2019ve seen our first orders for products destined for these new channels. Consistent with our perspective that care will increasingly be delivered in different settings, we continue to be really excited about our work in the home. Cardinal Health at Home continues to deliver good growth.","Our direct-to-patient business Edgepark continues to grow at double-digit rates. We\u2019ve have been introducing Cardinal Health branded products into this channel. Specifically we would expect that by the end of fiscal 2015 to have launched over 100 new products through this platform, primarily in the areas of wound care and in continents. Our strategy around private label consumables and physician preference items is aligned to address an important need in the system tackling the inefficiency associated with the proliferation of products and need for standardization. Building scale reducing variability, improving outcomes while reducing cost, this is at the heart of our strategy.","Specifically in the trauma area, we\u2019ve made tremendous progress in building out our product-line, helped by the acquisition of Emerge Medical. We expect to be able to offer a reasonably full line of trauma products by early next year. At the same time we have trained over 200 residents on orthopedic trauma using the Cardinal Health trauma products.","In wound management we've made a strong commitment to negative pressure wound therapy, and we're in the process of launching 25 SKUs in this area. As is true with all of our products, the introduction of a wound care portfolio leverages our channel reach to create an integrated wound care solution that stretches across the continuum of care.","Finally at interventional cardiology our AccessClosure acquisition is going extremely well. Some recent new sales on closure devices in our strategic account is an encouraging sign as it relates to the power of combining AccessClosure's product line and the breadth of our customer relationships. Further on the technical side our MynxGrip is now the only closure device in the U.S. indicated for venous closure.","Finally China continues to execute well against our plan with very robust double-digit sales growth. As you know, our development in China has been thoughtful and purposeful, built on a foundation of service, integrity and compliance as a key differentiator. Our balance sheet remains strong and we will not be shy about deploying capital to achieve best sustainable competitive positions in strategically important areas. Having said this we will continue to be both focused and disciplined in our deployment of capital, using partnerships to strengthen our position where that's more efficient, Red Oak and Henry Schein being two recent examples.","Let me conclude my comments by offering this perspective. This remains an exciting time to be in healthcare and our organization is aligned with the important trends which are shaping our new landscape. But we're also an organization committed to disciplined execution in a business that demands great attention to detail. Over the past 18 months our pharmaceutical segment has come to a critical transition, repositioning its customer base and dramatically improving its tools and has emerged stronger than ever.","Our medical segment is going through its own transition moving from an organization focused on med\/surge distribution to an organization which creates value in new ways for customers with new needs. It is also a segment which contains many important mid and long-term drivers of growth.","In summary it seems clear that growth will be driven by demographics, by more Americans having health coverage in some form, that care will continued to be delivered in new settings and at times by different care givers. Consumers will be more actively involved in their own care. Pharmaceutical innovation will continue to create treatments and in some cases cures for life's most threatening diseases.","Those who bring tools help manage the quality and the cost of care will be winners, and the efficiency created by scale will be valuable. We bring these things and we are increasingly aware that we have a unique position in the marketplace. It's difficult to find another Company with this kind of reach across the system and we are committed to bringing an increasingly integrated marketplace solutions across traditional lines. This is central to our competitive advantage.","And with that I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks George and good morning everyone. Before we get into the earnings discussion, I just want to say that it has been an exciting few months for me since becoming CFO. I've enjoyed not only leading the Cardinal Health finance team but also meeting with many of you, our investors and analysts. For those of you I have not met, I look forward to speaking with you soon.","Now on to the quarter. As George mentioned, we are happy to report strong financial performance this quarter, and to be raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance. I will first walk through the drivers for the quarter's financial performance and then provide some insight into our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our Web site as a guide to this discussion. I will start by talking about consolidated results and then go into more detail in my segment discussions.","Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.20, an increase of 33% versus the prior year. As a reminder the prior year quarter includes a $0.16 charge related to a tax item. Eliminating this item non-GAAP EPS grew 13% year-over-year. Again this quarter revenues exceeded our expectations up 15% to $25.5 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 8% for the quarter but the rate was compressed a bit largely because of Hepatitis C therapies launched within the last year and some shift in the margin rates related to the recent expansion of our customer base.","Total SG&A increased 6% versus the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of acquisitions. Consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings were up over 10% to $639 million or a non-GAAP operating margin rate of 2.5%. In the quarter net interest and other expense was $7 million higher, due in large part to the timing of various components of the long-term debt refinancing we completed during the quarter.","On tax, as we have said in the past, our non-GAAP effective tax rate can fluctuate quarterly due to changes in international and U.S. state effective tax rate resulting from our business mix and discreet items. This is why we only provide annual tax rate guidance. You will notice that for the first-half of this fiscal year, our non-GAAP tax rate was 35%.","We still expect our full year tax rate to be 36% to 37%, which implies a higher tax rate in the second half of this fiscal year. Our second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were $334 million, 12 million shares favorable to the prior year\u2019s quarter. During Q2, we repurchased $324 million worth of shares leaving about $1 billion of share purchase authorization remaining under our Board approval.","To complete my review of the consolidated numbers, let's move to the consolidated cash flows in the balance sheet. We generated a robust $953 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. As a reminder, operating cash flow was Q1 was light, which was largely just a function of timing and we expected some shift between quarters. At the end of the second quarter, we had cash on our balance sheet of $2.9 billion, which includes $448 million held internationally. Our balance sheet allows us the flexibility to deploy capital in the most efficient way to return value to shareholders and to drive sustainable growth. Speaking of capital deployment, as Pharmaceutical segment CEO, I was part of our capital committee and actively involved in all major deployment decisions. You should expect that our strategies around capital deployment will remain intact.","Now let me take a moment to reiterate these priorities. First, we are committed to investing in activities that reinforce the sustained strength of our core businesses. Next, we remain committed to our differentiated dividend that we expect to grow at least in line with our long-term non-GAAP earnings growth rate. Third, we will not be hesitant to deploy capital for acquisitions which further strengthen our businesses and best position us for leadership in this evolving environment. We\u2019ve thought pretty consistently about our strategic priorities and these will of course be the areas where we will devote the most attention as we consider inorganic moves. And as we\u2019ve done in the past, we will continue to consider share repurchases. This fiscal year, we have repurchased $684 million worth of shares.","Now let's move to segment performance, starting with pharma. Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 16% to $22.6 billion, driven by growth in our base of existing customers, as well as the impact of new customers. Pharma segment profit increased 12% to $542 million, due to strong performance under generic programs, which includes the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing. Also our profit was positively impacted by continued growth from existing customers, as well as growth from new customers. The Pharmaceutical segment profit margin rate decreased 9 basis points, impacted by customer pricing changes, newly launch hepatitis C pharmaceutical products and the impact of new customers. These were partially offset by strong performance from generic programs which again include the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing.","The branded hepatitis C therapies launched within the last year have been a topic of great interest in healthcare. Just to be clear, for Cardinal Health, these sales contribute to top-line growth but the overall impact is dilutive to margin rates. Additionally as a reminder, these products are recorded within the pharmaceutical distribution results, not our Specialty sales.","With respect to our generic programs, we saw strong unit growth this quarter. Also, as projected Red Oak Sourcing was accretive in the quarter, net of the $25.6 million payment we made to CVS Health. As a Board member of Red Oak, I continue to be impressed with the efficiency and speed at which the Red Oak team has executed. They have now transitioned suppliers representing greater than 95% of the total generic spend. For the quarter, as it relates to the impact of generic manufacturer price increases, we did see a slight year-over-year decrease in contribution.","Now let's go to the Medical segment performance. Revenue for the Medical segment increased 4% to $2.9 billion, driven by acquisitions and growth from existing customers. Medical segment profit decreased 12% to $115 million, with the largest negative driver being a year-over-year increase in enterprise wide incentive compensation, as well as the continued impact of market pressures in Canada and the related repositioning of that business. These factors also drove the Medical segment profit margin rate this quarter, which decreased by 73 basis points.","Since the performance our Canadian unit has been a challenge over the last nine months, let me take a moment to discuss it. I recently met with the Canadian team and left impressed with the new team members, the optimism of the entire team, their pipeline and their strategic plan, which includes accelerated movement of Cardinal Health branded products.","We should see some recovery in that business starting later this calendar year. While there have been challenges in certain discreet areas, the medical segment continues to execute against the strategic priorities. For example, within our strategic hospital accounts, we continued to achieve organic growth of more than 5% versus the prior year quarter. This remains a key area of focus, as we demonstrate to the large integrated health systems that we create enterprise solutions to address the challenges they face.","Now I'd like to give you my observations on our Medical segment, not only from my new CFO seat, but also from my experience as CEO of the Pharmaceutical segment and President of the Medical business some seven years ago. As George mentioned, medical has been going through a critical transition. I'm particularly aware of this as I compare our profit drivers today to what they were seven years ago.","Over this time the profit pools have shifted and under Don's leadership the team has adapted and made tough decisions to invest in certain key priorities while reducing emphasis and investment in others. Our medical team has built new capabilities and made the moves necessary to reposition the segment to create more value per customers and partners and to participate in new profit pools going forward.","Before we move on, I'd like to briefly tough on what we are seeing around commodities as this has been top of mind for many of you. For FY15, as we previously said due to the time lag within our supply chain we only expect to see very slight benefit and that is included in our updated guidance range.","Now while it is very early, I just want to give you my preliminary observations regarding FY16. We're continually updating our commodities forecast, including analyzing them based on forward curves. Our most recent analysis indicates there will be a modest benefit of $10 million to $20 million in fiscal '16. For those of you who remember commodities being a large headwind some years ago, this may seem low.","While there are several factors causing this, let me touch on two of them. First over the past few years the prices of inputs to our Cardinal Health brand products no longer move in tandem with crude oil prices. Second, since we experienced significant commodity exposures in the past, we have worked to temper these through strategic and operational measures we have taken with our suppliers. Any updated estimates would be included in the FY16 guidance that we typically provide on our Q4 call.","Now turning to Slide No. 6, you will see our reconciliation of consolidated GAAP results to non-GAAP for the quarter. The $0.34 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by litigation expenses, amortization and other acquisition related costs and loss on extinguishment of debt. You will see on the schedule that the net of tax impact of the debt redemption resulted in a $37 million GAAP expense.","Let me begin to wrap up with a brief discussion on the remainder of FY15. Based on our strong first half performance, and helped a bit by the lower tax rate in Q2, we are increasing and tightening our overall FY15 non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $4.28 to $4.38 from the prior range of $4.10 to $4.30.","A few comments about the new guidance range, what we've realized today and what we are assuming. Based on the overall revenue growth fiscal year to date, we are updating our total company revenue guidance from up modestly compared to FY14 to now expecting the full year revenue growth to be in the high single-digits. As for each segment, we continue to expect our Medical segment revenue growth to be as originally provided, low to mid single-digit growth versus FY14. And following two quarters of strong growth, we now expect the full year Pharma segment revenue growth will be in the high single to low double-digit range compared to the prior year.","With respect to Red Oak, as George mentioned, the transition of the manufacturers to the Red Oak program have been a little faster than our previously discussed expectation. It is too early to comment on the timing, sequencing or impact around the possible Nexium launch, and so we have not included this in our updated guidance.","There are multiple variables that are still up in the air including legal maneuvers, the timing of launches, capacity and the number of other companies who could potentially launch. When the facts become clearer we will evaluate its impact on our new guidance. Also it is worth mentioning that our assumptions around branded and generic inflation have not changed. We still expect branded inflation to be about the same as fiscal \u201914 in the low double-digits and across our generic portfolio, while we still expect slight inflation, we have modeled the overall benefits to moderate in our second half versus what we experienced in the first-half. Our guidance range also assumes that our head wind we\u2019ve experienced in Canada year-to-date will carry through the remainder of the fiscal year.","Looking at our corporate assumptions, our full year non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 36% to 37% remains unchanged, which as I mentioned previously implies a higher tax rate during the second half of this fiscal year. We are slightly reducing our interest at other range to $135 million to $145 million. We are also lowering our diluted weighted average shares outstanding range to 336 million to 337 million shares. We are modifying our capital expenditure guidance to $340 million to $350 million, and finally our amortization slightly increased, based on the few previously mentioned small acquisitions we\u2019ve completed in the first-half of the fiscal year. In summary, we are really pleased with the progress we have made in the first-half of fiscal \u201915 and expect similar execution in the back half of the year. So with one quarter under my belt as the new CFO, I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming weeks and months.","Operator let's begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Bob Jones ","I seem to have couple of on Medical, trying to calibrate things here. I know you guys had mentioned incentive comp as a headwind in the quarter. Could you maybe just give us a sense of what the margin in Medical would have been of you adjust for incentive comp year-over-year?","Mike Kaufmann","This is Mike and thanks for the question. Really can\u2019t go into details of what it would be adjusted, but I will give you a little color in that the majority of the comp that you saw pushed out into the Medical segment was in the area of 401(k) and that\u2019s because that\u2019s based on employees and as you know, a significant portion of our employees are in the Medical segment.","Bob Jones ","That's helpful. I guess just one big question around that then is as we think about where we are today in Medical on the margins, and moving towards at some point that long-term goal of 5.75%, just wondering if you can maybe help us think about the path to get there? And then if I could just sneak in one specific one, Mike, on the commodities. I believe you said it was a tail wind of $10 million to $20 million for next year. If I go back and look at your 10-K filing, it looks like the impact from a 10% move and the example you gave in your slides would have resulted in about a 30 million impact. I'm wondering if there was some changing [ph] in hedging between June and today.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, thanks for those questions. I\u2019ll talk about the commodities first and then I can go back to giving you a little bit more color on medical margins or George can do that. And as far as the commodities go, remember a couple of different things. First of all as I said, which is really most important, what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is all of the components of our -- of the items that make up commodities for us, they do not really track in tandem with crude oil prices anymore. While historically several years ago you would see that for the most part, you don\u2019t see that any more. So that\u2019s a really big driver for us as we track both current and future rates on commodities.","Also -- you also know that when we did have those significant issues in the past, as you could imagine we took a look at our contracts with our manufacturers and really focused on trying to rework those contracts and relationships with the manufacturers, so that we would not see these types of ups or downs going forward in the future. And so that\u2019s really what\u2019s probably tempering your estimates of the numbers.","George Barrett","And Bob if I can -- its George -- maybe just touch base a little bit on the drivers as it relates to the goal of expanding margins in Medical. Let me just carve them out. Key growth areas will be the services around our distribution platform. So the traditional supply chain activities are now a much broader range of services that we\u2019re beginning to offer. Those typically carry higher margin. Growth in our consumables, particularly our private label consumables, our physician preference items, I talked about wound management, I talk about interventional cardiology, I talk about trauma. Growth in these are higher margins. Growth in the Home is important to us. Again this is an area where we\u2019ve seen excellent growth and expansion of margins. So the overall positioning of these activities really drives mix. Again I think remember, for example private label products now being driven in through our home strategy. So these are all expansive to margins. And then finally positioning with the key accounts in the system. So it's really -- a large component of that is both mix of product line and in some degree mix of customers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee","Maybe if I can follow up on Bob's question, and maybe ask in a little different way. If we were to exclude the Canadian business out of the Medical segment, can you kind of give us sense on how that is performing over the last couple of quarters? Margin improvement and -- as you have been pushing out preferred products and the physician preference items?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, I can appreciate the question but I really don't want to go into that level of detail on it. Again there are a couple of discrete items that we mentioned. It's really the Canadian business that is a big factor and a pushdown of compensation are really driving the Medical segment year-over-year negative performance.","Charles Rhyee","Then maybe on the Canadian side, you talked about meeting with the team and you said you like the strategy they're kind of playing out to you. Can you maybe give us a little bit more details on how you guys are planning to tackle some of the issues here? I know you talked about more Cardinal branded products. But what is specifically there that we can hope to kind of get around some of the issues?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. Thanks for that question. I did get a chance to actually go up there and spend some time with the team and I've had some involvement over the years with them. I think a couple of things on their mind. First of all as I mentioned, focusing on shifting where possible our Cardinal branded products, that's a big important piece.","One other thing to remember is we are really the only distributor up there in the med\/surge area that has reach of the entire -- of all of Canada. And so I think the team has done some really good things around leveraging our supply chain to be able to work with manufacturers to drive more opportunities up there. They're also as you can imagine looking aggressively at their cost structure and they're doing things with their management team and I've really liked where they have been able to bring some new blood into some really talented folks that are looking at the business differently. In fact I know our new CFO up there really came from one of our customers up there and really understands the business and is going to bring some new ideas to the table.","George Barrett","This is George. I might just want to add something to sort of back to where you started. We're not going to start to break out and pull out the pieces of the [indiscernible] business on medical, but I would probably offer this. When we look at our all of our strategic priorities, and we're doing pretty consistent metrics around our medical business, we actually see some very good signs, and it's actually been an operating according to our internal forecast.","So our growth is strategic, accounts is good, consumables growth is good. The physician preference item strategy as we've told you is sort of a more mid-term driver of the business, but we actually like some of the underlying characteristics that we've seeing. We have seen over the years that traditional med\/surge distribution has seen some pricing pressure over the years. But that's something that we anticipate and expect and we like the growth that we're seeing in the home. So when we look at the components that are making up this segment, we really like the way the pieces are going. Again we're going to have to absorb the changes that we saw in this Canadian mark and I think we'll also lap this -- part of it with the market change that we had to deal with.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo","George, I just want to follow up on some of the commentary around generic price inflation. I think you seemed to suggest that maybe you saw slightly better inflation on generics sort of year-over-year. But I think you're moderating your assumptions in the second half of the fiscal year versus the first half. Are you kind of implying that maybe some of that was pulled forward? Could you maybe just flesh out a little bit more what you're seeing in the marketplace and how we should think about the trends?","George Barrett","Glenn, let me start and then I'll be happy to have Mike chime in and he's obviously been very close to it from his prior role. When we talk about moderating for the back half of the year, it's largely just a model at this point. We don't have perfect transparency on pricing. We have historical models. We do the best we can to use those to guide us going forward. We have in the interactions with the suppliers. But there is not something absolutely discrete perfect trend line that tells us what to do. We just thought the numbers in the first half were reasonably strong. And so what we did was we just moderated that somewhat in the second half, and that's the way to approached. But it's difficult to come to us a perfect number on this.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. I can just add a little bit of color. So as I did mention, for the quarter as it relates to generic inflation, this quarter was slightly less than last year's quarter, as there was a year-over-year decrease in the contribution. As far as Q1 versus Q2, Q1 was a little stronger than Q2 in terms of rate. And you were right, you did hear me right. We do expect the second half of the year total generic inflation contribution to our bottom line will be moderated compared to the first half of the fiscal year.","Glen Santangelo","Maybe if I could just follow up on capital deployment. George, you said all along that your preference is clearly to do strategic M&A versus share repurchase, but here we are halfway through the fiscal year and you\u2019ve kind of already blown through your share repurchase target. Should we sort of read into that, that maybe you don\u2019t see anything on the strategic M&A front that interests you, or maybe if you can just give us an update there on how we should think about capital deployment through the balance of the fiscal year, given where the leverage sits on the balance sheet?","George Barrett","Thanks, Glen. No, I don\u2019t think you should read and anything into it actually. We are always looking at the most efficient way to create a great position for strategic growth. And there are moments where those opportunities are right in front of you and there are moments where they are not, but I don\u2019t think I would read into it. We\u2019ve done a small -- a couple of small moves in the physician preference item area over the last year -- last few months. And we\u2019re always actively looking. It's just a matter of finding that opportunity you think drives the value you want and you have to have someone there decide really to do it at that moment. But I don\u2019t think I would read anything into it.","Mike Kaufmann","We\u2019ll continue to opportunistic where it makes sense on the share repo, but I guess -- maybe the only other thing you could read into is that we\u2019re being disciplined and we\u2019re going to make sure we pick the things that match to our strategic priorities and are at the right price.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill ","Maybe, Mike, quickly on generic inflation, when you talk about the decreasing impact year-over-year, should we think about the decreasing impact as lower sell side margin contribution on higher generic drug prices or should we think about kind of lower carry on inventory that inflates? What's the right way to think about the contribution there?","Mike Kaufmann","I really don\u2019t think I can go into a lot of detail on that. Let's see if I can help a little bit. As you know there are different ways you can make money on generics. There is obviously the difference between what you sell it at and what you buy at. So we\u2019re always focused on that. And then obviously there is the appreciation on inventory when you have -- do have price increases. So there are a lot of different components including how you price, penetrating current customers, et cetera that improve our programs and drive margin. So to be specific how any one single margin bucket works would be difficult. And obviously our manufacturer contracts and discussions are incredibly confidential and competitive.","George Barrett","I guess some -- I want to make sure I understood the question George. I don\u2019t think there is anything mechanical that we\u2019re highlighting here. It's just the overall pricing environment. So I don\u2019t think that we can -- if that\u2019s a question it's a not a unique mechanical dynamic. I think Mike's just describing the overall pricing trend.","George Hill ","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just kind of a quick follow-up on the Medical segment again. Just -- I don\u2019t know -- I'm wondering is there any more color you can give us on kind of what would drive the rapid increase in the 401(k) contributions in that segment of the business compared to other segments?","Mike Kaufmann","So the best way to think about it is, is the way we look at compensation. We look at it is all of Cardinal. And so when there is overall performance from the business, then one of the biggest pieces that get funded first is our 401(k) program. And we don\u2019t distinguish between our employees on whether they're in the M or the P segment when overall cardinal health is performing. And so since we had a strong first-half, it caused us per our internal guidelines to increase our accruals on our 401(k) and knowing that a significant portion of our employees are in the Medical segment, then those costs just get allocated to the Medical segment for the employees and their 401(k) contribution.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen ","Hey, can you guys talk a little bit more about the operating margin in the Pharma division. So I think you called out a couple of things; pricing, new customers and Hep C. So, margin I think decline by about 8 basis points year-over-year. Can you just give any more color on sort of what the -- like the size -- the buckets for each of those items that you called out and which ones have greatest impact? ","Mike Kaufmann","I did get into a kind of detail, but clearly those were the two largest -- over 9 basis points of decline in margin rate and the two biggest drivers were just some new customers that we mentioned. As George mentioned we had one large mail order customer that tends to come in at lower margin rates. And then as I think you\u2019ve seen from a lot of folks in the industry, the hepatitis C drugs have been doing very well. This is really important drug class and we too have seen significant sales of those drugs in our business. And because they come in at much lower margin rates than typical our average, they are lowering our overall margin rate.","David Larsen ","So you obviously saw a good growth year-over-year in terms of dollars, I think up 12% year-over-year. So the mail order customer, such a new customer that came in at lower margins as a percentage of revenue? Is that correct? It wasn\u2019t a shift just to mail? And then obviously the Hep C is new revenue at a lower margin rate, right? Is that correct?","Mike Kaufmann","That\u2019s right. It's a new customer, that again being newer [ph] is mostly brand business and so it comes in at lower margin rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson","This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. I had a question about the Hep C -- the Hep C product as a percentage of your total sales. Could you provide a little bit more color on that?","Mike Kaufmann","Sure, our Hep C drugs as a percentage of our total Pharma segment revenues is less than 25%.","Elizabeth Anderson","Okay. And in addition, I was just wondering if you could give some additional color on the early wins and challenges from Red Oak? I know you said that you have sort of 90% of first 5% of contracts. But I was just wondering if there are any more specifics you could give us on that?","Mike Kaufmann","Sure, let me just make sure on that, first one. Just to make sure I got it right. It's less than 25% of our growth, not less than 25% of our volume of drug spend. So just to be clear, the Hep C drugs were less than 25% of our overall growth for the quarter. And then as far as Red Oak goes, I guess all I can add to it is, I just continue to be impressed with the team. The leaders there, the executive team has done an excellent job of really blending together the employee bases. You could go there, and I think George has mentioned this the past [indiscernible] is some situation, you really can't tell who CVS or a Cardinal employee was, who came from the outside? And when I was at our Board meeting just recently, a lot of the executive management said the same thing, that they're having to remind themselves some of new people who came from where. So I think from a culture standpoint that's really important.","And then also -- that's been really exiting is we were able to get all the people we wanted to transfer to go there. So all the key folks from CVS moved over there, as well as the key folks from Cardinal. And that really helped us get a really quick start, because we weren't training anybody. We had literally experts who have had decades and decades of experience in the generic business move straight over to Red Oak. So that's been positive. So again culture is going well, discussions with the manufacturers have gone well, and as I said we're at above 95% of the manufacturers moved over. So let me ask George to add couple comments.","George Barrett","Just one additional thing, because you asked about challenges. We were very focused on simplicity, and speed and clarity for the manufacturers. So one of the biggest challenges, it's an incredibly complicated system, but if you look at all of generics and trying to do all the trade terms and conditions with every manufacturer. So as Mike said getting through this many, given the complexity and then trying to come out with a program, that was really straight forward and simple, was a great challenge and I think the team did an amazing job of doing that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","A couple of follow up questions here. First of all on the top line growth. Mike, I think you mentioned that Hep C was less than a quarter of growth, that's about 3% contributions. So when we parse out [indiscernible] the new customer is in the Hep C, what percent of growth do you think is Cardinal specific versus just overall market growth?","Mike Kaufmann","I can't get into real specifics, but I would tell you that we all I think have seen if you're -- we've all looked at IMS data. We've seen some really strong comparatively to the past numbers from IMS, in around that 1% to 4% range. Specifically over the last several months we've seen strong growth there. So that's obviously a contributor to our top line growth. But breaking it down between what's industry growth, how much is new customers, how much is existing, how much, because you have brands moving to generics et cetera, it would be really tough to parse all of that out. And then there is also lot of other things going on in the environment.","George Barrett","Ricky I want to make sure I understand your question, but again in general terms, our prescription growth was very good. As Mike said our unit growth in generics was very good, our positioning in the market was very good. And again the IMS data, last time it was 3 point something. So there is clearly some demand growth which is good in the system. Our position in the market is good. And so that is a good combination.","So I'm not sure if you're asking about Hep C and whether we're disproportionately, and I was trying to make sure I understood that question. But I say again, for us think about it just, we've got a base of customers. Those Hep C products flow through different channels and we're present in all those channels.","Ricky Goldwasser","I'm actually trying to understand what growth is, when you normalize for Hep C, right, assuming that over time will actually settle down?","Mike Kaufmann","I don't think we'd probably take any piece of business out of our business and say that's normal. I think this is now part of the base of the business.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And then on Red Oak, you said that 90% 95% [indiscernible] over. So when we think about kind of the contribution that flows through your P&L, how far are you in the ramp in the generic stage? Is what we've seen this quarter and we take that and annualize it for the reminder of the year or should we see sequential improvement over the next four quarters?","Mike Kaufmann","Ricky we're having a little bit of difficulty hearing you. If I got it right, as George mentioned I think I emphasized as we did see a ramp faster in this quarter than we had originally expected. So I guess I would tell you that. Now to try to describe with Q3 and Q4, we obviously still expect some ramp in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year because every day we're signing up new vendors and transitioning suppliers, but obviously with 95% of them already moved over to the new contracting, you're getting close to where you could take Q2 and you're going to see it again ramp up over the next couple of quarters.","George Barrett","Again this is all built into the guidance.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill ","George, just following up on thinking about Red Oak and your opportunities with share existing customers, can you maybe talk about the Greenfield opportunity for customers that source generic products from Cardinal?","George Barrett","Yes, good morning Lisa. Yes, look we believe that we\u2019ve got a unique model here and a terrific partner we're really excited with flowing, and I think as we look at the overall market of those who buy generics, we have started to see a little bit of change as companies start to consider the most effective way for them to source their products. Some companies who historically have sourced those products directly are reevaluating whether that\u2019s the most effective tool for them and I think in some cases we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate to those customers that we\u2019re a very attractive alternative as Cardinal Health. So it's hard to size that opportunity for you, but I would say it's pretty clear that there are existing players out there who today are still trying to -- I am sure evaluate the most effective way for them to source products. We think we\u2019re very attractive supplier to those and we have picked up some business in this area, and I think those are encouraging signs.","Lisa Gill ","Is there -- asking it the other way, is there a number that you can give us as far as your existing customers that source and buy generics through you today? Is it greater than 50%, is it 90%? Just trying to get some idea of just even in your existing customer base, what the Greenfield opportunity is?","George Barrett","Yes, we would be able to give you that exact percent. I would tell you that every customer buys at least some generics from us. It's just whether -- what percentage of the generic spend they buy from us. Sometimes it\u2019s in a backup position or in other times they'll buy a 100% from us. So, I would tell you that we still have opportunity to be able to do that -- to grow that going forward and -- but we\u2019ve done a great job historically in penetrating a lot of the change, independence and even our hospital class of trade on their solid orals [ph].","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher ","Maybe I\u2019ll start by following up. You just mentioned you\u2019ve been able to penetrate even independents in hospitals. I'm curious, you\u2019ve brought on a mail customer recently that you spoke of, that is probably quite a bit smaller than your sourcing program when it comes to purchasing. So is there a value proposition even where you wouldn\u2019t be taking over the fulfilment of the products?","George Barrett","Yes, absolutely. We think we offer really great solutions Eric, not only in terms of the potential to save money in terms of cost, but also in the terms of our quality of the products, the supply, the way we work with the customer. And so, we\u2019ve a lot of components of our program that we\u2019re going to work with each customer.","Now that being said, I can\u2019t speak for any of one individual customer and they may have various reasons why they may choose or not choose sourcing from us, but we think we have as competitive or more competitive a program than anybody else. I'm out there and then we do see opportunities going forward or working with our various customers who are not buying a 100% of the generics from us.","Eric Percher ","And then my follow-up would be on Canada, and you may have covered this when we first started talking about the issue, can you just remind me in simple terms what the issue has been? Is it competition, volume, pricing related? What is that work there?","George Barrett","Yes, it's been a couple of things. Generally overall I would just say it's really market pressures, and those market pressures, a lot related to reimbursement in the environment have driven a lot of behaviors as you could imagine, less purchases of capital equipment, utilization, all those types of things, pricing pressure is on there. So it's really reimbursement pressures in the market have put a lot of pressure on that business and it has forced them to relook at their model and work with their customers in different ways.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger","George could you give us an update on how the China business is doing and what aspects of that business are gaining the most traction?","George Barrett","Yes, it's going well. We mentioned that we had significant double-digit growth again in China. All the components of business are growing. Our distribution platform continues to expand. We have continued to provide some wrap around services with those customers, building out those capabilities, more marketing presence, which has I think been an exciting potential. Our geographic reach continues to expand and we continue to expand the number of the direct-to-patient pharmacies, probably in and around 30 at this point. So -- and the product lines that we\u2019re carrying is now bigger on those pharmacies. So it's not unusual for us to carry double-digit number of products in those pharmacies; all good news because it expands our touch points to the patient, reinforces our relationships with our biopharmaceutical partners. So we\u2019re encourage by the continued growth in China and we see it as a really exciting market.","John Kreger","And then maybe a quick follow up. Can you remind us how the Henry Schein alliance will flow through the P&L? Did that have an impact on the quarter to support it or will it mostly\u2026.","George Barrett","So essentially what's going to happen is the sales that used to be reported through a part of our Medical business which was in ambulatory, those sales will ship to Schein? We will see our value coming through the gross margin line and our products flow through their channel. So that's the basic mechanics. And you would not have seen any value in the quarter completed.","Mike Kaufmann","And obviously our sales reps obviously moved over to Henry Schein. So revenue expenses moved over to Henry Schein and obviously the margin will generate that but that's going to be more than offset. As we said this will be accretive. So it's by the margin that we will make on our sale of products to Henry Schein.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","Dave Francis","Down on a couple of questions asked earlier. George and Mike, can you talk a little bit more about the drivers that you're seeing from your chair on what's creating the current pricing activity on the generic front? Is it push back from insurers or the retail folks in the chain or other folks in the supply chain that are kind of equalizing the supply demand dynamic, or is there something -- other factor at play that's causing a moderation in pricing on the generic front.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, I'm not sure that it's a single factor, and again Dave, it's hard to say, to describe a trend. I think we've talked at times about the conditions that we saw that probably led to some of the increased prices. I would say systemically we're not seeing a big change in that. So it's really individual behaviors. These are all individual products. You have to remember that when we talk about the pricing movement, the biggest swings that have occurred over the last couple of years are on hundreds, not thousands of products.","And so I'm really discrete to the individual supplier and their product line, and so I wouldn\u2019t say the overall conditions of the market have necessarily changed. We're just -- based on just some data we have and we saw in the first half, we just decided that in our model we would moderate that second half. But as I said before, it is extremely difficult to project this, because it really is individual companies with individual product lines.","Dave Francis","As a follow up, going to the capital deployment side of things, you guys have quite a few different strategic development efforts going on across both product lines and geographies. Is it possible to try and tease out from you a little bit more about where you see more specifically in the different areas that you're looking at better options than others relative to putting capital to work on the acquisition front.","George Barrett","It's a good question. I wish I could answer it fully for you, which of course I can't, in terms of what we look at. But let me just highlight the priority areas. Certainly where we can build scale in our pharmaceutical business and particularly around generics, it's always effective. Those opportunities don\u2019t come up every day. But those are my high priority. Specialty continues to be an area of high emphasis. We believe that you'll continue to see the growth of specialty biopharmaceuticals and products that address unique patient populations. And so we continue to look in that area.","Everything around the IDN hospital services for us is important. Many hospitals are beginning to look, particularly given some of the changes in reimbursement and even some of the news coming out of HHS this week, looking at bundled payment models. Some of the area that used to be revenue drivers in a different model could become constant, and so the opportunity to provide those services might be areas we look. Consumables -- the ability to grow our consumable and our physician preference items, clear priorities for us. The home -- activities around the home and China, those are all areas that we've talked about as high priority. You guys know the system there. Some of those areas that have many, many more activities and more players and there are others that have fewer, maybe more highly consolidated, et cetera. So those are sort of priority areas. We're looking at all of them, pretty much all of the time and the opportunities will come when they come.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette","So for the medical segment, I guess as we move further into calendar '15. Are there any signs at all or any buzz still within the industry about accelerated patient volume growth for your hospital customer base related specifically to health reforms. There still seems to be some mixed views on this within the investment community for the hospital sector in particular.","Mike Kaufmann","I think mixed use is probably right. There are some clear signs, and CMS at this point I think is saying enrollment is close to 10 million at this point coming through the ACA. It's very difficult to tease out exactly what the contribution is in a hospital setting. In think we certainly -- as we look at our pharmaceutical business and we look at prescription centers, there's certainly some indication and it's more intuitive than anything else that there are more patients in the system. And I think it's reasonable to assume that more patients covered have some impact on the hospital side. But it's much harder to tease out, partly because we're seeing some shift in channel behavior.","So it's not like you have one system. When you have moving for example from an acute care setting to an ambulatory setting, you can see a shift in volume. So it's much more difficult to tease out the exact total volume impact of the Affordable Care Act and how that floats through the acute care centers, because we're seeing sort of a natural shift in delivery of care where it's being delivered. We\u2019re also seeing a little bit of shift of market-share among players, given some of the network design issues in the system. So it's a little bit difficult to tease that for you.","Steven Valiquette","And you actually hear your customers talking about there or is it just sort of a quiet on that front right now?","George Barrett","No, you actually hear views from different customers. So there are some that are [indiscernible] that they're seeing increases and some that are not experiencing quite as much. So as you describe mix signals, it's probably a little bit of an accurate description.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian ","So I'm trying to get a better idea of how conservative your guidance is putting Nexium aside. So as I think about it, Pharma sales were very strong of a -- maybe incrementally lower margin from Hep C. The Red Oak contribution is ahead of schedule. There is now slight commodity tailwind. But guidance has to be raised roughly by the amount of the beat [ph] from litigation. So is the offset from Canada incentive comp that might not have been fully baked in before? Is that the right way to think about it or is there anything else to consider?","Mike Kaufmann","Well, one thing that I consider remember is the tax rate is an important driver. I'm not sure how the litigation piece would affect. It's really -- and that was in GAAP, not in our non-GAAP numbers. And so I'm not sure how that would effect, but tax rate is one thing to consider. Remember last year we also had a minority investment income in Q3 that we had talked about. That\u2019s not expected to repeat in the second half which was a large number. We did expect the Canadian pressures to continue to happen throughout the rest of the half, and while we\u2019ve said Red Oak started a little sooner, that doesn\u2019t mean necessarily that it's going to get a lot bigger into Q3 and Q4. It just came a little bit sooner.","George Barrett","Again, I'm going to just jump in here for second. Again I wouldn\u2019t comment on how conservative or not conservative our guidance is. I'd say that we\u2019re performing very well right now in general, and so we feel very good about the first-half and actually pretty excited about the second half of the year. So our guidance was increased. We feel good about that and again, we'll leave it to others to judge whether or not it was conservative or aggressive. But we like our positioning and we\u2019re pushing ahead.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our final question from Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric Coldwell","Can you hear me? A quick one here off topic related to foreign currency. I didn\u2019t hear a lot about that today. I'm curious about the impact overall of course specifically in Canada, with the Canadian dollar we gained about 17% in the last six months. Two is on the impact to the medical surgical segment and if you can talk through some of the dynamics on revenue and profit dollars related to that? Thanks.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes so I\u2019ll give you a little bit of information here. First of all, we did realize a smaller benefit from FX in Q2 than we did in Q1, but again it was minor. Our assumption for the remainder of the fiscal year is really some modest upside to -- with FX and that\u2019s already built into our guidance. The thing you have to remember on FX that makes it unique is because we operate in some countries but we buy in others, you have the impact that one could be a positive, the other one could be a negative. And so the net, if you really want size, it's very small at this point in time.","Sally Curley","Eric or the operator, do you have a follow-up?","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Barrett for any additional or closing remarks.","George Barrett","With that, thank you all for you questions and I very much appreciate all of you joining us on today\u2019s call. We look forward to speaking with all of you later. Thanks.","Operator","And again that does conclude today\u2019s presentation. Thank you for your participation."],"4406":["Cardinal Health, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Moran. Please go ahead, sir.","Kevin Moran","Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. Today, I'm joined today by Mike Kaufmann, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Evans, our interim Chief Financial Officer.","You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our Web site at ir.cardinalhealth.com.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties.","Note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release.","We will provide an update to our FY '20 outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP results.","During the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. ","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks, Kevin. And congratulations on your new role.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I am here with Dave Evans and I'd like to welcome him to his first call as our interim CFO. Dave has done a great job getting up to speed over the past few months. I'm grateful for his leadership and experience as we conduct our search for a permanent CFO.","This morning, we'll cover our progress and our path forward. I'll start with a few high-level thoughts on the quarter and then Dave will cover the financials. I'll close with some thoughts on how we will build on the solid start to the year.","We remain confident in our strategic direction as we focus on driving both efficiency and growth. Our Q1 performance validates our short-term progress and longer-term path.","At the enterprise-level, our disciplined cost management is enabling strategic reinvestment across both segments as well as in critical, functional areas.","In the Pharma segment, we're seeing early signs of positive trends. And although we still have work to do, we are making progress in key areas.","In Medical, we're encouraged by early traction from our improvement efforts, as well as the initial returns from ongoing investments in our growth platforms. I'll share more about this work in both segments later in my remarks.","But, first, I'll turn to Dave to walk you through our results and specific milestones we achieved in Q1.","David Evans ","Thanks, Mike. And thanks everyone for being with us today. I'm pleased to join you on my first call. I'll walk through the numbers and highlight a few actions taken in Q1 to demonstrate our commitment to long-term growth.","Overall, I'm happy to report that we delivered earnings of $1.27 per share in the first quarter, which were ahead of our expectations. Total company revenue increased 6% versus last year to $37.3 billion.","Consolidated gross margin increased 1% from last year to about $1.7 billion. The decline gross margin rate principally reflects year-over-year Pharma distribution contract renewals and products and distribution mix.","SG&A, which includes variable distribution related expenses, improved 2% despite higher revenue. This improvement reflects sustained organization-wide efforts to streamline our cost structure.","Mike might elaborate more on some of these efforts in a few minutes, but I'd like to say that just in the few months that I've been here, I've already seen this effort evolve from a cost reduction initiative to a broader cultural mindset of efficiency and improvement.","Total operating earnings were $577 million, a 6% increase from the prior year, driven by performance in the Medical segment.","Interest and other expenses were roughly flat versus prior year at $80 million. This reflects a decline in interest expense.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24%. This compares to last year's rate of 14%, which was impacted by changes to our international legal entity structure.","Average diluted shares outstanding were $297 million, about $9 million fewer than last year. During the quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program to opportunistically buy back $359 million of stock. We tired 80% of these shares in Q1 and expect to complete the program in our second quarter.","Combining share repurchases, we returned well over $400 million to shareholders in the first quarter, demonstrating our continued commitment to look to deploying capital on a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly way.","Moving on to cash flow, operating cash for the quarter was a use of $653 million. As a reminder, timing, in particular, the day of the week in which the quarter ends, affects point in time cash flows. This dynamic negatively impacted our year-over-year cash flow for Q1, but will reverse in Q2. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion, which includes about $700 million held outside the US.","So, I'll now transition to segment results, starting with Pharma. Revenue increased 6% to $33 billion, driven by sales growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions.","Segment profit decreased 3% to $398 million, which reflects the impact from Pharma distribution customer contract renewals. This was partially offset by the benefits of our ongoing cost savings initiatives and performance in our Specialty Solutions business.","As a reminder, we record opioid related litigation expenses in the Pharma segment. ","Before I leave Pharma, I want to note that our generics program performed roughly as expected. While we continue to see improvements in the market dynamics for generics, I would remind you that several variables impact the net performance of our generics program, including sourcing, volume, new item launches and sell side pricing.","Overall, we're seeing positive trends and good progress in the Pharma segment. Mike will discuss our ongoing efforts to maintain this momentum.","Transitioning to Medical, segment revenue for Q1 increased 3% to about $4 billion. This was due to organic growth across the segment led by products and distribution as well as in Cardinal Health at Home, one of our strategic growth areas.","This growth was partially offset by the divestiture of naviHealth in August 2018. Segment profit increased 26% to $170 million. This reflects benefits from our cost savings initiatives, as well as growth in products and distribution services and Cardinal Health at Home. As with revenue, these benefits were partially offset by the divestiture of the naviHealth business.","To provide some additional clarity, products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products, as well as costs from our global supply chain. ","Our work across the Medical segment to integrate our infrastructure, streamline our footprint and improve the customer experience is progressing as planned. Mike will discuss how this work will transition into growth over the longer term.","Moving now to our full-year outlook, with one quarter's worth of results behind us, we've increased confidence in our full-year guidance. At the same time, we continue to monitor external factors and key assumptions that could impact our forecast. We also continue to track the timing and evolution of internal investment initiatives.","Examples of external factors could be headwinds, which include tariffs and medical device tax. Examples of key assumptions we closely monitor include brand inflation and our generics program.","Considering the potential fluctuation of these and other items, we are reaffirming our guidance along with our corporate and segment assumptions. While we generally don't provide quarterly guidance, I will say that, directionally, we expect operating earnings in Q2 to be modestly lower than Q1.","So, before I turn it back over to Mike, I'd like to mention a significant item included in our GAAP results. In connection with a recent opioid-related settlement with Cuyahoga and Summit counties and the agreement in principle amongst the parties involved to a global settlement framework, we accrued $5.1 billion after-tax in the first quarter.","We believe this global settlement framework will serve as the basis for definitive settlement terms and documentation. And for this reason, from a legal and accounting perspective, this accrual is prudent.","For Cardinal Health, the cash component of the settlement framework is up to $5.6 billion over 18 years. If factors change, we'll adjust the accrual appropriately.","Let me now turn it back over to Mike to provide further remarks. ","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks, Dave. This settlement with the two Ohio counties enables the discussions around the global settlement framework to proceed. The global framework, which is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general, is designed to resolve all pending and potential opioid lawsuits by states and political subdivisions.","Importantly, with the commitment of both funds and the distribution of treatment medications, this framework provides an immediate solution to the communities and families that need it most.","As you know, we have an important, but limited role, in the pharmaceutical supply chain. We take that role and the responsibility that comes with it seriously. We remain committed to being part of the solution to this epidemic and that is why we are committed to the global framework and continue to be actively involved in its progression. With that said, if this framework is not successful, we are prepared to vigorously defend ourselves.","Shifting now to our strategic direction in the focus areas I mentioned last quarter. I said on our last call that, in Pharma, we're focused on two things \u2013 further enhancing our core distribution business and fueling sustained growth in key areas.","Regarding our core distribution business, we are focused on continuously enhancing the customer experience, improving pricing and contract discipline, and reducing costs. We are making significant investments throughout the segment with a longer-term view of the business.","For example, we're implementing digital technologies that will improve visibility and enhance our pricing capabilities. In addition, we recently began a program to improve our e-commerce capabilities and enhance the experience for our customers.","Beyond investing in our core businesses, we are focused on investing to drive growth in rapidly-evolving spaces in healthcare and identifying ways to further differentiate ourselves and shape the future.","For example, in Specialty, we recently made a multi-million dollar investment to establish a new distribution center outside of Nashville, Tennessee with a state-of-the-art, cold chain complex including deep frozen technology.","This new facility will enable us to combine two existing distribution centers, streamline technologies to drive operational efficiencies and support continued growth in rapidly evolving areas of the Specialty industry.","We're also investing in our higher margin services businesses, which we call our connected care offering, to build greater connectivity between manufacturers, payers, pharmacies and patients.","We will continue to purposely redeploy capital in these and other areas that align to our strategy.","Moving on the Medical, we are building out our commercial and operational capabilities across the segment and continuing investment in key areas. Dave shared some of these activities, which include enhancing our commercial approach, streamlining our supply chain, and rationalizing our footprint, are showing early signs of success.","Commercially, we are more closely aligning ourselves with the needs of our customers and incentivizing our sales force to sell Cardinal brand products. We expect these enhancements to be complete by Q3 and their benefit will begin to materialize in FY 2021.","As part of our supply chain work, we are reconfiguring our North American network. For example, in California, we are consolidating two of our distribution centers into a modern flagship center, which will enhance customer experience at a lower cost to serve and position the segment for growth.","Additionally, with respect to our global supply chain, we more than doubled our manufacturing footprint with the patient recovery acquisition. We are already leveraging some synergies, but we see a path to capture significantly more.","To that end, within the next quarter, we will finalize plans to reduce cost and deliver industry-leading service across our global network. These plans will take some time to execute. So, we have a strong governance structure in place and are committed to diligently managing our costs to realize the greatest long-term benefit.","As in Pharma, we're making significant investments across the Medical segment to improve the customer experience and drive growth in both the products and services spaces.","For example, as Patient Care shifts more toward the home, we continue to capture growth opportunities through Cardinal Health at Home solutions. We are committed to further developing this business and are redeploying some of our cost savings benefits in this area to improve the customer, healthcare professional and patient experiences.","In Medical services, another business unit in the segment with sustained growth and strong results, we're building additional digital and data capabilities, modernizing our operating systems and streamlining clinical and operational workflows. This will reduce costs for both us and for our customers and, importantly, will improve patient safety.","We recognize the components of the work across our products and services spaces will take time to translate into sustained growth and results. We remain committed to fueling this momentum.","On the enterprise level, as Dave and I shared earlier, our cost savings initiatives are producing tangible benefits across the company. We expect to meet or exceed our $130 million commitment for the year, primarily through SG&A-related activities.","Our initiatives to improve gross margin, like those in Medical to right-size our manufacturing and distribution footprint, will contribute more significantly to our five-year, $500 million savings goal as they will ramp up over the next few years.","With these initiatives, leaders across the company are evaluating internal operating models and identifying opportunities to leverage automation, analytics and additional technologies that not only drive efficiencies and contribute to our savings goals, but to improve insights.","One example is our recent partnership with Genpact, a global professional services firm focused on digital business transformation, who will help us transform our finance operating model.","As part of this partnership, Genpact will create a data analytics and FP&A hub here in Central Ohio to drive industry-leading innovation. About 200 current Cardinal Health FP&A and data analytics employees are transitioning to the Genpact hub next week, alongside a team of Genpact's process, finance and data analytics experts.","This is just one of the many initiatives across the company to streamline our processes, leverage our scale and enhance our data capabilities. We will share additional updates on these initiatives as they develop.","As we drive these type of efficiencies across the company, we will fuel growth through balanced capital allocation. This includes reinvesting in the business, returning cash to shareholders and improving our financial flexibility, while maintaining our investment grade status.","We remain committed to paying down at least $1 billion of long-term debt this fiscal year, which includes the $450 million of debt maturing in Q2.","To close, in Q1, we generated positive momentum across the company. We are pleased with this start to the year and recognize that there is more work ahead.","We have a strong foundation of scale and industry knowledge. With our talented and dedicated employees, we're committed to building on this foundation to adapt, innovate and lead as our industry evolves.","With that, I'll now open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","George Hill","Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the questions. Mike, I guess, can you help me square two things here. You talked about the early signs of positive trends that you're seeing in the Pharmaceutical business, but I kind of want to square that with the guide where it seems like operating earnings deceleration is going to continue through the balance of the year. So, I guess, could you put a little more color on the positive trends that you're seeing and kind of help me square that with the guide for operatings growth or actually operating kind of deterioration in the segment?","Mike Kaufmann","Go ahead. I'll let Dave start.","David Evans","George. Thanks for the question. Look, I think the way we're thinking about this is, we're really pleased with the first quarter results. I'll start with that. It certainly gives us increased confidence in the full year. At the same time, I'd say we're very cautious and that we're only one quarter into the year. So, we've got some pretty significant assumptions out there that are still left open \u2013 for example, brand inflation \u2013 and there's also a lot of other key kind of environmental assumptions that we're making that could change. So, our view is, at this early stage in the year, there's just no reason to be changing our full year guidance. We'll certainly be in a much better position to do that after our next quarter earnings call.","George Hill","Okay, that's super helpful. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up is, did we see a full quarter of the CVS repricing this quarter? And is there any way to call out the impact of that?","David Evans","We did see the full quarter. And we have not provided any specificity in terms of the annual impact of that contract renewal.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks.","George Hill","Okay. Helpful, thank you.","Kevin Moran","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now take the next question from Glen Santangelo of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Glen Santangelo","Oh, yeah. Thanks and good morning. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on the strength in the Medical business. In the past few years, you talked about the challenging market conditions, some of the supply chain issues. It sounds like this quarter, the company did a great job on the cost side. But what else has changed to help drive that performance, so we can maybe think about the sustainability of the results, you posted this quarter?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, thanks for the question. I feel really good about the Med segment. They performed a little better than we expected in Q1 and really happy with the transition of Steve Mason in his role. He's done an excellent job of getting up to speed so far and really surrounded himself with a solid team.","SG&A clearly was a component of our performance in the quarter. But there are multiple areas where we are working through various performance improvement. For one example, service levels now are not only back to where they were at the acquisition of patient recovery products, but are actually better than at any time while we've held the business. So, we've made a lot of progress in service levels. We're making solid progress on both SG&A and items that will really drive COGS. And we're in different innings on each one of those, but really happy so far with what we saw in the first quarter of Medical.","Glen Santangelo","Thanks. Maybe I just have one follow-up for Dave. Dave, you maintained the guidance for the full year, but you called out specifically that the operating profit in 2Q would be lower than Q1. Could you maybe just help us think about some of the assumptions in that sequential second quarter or some of the seasonal items that are maybe driving that outlook in 2Q? Thanks.","David Evans","Yeah, absolutely. So, I'd say \u2013 first of all, we said modestly lower. And we think about that, we think about a variety of factors that could change from quarter to quarter. One, for example, would be our SG&A spend. We've got a large inventory of investment opportunities to drive long-term improvements, and those are ramping up. And so, the level of the spend, the pace of that spend, we expect to increase in our second quarter. ","Further, we've talked about the CVS and the Kroger's contract renewal being effective July 1st, we do have other contract renewals in much smaller scale, but yet other contract renewals will be occurring in the second quarter and throughout the year.","And finally, I would also say that we have some customers that have experienced difficulty either through bankruptcy or other financial distress where we're expecting some modestly lower volume in the second quarter than the first quarter. And as that volume declines, we'll capture our fair share of that, but we'll only capture our fair share of that is our current assumption.","So, there's a lot more depth in that, but I'd say those are some of the headlines that give us some reason to believe that Q2 won't be just simply a mirror image of Q1.","Glen Santangelo","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yeah. Hi, good morning. My question is related to the opioid comments. When we think about that $5.6 billion that you're now reserving, if that ends up being the final number and within that 18-year timeframe, would that have any impact on the business, the core business? And if so, do you have \u2013 what degree of freedom do you have to offset that with additional streamlining initiatives?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, thanks for the question. It broke up a little bit, Ricky. So, if I don't quite get the answer right, feel free to follow-up on that, particularly. I can't provide a lot of details on it. But, first of all, the settlement is spread over 18 years. And so, that's important to know. We continue to believe that that settlement is something that will be a consideration as we look at capital deployment, but not a limitation as to when we look at capital employment or investments.","We do believe that the overall settlement framework is something that is supported by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general and it does provide a framework by which hopefully we can continue to not only get this behind us, but also get meaningful funds to the people that need it, begin looking at the distribution of the free goods that are out there and also look at other ways that the industry can work together to improve the overall monitoring of opioids. So, I'll stop right there and see if I was able to answer your question or not.","Ricky Goldwasser","No, you did. Thank you, Mike. Let me just have a quick follow-up, or maybe not so quick. But when we think about the long-term financial profile. Obviously, in the quarter, revenue up mid-single digits and profit were down because of the renewals that you talked about and we'll see throughout the year. But when we step back and we think about the industry on a steady state in your assets, and once you normalize for the renewals and taking into account all the streamlining and efficiencies that you talked about in your prepared comments, what type of operating profit growth do you think the business can support long-term with a mid-single-digit type top line growth?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah. Thanks for the question. It's too early for us to give any real comments on 2021 and beyond. I would just say that we feel really good about the progress that we made this quarter, both in investing in the growth areas that we've talked about, Specialty at Home and our services businesses, but also getting after our cost structure.","I think Dave made a comment that's really important, is this isn't just a cost reduction, this is taking entire cost structures out in a way that they won't come back, that the culture and the way the leadership is working is really driving at prioritizing and focusing us on the right things, so we're spending dollars in the right space, taking advantage of digital technologies, robotic automation, AI, et cetera, in order to really drive our cost structure down.","So, we feel really good about achieving our overall $500 million number, our $130 million number for this year and really have this built into our overall culture. But, again, it's just too early for us to make comments on 2021 and beyond, but we feel that we are not only getting after our cost structure, but investing for growth, which is really important.","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","With Cowen. Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking the questions, Mike. Just one going back to the opioids real quickly. Your comments \u2013 and one of your peers today sounds a lot more positive, I would say, maybe than the comments from many other companies the other week. Anything kind of change in the last week or two that kind of increased the sort of the optimism here in terms of getting towards a global settlement here?","Mike Kaufmann","Wouldn't say anything changed. Let me just step back and make sure that we're on the same page. As you know, a few weeks ago, we settled with two Ohio counties, which, by doing that, enabled us to move forward with this framework. That was an important component of being able to get that behind this, so all of the parties involved in the global framework could move forward and begin working on. So, that's an important thing to know.","We clearly have a global settlement framework and structure with the $18 billion over 18 years with our component being $5.56 billion. We've also agreed upon distributing the free treatment medications for 10 years and we've agreed that, when we get this behind us, we can all work together to look at the way state, federal government, distributors, everybody work together to monitor opioid shipments and uses, so that we can work together.","We think the desire and \u2013 if we can get this behind us, how we'll bring meaningful relief in both funds and distribution of treatment medication to the people that need it is important, and so we feel positive that folks will work hard on this to get this going. So, again, nothing specific, but our belief is that the way this is structured that this is the right accounting for us at this point in time.","Charles Rhyee","And if I could just follow-up, obviously, if you look at the number of plaintiffs \u2013 I forget the last count. It's upwards of 2,000 or so. Obviously, the states are a big component of it, but you have a lot of smaller plaintiffs. As I read some of the comments from AmeriSys as well as who speaks to it, it kind of suggests that not only state AGs, but also a lot of the other plaintiffs. Can you kind of discuss like the participation of the smaller entities in this? In other words, if you get this framework done, do we still have a long tail of small plaintiffs kind of coming after the players here? Or is it kind of \u2013 this is structured in a way, would you think, that this will achieve [indiscernible] looking forward?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, good question. I would say this. You could probably put them in many, many buckets. Well, let me put them in three broad buckets. There's state, there's the political subdivisions, the counties, the cities and then this will become more private plaintiffs, which might be pension funds or individuals and those things. This global framework is put together to settle on the first two, all of the state claims as well as the cities and all the political subdivisions. And the accrual that we put on the books is to represent the global framework we did for those first two buckets. That third bucket, which there is also still suits out there, are very different and it's a mixture of different things and those are still out there and will be things that we will have to address going forward.","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning, Mike and Dave. So, kind of following up a little bit on that last question. One of your peers had some very different language in their press release this morning about when they make accruals and when they don't. But without getting too much into that, I guess, the question is, is there any possibility that Cardinal's further along or closer to a settlement agreement than some of your distributor peers? Is there any scenario where Cardinal may reach a global settlement, but your peers may not? Or is it kind of all three year or none around the global settlement? Just curious to get your extra thoughts on that. Thanks.","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, thanks for the question. No, I would say that Cardinal is not doing anything different. This is just our understanding and belief of the way the global framework is set up that we believe the accounting that we've done is appropriate for the circumstances in our \u2013 on that. ","Steven Valiquette","And one of your peers talked about a settlement maybe still being months away and that seemed to be different than what some investors were thinking. To me, I think that's still a pretty short time horizon given the number of parties involved, but is there any extra color on when do you think the timing could be nailed down on a settlement?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, it's really hard to actually predict timing, but it's not something that we think is going to get done tomorrow. There is work to be done. And as I mentioned, we believe settling the two counties, getting that behind us and allowing the state AGs to begin the process of working with the political subdivisions, plaintiffs, attorneys, et cetera, that that process has begun and we're fully supportive and we'll do what we can to help in that process. And it will take some amount of time, but it's really hard to predict what that will be.","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","We will take our next question from Lisa Gill from JP Morgan.","Lisa Gill","Thanks very much. Good morning, Mike. As we think about the global settlement, how do I think about it from a tax perspective? I'm just trying to figure out what the impact will be to cash flow. You talked about the fact that there'll be some impact, but really shouldn't change how you think about capital deployment? So, that would just be my first question, was how do we think about the tax implications.","David Evans","Yeah, Lisa. This is Dave. Thanks for the question. Look, the intent of this is consistent with the public policy and guidelines of the IRS and the state tax authorities to make this tax deductible. Having said that, the details and specifics of this agreement really just aren't there right now, to provide the level of precision that, ultimately, we'll have, nor is the complete clarity of the tax code there at this stage.","So, from an accounting perspective, we just followed accounting guidance and established what we believe is an appropriate reserve for what will be tax deductible. But that, I would say, will continue to become more clear as time marches on and the specifics of both the tax code and the settlement offer become more clear.","Mike Kaufmann","And as far as the cash flow impact goes, Lisa, as you said, while it's spread over 18 years specifically, how it will be paid and funded each year is still being worked out. So, it's hard for us to give you any real color on the exact timing and impact of cash flows. But as you can imagine, we spread it out over time in order to be able to still manage our business effectively going forward.","Lisa Gill","And then, Mike, if I could just sneak one in on policy. Thoughts around re-importation and the potential impact that that could have to Cardinal and drug distribution in general?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, it's an interesting question. It's one of those things that it's probably a little too early to get into a lot of detail. This is something that I can remember working on 15 years ago when we thought it was going to be imminent and working on setting up all of the capabilities internally to help make sure that, if it did happen, there would be a safe supply chain. And I think the focus on re-importation has to be on patient safety.","And I think that Cardinal was as well-positioned as anybody that, if this were to get some legs, that we would be able to work with folks to help make sure that any re-importation was done on a safe basis. It's hard to imagine that it could be material in any way to affect our businesses, but if it did happen, I think Cardinal was well-positioned to help any of the folks that would do that.","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Great, thanks for the questions. Mike, I just want to go back to some comments from the prepared remarks around the financial distress of certain customers. I guess, first, I'm assuming that's some retail independents, but wanted to confirm that. And then, could you talk a little bit about what you think is driving this? Was it kind of a one-off related to a certain pocket of customers or is there anything more systemic you're seeing in the marketplace around the health of some of your maybe perhaps smaller customers?","Mike Kaufmann","No, those comments were not meant \u2013 so I'm really glad you asked, were not meant to talk about the small customers. This was really about the bankruptcy of Fred's and the continuing restructuring of the Kmart account \u2013 two accounts that we've had that we've been managing over time that were both generic buyers of ours. And as those volumes declined due to their financial situation, that has had some impact on us. But that's really what we were referring to in those comments.","Robert Jones","Got it. Got it. No, thanks for the clarification. And, I guess, just one follow up on the Medical guidance, you guys mentioned that you're monitoring the med device tax and tariffs as it relates to guidance. And, clearly, the guidance would imply a deceleration over the course of the year. So, I just wanted to maybe get a better sense of what maybe the guidance looks like if in fact those items don't, in fact, come to fruition. And just one point related to Medical. I wanted to make sure I was thinking about this right. I believe you're lapping a fairly meaningful headwind from a supplier charge in 4Q. Wanted to confirm that that was right as we just think about the cadence around the Medical guide for the rest of the year.","David Evans","Yeah, Bob. That's absolutely correct in terms of the second half of your statement. We will be lapping in the fourth quarter a reasonable charge that should be non-recurring. ","With respect to the balance of the year, we have not built in \u2013 as we said last quarter with the full-year guidance, we've built in nothing with respect to the med device tax. So, if it doesn't come to fruition, then that's consistent with the guidance we provided. And, clearly, if it does, then that's going to be a headwind we're going to have to manage through.","Tariffs are just such a dynamic topic that we've done our best to offset the tariffs that are in effect now. But that, again, is changing. So, I'd say if that would completely cease any further dialog around tariffs, then what's been announced today, we've more or less been able to manage through that.","What I would say is there are still a lot of other SG&A initiatives that Mike talked about that do have a longer runway and, therefore, they aren't necessarily all \u2013 the cadence isn't equally distributed amongst four quarters. ","I'd really highlight some of the supply chain initiatives that have a long runway and won't necessarily bear fruit for \u2013 it could be two, three years, but we are incurring costs to begin to plan for those this year. And as well, the sales force restructuring that we've discussed as well is kind of in-flight through the course of the year. So, that's not something you can just kind of ratably divide it by four and say it's going to be equal in terms of the cost or the benefits.","So, look, you're right in that the fourth quarter does have a tailwind this year and the fact that this is non-recurrence of a charge, but we just \u2013 we feel, I guess, I'd say, cautiously optimistic for the year based on the first quarter, but feels too early at this stage, given all these variables that are out there to call anything up at this early stage.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Eric Percher from Nephron Research.","Dolph Warburton","Hi, this is Dolph on for Eric. Question about the in kind portion of the potential settlement. If we take $1 billion of value, is that $1 billion of revenue? And if so, are you able to determine kind of the costs? Or, I guess, the better question is, what does an in-kind service really look like for Cardinal?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, it's a great question. That would be an area that is still looking to be defined yet, but, essentially, they're one of the folks that's settling in the case, is contributing free goods is the essential idea here. And the thought is that the three distributors would agree to distribute those free goods to the people that need it. None of the actual cost of distributing those free goods, because we don't have enough information on that, are included in our overall accrual.","That being said, we at this time don't think that would be material, but don't have enough information to know. But the concept is just being able to take those drugs and then using the efficiency of our overall supply chain of the distributors to get those to the folks that need them most.","Dolph Warburton ","Great, thank you. And then, just a follow-up. The difference between the charge listed in the text of the release and what's listed as an add back pre-tax, it looks like about $40 million. I assume that's legal services in the quarter? Or is there something else causing the difference?","Mike Kaufmann","No, the breakdown\u2026","David Evans","We've got two components. The primary two components. Of course, our pro rata share of $18 billion and then there's the pro rata share of the two Ohio county settlements. The remaining small difference relates to \u2013 I believe we may have spoken in the past about, which is in our med supply business, our Cordis business, the IVS product, which we continue to accrue for a loss, continue to see on that as well. It's a fairly small number, but that \u2013 if you get to the third decimal digit, that's where you're going to find, is the IVS\u2026","Mike Kaufmann","Kevin Moran","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will take our next question from Stephen Baxter from Wolfe Research.","Stephen Baxter","Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow-up on the opioid discussion. Really appreciate all the color and insight you've provided thus far. I wanted to come back to the outlook for share repurchase. So, if we were to treat the settlement like debt, this settlement would point to trailing leverage approaching 4.5 times. So, it sounds like you're saying that the settlement framework, as currently proposed, would not be a limitation on capital deployment. So, I'm hoping you can help us square your comfort level with this implied leverage. How you think the debt rating agencies are going to look at this issue and the importance of maintaining an investment grade rate to the company? Thanks.","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah. First of all, I would say that \u2013 I wouldn't say that \u2013 remember, this is a consideration. So, we don't see it necessarily as a limitation, but, clearly, once we understand the flows of the cash over the 18-year period, we're going to have to take that in consideration in all of our capital deployment pieces. But let me turn it over to Dave to give you a little color on our thoughts around the rating agencies and what we could talk about.","David Evans","Look, first of all, we've got good relationships with the rating agencies and we stay in close contact with them. So, it's continuous dialog. ","Second, our investment grade credit rating is very important to us. So, it's something that we value and we'll continue to monitor and manage \u2013 to maintain that. ","Let's say, when you look at the leverage, the numbers that you're citing, a couple of factors. One, recall, this year, we've committed externally to de-levering by at least $1 billion. So, as we look forward on this, that number will be coming down.","And second of all, I'm not sure \u2013 I'm not going to speculate on the credit rating agencies or opine on where they're going to land, but I think there's multiple scenarios between saying this is zero liability or it's the book accounting accrual liability.","For example, you could look at \u2013 it's just a discount in future cash flow of all the future years' payments, which nets you a number that's quite a bit smaller than the headline $5.6 billion.","So, we'll see how the credit rating agencies opine on this, where they land. But at this point, I'd say we'll be focused on this. We will make a substantial bite of the apple this year and we'll continue to monitor this in the broader scheme of our capital allocation policy in the years ahead.","Stephen Baxter","Great, thanks. One quick follow-up. Just given how you started out the year on cash flow, can your remind us what you're expecting for the full year for operating cash flow, or at least some directional context relative for the past couple of years? Thanks.","David Evans","Yeah. Look, we have not provided cash flow guidance in the past and we didn't provide it this year. So, I'm not going to speak to that. It's just \u2013 I'd say, if you look at the fundamentals, the fundamentals are not structurally different than last year. We continue to work on our working capital efficiency initiatives. We continue to drive strong cash flow. You will see anomalies based on a point in time, but I wouldn't say we expect anything materially different year-over-year without providing a finer point to it in terms of giving you any specific guidance.","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from John Ransom from Raymond James.","John Ransom","Hey, good morning. Just going back to the stuff we used to talk about a lot, Mike. I know you've probably answered this question 18,000 times over your career. But it's interesting to us what's happening with the generic cycle, in that the pricing at a manufacturer level has certainly firmed. So, we calculate deflation having dropped from the high teens to something like the mid-single digits, whereas at the pharmacy level reimbursement pressure just continues. So, you're seeing an accelerated squeeze at the Pharmacy. So, I just wonder you guys being a student of the pharmacy and you're already talking about Fred's and Kmart, how long can this go on without just continued chaos in the independent pharmacy channel?","Mike Kaufmann","Well, that's a tough question to really talk about. So, I'll give you a little bit of color. A few things come to mind. I'll talk about it from both sides. First of all, I think our \u2013 all of our customers are \u2013 are there a few one-offs like a Fred's and a Kmart? Yeah. But as we look, our retail independents, in general, have stayed at roughly the same number over several years now. They continue to find not only ways to work through the reimbursement challenges, but to continue to find other ways to compete in the marketplace, whether it be through packaging, through additional services, through front end, through just the high quality service that they give every day. And I think the chains continue to do the same through automation and other programs themselves.","So, I think that the chains, including the independents, all of the retail pharmacies, continue to be an important component of getting pharmaceuticals to patients. And so, it's something we're always going to keep our eyes on, but I think they've learned how to compete in this marketplace.","As far as on our side, we have seen some improvement as we said in the market dynamics around the sell side pricing side. Remember, our generics program is made up of four components and we've always said it's sell side, buy side, launches and overall volumes with our customers. Because of some of the customers we've mentioned, we've seen a little bit of weakness on the volume side than we expected. And the new item launches, as you know, are always highly fluctuating and can change. That's been a little less than we expected so far this year. And all that netting together, our generics program came in about as expected.. ","John Ransom","Okay. And just switching gears. A philosophical question. We're all kind of scratching our heads about how to treat this settlement. But if this is going to \u2013 if it's an 18-year settlement and it's just an annual cash outlay, why would that be added back to adjusted earnings? It's not something like amortization, it's non-cash or it's not a one-year one-time. Isn't this just best thought of as a reduction in adjusted earnings for almost 20 years? Why would we add this back?","David Evans","So, the way I'd answer that is, this isn't going to be a charge to the P&L over 18 years. It's a cash cost. But from a GAAP accounting P&L expense perspective, the charge is recognized initially once and that was what you saw recorded this quarter. And so, recognizing a 18-year charge, we did call out as a GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment, appropriately so. So, I think we might be mixing and matching cash and expense charges. Does that answer your question?","John Ransom","I mean, if I could just push back on that, it seems like we want to have it both ways in terms of \u2013 if it's helpful, we add it back. Yeah, I get, you can take the charge year one, but it's going to be a reduction of what I would call cash earnings. And so, yeah, add back amortization, that's not cash. I get that. Or a one-time. But this is an actual reduction. So, it just seems like we're having it both ways to take this big accounting charge, but then add it back to adjusted earnings. So, yeah, the mismatch, seems like we're a little bit having it both ways. That's all.","David Evans","Yeah, I understand your question. I think what I \u2013 look, when we make GAAP, non-GAAP adjustments, that's for when we have an expense or a credit in the current period P&L that we add back or subtract out to get to non-GAAP.","In the case of this opioid accrual, we won't have a P&L charge in future periods. So, there won't be anything to add back to get to non-GAAP earnings. Now, I suppose \u2013 I think you will look at this from a cash perspective and certainly everyone can model the cash flow impact for the next 18 years, but that's separate from \u2013 it just won't really be in the equation in terms of a GAAP versus non-GAAP adjustment because it won't be a charge in future P&Ls. So, it won't be anything to add back .","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Eric Coldwell of Baird. Please go ahead.","Eric Coldwell","Thanks. Good morning. All of my snazzy questions have been asked already, but I have a couple of technical ones. I think it was Bob that asked about the medical device tax. You admitted it's not in guidance. It could come back. What would be the actual impact or best estimate of the impact if it does come back in dollar terms?","Secondarily, commodity cost inputs and FX in the Medical segment. I'm curious if you can give us some sense of the impact those had on profit in Medical. Thank you so much.","David Evans","Yeah. So, first, with respect to the medical device tax, we don't have complete clarity on this. So, I don't have a precise answer for you. But I would say that, on an annualized basis, we believe it could be in the neighborhood of $40 million to $50 million on an annual basis. Okay? So, if we look at for \u2013 if it's effective in January, the second half of the year, you'd pro rate that. Again, I'll just kind of caution that that's based on a lack of perfect clarity and information. And so, if that were to actually happen, we'd be prepared to provide a more precise answer to that at that stage.","The second question was related to FX. Look, we have FX that shows up in different areas of our P&L. We have some that's showing up in the segments. And then, you may have noticed in interest and other, we have other changed a bit, and that's principally driven by FX.","I would say that, on a net basis, FX in the first quarter was reasonably neutral, was not a material driver positive or negative. I think the team is doing an excellent job in managing this and navigating through this as appropriate.","Eric Coldwell","And the commodity costs?","David Evans","Oh, I'm sorry commodity costs.","Eric Coldwell","[indiscernible] pointed that out yesterday, yeah.","David Evans","Yeah, I know. I apologize. So, commodities, for us, in the first quarter, I'd describe them as a small headwind. They were a headwind, but not in a material way.","Eric Coldwell","Thanks very much.","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our final question from Kevin Caliendo from UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","Great. Thanks for getting me in, guys. So, my question on the opioids is just how much confidence do you have \u2013 that $18 billion over 18 years \u2013 that this will be the final layout between the level 3 \u2013 or the tier 3 groupings that you mentioned earlier, that this is really going to be the final number for the MDL and for everybody else and that you can really put this to bed with this kind of settlement?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, thanks for the question, Kevin. Look, it's still too early to tell. As I said, this global framework does only impact the first two buckets. There is no accrual or ability to even estimate and understand the size of the last bucket that we talked about. But as far as the global framework, we have to separate both the accounting and the likelihood of this getting done in our mind and this framework is something that we support. We like that it's being supported by a bipartisan group of AGs and it's something that we're behind, but it's still too early to tell you whether or not it will be successful. But we do think not only is it something that we can support, and it has the support of them, but it's something that's important to the people that need it most because it will get dollars, free drugs and some potentially new processes out there that I think all benefit the country.","Kevin Caliendo","Sure. And just one quick follow-up, when are out visiting you guys, you talked about a restructuring of the Medical sales force compensation. Did that impact 3Q in any way? And how are you thinking about the impact of what the incentive program for sales force might have or have had on Medical going forward?","Mike Kaufmann","Yeah, that's something \u2013 it's one of the really key things going on in Medical that Steve and the team are leading. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, this restructure is a component of not only compensation and sales incentives, but also around how we go to market to best address selling to the customers they want \u2013 to our customers, the way they want to be sold to. So, we did a lot of work out talking to and understanding the way our customer base would like us to come to them and how they would like to be serviced. And so, this restructuring was highly defined by a lot of detailed work. We started to \u2013 we put it in place in our Q1. And as far as incentives go, changing the jobs, interviewing folks for roles, both internally and deciding that, in some roles, we needed to go externally for the right level of talent the way we want to work and we would expect that that entire restructuring will be done and behind us by the end of our Q3 and that we would start to see benefits from that next year in FY 2021. So, we're really excited about it and like the progress we're making.","Kevin Moran","So, next question.","Operator","There are no further questions. So, I'd like to hand back to your host for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Kaufmann","Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. We're really pleased to be off to a solid start to our FY 2020 and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months. Take care, everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"4260":["Cardinal Health, Inc.

George?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. As I typically do, I'll spend a few minutes of my discussion covering at a high level our performance for the quarter. However, these are not typical times and, on the surface, not a typical year for Cardinal Health. The impact of this year's generic pricing environment accounts for the primary headwind on our financials. It is masking the fact that we are seeing growth in more key initiatives and priorities than we've seen in quite some time.","In that context, I want to make sure that woven throughout my comments we address the following three questions. One, how are we executing and competing in the market; two, how would I characterize some of the more recent market dynamics; and three, how are we positioned for long-term sustainable growth?","Before I get to that, I want to acknowledge that in spite of the extraordinary dynamism in the industry, we at Cardinal Health remain focused on the millions of people that we touch every day. We embrace our vital role at the center of the healthcare continuum, and our responsibility remains unchanged. Our role, providing the highest quality products and services to all of our partners and their patients around the world, lies at the core of who we are and what we do.","Because the healthcare discussion in the U.S. has been so prominent, my commentary today will be more focused on the U.S. So how did we do this quarter? To summarize the performance for Q2, the revenue was up 5% versus the prior year to $33.1 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 3% to $1.34 versus the prior year. And non-GAAP operating earnings were down 4% versus the second quarter of last year to $701 million.","At the segment level, our Pharmaceutical segment performed a bit better than we had expected this quarter. Revenue was up 5% versus the prior year to $29.7 billion, and segment profit declined 14% versus the prior year to $537 million. This decline was almost entirely the result of generic pharmaceutical pricing and the loss of Safeway, both of which we covered in our last call.","Our Medical segment had another strong quarter, continuing its repositioning to better serve the needs of its evolving market. Revenue for the Medical segment was up 8% versus the prior year to $3.4 billion, and segment profit was up 50% versus the prior year. I would note here about half of this is attributable to the mechanics of last year's inventory step-up. These are really strong numbers.","As you know, our guidance for the year, which we provided in early August, was based on both our plans for the upcoming year, as well as our assessment of market conditions at the time. By the time we reported our first quarter, we'd seen a step-down in generic pricing which prompted us to make a small change to our guidance for the year to reflect that dynamic.","At the time, Mike also provided you with the key factors which could dictate where we might fall in that range. With actual data from Q2 and preliminary data from January, we can now forecast that the top end of that range is unlikely. This is more a function of the math, rather than any further deterioration of market conditions.","With that in mind and wanting to provide enough of a range to account for the normal variables, we're adjusting our guidance range for FY 2017 to $5.35 to $5.50, from our prior range of $5.40 to $5.60. Mike will provide some additional color on how the various factors were included in this decision.","Across the board, Cardinal Health is seeing the results of our team's dedication to addressing the needs of our customers and the people they treat every day. This team's hard work is evident as our lines of business are showing strong fundamentals. Unit sales are strong. Our customer service levels have never been higher. And our ability to operate across the continuum of care with a broad range of products and services creates a uniqueness to our model, which is resonating with our customers across the enterprise.","Our rates of customer retention are extraordinarily high and we are growing with our customers, building on a sustainable value proposition that aligns with long-term trends. We are confident that we can improve efficiency for virtually any part of our customer base, and do so with a valuable and integrated portfolio. At a time of rapid change, we know how essential it is to demonstrate customer intimacy in ways that meet their specific needs and enable them to adapt to a shifting landscape.","I've had the chance in recent weeks to meet with many of our customers, both upstream and downstream; and I came away from those conversations with the clear sense that they are eager to work closely with us. Together, we are better equipped to address the complexities of the system, with Cardinal Health well-positioned as a partner.","Reinforced through these conversations, I'd like to focus on five major initiatives which should be familiar for you. They are: one, growing our generics program; two, driving growth in our Specialty Solutions group; three, increasing our offerings of valuable products and services to our acute and integrated delivery customers; four, driving additional penetration of Cardinal Health consumable Medical products and physician preference items; and five, establishing a leading position in the post-acute space.","Let me walk through these one by one. On generics, as I said, industry pricing dynamics were challenging throughout the first half of our fiscal 2017. We are, however, seeing some signs of a return back to more typical patterns. While it may be too early to characterize this as a trend, we see it as encouraging.","Our customer base is solid, and we continue to offer tremendous value for any retail or institutional customer looking to offer an industry-leading generics program. Our team's innovative approach to generics serves our customers well; and our joint venture with CVS Health, Red Oak continues to be a driver of value and, in our view, a unique source of competitive advantage.","Turning to Specialty Solutions, our group continues its high rate of growth, increasing our reach across key therapeutic areas and strengthening our suite of services that we can offer our pharmaceutical partners who seek to get closer to the patients. We've more than doubled the number of clients in our Specialty hub and significantly grown the client base in our 3PL business.","We are beginning to see the first wave of biosimilars entering the market. We've built the right therapeutic footprint to effectively serve any part of this system with these products, and have the team of experts in place to support this business.","With regard to our acute and integrated delivery customers, these providers of healthcare are experiencing significant changes: changes in the size and complexity of their systems; the new technologies which they employ; the shifting sites of care; the adoption of more integrated delivery models, which are directed towards more patient-centered value-based designs; and the accompanying evolution of payment systems, which align with that value-based model.","As their partners, we've built a suite of products and services that are designed to address these forces. Let me give you some examples.","We offer critical supply chain and inventory management solutions that allow clinicians to focus on their patients and remove themselves from supply chain activities and administrative documentation. Our solutions provide visibility to real-time analytics, enabling customers to make data-driven decisions around products supporting patient safety up to the point of care.","This past week, we celebrated the third anniversary of our Academy for Excellence in Healthcare, kicking off our 11th cohort. This program, based on our deep expertise and operational excellence, Lean and Six Sigma techniques, has been designed to help healthcare organizations identify and solve their greatest operating challenges, ultimately driving results that can significantly reduce costs and improve patient outcomes.","To-date, we've worked with 36 hospitals, training and coaching 49 teams comprised of hundreds of Medical providers, and the group has published 16 white papers. Through this work, we've helped our partners reduce readmissions, improve the discharge management process, reduce length of stay and surgical wait times and increase patient satisfaction.","Our Medical\/Surgical distribution business is highly efficient and growing again, and we continue to see growth in Cardinal Health Brand products, which as you know includes Cordis. We continue to grow the number of products and product categories in our Cardinal Health Brand, and now offer more than 19,000 SKUs in 110 product families. Our Cordis acquisition is largely on plan, and I'm proud of the way in which our teams have come together around the world during this first year. We feel very confident that we can add value to any system in their interventional cardiology activities.","Demographics and delivery system shifts remain key drivers behind our focus on the post-acute world. We believe that patients can be treated more efficiently, more safely and with better outcomes using the right tools.","In our Cardinal Health at Home business, we continue to focus on bringing Medical products to patients in their homes. And the work we're doing at naviHealth in post-acute care management and care transitions is industry-leading and growing quite dramatically. That business uses the tools and clinical data needed to create the optimal care experience for patients.","In summary, our value proposition is increasingly resonating with our customer, and this includes our manufacturer partners who are also dealing with a dynamic and shifting landscape. We have a unique capacity to navigate through environmental road bumps. Our portfolio is robust, balanced and fully integrated.","Our organization has critical scale, but it's still nimble enough to deal with short-term disturbances, and our team has proven their mettle. They're mission-driven and possess a clear sense of where we're going. Because of this, as an enterprise, we are positioned for sustainable and enduring value creation for our business partners and for you, our shareholders.","Finally, we are an active participant in the unfolding policy discussions around healthcare. We bring to those conversations our key tenets. All people should have access to coverage for healthcare, which most experts agree requires a stable insurance system. We need to support our providers of care, most of whom recognize that healthcare can be centered more around the patient.","It can be more clearly coordinated, and incentives can be designed to encourage innovation, including ways to drive the best outcomes in the most affordable and accessible way. And we know that the overwhelming power of demographics will continue to fuel demand. Those are the inescapable realities which guide our course. This commitment to our true north helps us serve our customers and the people that they treat every day.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike and get back to you during the Q&A.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. This morning, I'll start with a review of our second quarter financial performance and then provide some additional color around our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. Please note that with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.","Starting on slide four, our second quarter fiscal results were slightly better than expected with GAAP diluted EPS at $1.02 and non-GAAP diluted EPS at $1.34; a 4% and 3% increase, respectively. Note that both the GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer outstanding shares as compared to the prior year. I'll review both segments in greater detail later, but let me start with consolidated results.","Revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $33.1 billion. Consolidated GAAP gross margin dollars were flat, while non-GAAP gross margin dollars were down 2% versus the same quarter in the prior year. GAAP gross margin rates were down 29 basis points for the quarter, while non-GAAP gross margin rates were down 38 basis points. The decline in rates is best described in the explanations of the Pharma and Medical segment profit rate changes, which I will cover in a few minutes.","Consolidated SG&A was down by 1%. As you would expect, we continue to have a disciplined approach to managing cost while still investing in our future. Both consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined by 4% versus the prior year. Below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $51 million for the quarter, a moderate increase over the prior year.","For the second quarter, the GAAP effective tax rate was 34% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.2%, both somewhat lower than historical norms. Both declined 3 percentage points versus the prior year, and these lower rates were primarily due to a few favorable discrete tax items.","Our second quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 319 million, 13 million shares fewer than the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This is the result of our share repurchases, including $350 million worth of shares repurchased during the quarter. We now have $443 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program. As I've said in the past, we will continue to evaluate share repurchases opportunistically in the context of our overall capital deployment strategy.","We generated $554 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance, including short-term investments, was $2.1 billion, with $552 million held outside the United States.","Now, I'll move to the segment reviews. You can follow along on slides five and six. Our Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 5% to $29.7 billion. This increase was a result of growth from existing Pharmaceutical distribution customers, as well as strong performance from the Specialty business.","Segment profit for the quarter decreased 14% to $537 million. Generic pharmaceutical pricing and, to a lesser extent, the previously announced loss of Safeway partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing drove this decrease.","Note that while profits tied to branded inflation were a headwind in Q2, this headwind had a smaller impact than the loss of Safeway. Remember that less than 15% of our branded margin is tied to inflation and we continue to work with our branded partners to ensure that we receive fair value for our services. My expectation is that this contingent component will be less than 10% in the near future.","Segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 41 basis points to 1.8%, largely due to generic pharmaceutical pricing. Last quarter, we told you we expected that generic pricing and brand inflation would cause Q2 Pharma segment profit to decline a percentage similar to Q1. While these items came in about as expected, our better-than-anticipated performance in Specialty distribution as well as SG&A contributed to the Pharma segment's better-than-expected results.","The excellent performance in Specialty was driven by growth in the acute space in Metro Medical on the provider facing side, and growth in our 3PL and regulatory science service offerings on the biopharma side.","Now, let's go to the Medical segment which had another strong quarter. Revenue for the quarter grew 8% to $3.4 billion, driven by contributions from net new and existing customers. Segment profit increased 50% to $159 million due to the contribution from Cardinal Health Brand products which includes Cordis. This increase reflects the $21 million unfavorable impact of the Cordis-related inventory fair value step-up in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Excluding this step-up, year-over-year Medical segment profit growth was a robust 25%. Please remember that in the Q3 comparison, we will have the same $21 inventory step-up from fiscal year 2016.","Segment profit margin rate increased 132 basis points to 4.68% due to the Cardinal Health Brand products which, as noted above, includes Cordis. Overall, the Medical segment team is working well together to drive results.","My comments until now have been largely U.S.-focused, so I want to highlight two global items. First, Cordis is performing well, particularly in Europe and Latin America. And second, the China team continues to execute well, and they're on track to achieve double-digit top and bottom line growth for the full fiscal year. On a related note, during the quarter, we didn't see much of an impact resulting from foreign exchange or commodities.","Before I discuss our outlook for the full year, you can turn to slide number seven to see our consolidated GAAP to non-GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.32 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS result was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.","Let me move to our fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance range and assumptions on slides nine through 12. As George mentioned earlier, with six months of data behind us and a good view into January, we believe achieving the upper half of our $5.40 to $5.60 guidance range will be challenging. So to adjust for this and provide some room for variability, we are modifying our guidance range to $5.35 to $5.50.","To be specific, the most significant parts for the second half are mainly environmental. They're generic market pricing, taxes and brand inflation. So all this translates to a non-GAAP EPS growth rate of between 2% and 5% for the fiscal year, a minor adjustment from our prior guidance.","With that context as a backdrop, I'll walk through our updated corporate assumptions on slide 10. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be between 320 million and 321 million shares. Additionally, our updated assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization will be about $384 million or $0.77 per share, which does not affect our non-GAAP earnings. As you can see, all of our other corporate assumptions remain unchanged.","On slide 11, there are two updates to our full-year Pharmaceutical segment assumptions. First, based on our six months of data plus a good view into January, we are updating our generic drug price assumption from mid to high-single digit deflation to high-single digit deflation for the full fiscal year.","Second, our Q1 assumptions expected Pharma segment profit for FY 2017 to be down mid to high-single digits versus the prior year. Based on the factors I discussed earlier, we now expect full-year Pharma segment profit to be down high-single to low-double digits. All other Pharma segment assumptions are unchanged.","Now turning to the Medical segment assumptions on slide 12. We are on track to achieve mid to high-single digit percentage growth in revenue, up from our previous assumption of mid-single digit percentage revenue growth. All of our other Medical segment assumptions are unchanged, and we expect to see double-digit profit growth versus the prior year for the segment.","One final comment. As you can see, based upon our first half performance and updated total year guidance, we expect our second half to be somewhat better than our first half with Q3 slightly larger than Q4.","Overall, we believe that we're well-positioned to manage the changing healthcare landscape with a clear, well-defined strategy across the enterprise. The vast majority of our businesses and initiatives are going very well, and we know our key priorities and how to get after them.","With that, operator, let's go to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning, and thank you for all the details.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Good morning.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just to follow up on how we should think about the update to guidance and kind of when we think about the different factors that are getting worse in the second half, are these things that you think are going to be isolated to, one, the third or fourth quarter? Or should we expect some of these headwinds to persist throughout the year? And basically, what I'm trying to get is kind of will some of these things carryover or flow through to fiscal year 2018? How should we think about that?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Ricky, good morning. It's George. I'll start and then I'll let Mike pick up. Again, it's important, in my commentary I made the observation that actually we're not seeing a further deterioration. That, in fact, as we started to come to the very end of our Q2, we started to see more normal patterns on generics. So largely \u2013 and I'll let Mike touch on this \u2013 the base is sort of reset lower. But, Mike, do you want to add to that?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I would just emphasize, Ricky, as I look across all of our businesses and all of the various factors that contribute to our overall results, I would emphasize that as we've been saying for the last couple of quarters, it's really this generic pharmaceutical pricing that is the number one factor.","And all we're saying here is that it basically ended up finishing a little lower than we expect it to, in the sense that our base is reset a little bit lower than we expected it to, but the actual activity that we saw in December and January looks to be stabilizing, and that we've just set at a little bit lower base. And so, when we took that lower base and spread it across our second half, that's really essentially what lowered our overall guidance.","So as you think about the various components, I've mentioned three things, generic pricing being the biggest factor that can have a little bit of variability to it. But again, as George mentioned and I mentioned, it's looking much better over the last couple months.","Branded inflation, we did see some branded inflation in January and it seems to be about where we're expecting it to be. But again, depending on what happens over the last five months, we just want to call that out. And lastly, taxes, which I called out is the third factor. It's more about timing within quarters than overall being concerned that we're going to fall outside our 35% to 37% guidance range. It's really that you might see it be a little better in one quarter and a little worse in the other. But overall for the year, we expect it to be...","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Right. Ricky, my comments were specifically about the generic environment, which is what I thought you were asking about. But I think Mike captured the more broad perspective on this.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. And I would emphasize, I think, it's really just a slight EPS reduction because of, again, this variability in the generic market pricing.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And just to clarify on the generic pricing and deflation. I know last quarter you mentioned that generic deflation is also a mix, right, so it's the sell-side versus buy-side. So should we read into your comments that you've seen both the sell-side and buy-side environment stabilizing by December?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I would say the answer is yes. As far as price activity from manufacturers to us, that's been tracking all year about as what we expected. It was really the sell-side that started out for the first couple quarters lower than we had originally anticipated. But, again, we see it stabilizing now.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Ricky.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Can I just start and just follow-up there just so that I understand this, George? When you talk about it stabilizing, but yet we think about the fact that you're lowering the back half of the year. I guess, I'm just trying to understand that math. How that works. So if it stabilized in the most recent quarter and SG&A and Specialty drove a little bit of better upside, was it just that your anticipation was that things were going to get better in your fiscal back half of the year and now they're somewhat carrying through, although they've stabilized?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. That's a fair question, Lisa. I would say that's pretty much accurate. I'd say that where it's stabilized at, we're just a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated when we projected our second half. And so, that even though Specialty is over-performing and we're seeing some really good controls in SG&A, that when you mix the two together that it net was a little bit potentially lower for us.","And then, we just wanted to give ourselves a little bit of variability. When we first thought about taking off the top half of the range and having just a $0.10 range, that seemed a little tight for us only halfway through the year. And so, we thought that adding another $0.05 to give us a little bit of room would be the smart thing to do.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Mike, you also made a comment about Q3 being better than Q4. Can you just talk about is there something specific that you're anticipating in either side of your business in Q3, or was that comment specific to drug distribution?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No. That was just specific overall, just to try to be helpful. Obviously, you'll be able to estimate we think the second half will be, and then I just wanted to give you a little thought that Q3 would be bigger than Q4 mainly because that's the quarter where you see the majority of the branded inflation. Anyways, as you know, that's typically the quarter where you see it. And so, I thought you guys are all going to be thinking Q3 is bigger than Q4 generally because it historically always is. But I just wanted to give you little thoughts around that it should be about slightly bigger than Q4, to give you a little help.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","The next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, guys. George, appreciate the commentary. Obviously, it's a tough environment for all of us to kind of navigate. And amongst your peers, the commentary regarding the outlook has been slightly different in terms of various drivers. I guess, from your standpoint, what do you think are the one or two things we need to be spending the most time thinking about as we analyze and grade how this business is doing given all these macro factors?","And, obviously, you feel as if the underlying was better than sort of what the guidance or the quarter showed. And so, help us think through what sort of KPIs you're looking at or how you're thinking about the evolution relative to kind of how the last 12 months played out? Because it's obviously been a pretty volatile environment relative to what this business has been used to.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Ross. Yes, let me try to do this, and then I'll comment a little bit on the unique dynamic of having some of our peers report with actually different year ends. And Mike will touch on that because I actually think it's an interesting dynamic at work.","For us, the drivers \u2013 we know that economically, as we've said, that the generic pharmaceutical pricing environment is a big factor. We'll watch to see, for us, that those rates look more normalized. We started to see that towards the end of the quarter and the beginning of January. Obviously, as I said, it's a little early to declare trend, but I thought that was an encouraging sign. It's something that I said to you guys I thought would start to happen.","The other thing is all of our priorities have to be going in the right direction. Specialty; our Specialty business is in a really good position right now. We've seen really good signs of growth broadly, both downstream and upstream. Across our Medical segment, we're seeing really encouraging signs, even in what you think of as our legacy Medical\/Surgical business is really beginning to get a little bit of wind in their sales.","So watching for all the components, our service lines in Medical, our Cardinal Health branded products, our work in naviHealth, our activity with our Med\/Surg products. These are all, for us, key indicators of our long-term positioning playing out the way we want and, actually, the general growth in customer base. We want customers to see us as that go-to company at a time of complexity.","So we're beginning to see that. And so, actually, we're feeling quite optimistic about where we are, we're having to navigate, and have had to navigate through a little bit of a tough environment in generics. But as we've said to you that happens from time to time and we're keeping disciplined about how we see the future of the business. Anything to add there, Mike?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I think the only thing I would add is, as you mentioned, generic pharmaceutical pricing is a key driver, and I think the timing of the three distributors' year ends is an important factor to consider. When you think that what we really saw, the impact of that was really in our Q1 and if our \u2013 I'll just put it simply, if our year-end had been three months later, we probably wouldn't be revising guidance because we would've had some insight and built that into the year. If our year-end had been three months earlier, we probably would've had a bigger miss because we would've had even less insight into it. So it's difficult to compare when you have three different year ends.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. And obviously, George, you talked about just in terms of key priorities. On the Medical business, the growth there has been obviously quite good. You've gained some share, you've executed on the deals. The balance sheet still has some capability. And in terms of adding incremental assets to the mix and continuing to evolve that strategy, where are you in terms of appetite for having digested Cordis, contemplating whether or not it makes sense to add more into the bag there in Medical?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Ross. I'll just do this very generally and probably consistent with the comments we've made in the past. We continue to look for opportunities to grow our business organically and certainly through the strength of our balance sheet. And so, to the extent that we see opportunities to grow capabilities that we think have sustainable competitive advantage, position us for this continually evolving market, we will not be shy to look at those opportunities. But, again, hopefully you'll expect from us discipline in doing that. But certainly a part of the equation for us is how we use our balance sheet, and that may be through activities that are available external to us and the other ways that we deploy capital.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I think I like to maybe split hairs a little bit on the drug pricing conversation. So I heard you loud and clear on the impact to this quarter from generic drug pricing assumptions moving to high-single digit deflation. I want to make sure I understand perfectly that commentary relative to competition in the marketplace and your view. Did that competition element impact the change in guidance, or are we really focused on the element and the assumption that you focused on?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Well, I think one feeds the other. The competitiveness in the generic market is what drove the revision to the generics being down net high-single digit deflation for the year, because it's made up of two key components: pricing from the manufacturers, which we said we haven't seen really much variability from what we expected for the year; and then our pricing downstream to the customers. The combination of those two drive that factor. And so, since we've seen, like we said, more aggressive pricing in the market early on in the year \u2013 although again we've seen some positive signs lately \u2013 that is what drove that number to be down high-single digits.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Now, I get it relative to the manufacturer expectations. That's helpful. And then, your comment on Q3 versus Q4, Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","We've been trying to understand the ramp through the year. Should I expect that we're still down high-single digits in Q3, but then potentially up as we get to Q4 and you lap some of the headwinds?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","As far as actually giving growth percentages, I don't want to necessarily step right into that, but I do think that \u2013 again, just trying to be helpful. If you take what you obviously think the guidance for the year is and take a look at the second half, we just want to give you a little bit of color that Q3 would be slightly larger than Q4.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. Just following up, Mike, on the back half commentary. Seeing some of the key metrics stabilizing as you move into the back half, other than maybe some residual impact from something like Safeway, do you feel that the back half as you look at it today is more representative of the new world order? Is this how we should think about how the business can perform in this environment as you think about, obviously, a little bit of a difference between 3Q and 4Q. But taken together is that how you envision the business performing going forward?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Generally, probably, overall that's not a bad assumption. Again, we have to think through all the pieces and how it relates over a full year because you've got comps and stuff through the prior year. But if you think about certain things like if the generic market has stabilized \u2013 which again we say early results we've seen \u2013 will lap Safeway in the fourth quarter, then you have the $21 million step-up in Q3 that completely goes away.","So you do have some large moving parts that kind of settle out during the year, but you're going to continue to have positives like Red Oak and some of the other initiatives that we're driving that continue to be tailwinds for us. But, yeah, a lot of those things that have created some noise in the P&L should either be stabilizing or we should be lapping.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And I know we spend a lot of time on the generic pricing side, but just can you remind us on the branded side what's factored in for the year? I guess, specifically, is there another assumption in your fiscal 4Q that you would see another round of more significant branded price increases?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question. It's hard to know whether or not we'll see another set of increases or what they'll be for the rest of the year, but we still believe that our estimate of 7% to 9% for the full fiscal year is approximately the right number to be at. Again, that's a range that \u2013 obviously, there's some variability into that. So we're trying to take into account all of those factors as to whether or not there should be. I would also mention that, again, most of the price increases in the second half do happen in January. So we have seen a lot of it. So the amount of it in the second half that's left to go is not necessarily huge.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. And I think the other thing, again, just as a moving part, movement here is not as relevant economically as what we were describing in generic.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","And we'll take a question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Mike and George, I'd ask what type of insights is Red Oak giving you in the ability to kind of forecast generic drug pricing? And does Red Oak provide you any protection from downward price activity that might differentiate you from your peers?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","George, okay, I'll start with that and then Mike. So on the buying side, remember there's two components to this. There's the buy and the sell. Red Oak, I think we've got really sophisticated analytics and capabilities and just great dialogue with our manufacture partners. So as much as you can, obviously, these are products that, as you know, change frequently in the generic world. But I would say we've got pretty good line of sight and really good analytics and great teams. The sell-side is a different story. And so, Mike, thoughts on that?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say, I guess, the first comment again kind of emphasizing what George said on Red Oak, right, the ultimate \u2013 for lack of a better word \u2013 game in generics is while you can have a deflating sell price, but if you're managing your costs better you can always be expanding your margins. And so, if you're asking me do I think we're in a great position with Red Oak. Absolutely, based on what George said. I have a ton of faith in the team, the analytics. The fact that we are the largest in that standpoint I feel really good about that.","As far as Red Oak, working together with the sell-side, there's actually no cutover. Red Oak doesn't do anything or have anything to do with what our sell price should be. Their goal is to ultimately go out and get us the best absolute cost. And then, we actually have a firewall between the two, because I think it's incredibly important that our selling side folks aren't actually seeing the cost of our generics because I don't what that to influence how they decide to price. We want the price to market and we want to make sure we're overall evaluating our overall selling proposition. So we actually have a very strong firewall between our sell-side decisions and our costing decisions with Red Oak.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","What I would add to this, George, is that I do think our telemarketing operations give us, on the sell-side, probably a very nice line of sight because we're having so much daily dialogue with the pharmacy world. So, I think, as good a line of sight as we can. But, as you know, this year has been a little bit more difficult to model than past years, but we're a little bit encouraged by the more recent signs.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, maybe a quick follow-up might just be your largest customer seems poised for some market share losses. I know for you guys that's largely brand business. Is there any impact to kind of market share shifts on the retail end factored into the guidance or is it immaterial?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. We knew about all of that in the past, as we mentioned before. All of that was factored into our guidance.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question.","Operator","And the next question is from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","(43:47).","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. So just on the generics, on the signs of returning back to more normal typical pricing patterns, just curious to get more color on what you think are the drivers of the slightly improving generic deflation rate? You don't have to throw things out there. I'm just curious, are you seeing maybe just some price increase activity to offset price erosion on others? Is it just anniversarying tougher comps? Just wanted to get more color on what you're seeing that's leading to the better trend?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Steve, I'll do the best I can on this because these are complex markets. I would say, in general, we saw what we thought to be a pretty unusual flurry of activity in the early part of our fiscal year. And our expectation, just based on sort of history, was we see those things from time to time and they tend to stabilize and revert back to more normal patterns if you don't see significant movement of share. And I would say that's probably what we saw.","So what happened during a period of time was that the steepness of the curve was sharper. It was a more steep downward curve. There's always erosion on the sell price. That's sort of the normal pattern. But the rate, the steepness of that curve was a little heightened. And our feeling was that what we might see and we expected to see was a bit of a calming down of that at some point. And I think that's largely as best as we can describe that dynamic.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just quickly on the brand side. You mentioned that 15% of the profits may be tied to brand inflation. For whatever reason, it seems like investors have a higher-than-normal amount of focus on the upcoming midyear round of brand price increases for the industry. And my sense, kind of as you touched down a little bit earlier, it's just not that critical to the overall earnings picture really in any year. So I'm just wondering is there any breakdown of how much of that 15% of those economics occurs around the January round of branded inflation versus the midyear round. I'm guessing the overwhelming majority is tied to the January round? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. When you take a look at the historical patterns and even so far what we seen this year, is the branded price increases are heavily more weighted to the January timeframe than any other time. Probably that mid-summer timeframe is the second largest, but it's by far larger in the January timeframe. And again, to emphasize, if I had to talk about the three variables, I would rank them in order of generics by far being the largest, and then the taxes only because of its variability between quarters, and then brand being the smallest of the three at least for our mix of products and what we're expecting.","Operator","The next question is from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, hey. Thanks for taking the question. George and Mike, if we go back to the Dublin day in December, you had talked about the competitive environment on the sell-side highlighting your independent book. And, George, if I recall you made a comment saying that you had factored in sort of the competitive sort of step-down in the pricing into your guidance here. So then when I think about your comments today, are you saying that we continue to see more competitive price erosion? Or was it your assumptions on what you needed to give in terms of maintaining your book had changed? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Charles. Good morning. So, I think largely what we're saying is that as we came to the tail end of Q2, we started to see more typical rates of erosion in comparison to what we had seen in the early fall, which was more sharp. So actually, again, we're being a little bit cautious here because \u2013 I wish I had more data to say this is a discernible trend. But I would say it's a good sign that we did see some stabilization to the more normalized rates. Mike, could you add to it (47:36)?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I'd just again emphasize that at the time in December we didn't have quite as much information as we did by the end, and bottom line is it just settled out a little lower than we expected it to across all of the channels where we sell generics. But the good news is, it seems to have stabilized at that lower level and we just needed to update where we were for the rest of the year.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And then, as a follow-up, you mentioned earlier you expect the component of your fee-for-service, that's contingent to be less than 10%. I missed the timeframe that you expect that to happen. Is that sort of as we get into fiscal 2018, or is that a contracting cycle over the next few years? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that it would be more of a next 12 months type of a thing. Right now, it's less than $0.15. I would expect it to get to that $0.10 range within the next 12 months.","Operator","The next question is from John Kreger with William Blair.","Jon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. Thanks for taking the question. So you noted strong growth in your Specialty business this quarter. So could you touch on how your discussions with specialty drug manufacturers are going? And then, how quickly is your Specialty distribution business growing compared to the hub services piece? And how confident are you that growth in Specialty over the long-run won't cause some downward pressure on margins?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. So there were a couple of parts to that question, Jon. I just want to make sure I got them right. One is, I think you're saying what's driving it, if I got it right. Again, there's multiple components. What's driving it? Do we see it as sustainable? And the impact to margin rates?","So let me start with the basics. I think we're driving it and have been very consistently been driving growth in two primary areas. One is our reach across therapeutic areas has just become dramatically larger over these last three to four years. So we were present in certain areas in the institution and then we started to grow our oncology businesses. We've expanded into urology and rheumatology. And so, I would say our overall footprint downstream in therapeutic areas right now is very strong, and that just makes us a stronger partner for anyone.","On the upstream, I think we've started to build more tools and capabilities for the manufacturer partners and, in particular, I'd highlight our patient hub. And this is a time where manufacturers really want to connect with their patients and I think our hub allows us to do that. So we do see continued progress in our Specialty business.","As it relates to margin rates, we don't break out the specific margin rates in Specialty versus sort of traditional Pharma. Having said that, we don't see the Specialty as being dilutive to it. And, again, Mike, I'll ask you to just qualify anything I (50:35).","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Just a couple of quick comments. I would say, if you think about Specialty, just separate it in two different businesses \u2013 services upside, the biopharma downstream to the providers \u2013 both are growing significantly. On the downstream side, although we've lapped the Metro Medical acquisition, it continues to perform very well in some of the areas where we weren't as strong before the acquisition.","For instance, we were strong in oncology. They were very strong in rheumatology and nephrology, and those areas continue to go very well for us. And the team down there executes very well. So we're seeing very strong growth downstream on the provider side. That's going to be our more lower-margin typical distribution type of margin business.","And then, upside on the biopharma side, the strong areas have really been our hub, our 3PL business and our scientific and regulatory businesses are all doing very nicely. And these are going to be much higher-margin services businesses. So when you blend it together, it makes for a nice mix for us.","Jon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Next is David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Congratulations on a good quarter. Mike, can you talk about the \u2013 yeah, very good quarter on both divisions \u2013 can you talk about your SG&A costs? I mean, those looked like the lowest percentage of revenue that I've seen in four years. Are there any focused efforts going on at Cardinal to maybe reduce costs? Can you talk about that, please?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Sure. As you can imagine, any time when you're not performing at the level that you would expect yourself and hold yourself accountable to delivering, you're going to get after managing your expenses maybe even tighter than you normally would. And so, I think that both the Pharma and the Med team, even though the Med team's performing very strongly, they're also paying attention to their expenses too, because we're all one company. We're all Cardinal.","But the Pharma side is just being very thoughtful about where they're making investments, trying to prioritize; and I do want to emphasize, we're still making investments. It's important to know that while we're paying attention to our SG&A, we're also at the same time prioritizing things that are still important to our future and investing in those. So I would say it's really about tight focus, prioritization and just managing through those types of things.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then on the Medical side, if Don is here, maybe he can comment on the margins? And is this a good sort of go-forward run rate?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're going to continue to see some fluctuation in our margin rates in Medical, but I do think that you're now starting to see a margin rate where we would expect it to be. As you said, we've never given up on our goal to be at 5.75%, both through our organic growth and inorganic moves that we'll continue to make.","I think that you're going to see big wins like Kaiser, that we talked about, while that's a distribution customer, it's going to be margin dilutive because it's more margin. It's more of a distribution business. And then, you're going to see adding businesses like Cordis, which are going to be higher margin. Then you're going to see us convert our customers to more Cardinal Health Brand products, which is going to increase our margin rates, grow our at Home business, which is growing our margin rates as well as naviHealth. So I think we have a lot of moving parts in Medical that should continue to help us with the momentum on growing our margin rates on that side of the business.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered. Just quickly, Mike, one for you. Just a more technical question than anything else. It looks like just from your updated share count assumptions that we're pretty much assuming no real incremental buyback based on current levels of the back half of the year? Is that how you guys think about it and then to be opportunistic if you see fit?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Mike, you said it about perfectly. Yeah, we're not anticipating any more stock repurchases in the second half. However, if there is an opportunity and depending on where our cash sits, we may opportunistically do that. But right now, we're not planning to do that at this point.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Must be the patriots' blood in me. And then, George, one...","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Don't encourage, Sally.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Okay.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","George, one just big picture question for you, particularly as you move into your role as Head of Healthcare Leadership Council. So as you think about all the moving pieces in D.C. and whether it's uncertainty around stuff around tax reform, be it corporate tax reform in the U.S., border adjustability, all of the moving pieces related to the changing landscape of healthcare reform and will they, won't they on the Obamacare repeal, how do you think about positioning the business and positioning the company so that you're as nimble as possible as some of these changes come down to landscape? And is there any way you can even pre-prepare the business for something that's a moving target?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question, Mike. I appreciate it. So let me do the best I can. One of the interesting things about our business is that our fundamental strategic direction has been set really for a number of years, and we actually have a strategic plan in process that we do with 100 or so people in the organization a couple of times a year. And as it turns out, we had one just a few days after the election. And the first thing we did with the group was put out a chart in front of them and said, these are our priorities, these are the trends in healthcare. What changes?","And with the exception of the fact that we're going to have to deal with some policy issues along the way, fundamentally the directions are clear. Demographics will not turn backwards. We know it's an inexorable march. We know that care is going to move to more ambulatory settings, move to different settings. We know that there's going to be a focus on efficiency and coordination of care, that the post-acute world is going to be important. So we built our strategy around those things.","So it's been really interesting to try to sort of navigate the short-term stuff, but keep our eye very much on the long-term. Here's what I'd say just very, very generally about the two things you mentioned, the Affordable Care Act and the tax-related issues. The President, the majority party have made it very clear that their intentions are to repeal the Act through the budget reconciliation process. And through that, as you probably know, they can eliminate components of the law. But they've also reaffirmed their commitment to retain certain aspects of the law like the pre-existing conditions requirements.","So again, these are complex moving parts. And so, the things that we're doing is making sure that there is an educator reminding people about whether we're going to replace, or rebuild, or repair, or whatever the right term is. We want to make sure that there is a stable insurance foundation to support it, and that sort of is a key opening part to it. And we think that is at this point well understood, and that the timelines are probably going to adjust a little bit as people try to figure out how to navigate that. We'll make sure our voice is heard.","On the tax proposals, we generally have been a supporter, as you know, of tax reform. But again we want to make sure that we are educators and informers on certain dynamic. So, for example, you know that many Medical products including some of ours are made outside of the U.S. and related facilities. And so, we just want to make sure that that information is well understood as policies are starting to come through. So, yeah, there was interesting time both as Cardinal Health and certainly in my new role as Chair of HLC. But I think we're well-positioned broadly, and I think we're nimble enough to continue to adapt to short-term dynamics at work.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. Medical, obviously, I think everybody is feeling a little bit better about it today. That being said, you do have a very large win with Kaiser. I'm just trying to pull back the layers of the onion here a little bit. If we could strip out Kaiser, my guess is growth looks like 3% to 4%. What is the growth in acute care stand-alone, ex-Kaiser? You've got a lot of small businesses that are growing faster, doing better. I'm just trying to make sure that the acute care distribution piece stand-alone ex-market share isn't actually flat to shrinking at this point? Or maybe it is.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. So, Eric, thanks for the question. I don't want to pull Kaiser out for two reasons. One is, I wouldn't want to talk specifically about the size of any one customer, but second of all it is part of our business, it is the result of all of the work that the team has done to reposition the business as a thought leader, as a business that has lots of other services, a broad product line. And so, to me it is more of the result of all of the work we've done, so to pull it out doesn't make sense. Now, business is still definitely growing without the Kaiser piece in it, but it's hard to break it down. I don't know that would be appropriate. George?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, Eric, if it's okay, I will do this because we don't break out individual pieces, and we certainly don't want to break out individual customers. But remember I talked to you about and someone asked earlier lead indicators. So they are all looking green. Our Pharmaceutical \u2013 excuse me, our Medical\/Surgical distribution business is probably the healthiest position we've seen it in quite some time. So we're seeing really a very good organic activity and growth there. So I think I can answer qualitatively without breaking out the individual pieces for you.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","And if you set aside Kaiser and make it Cordis, the business (01:00:28).","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I don't want to take Kaiser away from you. I actually think you're structurally advantaged perhaps versus some in the market. I am just trying to get a sense of where the market is?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Understood.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely. And I didn't mean any other way than that. But I appreciate that.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. We can take it offline. Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","The next question is from Garen Sarafian with Citi.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, George and Mike. High-level question on procurement in generics. One of your peers is in the market getting updated pricing that includes the volume of a large new retail client. So how has that impacted the market? And how long do you think whatever changes are going on take to flow through?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","That's a tough question, because I don't really want to speak for our competitors. And I'm not sure of the timing of exactly when they are launching and all the different pieces of when they go-to-market. But I will say that as you can imagine, our Red Oak team is paying attention to that, has great relationships with the manufacturers and will be paying attention to that to make sure that we are costed appropriately for our size and simplicity and transparency of our model. And other than that, that's probably all I can say.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess, if there's anything on \u2013 how long, in generic terms when there's a large new client, it takes to flow through the system? But the follow-up was actually going to be, to close out a prior question, on the impact of branding price increases and impact to Cardinal. So could you put some sort of any broad weightings around the impact of January price increases versus the midyear? Is it more of two-thirds, one-third? Or is it more 80\/20? Or something else that you could share? Thank you.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I probably can't share that level of detail because it's obviously hard to know, and manufacturers moved slightly between month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. So again I'll just emphasize January is bigger, the biggest month, but other than that, George?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Garen, I'd just add to this? I mean, typically January is bigger, as Mike said. The other thing that we need to note is, it's been an unusual stretch for some time. And so, again, predicting exact ramp behavior is always a little bit tricky. As you know, years ago it was very, very systematic, and today it's a little bit more one-offs. But I think that January typically is a bigger month, but I think we have to recognize that things are little bit different and maybe not as predictable in terms of exactly when things occur as they might've been five years ago?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. And to answer your other question around generics and being able to execute on that, I think that just depends very differently on how you go to market, the size of that customer, whether it even deserves a repricing, and then how you go about that, how your relationships are with the manufacturer. So I think that can vary drastically and dramatically between different players in the marketplace. I know we feel really good about when we combined how quickly we executed, but I'm not sure I can say that anybody else would go faster or slower than us.","Operator","The final question will come from Greg Bolan with Avondale Partners.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. And I hate to ask this at the very end of the call, George, but \u2013 and by the way I very much enjoyed the white paper on DIRs and that just was issued, what, last month? But from the standpoint of your ability to defend or protect end of tenant pharmacies and obviously maintain, maybe even gain, market share in the independent pharmacy space as it relates to DIRs. Where do you guys sit in the spectrum? Because it does feel like this is obviously \u2013 these revelations that we're starting to see on DIRs. I mean it's a very painful experience for your Pharmacy customers. And I just wanted to kind of see how you guys could possibly or how you are potentially defending them, protecting them, when they are obviously experiencing these pretty massive decremental margins 90, 120 days after the fact.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","So there are two parts to this, so let me answer the second part first. I'm not sure there's a company more focused on the community pharmacy and pharmacy industry, in general. We believe that they're going to be a key player. As healthcare continues to evolve, we have shortages of primary care physicians. We think pharmacists will and should play a more active role.","We're doing an incredible amount of work through Jon Giacomin's organization to make sure that we're close to them and providing all of the solutions and tools that can help them compete in the market, and actually help them provide cognitive care which we think is very important.","Going back to your first point, I might want to make an important note about this because we've gotten a few questions. We are a player in oncology and, as such, we've been a member of Community Oncology Alliance. And as a member of that, we have funded research. But you specifically referred to a particular project. We do not direct the researchers' \u2013 the subjects. So it's just important for me to comment on that. So we've had questions about that paper. We didn't specifically fund a paper on this. We are basically part of an alliance, and that group does research.","But the summary of what I'm describing is our work around community pharmacy and around pharmacy in general, is very much a part of what we do.

[Operator Instructions].","As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional questions.","I will now turn the call over to Mike.","Michael Kaufmann","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. Today I'll begin with some comments on our third quarter of fiscal 2019 and then I'll discuss our progress on a number of fronts to drive future growth. Overall, for the third quarter, revenue was up 5%, and operating results were in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.59, up 14% from the prior year.","Based on the year-to-date performance and our current expectations for Q4, we are raising the bottom end of our EPS guidance to a new range of $5.02 to $5.17. As I reflect on the quarter, we made progress in several areas, including our strategic initiatives, and the team is focused on delivering full year expectations as we navigate the current health care environment. As I have recently spent time with our upstream and downstream customers, I am hearing from both that what we do and how we do it are as important today as they have ever been. We have scaled businesses that are important to our customers' success as they look for the most efficient ways to deliver high-quality care to patients.","Our commitment to innovation and strong customer focus were keys to recent pharma renewals. Most notably, we've extended our distribution agreement with CVS Health for 4 years beginning July 1. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with CVS Health to further enhance our relationship with them. In that regard, we continue to work with all of our customers across our portfolio of business as they balance their commitment to deliver high-quality care with the need for efficiency. For example, retail independent pharmacy customers have navigated years of change in their pharmacies, and we've been right by their side helping them succeed in learning in the process. We are advancing solutions that help them address reimbursement, manage their inventory and place the right focus on the front of store. In addition, through our connected care platforms, we offer pharmacies' medication therapy management services and the ability to communicate with patients to help them follow their prescribed course of care. We continue to develop these types of strategic capabilities as they enable our customers to navigate the evolving pharmacy landscape where improving both patient care and the linkage among providers, payers, pharmacies and patients remains critical.","In our generics program, we are seeing market dynamics and program performance consistent with prior quarters. We continue to invest in data and analytics and allocate significant time to improving the overall performance of our generics program, which is key for long-term growth in the Pharmaceutical segment. Our commitment to innovations, our customers and their success is also bearing fruit across the balance of the Pharmaceutical segment where we are seeing strong positive contributions to earnings from both specialty and nuclear.","Turning to Medical. While we have made significant strides, we are disappointed with the segment performance this quarter. We would like to see quicker progress on several initiatives including our global cost structure. We continue to actively evaluate how we can accelerate our progress here while balancing our commitment to maintain service levels and deliver an outstanding customer experience. We are moving with a sense of urgency to address the opportunities for improvement we've identified in the Medical segment. Importantly, the Patient Recovery primary TSA exits are now complete, leaving just a few minor exits in action.","At Cordis, the stabilization program remains on track. We continue to see improving service levels and fill rates, lower back orders and increased cost discipline. Cardinal Health at Home and our Services businesses continue to flourish. Services continues to expand its niche, providing value-added technology and logistics support to our partners while the at-Home business is capitalizing on a number of larger health care trends.","Let me briefly touch on our strategic priorities. As I had shared already this morning, we are making progress in our Pharma segment, Cordis and Patient Recovery. The team has also made excellent strides on our overall cost structure, and we are already realizing the benefit in our results. Regarding capital deployment. I would note that we continue to execute a very disciplined and thoughtful strategy to fund the future growth of the business, return cash to shareholders and maintain our healthy balance sheet, and Jorge will share the details.","Altogether, we remain highly focused on how we can deliver the greatest value and be nimble in the ever-changing health care environment so that we can respond to our customers' challenges. We know that our success begins with an emphasis on the longer-term, a balanced thoughtful approach to how we prioritize and deploy capital and discipline in our cost structure. The team is focused on executing across both our newer and existing businesses, investing in what makes us stronger and continuing our essential role in the health care system. The value we provide to customers and suppliers is as strong today as it has ever been. I want to thank our entire team for the work they are doing. We look forward to continuing to deliver for our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve.","With that, let me turn it over to Jorge.","Jorge Gomez","Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start with a quick overview of the quarter. We made operational and commercial progress in both segments to strengthen our relationships with our strategic partners and benefited from a few tax items that drove our effective tax rate below typical levels. This morning, I will focus on our Q3 performance, our view of the current fiscal year and updates on a few of our strategic initiatives.","Our Q3 total operating results, which exclude tax, were in line with the expectations we had for this period when we updated guidance last quarter. Total company revenue was strong again, increasing 5% versus last year to $35.2 billion. Total company gross margin was down 8% from last year to about $1.8 billion. Operating earnings were $667 million. As Mike said, our EPS for the quarter was $1.59, a 14% increase versus last year. This increase was driven by lower tax rate and by prudent balance sheet actions which resulted in fewer shares outstanding and lower interest expense.","Our Q3 effective tax rate was lower than expected, at 21.6%, driven by net favorable discrete tax items of $0.06. The largest discrete item was a True-Up related to the Patient Recovery acquisition. In the quarter, we saw a 3% improvement in SG&A due to divestitures and the ongoing benefit from our cost optimization efforts which I'll discuss when I cover strategic initiatives.","Interest and other expenses improved 24% versus prior year to about $62 million. It was driven by the change in the value of our deferred compensation plan, which as I explained previously, is fully offset above the line in corporate expenses and had no impact on the net income or EPS line. Average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 299 million, about 16 million fewer shares than last year.","We generated very strong operating cash flow of $1.5 billion in Q3, which includes a large benefit from the timing of inventory purchases. Our year-to-date operating cash flow is $2.2 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.4 billion, with about $800 million held outside the U.S.","Now I'll turn to segment results, starting with the Pharma segment. Sales to Pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution customers were strong in the quarter, driving segment revenue growth of 6% to $31.4 billion. Although segment profit of $536 million was lower than last year, it was ahead of our expectations from a quarter ago. The 10% decrease versus last year reflects the negative impact from generics program performance, prior customer renewals and opioid litigation expenses. These headwinds were partially offset by Specialty, which again delivered very strong top and bottom line growth. Of note, key customers continue to reward Cardinal Health with a troth of long-lasting partnerships. The renewal of CVS Health validates both our strong value proposition and our reputation as a trusted and effective long-term partner.","Turning to Medical. Segment revenue for Q3 was down slightly to $3.9 billion driven by previously discussed divestitures, offset by growth from existing customers. Excluding divestitures and FX, revenue was up low-single digits. Segment profit decreased 22% to $155 million driven by the performance of Cardinal Health Brand products. Market dynamics in our product businesses as well as incremental supply chain costs contributed to this lower-than-expected performance. In response to these challenges, we are moving forward with the work that I mentioned last quarter to drive efficiencies across the Medical segment through refining our commercial, operational and data capabilities. We currently have teams deployed to support each of these pillars of work through activities including global product and geography rationalization, supply chain optimization and selling strategies.","Now let me share a few updates on some specific business areas. What we refer to internally as a Medical Solution businesses, which includes patient recovery and our legacy Cardinal Health brand products, is experiencing challenges relative to market dynamics and supply chain integration activities. However, the team is actively engaged in multiple initiatives to drive greater operational efficiency and to address the below-target service levels experienced over the last few months. As a result of this work, we are seeing improvement in service level trends, particularly in the U.S., where the levels are reaching 6-month high. At the same time, all areas of our Medical businesses are showing strong growth. We see a strength in our strategic accounts which are growing above market rates.","Also, Cardinal Health at-Home had another terrific quarter. The customer pipeline for this business is healthy, and our cost management was extremely effective, producing another quarter of double-digit growth. National brand distribution had a strong performance as did its services which delivered above-market growth in Q3.","At Cordis, we are seeing top line growth in several geographies, most notably in the U.S., Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific. As we move forward with our stabilization plan, we are seeing improvement in fill rates and backorders, with Q3 reflecting the lowest backorder levels we have seen in 18 months. Also, service levels are improving due to our work on SKU rationalization, and additional technologies will help us better manage both inventory and sales productivity.","We also continue to evaluate product mix and partnership agreements. Our key challenge remains our cost structure, primarily outside the U.S, which we are actively working to address.","Turning to our full year outlook for fiscal '19. Based on our most current expectations for our effective tax rate and operating performance in both segments, we are raising the lower end of our EPS guidance from $4.97 to $5.02. Our updated range for the year is $5.02 to $5.17.","We are making the following changes to our assumptions for the full year. For the segment assumptions, due to the dynamic that to continue to experience in Medical, we now expect segment profit to be down low to mid-single digit. For our corporate assumptions, we now expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This update reflects a few favorable discrete tax items, including the impact of tax reforms, the legal entity restructuring work we completed earlier this year and the tax true-up related to Patient Recovery that I mentioned before.","Also, we now anticipate our interests and other expenses as well as capital expenditures for the year to be lower. We expect interest and other expenses in the range of $330 million to $350 million. The new range for capital expenditures is $310 million to $340 million. I'll now provide an update on some of our strategic initiatives. First, regarding our cost optimization efforts. We will exceed our initial commitments of $100 million in annualized savings by the end of fiscal '19 and the aggregate $200 million by the end of fiscal '20. We will provide more precise numbers when we finish the year.","To deliver these savings we have developed a compressive data-driven approach that extends beyond budgeting and is supported by an organized program structure. Leaders across company are accountable for initiatives that we are rigorously identifying, operationalizing and tracking to support these commitments, and all of this work is enabled by a more agile, forward-thinking mindset that we are embedding at every level of the enterprise. This broad approach is standing across strategy, tactics and culture will enable value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees. We said previously that we will reinvest some of these savings we generate from these work back into the enterprise. For these investments, we are focused on opportunities to rapidly implement and enable digital technologies with the goal of streamlining our processes, creating greater efficiencies and optimizing our data capabilities. We will share updates as specific initiatives or operationalize. ","Second, with respect to capital, we have generated strong cash flow and remained very disciplined in our approach to capital deployment. Our financial flexibility allows us to efficiently fund both current operations and investment opportunities for long-term growth. As part of this disciplined approach, we plan to use cash on hand to repay $1 billion of debt that matures next month. Additionally, we maintained a significant level of scrutiny and selectivity regarding all allocations such as capital expenditures and acquisitions with a focus on high thresholds for strategic fit, ability to execute and return metrics.","Overall, as I look back on the quarter and year-to-date, while internal and external dynamics continue to evolve, we continue to be resilient and agile. We remain thoroughly focused on delivering our commitments as we finish the year.","With that, I'd like to open the line and invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Steve Valiquette from Barclays.","Jonathan Young","This is Jonathan Young on for Steve today. Just going to CVS renewal. Were there any changes in the contract? Or anything that we should consider given that you guys got the renewal?","Michael Kaufmann","Thanks for the question, John. This is -- first of all, we're really excited and pleased to extend our partnership with CVS. As you know, they've been a long-term customer of ours. Well, I can tell you that the contract is for a 4-year period. Actually, the new pricing goes into effect July 1. And other than that, it's same business and same typical structure that we've had in the past. Nothing that I would call out differently.","Jonathan Young","Okay, great. And then just turning to the Medical business. I guess kind of what were the challenges that you're kind of seeing in the business related to supply chain activities, et cetera?","Jorge Gomez","Let me take that question. Good morning. Yes. We feel that we had a difficult quarter in Medical in Q3. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the largest driver in the quarter was the performance of our Cardinal brand products. Within that, I think there are 2 key buckets: the first one is just the normal market dynamics that we normally overcome through actions around mix and commercial efficiency and volume. This time and in this quarter, we were not able to offset those dynamics because there were additional challenges from a supply chain cost integration work that resulted in backorders and higher expenses as we were trying to meet on commitments to our customers. Those are kind of 2 main things. This is what we're doing about that. ","We clearly have deployed a number of teams to work on the short-term issues around operational efficiency, below-target service levels, and we are seeing improvements in that. Our service levels and backorder trends towards the end of the quarter were improving. And in fact, in the U.S., our service levels are reaching now a 6-month high. But from a long-term perspective, we have -- I mentioned this in my remarks as well, we are working on global product and geography rationalization to simplify our business, we are trying to optimize our supply chain, and we are making some good strides on that. And working in our selling strategies as well. Obviously, all of these actions have different time lines, and some of them are being executed very quickly. And as I said before, we're seeing improvements. All initiatives will take a little bit longer. Overall, we're actually encouraged with the underlying demand of this business, and we have a very strong conviction about the value proposition we're bringing to our customers every single day.","Operator","I'm going to move to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","I just want to follow back up as we think about the Cardinal Health Brand products on 2 levels. Just one, when you talk, Jorge, about the supply chain cost, is that actually commodity cost or is it the actual process that you just described at the last question? And then Mike, can you talk about the current competitive landscape? It appears that just in the peer U.S. distribution you have a competitor that's really struggling in the marketplace. I would have anticipated that, that would have created opportunities for someone with a strong balance sheet like Cardinal to continue to gain from market share. So just some thoughts around the competitive landscape would be helpful.","Michael Kaufmann","Great. I'll let Jorge start, and then I'll answer your question.","Jorge Gomez","Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. The cost challenges, I guess, expand over all of the areas of the P&L. So from a manufacturing perspective, we have, as you indicated -- commodities is actually one of a headwind and there are other elements within cost that are creating some short-term challenges. And then the overall supply chain as we finish integration work and as we continue to improve our network, especially outside the U.S., we have experienced a higher cost, which essentially stems from the fact that we want to make sure that we balance cost with servicing our customers at the best possible level. So all of those areas of the P&L from a cost perspective impacted the segment this quarter.","Michael Kaufmann","And as far as the competitive environment in the Medical side, we continue to see a competitive environment, no differently than we really have in the past. I, obviously, don't want to comment on any specific competitor, but I think the dynamics are similar than they have been in past. We feel really good about our value proposition. And we really want to make sure that we're focused on winning and retaining the customers that appreciate our value proposition, which is being both a strong distribution medical business and a products company that people see as someone that can bring them equal to or better products at lower cost.","Lisa Gill","Just so I understand all the comments around this. As we think about this going into next year, Mike, I mean, do you feel like you can really get your arms around these costs continue to win customers based on what you just talked about? Or do you think that this is kind of a multiyear challenge as we think about it and I'll stop there?","Michael Kaufmann","Thanks, Lisa. I think Jorge -- from what he said, I think, emphasizes a few things. First of all, I think there are some things that were very fixable in a short-term period, and we put the people on that and we've made very good solid progress. Some of the other things, for instance, evaluating our global manufacturing footprint, looking at our U.S. distribution footprint. We believe there's areas for opportunity to streamline and maximize the efficiency in both our manufacturing and distribution footprints as well as the overall supply chain. Those aren't going to happen overnight. Those are going to take time as we work through those because ultimately, as much as we'd like to go faster, for us, the most important thing is keeping our eye on our customers and we don't want to do anything that would disrupt the overall demand for the products, which we continue to see strong, and we still believe in our value proposition. So it's truly balancing what we know our opportunities and our footprint making sure that we don't let any customers down.","Operator","We'll now move to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Thanks for the question. I guess just to stick there with Medical, Mike, want to make sure I understand it does seem like a fairly dramatic shift from last quarter's update. So does this boil down to really just some fulfillment issues that created higher cost, which I would imagine obviously would be within your control to fix? Or is it that plus a bigger issue that you're seeing as far as the macro backdrop in that sector? I know, Jorge, you mentioned demand still felt really good for the lines of business here. So just really want to make sure I understand what shifted from last quarter to this quarter? And was it really more just around some fulfillment miscues and costs that obviously would be associated with taking that?","Michael Kaufmann","Yes, and thanks for the follow-up. Totally get the question. And it obviously was a significant change on our assumption for this business, so very fair observation. I would say first of all, we've said several different times that when you exit TSA they can sometimes be lumpy. I would say the exits that we've had recently have been little bit more lumpier than we would have expected, and some of those created some service level -- unexpected service level challenges Jorge mentioned in our Q3 and we're still working through those as quickly as possible, but still little bit of work to do on that. And as Jorge mentioned, we are seeing some challenges in our cost structure, some of it related to commodities and FX, some of it related to some cost initiatives that we hope to get to quicker than we had to slow down on it in order to make sure we don't have service level disruptions. Jorge, would you add anything?","Jorge Gomez","Just, Bob, to be clear, the change in expectations in the segment was mostly driven by volume issues related to our own internal challenges in terms of bill rates, and we had backorders throughout the quarter. So as I indicated from a demand perspective, we are seeing -- we haven't seen any major change -- any changes that since last time we talked about Medical. So it's mostly related to volume issues within our business.","Robert Jones","That's really helpful. I guess just one follow-up if we could shift over to Pharma. You guys mentioned obviously good performance in the quarter, but you did mention one of the negatives being the generic performance, the performance of the generic program. Could you maybe just elaborate on what exactly you're seeing there? I'm imagining is more in the sell side but just the dynamics that led that to be a bit of a negative in the quarter would be helpful to better understand.","Michael Kaufmann","Yes. In generics, we really look at all of the factors, which to us, are the inflation, deflation rates, launches, penetration, the ability of Red Oak to take out cost. And when we look at combining all of those together, we still continue to see our generics program to be a significant headwind for us both in Q3 and for the entire year. So I wouldn't necessarily say that we've seen any one of those components change dramatically within those various components of the program, just that it continues to be consistent with prior quarters versus seeing some of the improvement we would obviously like to see.","Operator","Eric Percher with Nephron Research.","Eric Percher","Jorge, could you say that you had to scale back your ambitions for cost reduction in part because of what was occurring in the Medical business this quarter?","Jorge Gomez","No. Actually, our cost initiatives are tracking ahead of our internal plan. What happened this quarter is that some of those savings, we actually had to redirect and reinvest to try to fix up some of the short-term challenges that we're seeing in Medical, so that's why weren't seeing the entire benefit of cost savings dropping to the bottom line because we have been -- we have used those to cover some of the short-term challenges. But the initiatives are very much on track. And in fact, every quarter, we are gaining more confidence in those targets, and we will exceed the target for this year.","Eric Percher","Okay, got it. Now and then on CapEx. I know you've reduced your expectation for the year and that had been running low in the first half. But seems to normalize this quarter. Can you give a little bit of color on your expectations there?","Jorge Gomez","Yes. I think really nothing has changed fundamentally, but as we indicated we have been extremely disciplined and strict about return metrics and thresholds for investment. And then when you add that to bandwidth and the thing that we're trying to take care of in the short term, we believe that the new amount that we are guided to is a reasonable fluid amount for this year.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.","Stephen Baxter","I wanted to come back to Medical again, more of a big picture question. So if we look at the revised EBIT outlook for the segment, it looks like it's somewhere around $640 million. And based on your previous guidance for Patient Recovery, I would estimate that that's contributing somewhere around near $450 million of EBIT? So If you look at the legacy medical EBIT for Cardinal, it would be something less than $200 million. It would be helpful to us if you could rank the decline in terms of drivers over the past 2 years? It feels like the issue has shifted slightly from quarter-to-quarter, and I think it will be really helpful to have sort of the cumulative sense of what's happening in the business over the past couple of years.","Jorge Gomez","Yes. Let me take the question. The -- I'd say we've been very transparent about the performance of the Cardinal brand products this quarter and the issues we are facing with respect to volume in that part of the business. Overall, the biggest parts -- the business unit within the segment, they are performing not too far from where we thought they would be, but certainly, we have some short-term challenges that we are facing. We have some businesses within the core legacy businesses, if you will, that are performing very well. As I Indicated before we have at-Home have services doing really well. And Patient Recovery -- although -- Patient Recovery were still on track to meet our operation goal that we set for this year. It is probably the projections we have now or probably lower than what we thought due to the volume challenges, but we are on track to meet the accretion goal that we have for fiscal '19.","Stephen Baxter","Just a quick follow-up. Is it possible to comment on what revenue trends look like sort of ex-Patient Recovery?","Jorge Gomez","The underlying revenue trends in the segment, as I indicated, when you exclude dispositions and FX, the business is tracking pretty much in line with the market and with the expectation, so no major changes there.","Operator","We'll hear from David Larson with Leerink.","David Larsen","Can you talk a little more about the spread we're seeing on the generic side of the house. One of your peers is obviously talking about Pharma operating income growth over the next year, but from your tone or from your comments it sounds like you're not necessarily seeing an improvement on the generic side. What's the difference in your view? What do you think the difference could be?","Michael Kaufmann","Yes. It's hard to comment on other people's views of generics based on the fact that we all have different mixes and we may defining and putting different things in various buckets, but I would tell you that we do see it as more consistent with the prior quarters. And again, would not say that we have noticed any one factor. As you know, we've said that's beginning in the year that we expected that all those components to be a net headwind for us, and it has been a net headwind for us for the year, it has been the most significant one. And other than so far what we're seeing through three quarters is consistent market dynamics, it's really hard for me to comment on ours compared to someone else.","David Larsen","Okay. And when you use the term consistent, like is your spread expanding or is it contracting? Is it a consistent rate of contraction in the spread? Any more thoughts there would be helpful, Mike.","Michael Kaufmann","Yes. I guess when we're talking about consistent, what we're talking about is that when we take a look at deflation rates, we look at the value that we're going to get from launches, et cetera. Those are basically tracking where we expected. The deflation rate is relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter. And so we -- for us, it's -- again, it's a net headwind, and so we're continuing to see consistent net headwind quarter-to-quarter not necessarily at this point in time through 3 quarters seeing that headwind reducing.","Operator","We'll now hear from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","So not to keep going back to Medical, but as we look and think about your guidance and how it plays through the fiscal fourth quarter, would you consider that a run rate as we move into 2020, is there anything in there that's sort of onetime-ish? Or should we think about this as the base of which X any seasonality in that business that we should be thinking about growing off of moving forward?","Jorge Gomez","Good morning, Kevin. Thanks for the question. As Mike indicated before, at this point, it's too early for us to start talking about trends going into next year. But obviously, we have taken down the guidance for the rest of the year. It reflects what the challenges that I discussed before that we are seeing. And we had a good first half. The second half of the year is going to be relatively consistent in terms of the challenges. And that's why we've taken the guidance for Medical for Q4. I think it's too early to start talking about the things that we're seeing going into fiscal '20.","Kevin Caliendo","Okay. That's fair. And just on the CVS renewal. You said everything was the same in terms of the business structure, pricing starts July 1. Just a couple of questions around the pricing. Was it -- there's obviously an incremental step-down in the renewal contract, we understand that. Was the incremental step-down typical with most renewals that you do? And then secondly, this contract through 2023 also incorporate your relationship with Red Oak? Or is it simply on the distribution side?","Michael Kaufmann","Yes, this contract was strictly on the distribution side. Our Red Oak agreement still has 5 years left on that agreement. The first 5 years will expire here at the end of roughly June 30, and then we have another 5 years left on that, so there's no current need to address that contract. Although things continue to go really well with Red Oak. Love the team and love the partnership that we've had with CVS on that. As far as deal goes, yes, it is -- the new pricing does go in effect July 1 for us. And I would say that it was -- there was nothing about it that I would say was different than what we would expect in the marketplace for customers of this size, in importance and how they're growing. And we feel that it's a fair and appropriate renewal, and are excited to have the business for 4 more years.","Operator","We'll hear from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.","Michael Cherny","Jorge, just to clarify. You just talked about it's a little early at this point to start giving color, clarity on fiscal '20. A, is that for Medical versus the whole business? And then I guess b, when you think about what's changed this year versus previous 3Qs when you've had some visibility and color into the next year, I guess what changed your view on how you expect -- or why you decided to not give any color heading into next year?","Jorge Gomez","Good morning, Michael. Thanks for the question. This is -- we normally don't provide any guidance into next year at the end of Q3. Our typical cadence for providing color into the next fiscal year is during our August call, so we are not changing that. This is just not consistent with our typical practices. And my comments in terms of not giving color about Medical, it applies to the entire corporation and all the numbers across the enterprise.","Michael Cherny","Okay, yes, I know you don't give guidance. Usually give some color on here are some headwinds that we expect to persist, here are some tailwinds that people are thinking of I guess at this point, we'll just wait until August to hear on some of those.","Michael Kaufmann","Yes. I think just some quick comment on that. Remember last year, there was -- we had made earlier comment around 5 60 in the marketplace and then we had decided that it would be -- because of that, we gave a little bit around that. Last year it was different, but that is not our typical and it's not something that we would typically do. We want to stay disciplined to being around our August earnings time.","Operator","We'll hear from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Bryan Ross","This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. When you look when you look at the generic landscape, across the buy side and sell side in terms of what you're seeing now versus historical norms, I guess what inning do you think that you're inning getting back to that to normalized generic pricing environment? And are expecting to get back to that over the next year? Or do you think that's further off than that?","Michael Kaufmann","Thanks for the question. It's really hard to say. And again, that would be really more around giving guidance, and we just want to stay away from that. For us it's just -- again, just want to keep emphasizing that it continues to be a significant headwind for us in FY '19 for us. And the market dynamics across our various components have remained consistent, but we'll give some more color to your question in August around not only our results for our Q4 but what our thoughts are obviously around that for our fiscal '20.","Bryan Ross","Got it. And then just a follow-up on the 4Q guidance. Relating last year, somewhat of an easier comp and factoring in cost optimization and some of the actions you're taking in Medical, what are the puts and takes that give you the confidence in the year-over-year ramp implied by the fiscal year guidance?","Jorge Gomez","You're talking about the Medical segment or...","Bryan Ross","No. Overall just the 4Q in respect to the -- for the full fiscal year guidance?","Michael Kaufmann","I guess it's a couple different components. I know Jorge went through the detail here, but we've got, as you said -- as he said, he's got the ETR benefit we've had so far this year. Now we expect it to be higher in Q4. And we've changed our Medical guidance for the year, so we would obviously have taken down what we expect our Medical segment earnings to be. And then we've mentioned some other opportunities like the Pharma business doing -- obviously, it's going to offset some of that are expense initiatives. So think it just a total of all those when you look at it. We feel like our new guidance is the best indication of where we think will finish for the year.","Operator","Next question will come from John Ransom with Raymond James.","John Ransom","We can look at the generic marketplace just with a handful of public companies and we can look at pricing data, but the analysis sort of stops there. I'm curious, if you were to compare today to say couple of years ago and think about your top 50, 100 drugs, do you see a material decline in the number of suppliers for, say, a generic Lipitor or some of the larger products? Because what we have seen with big public companies is they appear to be abandoning mid-tier products and of course, the public drug stores chains are complaining of lack of generic deflations. So indiscernible] would be that we just have fewer suppliers and I'm just kind of curious to your perspective on that?","Michael Kaufmann","Yes. It's an interesting question. I would say that - I would not say that overall, that we're seeing less generic suppliers. There's clearly been a lot of public discussion around some of the larger ones rationalizing their supply chain in their portfolio of products. But at the same time, we're seeing the FDA approve generic drugs at a record pace, we're still seeing suppliers from outside the United States come in both on newer drugs as well as opportunities on the old -- some of the older drugs. And most importantly, whether there's 5 or 10 players, probably doesn't make as much of a difference for us because as long as there is certain amount of competition we're going to be able to go get the cost that we need to from a Red Oak perspective and when we've seen it start to get to maybe fewer suppliers on certain specific items than we wanted, Red Oak has done a nice job of working with companies to either get them back in supply or find ways to get agreements to continue to get the cost. So I wouldn't say that I've seen a material difference in the net overall number of suppliers on items, although you can always pick 1 or 2 items where you might see significant changes.","John Ransom","So if that's true, it's not entirely clear, at least to me, where the pressure will be coming from. And certainly you would say there's a lot of stress in the retail channel so you're having to give a little more price concessions downstream because your retail customers need every bit of margin they can find? Or is there something else that we're missing?","Michael Kaufmann","So I think that what we've said in the past is that when you look at all of the components, when you take a generic deflation, which we at Cardinal define as sell-side deflation, and you net it against launches, penetration and the ability for Red Oak to go reduce cost on existing items, the net of all that is a net headwind for us for this year and has been for the quarter, and for the year so far. So it's kind of exactly what you're saying is that we're seeing more pressure on the sell side, and we are able to offset that with launches, penetration and cost decreases, and we're seeing margin shrink.","Operator","And that will come from Charles -- excuse me, Glenn Santangelo from Guggenheim Securities.","Glen Santangelo","Mike, just to maybe follow-up on the Pharmaceutical segment for a moment. It looks like the headwind that you experienced in 3Q was smaller than what you did in their first and second quarter so the operating profit was probably better than most people on this call were looking for. And so if we hear you clearly, it doesn't sound like it came from the generics program at all. So was there something else within the Pharmaceutical segment that maybe performed a little bit better than what you or we all would have thought?","Michael Kaufmann","Well, remember Q3 is the quarter that is always going to be the quarter that has seasonality and the most seasonality and related to brand price increases in the January time frame. And so while those came in roughly about where we expected, I would say for us, the quarter came in about where we expected it to be in Pharmaceutical. So I wouldn't call out any individual item being significantly better or worse than we actually anticipated for the quarter.","Glen Santangelo","And then maybe just a follow-up on that. I was just can curious how you may be the conversations are trending with the manufacturers given all the scrutiny around rebates and the HHS proposal and all of that. Are there any sort of initial what-if type acquisitions or is it just sort of business as usual?","Michael Kaufmann","Thanks, that's a good question. I would say --it appears what we're hearing from manufacturer. I think we continue to have very open and transparent conversations with manufacturers. We have been -- as contracts expire, we continue to work through the wording to make sure that we are protecting ourselves in the case of sudden changes in WAC prices that might potentially alter our dollar earnings from those manufacturers. The conversations with manufacturers around the fact that if there were any changes around that, we would need to work together because we still need to earn the dollars that we deserve based on the value of the services we provide. And so you take that with constantly talking to them about ways to help them reduce their cost, improve their service levels, provide other services. I would say conversations with manufacturers continue to be fruitful, positive and very transparent about all the various things that we're seeing out there that could impact both of us.","Operator","And we'll hear from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee","Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on Medical. Just -- and I think there was a sterilization plan in February and some articles around that, I think it affected some of the manufacturers. And it sounds like maybe affected you. How much of that is maybe if, is in this when you talk about sort of the internal challenges on fill rates? And Jorge, you talked about still on track in terms of the accretion for the deal in '19. Does that mean when you guys gave sort of the accretion targets for Patient Recovery, you kind of gave numbers not only for '19 but also for fiscal '20. Are the fiscal 20 sort of number still intact here from your mind understanding that we reinvested some of those in the near-term? And then also the $150 million synergy target that you initially laid out.","Michael Kaufmann","Yes. I'll take the first part on the issue related to ethylene oxide is what I'm assuming you're talking about there, and then I'll let Jorge talk about accretion part. As far as the ethylene oxide issue, that wouldn't really have had an incredibly minor impact on us for the quarter. Now that being said, it's something we have our eye on. We think it's important. It's used widely across the entire industry to sterilize products, so it's something that is -- would impact everyone in the industry including our competitors and manufacturers. So it's important to the industry on that but for the quarter it was immaterial. And like I said, at this point in time we continue to look at alternatives and make sure that we're prepared in case there are any other changes related to that.","Jorge Gomez","Charles, your question about Patient Recovery. So I said before that we are on target this year. We are -- for the disruptions that we experienced in the last quarter or so, we are below what we thought we were going to achieve this year from a -- in terms of the growth from Patient Recovery, but again within the accretion targets. Similar to any other parts of the business at this point we don't want to get into any trends going into '20. We will do that in August, but as of now this is how this quarter is trending. Within the fiscal '19, we are trending below what we thought we would achieve with Patient Recovery this year.","Charles Rhyee","But at that time, you did give us fiscal '20 as well. I mean can we think understanding that this year, we're trending below what you initially expected, is it fair to think or are we still thinking from a sequential basis that you would expect things to continue to improve overall? And then just Mike, just to clarify what you are talking about, when you talk about ethylene oxide, that's the stereogenic plant that we're talking about?","Michael Kaufmann","That's right. That's the sterilization method that, that plant uses. There are several different types of sterilization methods but that is what that plant is using that I was referring to.","Jorge Gomez","And Charles going back to your question about Patient Recovery and going into the future. Obviously, the business case was designed and our expectations continue to be that we will improve the results -- the performance of this business over time especially as the synergies kick in. The synergies are expected to accrue over a few years. And when we think about those synergies at this point right now during this fiscal year we are on track with that trajectory.","Operator","We'll hear from Ross Muken with Evercore.","Ross Muken","Guys, on the Medical side, is there any incremental thought on sort of the portfolio mix? And maybe as you thought about sort of the longer-term strategy, given some of the volatility you've seen in some of the units and maybe changes in the end market, whether or not sort of you're sort in all the right markets? And secondarily, is there anything else you see on the outside that would be sort of synergistic with it in terms of pivoting in a direction where maybe you've had more success versus some of the areas where pricing and other elements have been more challenging?","Michael Kaufmann","Thanks, Ross. I think a couple of things. I do think that when we look at our overall strategy of Medical being really leveraging our historical distribution routes, we having a broad and well-known product portfolio, it's really still the right strategy and important to us. We think that leveraging those 2, like I said, is the right thing and important. We still have work to do, as we've said, around how we continue to modify our comp structure and the way we go to market to drive that. So as we said, we're making the progress we want, but that takes time to change that, and we're continuing to work through that. So from that standpoint, we still feel very good about that. And so there's always opportunities to look at individual products to see if you -- if we need to add or delete from the portfolio. But in general, we feel really good about our portfolio and the overall strategy. Jorge, would you add anything to that?","Jorge Gomez","Yes. Ross, just to one of your specific points about certain market and being in the right place, as we indicated a couple of times in the past and even today, part of the work we're doing is looking at our entire global portfolio, looking at geography rationalization opportunities. A few -- a couple of quarters ago, we talked about a few small geographies that we exited, and that is an ongoing work. We will always look at opportunities to improve our footprint. And in some cases, potentially add and in many other cases, exit in geographies and certain product lines in certain places. So that is all part of the ongoing strategic work that John and team are doing.","Ross Muken","And maybe just on the corporate side. I mean I -- maybe I missed it, but I don't remember anything on opioid travel-related expenses, it already appears yesterday. All that obviously a big step up for them into next year. I guess where are you in terms of that headwind? And how are you thinking about that in the context maybe of some the cost takeouts that you're doing hopefully offsetting maybe some of that incremental pressure?","Jorge Gomez","Yes. So this year, as you may recall, the number that we have included in our Pharmaceutical segment, which by the way we include all the opioid litigation expenses in Pharmaceutical, those are tracking in line with the guidance we provided a couple of quarters ago. So we are probably -- at some point, we said it was like about $80 million including some factories in New York that we ended up unwinding. So we're probably $70 million area plus or take -- plus or minus a few million dollars. And so that is a major headwind for us this year. And obviously, we work really hard to make sure that we offset that with all cost-savings initiatives, but it's trending in line with what we were expecting for this year.","Operator","And that last question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Rivka Goldwasser","So two questions here. First of all, if you think about the Pharma segment and we you think about what guidance implies for fourth quarter, it seems that there is still a fairly wide range in your expectations from operating income. And when we look at the numbers, it seems that at high end, you expect operating income to potentially be up year-over-year versus a scenario where operating income is still down. So can you just help us better understand what are the swing factors into fourth quarter? Are you expecting generic to do better? Is there anything that you see that would drive that variability?","Jorge Gomez","Yes. Ricky, this is Jorge. The drivers for the fourth quarter are the same drivers that we have experienced throughout the year. So obviously, what happens with our generics programs is an important factor. The Specialty business has been trending above expectations for us throughout the year, has done really, really well, and that is a swing factor as well. I think the type of savings we are able to achieve with our programs -- internal programs, that is another important factor. So there is nothing new that I could point to that is driving the range that you're talking about for Q4.","Rivka Goldwasser","Okay. And then when we think about the specialty, because you highlight that -- and you highlight Specialty, strong growth in Specialty now helping you for a few quarters, can you just give us some more -- some context on what's driving Specialty growth. Is it pricing? Is it market share gains, new products?","Michael Kaufmann","For the most part, I think the big driver in Specialty is really -- the overall market growth is a big component of it. I mean obviously, we feel very good about our offering and how we our competing in the marketplace and our discipline around cost structure are -- also our upstream services business and continues to grow but I think the biggest factor in Specialty really is strong market growth that we're able to take advantage of.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your CEO, Mike Kaufmann, for any closing remarks.","Michael Kaufmann","Yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As you can see we continue to execute our plans and position Cardinal for future growth, and we really look forward to reporting on our progress with you over the next several months and then particularly, August when we talk about our FY '20.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sally Curley. Please go ahead.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Ronald, and welcome to Cardinal Health's fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2016 earnings call today. We have a lot to get through this morning, including our fiscal 2017 outlook. And we also recognize that most of you have a very full earnings reporting day today, which is why we thought it might be helpful to move our call a little earlier this morning.

We hope to see many of you at an upcoming event.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our fourth quarter and end of the year call.","Healthcare is at an inflection point. The demands of an aging population, the challenges of public health, and continued policy debates around cost, quality, and access have significant implications for economies around the globe and families close to home that require adaptive and meaningful action from our industry. The simple truth is we're experiencing the most dynamic and rapid change in the history of healthcare.","At Cardinal Health, we are acutely aware of the need to adapt, innovate, and lead. Our teams worked hard this past year integrating new product teams, building and acquiring additional capabilities, and finding more efficient and effective ways to deliver real value while never losing sight of the ultimate goal, serving patients and their families.","This was also a period in which I participated in the healthcare system in a very personal way. I lost both of my parents in these last 15 months. I had the opportunity to witness the technical skill, the dedication, and the compassion of caregivers, from physicians to hospice workers, as well as the extraordinary power of science. I also had the opportunity to see how complex our system remains, how disconnected the elements of care can be, and how difficult it can be for a person to retain their dignity when they need it most.","Healthcare is, at its core, personal. This is what inspires all of us at Cardinal Health to do our work every day. Every priority we set, every strategic move that we make, we know that at the center of all this is that patient, our mother or father, our sister or brother, our son or daughter, our friend. As I highlight our Q4 and full-year performance and put the year in context, I will keep those patients at the forefront of our conversation.","Also, as I've done in past years at year end, I'll spend a few minutes providing some commentary on the big picture for our business and our future. And then I'll turn it over to Mike, who will go into further detail on the financials, our assumptions for the year ahead, and our long-term aspirations.","We delivered a solid fourth quarter, closing out an outstanding fiscal 2016, thanks to the incredible hard work of our integrated teams from medical to pharma to corporate. First, revenue for the quarter was up 14% versus the prior year to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 5% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $643 million. And third, we delivered an increase of 14% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.14.","For the year, we delivered strong, impressive results in fiscal 2016 across the enterprise. Full-year revenues were up 19% versus the prior year to a record $121.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating earnings were up 17% versus the prior year to $2.9 billion, also a record. And non-GAAP earnings per share was up 20% to $5.24.","I cannot say enough about the dedication, teamwork, and commitment that our more than 37,000 people demonstrated this year. This record achievement is their milestone. These results were indeed a true team effort, rooted in our culture of collaboration. Both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments achieved meaningful, measurable growth while strengthening our overall competitive and strategic positioning. That's a result of their disciplined and determined execution, delivering the highest levels of service to our customers, driving operating efficiencies, managing our rock-solid balance sheet, and integrating the operations of important acquisitions.","First let's look at the strong year our Pharmaceutical segment had. Full-year revenue was up 20% versus fiscal 2015 to $109 billion, and we reported an increase of 19% versus the prior year in segment profit of $2.5 billion. Jon Giacomin and his team spent this past year deepening their relationships with existing customers while welcoming new ones. They've successfully concluded the integration of the Harvard Drug team, building on our first-rate generics offering.","As for existing customers, we grew our retail independent footprint over the course of the fiscal year, increasing the number of customers we serve. Two weeks ago, we hosted a record 9,300 attendees at our annual Retail Business Conference in Chicago, where independent pharmacists shared their unique insights about how they serve their communities as well as the pressures they face. As a result of this regular engagement, the Cardinal Health team has its finger on the pulse, driving meaningful relationships with our customers, and working directly to help them be more efficient to drive the outcomes their patients deserve. This is how we operate, boots on the ground, understanding our customers' needs.","Throughout our Pharma business, you can see that our world-class supply tools provide patient-driven service offerings and help reduce costs, increase efficiency, and improve quality for providers and the patients they serve. As an example, the Cardinal Health Pharmacy Network, which includes thousands of locally-owned pharmacies as members, provides comprehensive services to monitor and elevate performance, improve adherence, and manage compliance and credentialing.","Our pharmacies consistently rank among the highest in customer satisfaction, a testament to the fact that our offerings are helping our customers achieve their quality star ratings. And of course, our first-rate generics program, strengthened by Red Oak Sourcing, our partnership with CVS Health, continues to be a source of value for our customers, their patients, and our shareholders. For those who might question whether the entrepreneurial spirit is thriving in America, listening to these business leaders share their experiences about running a small business while working to make their communities stronger serves as a powerful rebuttal to that narrative.","Specialty Solutions also delivered an outstanding fiscal 2016. Building on its proven track record of growth, this business not only met but exceeded the $8 billion revenue target we shared with you for fiscal 2016. Our Specialty Solutions group successfully completed the integration of Metro Medical, which expands our ability to serve customers in some important therapeutic areas such as rheumatology, nephrology, and oncology, now and well into the future.","We're continuing to add new biopharma tools and services to our portfolio, which positions us for strong steady growth today and tomorrow. Our work in Specialty links directly to the outcomes of major scientific breakthroughs coming from the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.","Our Nuclear business has regained its footing. We've moved beyond radio diagnostics and into radiopharmaceuticals, exploring their potential for new life-saving treatments for cancer patients. The way that we're working with Bayer on the Xofigo project, their treatment for prostate cancer, integrating manufacturing to dose compounding, is just one example of the cutting-edge work that we're doing in the Nuclear segment.","To conclude in the Pharma segment, while the generics environment presents some near-term challenges for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business on a comparative basis, we feel extremely good about the way the entire segment has competed in 2016 and positive about our competitive positioning going forward.","Fiscal 2016 was a real tipping point for our Medical segment, producing exceptional results. Full-year revenue for the Medical segment was up 9% versus the prior year to $12.4 billion, and we reported an increase of 6% versus FY 2015 in segment profit of $457 million. These results are a true testament to how we are working seamlessly and successfully with our provider and manufacturer partners as they seek to serve patients more efficiently with less waste to aid in delivering safer, higher quality care.","Our OptiFreight and 3PL services and our inventory management tools are delivering real and measurable results for our partners. And the considerable expansion of our Cardinal Health line of consumables drives both standardization and value. In just the last two years, we've added over 2,600 products to help providers with greater standardization and to source more cost effectively.","While healthcare systems continue to wrestle with the evolving payment model, moving from a fee-for-service model to one that is more value-based, Cardinal Health is providing products and services to help our customers manage these important changes. Our physician preference item strategy allows us to integrate products and services that help our partners deliver care in a cost-effective and high-quality manner for their patients. Don Casey and his team did a tremendous job closing the Cordis acquisition on time and managing the integration into Cardinal Health with discipline and a focus on the patient. Our global cross-functional teams have been performing at a high level, and we hit our integration and performance benchmarks.","To stay on the theme of evolving payment models, we can draw a straight line between these trends and our work in discharge management and post-acute. Our solutions, offered through naviHealth, RightCare, and Curaspan, position us to help providers and payers manage the complex processes of discharge. With these tools, we can help direct patients to the optimal site of care, build the linkages to post-acute settings, and through our at Home business supply medical products to patients in their homes, improving their healthcare experience. These are important solutions as the population ages and the health system adapts.","While we are proud of the strong results we delivered in fiscal 2016, we know that our healthcare system continues to undergo rapid transformation, and we know that changes are necessary in this new environment. First, care needs to be more coordinated, more efficient, and centered around the patient. Second, a higher priority must be placed on delivering the right care at the right time using the right evidence-based protocols and standards and in the right setting. Third, a greater focus must be placed on patient outcomes, not activity. Lastly and certainly not insignificantly, we are seeing daily the potential for science and technology to change the healthcare experience.","To highlight the significance and pace of change, just last week CMS released another proposed mandatory bundled payment model for acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, and surgical hip femur fracture treatment episodes in their Medicare population. Similar to the now-finalized rule around comprehensive joint replacement, acute-care hospitals would bear financial risk for an episode of care for an inpatient admission to 90 days post-discharge. Our work in physician preference items, where we can focus on an episode of care across the continuum of care, from device, to inventory management, to discharge management, to patient follow-up, all help providers compete in an environment in which they will increasingly be compensated around that episode of care. The capabilities resident in naviHealth, RightCare, and Curaspan all strengthen our ability to deliver real and measurable value at a time when providers are being asked to bear more risk.","While the initiatives coming out of CMS can create some challenges for providers, we see the goal of rewarding hospitals that work together with physicians and other providers to avoid complication, prevent hospital readmissions, and speed recovery as an important direction for the future of healthcare. We have participated directly in bundles programs and will continue to work very closely with providers and payers as well as CMS to do our part to best serve patients.","As we position Cardinal Health for the future, we're always looking for new ways to better serve providers and patients while driving value for our shareholders. We enter fiscal 2017 well prepared and positioned to weather some short-term challenges, particularly around the generic pharmaceutical environment. At Cardinal Health, we are committed to exploring avenues by which we can turn the systems challenges today into breakthroughs and opportunities tomorrow. We are both realistic and optimistic about our industry and its future.","With this as a backdrop, we are providing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for FY 2017 of $5.48 to $5.73, which equates to a growth rate of 5% to 9%.","Healthcare is ultimately about people. Every technical solution we consider, every innovation in which we invest, and every team that we welcome to the Cardinal Health family are all focused on the same faces, those of the mothers and fathers, the sisters and brothers, the sons and daughters and friends that we serve as patients. We all have a part to play in the next generation of healthcare. And I believe that as long as we're focused on those patients, their families, and our communities, we'll make the right decisions, the right investments, and the right moves to be successful now and well into the future.","I'd like to thank our customers for their trust, the manufacturer partners for their shared goal of great patient care, our shareholders for their support, and all of our employees for their deep commitment.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike to discuss more of our financials and our outlook for the future.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today.","George said our team delivered another strong year of earnings growth and cash flow in fiscal 2016, and this just highlights the great work of our Pharmaceutical, Medical, and corporate teams to deliver these record results for our customers and shareholders. Our proven track record of success combined with our aspirational goals position us to deliver meaningful measurable value for our shareholders now and well into the future.","We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment, including our dependable dividend payout ratio of 30% to 35%. We also continue to aspire to a non-GAAP EPS compound annual growth rate over any three-year period of 10% to 15%.","So with that additional context, I'd like to go into more detail on our fourth quarter results, then our full-year highlights, and finally a preview of our expectations for fiscal 2017, including some of our underlying assumptions. I have a lot to cover but I'll leave plenty of time to answer all of your questions.","Please note that with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website will be a helpful guide throughout this discussion, as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.","Let me start by discussing the strong year-over-year financial performance our team delivered this quarter and year. You can follow along on slides three through slide 12 in our earnings presentation. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 16% to $1.02, while non-GAAP EPS grew 14% to $1.14. These results contributed to full-year GAAP and non-GAAP EPS growth of nearly 20%, to $4.32 and $5.24, respectively.","Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 14% to $31.4 billion, while full-year revenue grew 19% to a record $121.5 billion.","GAAP gross margin dollars grew more than 14% in the fourth quarter, and gross margin rate increased by one basis point, which includes a $51 million LIFO benefit that we recognized in the quarter. Fiscal 2016 GAAP gross margin dollars increased 15%, while gross margin rate decreased 19 basis points, primarily from the impact of mix as we onboarded a new mail order customer in our Pharmaceutical segment. Non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 11% in the fourth quarter and 15% versus the prior full year. Non-GAAP gross margin rate declined in the fourth quarter and full year by 15 basis points and 19 basis points, respectively, again due primarily to the new customer I just mentioned.","SG&A expenses increased in the quarter and year, as we anticipated, largely as a result of our strategic acquisitions, many of which George spoke about in his comments.","Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 11% and 5%, respectively, in the fourth quarter and grew 14% and 17%, respectively, for the full fiscal year.","As anticipated, net interest and other expense increased versus the prior year's fourth quarter and year, primarily due to the debt issued in Q4 of fiscal 2015.","The GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.8%. As expected, our non-GAAP ETR was lower at 37.6%. As many of you may remember, in Q4 FY 2015 we had an unusually high tax rate because of increased reserves related to certain federal and state tax matters. For FY 2016, full-year GAAP tax rate was 37.1% and non-GAAP ETR was 36%.","Our fourth quarter and full-year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 327 million and 330 million respectively.","During the fourth quarter, we pulled forward $350 million worth of share repurchases. This brought our fiscal 2016 share repurchases to about $650 million, which combined with our differentiated dividend payouts totals $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we repurchased another $250 million of shares in July, which leaves us with $793 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.","Moving on to consolidated cash flows, we generated approximately $640 million in operating cash flow during the quarter. This brought the fiscal 2016 cash from operations to a record $3 billion, a result of strong contributions from both segments. We also deployed $465 million in capital expenditures, primarily in order to refresh our existing infrastructure and support new acquisitions.","Overall, we ended June 30 with a strong balance sheet, with cash and liquid investments of approximately $2.6 billion, of which $475 million were held internationally. Outstanding working capital management by our teams resulted in this strong year-end cash position, and average net working capital days improved by more than a day.","Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to slide six and slide 10. Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 14% to $28.2 billion, driven by growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers and to a lesser extent performance from our Specialty business. For the year, we drove growth in existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, acquisitions, and Specialty by 20% to a record $109 billion. In fact, as George mentioned, the Specialty team far exceeded the revenue goal we set in fiscal 2016 of $8 billion.","Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $542 million, primarily due to the contributions from acquisitions, offset by the loss of Safeway. In addition, positive contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, were offset by reduced contribution from a specific branded manufacturer agreement.","For the year, segment profit increased 19% to $2.5 billion due to growth from existing and net new Pharma Distribution customers, which includes our generics program, as well as contributions from our strategic acquisitions. This was partially offset by the typical customer repricing and to a lesser extent reduced contributions from the specific branded manufacturer agreement mentioned earlier.","Speaking of acquisitions, we've not only met but exceeded the goals that we set for our acquisitions of the Harvard Drug Group and Metro Medical, which is a testament to the hard work of these dedicated teams. We've now lapped both acquisitions.","Segment profit rate declined by 24 basis points for the quarter and two basis points for the year. This was largely due to changes in product and customer mix. Performance under our generics program, which includes Red Oak Sourcing, helped to positively offset some of the full-year decline.","All in all, despite a challenging environment in Q4 with the expiration of the Safeway contract and a tougher product pricing environment, we demonstrated that we have the team and talent to still deliver outstanding performance for the year.","Let's move to slide seven and slide 11 that cover the Medical segment, which had an excellent fourth quarter. Revenue for the quarter grew more than 12% to $3.2 billion, primarily due to acquisitions and to a lesser extent Cardinal Health brand products. For the year, revenue grew 9% to a record $12.4 billion, driven by contributions from acquisitions and sales growth from existing businesses.","Fourth quarter segment profit grew more than 19% to $122 million due to acquisitions and growth in Cardinal Health brand products. Full-year segment profit increased 6% to $457 million due to contributions from Cardinal Health brand products as well as the net contributions from acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by changes in the Canadian market, which affected the first half of fiscal 2016 and which we've mentioned on prior calls.","Medical segment profit rate expanded by 22 basis points in the fourth quarter, driven by Cardinal Health brand products, including Cordis, but declined by 12 basis points for the year, again related to the first half pressures in Canada.","Knowing you'll have some questions on Cordis, I'd like to provide more details on our progress. Our integration team has worked hard this year, and all day-one countries are stood up and providing solutions that drive efficiency, standardization, and improved patient outcomes. In fact, the Cordis team has already demonstrated measurable growth in certain geographic regions such as Europe, which hasn't seen that type of growth in a number of years.","We continue to work on closing and standing up day-two countries. As I mentioned last quarter, we expected variability in the margin rate between quarters, as we are still working through a few intricate mechanics related to the transition service and manufacturing agreements that we have with J&J. This variability is caused by such factors as the timing of exits, the ramping up and down of certain expenses, and the impact of foreign exchange. You can see that variability sequentially in the fourth quarter segment profit rate versus last quarter, where I had indicated that the Q3 segment profit rate was somewhat elevated. As we expected, we should be fully stood up and exiting our TSA agreements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, while our transition manufacturing agreements will extend for a couple of years longer.","Let me share a quick update on Cardinal Health China. Our business in China generated over $3.5 billion in revenue for the year, resulting in solid top and bottom line growth. And as many of you know, our Chinese operations serve both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, each showing significant multiyear growth. We have 16 large-scale distribution centers and operate 29 specialized retail pharmacies in 20 of the major cities across China. The team there continues to execute well through a combination of organic and inorganic moves, and we continue to gain share in our ranking among the top 10 healthcare distributors in China.","Finally, as I mentioned earlier, if you review the Q4 fiscal 2016 GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on slide eight, you'll see three key reconciling items that are excluded from non-GAAP EPS. First, amortization and other acquisition-related costs accounts for $0.32 per share. Second, net litigation recoveries, which includes proceeds of approximately $68 million in pre-tax antitrust settlements, accounts for $0.13. And third, as we closed fiscal 2016, we reviewed and adjusted our LIFO reserves based on the actual June 30 inventory balances. This resulted in a favorable $0.10 adjustment to GAAP EPS.","So with a very strong year behind us, let me now turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook and relevant underlying assumptions. From an overall perspective, there are two items to note about our non-GAAP guidance range. First, all of my forward-looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP, as we do not provide GAAP future guidance due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. And second, our guidance doesn't include the impact of the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of shareholder-based compensation. We are currently assessing whether or not we want to adopt this earlier than the required Q1 fiscal 2018 adoption date. If we do early-adopt, we will keep you informed and provide you with the impact and updated guidance range.","So now let me walk you through our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Starting on slide 14, we expect high single-digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues. And as George stated, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to grow roughly 5% to 9%, for a range of $5.48 to $5.73.","On slide 15, we've outlined five corporate assumptions. First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full-year guidance on tax rates, as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items. Second, for fiscal 2017, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 324 million to 326 million. As I mentioned earlier, we already completed $250 million of share repurchases in July, which is included in this range. Third, we expect net interest and other expense of $190 million to $205 million. Fourth, we continue to view reinvestment in the business as a priority to support acquisitions and growing demand. As a result, we expect capital investment to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. And finally, we currently assume amortization of approximately $376 million, or $0.74, which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again, this is excluded from non-GAAP.","Now moving to the segment assumptions, starting with Pharma, which you'll see on slide 16; beginning with revenues, we expect a high single-digit percentage increase versus the prior year. This is based on current pricing trends, contributions from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution customers, offset by the loss of Safeway, which impacts most of fiscal 2017. We expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be essentially flat versus fiscal 2016.","While we don't normally provide quarterly guidance, Q1 is unusual. We expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range, as we navigate challenging year-over-year comps. Clearly, the trends we saw this past quarter also factor into our guidance. Of course, this will affect our company consolidated non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter. As a result, we expect consolidated non-GAAP EPS to decline by high single to low double digits year on year. However, we do expect Pharma segment growth to improve and performance to be back-half weighted versus the prior year.","Let me provide some additional context on Pharma. As I mentioned just now related to revenues, we also expect the loss of Safeway to impact Pharma segment profit for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017. As it relates to generic manufacturer drug price increases, we expect less contribution in fiscal 2017 than we had experienced in fiscal 2016. We are modeling generic manufacturer price deflation in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. Also, I want to point out that in last year's Q1 fiscal 2016, we had several key generic items that we had previously disclosed as being unusual and significant drivers in that quarter. These items have now experienced meaningful deflation, which creates some tough comparisons to Q1. We assume brand manufacturer price inflation to be approximately 10% for the full fiscal year.","FY 2017 expenses associated with modernizing our Pharma information systems to support our significant growing demand as well as acquisitions will be more than what we had incurred in 2016. As I said earlier, we have the team and talent in place to ensure success of this multi-year project. We expect incremental year-over-year earnings contribution from both Red Oak Sourcing and new item launches as well as measurable growth within our existing customers and new customer wins. However, that year-on-year benefit will be significantly less in fiscal 2017.","Red Oak Sourcing has been and continues to be an effective and productive partnership. As we've mentioned in the past, the achievement of certain milestones would trigger the second of two predetermined payments, beginning in fiscal 2017. Because of the excellent performance, Red Oak achieved these milestones, and we will be making our second and final $10 million increase in our quarterly payment to CVS Health beginning in Q1. As anticipated, our new quarterly payment will be $45.6 million for the remaining eight years of the agreement.","There are two other business assumptions that we have embedded in our guidance for Pharma. First, we expect continued contributions from our acquisitions. For Harvard Drug, we are reaffirming our original assumption of greater than $0.20 EPS contribution to fiscal 2017. And second, we expect double-digit growth in our China business and in Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions. We expect that Specialty revenue and profit growth will continue in the double digits again this fiscal year.","So again to be clear, because of the exceptionally strong Q1 last year, smaller tailwinds from Red Oak Sourcing and launches, current pricing trends, and the Safeway loss which impacts the majority of fiscal 2017, we now expect Pharma segment profit to be down in the high teens to low 20% range in Q1 and essentially flat for the year.","Let's now talk about expectations and assumptions around our Medical segment for fiscal 2017, which you can find on slide 17. We expect revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect double-digit segment profit growth and margin rate expansion.","Medical segment profit growth stems mainly from three key assumptions. First, we continue to expect great performance from Cordis, with that acquisition adding more than $0.15 to fiscal 2017 versus the prior year net of transaction-related interest expense of $0.07 to $0.08. This is a lower accretion figure than we originally provided, largely due to currency impacts as well as some increased SG&A investments compared to our original business case. Our commitment to serving this global customer base without disruption is our highest priority, and therefore some of the synergies originally associated with this complex acquisition will take longer to achieve than we originally modeled. Second, we expect above-market revenue growth and therefore solid contribution from Cardinal Health at Home. And third, we are forecasting double-digit profit growth from Cardinal Health brand.","In Q1, we began onboarding Kaiser with a dedicated customer service team. This new contract is already embedded in our assumptions, as is the assumption that our Cardinal Health brand penetration will gradually increase over the course of this fiscal year.","On slide 18, we provided an EPS bridge from our fiscal 2016 finish to our fiscal 2017 guidance midpoint of $5.61. Each category that you see on slide 18 is a mix of headwinds and tailwinds, and the number associated with each category reflects the midpoint of a risk-adjusted non-GAAP EPS contribution range. We've tried to size each of these core categories for you so that you better understand the components of our growth for this fiscal year. This is not something that we plan to do on a go-forward basis. However, given current market dynamics, we thought it might be helpful.","As you see on slide 19, we expect core growth of about 3% to 6%, with capital deployment adding 2% to 3%, for total fiscal 2017 estimated growth of 5% to 9% in non-GAAP EPS. The higher end of our guidance range contemplates greater growth from the businesses as well as additional capital deployment either through share repurchases, acquisitions, or a combination.","Finally, I want to address the aspirational goals for fiscal 2017 year-end that we outlined in our December 2013 Investor Day because it's important to us that we stay accountable to you, our shareholders. At that time, we outlined five goals we hoped to accomplish as we exited fiscal 2017 and which we said would require both organic and inorganic moves. I'd like to update you on our progress toward each of these goals.","First, we targeted achieving a Pharma segment profit rate of at least 2.5%. As you know, we've grown with the addition of an important new mail order customer that helps to increase our earnings but is dilutive to margin rates. So while this goal will be difficult to achieve, we will always pursue opportunities that are both capital efficient and overall accretive to earnings.","Second, for the Medical segment, we targeted a segment profit rate of at least 5.75%. While this may take somewhat longer to achieve, the Medical team is still committed to this target.","Third, we stated that 45% of the segment gross profit would come from Cardinal Health brand, and we are very much on track to achieve this.","Fourth, we set out to increase income from Cardinal Health at Home by more than 50%. We've already made significant progress toward achieving this goal.","And fifth and finally, we said we want to deliver more than 70% of the Medical segment gross profit from a combination of Cardinal Health brand, services, and alternate site solutions, and we are also very much on track to deliver this.","I know I just provided a lot of information for you around our assumptions. So please feel free to ask any clarifying questions.","Allow me to briefly close by saying fiscal 2016 was truly a remarkable year for Cardinal Health and our well positioned portfolio. I'd like to recognize our team for all the work that they've done and continue to do to deliver meaningful measurable results. I am confident about our plan for fiscal 2017 and look forward to the year ahead.","I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question from Eric Percher from Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Ho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning. This is David Ho on for Eric. So my first question is on that $0.55 headwind from net customer activity. I was just wondering, Mike. Could you provide a little bit more detail? How much of that, or is the majority of that due to the Safeway loss? And I'm assuming it also includes repricing assumptions around customers like Prime and Kmart, so was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on that.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Absolutely; thanks for the question. Hopefully, you guys all found this slide to be helpful. Let me do this, just in case there's other questions. I'll give you a little bit of color on the $0.55, but I'll give you also a little color on the other pieces too, just to be helpful.","First of all, if you hopefully got it in color, the first three components -- net customer activity, generics program, and existing or remaining businesses -- those numbers all represent midpoints of a guidance range \u2013 of a range that we established for each one of these. And so just think about that. There is a range for each of these. The capital deployment is essentially the bottom of the range because we've already achieved the $0.10 through the share repurchases that we've done.","As far as the net customer activity, the things that are included in there would be, for instance, as you mentioned, the loss of Safeway. All of the repricings that we experienced that we expect to experience this year in Pharma, which we expect to be at normal levels, is also well with normal medical repricings, and then the impact of any other wins or losses that we would be having in customers.","The generics program bucket includes the headwind we talked about with generic drug manufacturing pricing assumptions and then the tailwinds of both generic and launches and Red Oak Sourcing, which again, while tailwinds, will be less than what we experienced in 2016 versus 2015. And then also our assumptions around generic penetration are in there.","In that final bucket, existing or remaining businesses, that would be everything else, such as Specialty China growth, Harvard, the negative impact of PMod [Pharma Modernization] that we talked about, et cetera. All those other things are in that bucket. So hopefully, that gave you a little bit of color.","David Ho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right; that helps definitely. And I guess my follow-up would be on that midpoint number, we've noticed that Cardinal has a history of exceeding that midpoint by about 6%, and I was wondering. Is there anything different this year versus prior years? Is this a year with less risk at the beginning of the year because maybe the generics piece -- there's less upside? So I'm just wondering if there's more room to grow from here.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question. I would tell you that, as every year, I don't think it's any different than we try to do any other year. I would tell you that I believe this is an achievable plan. We've put a lot of thought into this. Clearly, there are a lot of different dynamics affecting the year, and we try to risk-adjust each and every one of those, so hopefully that helps a little bit.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. I appreciate you laying out the challenges to this year and respective of your long-term aspirations. As you are thinking about some of the temporal items that are affecting the business, how did you think about the pushes and pulls of maybe other things you could have done to accelerate the growth rate this year but maybe that's not in the best interest of the long term, whether it was getting more aggressive with acquisitions or something on the cost side? I'm just curious what the debate was like, and I guess it maybe speaks to the fact of your confidence in the long term that you felt like you didn't need to do something now.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Ross. It's George. It's a little hard to answer that question, but let me do the best I can. We obviously have a goal of having this long-term creation of value for our shareholders, and of course on the short term making sure that we're hitting our numbers, executing, and are very disciplined. We've tried to continue that tradition. We will be very disciplined about the moves that we make, the way we deploy capital, the acquisitions we consider. All of those are really with the thought about where care is going and making sure we're on the right side of care.","But again, we are very much focused on making sure that we do what we say we're going to do in the short term and that we execute very efficiently. But we'll continue to look for those opportunities to drive the business. As you know, we're a pretty strong generator of cash, and capital deployment for us is a resource that we recognize is an opportunity for us to create value for all of you as shareholders. So we'll continue to bring that approach to it.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, guys.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys, for taking the question here. Maybe, George, I could ask you a question about Medical here. You were talking about as we move to episodes of care across 90 days, to change the way providers have been thinking about their costs. Are you saying that \u2013 are you then going to the market here trying to sell a suite of products that crosses the episode of care itself? So are hospitals really looking to buy maybe physician preference items that will be used for a case tied then to discharge planning? My understanding is that's not really how they buy today. How are those discussions going, and how quickly do you think we'll get there for people to think of it that way?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let me just respond to this broadly first, Charles. I think the movement towards value-based care is pretty clear. I think the horse is out of the barn in that regard. Making it happen in practice, as you know, is quite challenging. We're at early stages in this sense. So there are certain episodes of care we're aligning on what the outcome we're looking for is, where the appropriate period to measure can be quite straightforward. There are other episodes of care where it's extremely difficult, and the time horizon in terms of measuring outcomes is more difficult. So I think we have to recognize that we're in a period of mixed systems, where we'll be living for some period of time with traditional fee-for-service models as well as outcomes or value-based models. Not every provider or every payer is completely ready to move forward on all of those programs.","We feel like we're well positioned to serve in any of those kinds of markets. We're extremely efficient in driving our lines of businesses given the fee-for-service model, but we now have some tools that are enabling particularly very large, complex systems that are beginning to wrestle with these issues. We have tools that can really help them, whether or not it's reducing costs or standardization in the consumables, outcome of physician preference item strategy, which links the device and the services around it, where they're going to be paid a set fee for an episode or the work that we're doing in post-acute and discharge management, which is really critical as you think about the amount of costs in the system post-discharge.","So I think we're going to live in a world that has both models in the short term, but we really are positioned I think to create value for our customers in either model. And actually, just so you have this, our legacy lines of business in our Medical segment during the back half of the year were actually very strong, and I think it's again a testament to the fact that we can compete effectively in either one of these financing models.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just to follow up, so naviHealth, if you think about really post-discharge planning, is that a decision made at what level in the hospital when you're going in? And then because I'm trying to think about how quickly we can start tying these types of different product lines or offerings together into a full suite offering.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You have to remember that naviHealth has two types of customers. They have payer customers and provider customers. I think the decisions, this kind of work tends to get relatively high in the organization. It's not necessarily made in one place, but I will say that because the implications of post-discharge costs are very significant for our customers, these activities, the work that we're doing in this area tends to move fairly high up into the organization. But decisions are really made throughout different parts of any customer.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. This is Zack in for Ricky. I wanted to ask first about the moving parts on the Pharmaceutical segment and how you think about what organic growth was in the quarter versus in fiscal 2016 and how that compares to the \u2013 I realize it's not organic, but the flattish expectation for growth in fiscal 2017.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks for the question, Zack. I'm not going to get specific on the split between organic and non-organic within the segments. But if you think about our slide on page 19, we did split it down for the overall company to try to give you a little color in that we're expecting capital deployment, which will be the combination of stock repo and some tuck-in acquisitions, to be in the 2% to 3% range. And then we expect the business growth to be 3% to 6% in total. And again, if you remember, I did say that I expected the Pharma segment to be essentially flat for the year but a little different on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Zachary W. Sopcak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, thanks for that, and then a question on Specialty. So as you mentioned, Specialty is exceeding your targets and expectations for fiscal 2016. As you head into 2017 and further on, how do you think about Specialty impacting both your margins as well as your cash generation?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I continue to be very excited about what's going on in Specialty. Last year we wanted to give you a revenue goal, which we said was $8 billion, which we far exceeded. And really the reason we gave that last year, and it's probably not something we'll be giving forward, is because we want you to understand the scale and breadth of that business, that we've grown so quickly, that it's truly at a scale where we have all the relationships that we need with pharma manufacturers as well as the suite of services to serve providers downstream.","We do continue to expect double-digit growth in the Specialty business for 2017. We're excited about both our offerings upstream to providers as well as downstream \u2013 or upstream to manufacturers and downstream to providers. So I think we're really well positioned in that business. I think that our margin rates, I think it's going to be higher margin rates on the upstream services to manufacturers. We're at typical distribution margin rates on the downstream services to the providers.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Zack, I would just add. Some of you probably will know, which is that, again, if you look at the pipeline coming out of the biopharmaceutical world, Specialty is going to continue to be a priority. So our positioning, as Mike said, both downstream with the providers and upstream with manufacturers, I think is quite strong right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bob Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, this is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Mike, going back to your comments on Cordis and the update to the accretion range, specifically on the increased SG&A investments that you guys are planning to make, could you just give us a little more detail behind the nature of these investments? And is there any change to your expectations for the top line contribution from Cordis?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","So thanks for the question on Cordis. First of all, I just want to make sure. We feel really excited about Cordis. We think things are going really well. We've got all of the key employees, management team, sales folks in place. Things are going incredibly well.","So just a couple quick things to note, really the difference between the $0.20 accretion we had last year and the $0.15 that we're now updating it to is mostly FX. And obviously, that's something that we can have some impact in the way we price and stuff but is obviously hard to control. So the biggest piece of that change really truly is FX.","Why I want to emphasize the SG&A just a little bit was to let you know that we're incredibly committed to making sure that we do no harm to the current sales business and that as we get through our TSA agreements with J&J, that as we build up to and support it internally, and then exit off of those other agreements, we've decided to be, I guess I'd use the word conservative in the sense of managing our expenses so that we don't cause any disruption to the supply chain and do anything that would make lives for our sales guys tougher.","So we feel good about this. We feel like we have really good plans to deliver. And that's also why I mentioned before that we would have some variability between quarters because in some cases it was as we were ramping up our expenses, we're still on the TSA, so we have slightly double expenses in certain periods as we then walk off the TSAs as we move country to country.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then you also highlighted the record operating cash flow for the year. Just given your assumption for fiscal 2017, do you think that this level of cash flow performance is sustainable for next year?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I think we're going to continue to have strong cash flow, but we don't guide specifically to cash flow, so I can't give that to you. But I think that we're going to be, just by the nature of our business and our strong focus on working capital, we're going to continue to have strong cash flow numbers. This was a record year, and it creates a lot of options for us to take a look at different ways to deploy that capital.","Nathan Rich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks for the questions.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","Yes, our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, Mike or George, I'm going to go back to that slide 19 where you guys talked about the multiyear aspirations, and that was the 2013 to 2017 period. I guess if we think about the next five years, should we think of those multiyear aspirations as still holding, or is the most recent year, that being fiscal 2017, what we should think of as a more normalized run rate for the business?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I wanted to make sure that I did emphasize \u2013 we still believe that over any three-year period we can achieve 10% to 15% non-GAAP EPS growth. So whether you look at 2016 through 2018 or 2017 through 2019 or going forward, there's nothing at this time that as we project out what we think we can do, not only with the strong position and performance of our businesses but also with our significant and disciplined approach to capital, that we think we can still continue to deliver the 10% to 15% non-GAAP EPS growth.","And then on the dividend payout, we intend to continue to differentiate that dividend and keep our payout in that 30% to 35% range, which is again something we feel with our strong cash flow and continued earnings growth we're going to be able to continue to do.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's very helpful. And I guess just if we think about \u2013 you highlighted the moving pieces in the guidance in fiscal 2017. If we look at the core U.S. drug distribution business, recognizing that there's the Safeway roll-off, Nuclear, Specialty, and China are all growing fast, I guess what I'm trying to figure out is on a like-for-like basis, is the core U.S. DSD business expected to be flat or actually shrink in fiscal 2017?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I can't go into a split again with the core other than what I gave you from an overall Cardinal standpoint. I will tell you, though, that remember that we mentioned a few other things related to the Pharmaceutical segment and the assumptions.","So from a headwind standpoint, Safeway, as you clearly mentioned, is a headwind. Also, we have our normal repricings. Then we have the headwind from the increased expense we're going to incur this year, which we specifically related to our Pharmaceutical IT investments because we've had such significant growth in our Pharmaceutical business, including acquisitions, that that will be an important area for us. And then the generic manufacturer deflation that we've talked about, the impact on our business on that, and then specifically the manufacturer branded agreements that we talked a little bit. But I do want to make sure you know that PD is not shrinking. We feel really good about the strength of all of our businesses in PD, both China, Specialty, and the core PD businesses.","And then the tailwinds that we've talked about, as I mentioned just those, remember, just one other thing I mentioned that's important, we expect Red Oak and generic launches to continue to be tailwinds for us, but just less in 2017 versus 2016 than they were 2016 versus 2015, just because of the nature of the generic launches. There are fewer of them out there and because we synergized Red Oak so quickly and we had a lot of impact from it in 2016. And again, it will be positive in 2017 but less than it was in the previous year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and thanks for all the comments. George, I'm wondering if you can just maybe talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace for your contracts that you have with manufacturers that are not under inventory management agreements. Are you seeing any changes at all in the marketplace? And obviously, we have seen some of these manufacturers that have gone through some changes. Are they changing the way they're contracting with you at all?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Lisa. I'll start and then I'll let Mike jump in. Actually, we're not really seeing any noteworthy change here. Relationships with our manufacturers are really good. Again, we have different product lines that we're seeing launched these days, so more products that are coming through Specialty. But I would say in general, the basic tone of the conversations is positive, and the basic nature of contracting is quite similar. So, Mike, I don't know if you want to add there.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","The only thing I would add, Lisa, that maybe is a slight change that would be important to note is that typically in the past, we said that about 80% of our fees from branded manufacturers were non-contingent to inflation. And with recent renegotiations of agreements and various moving parts, we expect that to be 85% at a minimum this coming year. And so that means that now 15% or less of our margins on branded manufacturers will be subject to inflation, which again I think reduces the overall risk and exposure going forward. And as you've heard me say in the past, on that 15% that is contingent, we view that in a thoughtful way working with manufacturers that we believe can still deliver a consistent type of return for us. So I think that's probably the only slightly moving part that I've seen with our agreements.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks for taking the questions, a couple clarification questions actually. So on Red Oak, I was under the assumption that it was already a nice run rate, but you stated the incremental contributions. Just to be clear, is this just the normal benefit as volumes increased for the JV, or are there new functions Red Oak will be taking on?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start. And again, I'll make sure Mike clarifies if it's not clear. So really, what we were trying to say was the benefit as you move from 2017 to 2016 is less than the benefit that occurred from 2016 to 2015 because it was really the ramp-up basically. So we really had \u2013 the first year ramp-up was more dramatic, but the general direction is positive. I would say the relationship right now is really strong. Red Oak is a highly functioning operating entity with some scale, and so we continue to explore ways to create value from that. Mike is on the board. Is there anything you want to add?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","The only color I would add I think if I understand where you're going was, while I would tell you we were fully ramped up, with any sourcing business, every year you challenge yourself to take cost out and get better and better, whether it's on the Medical side, where the team this past year did an excellent job of continuing to take cost out on our Cardinal Health branded products and the ones we source no different than Red Oak Sourcing. I was at our board meeting just last week, and I continue to be impressed with the data analytics and analysis the team are doing as they look for opportunities to lower our cost and again work with manufacturers in different and unique ways that we hope are win-wins, with always the goal being transparent and clear with our manufacturers.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I guess where I was going with that is with that nice slide on page 18 with the bridging from 2016 to 2017. The generics programs line has $0.35 attributed to it. So just trying to figure out how much of that was marketplace dynamics versus very unique to Cardinal's Red Oak program. So it sounds like most of that is from just the marketplace dynamics of generics coming on board.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I would say Red Oak is going to be one of the big positives in there. Generic launches will be a positive, and then generic penetration will be a positive. And then on the flip side, what we're seeing in terms of generic deflation is the negative in there that offsets some of those upsides. And again, as George and I both mentioned, the upsides from Red Oak and launches were a little smaller this year. But also remember, it's really basically impossible to pull apart all those pieces because they all work in tandem together. When you see pricing pressure, you're looking for cost renegotiations, et cetera, et cetera. So a lot of that works together, which is why we grouped it together.","Operator","And our next question comes from Greg Bolan from Avondale Partners.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in here. Just keep it real quick. So if we think about where your minds were very end of April the last time we spoke with regards to generic deflation and where your minds are today, our work suggests that the ratio of inflationary to deflationary generic prices has really come back into a more normalized level, maybe even still slightly above a normalized level, certainly less than 0.5%. Has that changed at all just in terms of your mindset? Does it seem like there's more of a stabilization? And as we think about the back half of fiscal 2017 into the first half of fiscal 2018 \u2013 I know we don't want to get too far out -- but just does it feel like from a year-on-year comparable basis it's starting to stabilize?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So why don't I start just giving some historical perspective, and then I'll let Mike jump in. This is the environment that we've been in now for quite a number of months, and so we have over the years seen these swings from time to time. And over the last couple years is a particularly noteworthy stretch. But I would say this is a dynamic with which we're familiar. And I'm not sure that it's changed our mindset in any way. I think we understand the nature of the market. This is a kind of market we've lived in. We're extremely effective at sourcing products, and I think our teams do a great job of commercializing them, and I think we've been picking up new customers. So generally speaking, I'm not sure that our mindset has changed in any way.","Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I would agree with George on that in terms of a mindset. This is an environment we know how to operate in. And again, I think we're incredibly well positioned with our partnership with CVS Health, with Red Oak, and the investments we're making in our pricing and analytics teams across both Cardinal and at Red Oak.","There are less items going up in price if you're talking about that from a mix standpoint. But when you take a look at the core items, whether you look at it and look at items four years older or two years older or how many players, generally we're seeing similar deflation to what we saw in historical periods in those buckets. We're just tending to see fewer and less larger I guess increases when we do see the increases, which I think is having the impact which you saw from a few years ago.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that's right. The difference is really in a relatively small set of the total.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby from Credit Suisse.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, George or Mike, you mentioned the Cardinal at Home products a few times here. You're expecting above market growth here. What's incremental to that strategy for 2017? Why are you so upbeat that it's going to grow above the market? And then secondarily, where does that stand as a gross margin driver for you in your hierarchy of things? Is this in the top bucket, or is that too small to care about at this point?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bob. I don't think it's small. Again, this is a good contributor to us. I think the drivers of growth here are largely demographic. I think what we see is an increasingly aging population. And so I think in general, the winds are going in our direction here. We have more patients being discharged, in some cases more quickly. As you know, the incentives are changing a bit. We are competing very, very effectively. We are generating more flow of Cardinal brand, which is actually still in its relatively early phases of work.","So I would say as we are able to drive more of our own Cardinal brand through that channel, it actually makes us more effective. And that's a little bit of that flywheel that we've seen in other parts of the business, where as we can create more product flow-through, it's more efficient for the customers, which creates more volume, which allows us to do that much more effectively. And so I think that's the key to that business model. And we feel very good about our ability to source, drive Cardinal Health products, and expand our presence in that channel.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","The only thing I would add, Bob, around your question about why we're above market is I think a couple other things hit me. One is we have tremendous billing capabilities there and also outstanding payer relationships. We think we probably have \u2013 not probably have \u2013 I think we have the largest breadth of relationships with payers. So we make it easy for discharge planners and folks (1:10:43) when they want a one-stop shop to go to someone who can handle all of the needs of the patients to come to us. So I think our ability to make it easier for those folks, our breadth of our line, including the Cardinal Health products, as well as I would tell you I really believe in the team up there is some outstanding folks I think are the reasons why we're growing above market.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Is there any change in the retail strategy itself of how many storefronts you might be selling through?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I wouldn't say there's any change, but we continue to grow that relationship with our various customers. The team is doing a nice job. Jon and Don work together across P&M [Pharmaceutical and Medical] to look for opportunities and work with, whether it's retail, independents, regional chains or large chains, to find opportunities where we can help them create endless aisles in this area of these type of products and us to be their back office for them. So we are absolutely continuing to cross-sell those products.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right; thank you.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger at William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks, a quick follow-up on slide 19, Mike. The 10% to 15% longer-term EPS growth goal -- should we assume that there's any capital deployment in that number?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Absolutely, that assumes that there will be capital deployment in that number. It'll be a combination of stock repurchases, acquisitions, as well as any capital deployment we use for capital expenditures. So it clearly includes capital deployment.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And by the way, when we went back to the Analyst Day a couple years ago when we laid out these goals, that was also something we articulated.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, and then just a similar follow-up. If you think about your segment-level guidance for 2017, are there any additional acquisitions baked into either the Pharma or Medical guidance?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","At this time, the only acquisitions that would be baked in, in a sense, because there are no real acquisitions baked in, but we said that capital deployment would be 2% to 3%. So we have given some room in there to either do some small tuck-in acquisitions or to be able to do some additional repo. So from that sense, from an overall company standpoint, there is some I guess capital deployment that could be either acquisitions or stock buyback embedded in our earnings guidance, but no specific company necessarily at this point in time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, good morning, George and Mike. We've also been publishing an EPS bridge from fiscal 2016 to 2017 as well, so I'm glad you guys are on board with the same concept. I truly don't want to get granular as I try to compare on this call, but I would say just big picture, we had a benefit from new generic launches but an equal sized hit from generic price erosion on older products. So we were right around zero or neutral for generic profits for Cardinal overall for fiscal 2017. You guys obviously have a positive $0.35 contribution at your midpoint. I just wanted to try to dive into that a little bit deeper on what some of the positive contributors are. The first question might be, do you have generic pricing as a positive contributor or subtraction? And also, are you anticipating maybe a lot of unit volume growth in generics within your customer base that might be driving a lot of that earnings as well? I just wanted to get more color on that $0.35. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","The three positives that are in there would be Red Oak Sourcing would be the most significant of the positives in there, again, the year-over-year benefit. I've mentioned a couple times it's smaller than 2016 versus 2015, but it's still a very important number to us. So that's clearly a positive. Generic launches are a positive again, while smaller than the prior year. And then we also do have some assumption of penetration of current accounts, that we will be able to take some of the generics that they're buying directly from other folks and buy them through us. So those are the three positives or the tailwinds.","And then on the negative side, it's the generic deflation issue and the impact that that creates from inventory gains as well as the impact on our selling prices. That impact of generic deflation is the bad guy in there that we've talked about in the past.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And would Harvard accretion be in there? I don't know if somebody asked that or not. Was that part of that?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","No, Harvard would be down in the \u2013 overall performance would be down in the third bucket, existing or remaining businesses. We just put all of that down in that bucket.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Larsen from Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Mike, could you talk a bit about the operating margin in the Medical division? I think you mentioned there were a couple of one-time benefits last quarter. It just seemed like the sequential delta there was fairly significant. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks for the question. So in Medical, this was what we predicted in our last quarter. We thought with all of the moving parts on Cordis related to the building up of internal expenses to take over the various operations being managed by J&J right now on the transition service agreements that we would have some variability between where we're ramping up and ramping down. We also have some FX impact in there. And then there are a few other puts and takes that we've had between the quarters that are just creating some variability.","And so I'd probably look more at Q3 and Q4 combined than I would to try to look at any one single quarter over the last couple quarters. And this noise will begin to reduce as we go over the next couple quarters and begin to get off the TSA agreements by our fourth quarter this year.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, fantastic. And then, Mike, I know you led the Pharma division for a long time. You probably know more about Pharma pricing than pretty much lots of folks on the planet. How is Red Oak performing relative to your expectations? And what's going to turn that 20% decline in Pharma operating income in 1Q around so dramatically? It sounds like you're going to have to have a pretty good growth rate in 2Q and 3Q going forward. In your view, what's the one or two things that's going to turn that around?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks for that question, a couple things. First of all, remember, a big reason for that Q1 decline is really how incredibly strong Q1 of 2016 was. If you remember, back then I mentioned there was a subset of a few specific generic items that we had anticipated would deflate on July 1 of last year, and they didn't. They ended up staying very much higher-priced than we anticipated, which created a lot of extra margin on those items in Q1. Those items have subsequently deflated, and so they're not creating as much margin. So that's one of the big headwinds in Q1. You also have the Safeway piece in Q1 of this year, where it was a customer that was very late in its contract life that we had fully synergized in terms of Red Oak Sourcing and had penetrated essentially about 100% of the generics there. So you have those two big things that are there.","And then as you really look forward, the team is just doing a lot of things, as I've mentioned, around focusing on penetrating current customers, which is going to continue to grow us, continuing to invest in data and analytics. Some of the good work we're doing on Harvard, Specialty, Nuclear is really improving as a business. And so I think we're going to have much better comps as we move forward over the next couple quarters, so we would expect our second half to be much better than our first half on Pharma. But I don't think there's anything in there. We don't have to pull a rabbit out of a hat or anything to get there. I think Jon and his team have a really great set of plans to execute and get us where we need to be.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dave, if I could just add to it, our Pharma business is competing really effectively right now. Our position is really strong. I love where we are with our customers. Red Oak Sourcing is really effective. So as Mike said, there are some somewhat unique things in the comparative data, but we really like the positioning.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, I think we are going to try to go through the rest of the questions in the queue, if we can.","Operator","Indeed, we have one final question actually from Mr. Eric Coldwell from Robert Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Actually my question was covered just a minute ago and for the second time. I'll let you guys wrap up.","George S.

We look forward to seeing you at one of these upcoming events.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Cardinal Health's Chairman and CEO, Mr. George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining us on our second quarter call today. We've now completed a strong first half to our fiscal 2013. Total revenue for the second quarter was $25.2 billion. Although this represents a decline of 6.8% from the prior year's period, it was not unexpected given this past year's brand-to-generic conversions and the movement of the Express Scripts contract. Most important, our focus on value generation for our customers and our continued attention to portfolio, product and customer mix, along with disciplined performance management by our people, resulted in year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating earnings of 10.6% to $525 million; non-GAAP EPS of $0.93, growth of 15%.","Based on our results for the first half of our fiscal 2013 and the way we see the balance of the year, we are now guiding to the upper half of our prior guidance range with a new non-GAAP EPS range of $3.42 to $3.50.","Stepping back for a few moments from the quarter just passed, this really is an extraordinary time in healthcare. It seems clear that powerful forces, specifically the aging of our population, public health challenges and legislative actions to improve access to care for those who've lacked adequate care, will drive long-term demand. It is also clear, however, that unless we can approach things differently as a system, the cost of providing care will present overwhelming economic challenges. While I am largely describing the U.S. phenomenon, this is true throughout the world. It is in this context that our Essential to care tagline is more than a slogan. It drives our strategy and the motivation of our people who serve our customers and drive our performance.","Cardinal Health not only represents an essential, seamless and highly-efficient system for linking pharmaceutical and medical products companies with the provider and even the patient, but our other offerings make us increasingly important at this unique time. Let me give you a few examples.","Our surgical kits reduce unnecessary movement around the operating room and the potential for errors. Our provider-directed oncology tools are designed to facilitate the patient-centered practice of medicine and help with the focus on outcomes. Our medical-preferred products program take advantage of our scale to aggregate demand across multiple providers, to bring costs down and standardization up. Our nuclear medicine organization facilitates diagnosis of cardiac disease, cancer and neurological diseases. Our generic product programs enable all customers to access these important products through our best-in-class network. Our enterprise footprint allows us to serve integrated delivery systems as their models shift and our organization continues to pursue innovative ways to change the game while making sure the patient is the center of the universe.","So with that high-level overview, I'll now briefly discuss the performance of our segments.","First, the Pharmaceutical segment. Under Mike Kaufman's leadership, the Pharma segment continued its momentum with a profit gain of 12% for the second quarter. Led by Pharma Distribution, our Pharmaceutical segment profit margin expanded 34 basis points versus last year. We continue to work closely with our pharmaceutical partners across branded, BioPharma and generic, developing the support and services to meet the unique and evolving needs of each.","Generics now represent approximately 80% of all prescriptions billed in the United States and clearly, continuing our strong momentum and performance here is a priority. While much attention is devoted to the ups and downs of generic launches, and we are certainly affected by these fluctuations, our model focuses on value creation throughout the generic product's lifecycle and this will help sustain growth in this product area.","As you know, we've worked hard at rebalancing our customer and product mix in Pharmaceutical Distribution, and those improvements are driving our margin expansion and profit dollar growth in the segment.","Moving to Nuclear, our business continues to be affected by the softness in the markets for cardiac nuclear imaging procedures, which we've referenced in recent calls. Our market share remains very healthy and our quality and service performance is industry-leading, but procedures have not yet remounted. Having said that, cardiac disease is not declining and nuclear cardiac imaging is still the gold standard. At some point, we would expect to see the negative trend reverse.","Our Specialty Solutions group continues its robust sales growth, recording an increase of almost 70% a quarter, the result of building important partnerships and an expanding market share. We know that growing sustainable profitability in this space will be driven by our continued expansion of scale, right mix of business and true innovation.","During the quarter, Specialty expanded its reach through new products and new relationships. Three technology products for physicians' offices were launched to help improve practice efficiency and connectivity to other stakeholders in healthcare. We continue to expand our network of specialty pharma clients that use our 3PL in healthcare analytics and marketing businesses. And we acquired a distributor of critical care pharmaceuticals during the quarter, Innovis, which leverages our existing platform in the specialty hospitals and blood plasma distribution space.","Our Medical segment reported 11% profit growth for the second quarter. As we told you last quarter, much of the attention of our customer-facing organization during the first quarter was devoted to addressing the change management issues following our major systems implementation. During the course of Q2, we were able to redeploy most of those resources back to selling the products and services which will help our customers deliver care.","We're making great progress and we continue to be encouraged by the response to the offerings which we believe will be increasingly important to our provider customers and our supplier partner.","Don Casey has now been on board leading our Medical segment for over 9 months and is doing terrific work in positioning the segment to adapt to the quickly evolving market, focusing on the right opportunities, refining our customer-facing efforts and investing in growth areas. At the same time, we have taken actions to improve efficiencies in areas where the competitive landscape dictates us. Jeff will touch on this a bit more during his comments.","While some of our progress in Medical was masked by the challenging procedural environment, our continued focus on improving our product mix resulted in increased profit contribution for our preferred products in the quarter [ph]. One of our newer initiatives, our integrated orthopedic solutions offering its design to deliver high-quality, lower-priced orthopedic products and associated service. We expect this line to create real, sustainable savings for our health system customers going forward.","Our Canadian business reported another quarter of double-digit growth for both revenue and profit, including the impact of last year's very successful acquisition and integration of Futuremed.","Our revenues in China were up over 35% and we achieved continued gross margin expansion. Our local direct distribution business continues to deliver very robust growth as we execute on our strategy of increasing market share by enlarging our geographical footprint and targeted acquisition, and exploring new business partnerships and programs in areas like consumer health and direct-to-patient distribution.","And finally, I'd like to note that Cardinal Health retained the #1 slot in Gartner's Fourth Annual Healthcare Supply Chain Top 25 ranking. We are gratified to maintain this position in this program that assesses value in the delivery of health care products.","So in summary, we had a strong first half of our fiscal year and we'll continue to focus on delivering on our mission of being Essential to care. This will require that we execute with discipline on our foundational business while at the same time demonstrating the innovative instincts that add value in an industry experiencing change.","And with that, I'll turn it to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Today, I plan to cover the drivers of our second quarter performance and key financial trends, and then make a few comments on our full year outlook. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Let me begin by saying I'm extremely happy with our strong 15% second quarter non-GAAP EPS growth. This keeps us well on track to achieve our full year goals. As George mentioned, with 6 months completed, we feel good about tightening our guidance to $3.42 to $3.50 per share; over the top half of the previously provided range.","Now let's move quickly to the income statement, starting with revenues. As we expected, and consistent with our overall guidance, consolidated revenues were down almost 7% to $25.2 billion due to the nonrenewal of the Express Scripts contract and the continued Pharmaceutical brand to generic conversions. Second quarter EPS growth was driven by 11% non-GAAP operating earnings growth, a slightly better tax rate and a lower share count versus 2012. Gross margin dollars increased 10% with the rate up 74 basis points versus prior year. SG&A expenses rose 9%, driven by recent acquisitions which were worth about 2 percentage points of this growth; an increase in IT cost, much of it related to our Medical Transformation; and investments in certain key strategic priorities, including Cardinal Health China.","Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 33 basis points to 2.08%. Interest and other expense was essentially flat to last year as a change in the value of our deferred compensation plan was largely offset by increased interest expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 36.8%, which is 1 percentage point lower than the prior year's quarter but in line with our full 2013 fiscal year guidance of 36.5% to 37.5%. The year-over-year variability was driven by net unfavorable discrete items during the prior year.","Share repurchases in fiscal 2012 and the first quarter of fiscal 2013 continue to positively impact our share count. Our diluted average shares outstanding were 343 million for the second quarter, over 5 million favorable to the prior year's quarter.","Now, let me comment on consolidated cash flows and the balance sheet. In Q2, we had a use of cash from operating activities of $130 million, which is in line with last year's amount and is fairly typical from a seasonal perspective. As previously indicated, we did see a negative impact of the nonrenewal of the Express Scripts contract during the quarter, which is mostly offset by timing of some large customer purchasing patterns. Year-to-date, operating cash flow of approximately $440 million is in line with where we were at this point last fiscal year.","As we discussed before, we continue to forecast some sizable tax payments in the second half of the year upon resolution of past tax agency audits. We ended Q2 with approximately $2.3 billion of cash, in which approximately $350 million is held overseas.","Our working capital days ended the quarter higher than the prior year, mainly driven by higher day sales outstanding due to the nonrenewal of the Express Scripts contract and growth in our strategic areas, particularly in China and Specialty Solutions.","Now, let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss Pharma first. Pharma segment revenue decreased 8% to $22.7 billion in Q2 due to the nonrenewal of the Express Scripts contract and continued brand-to-generic conversions. This decrease was partially offset by revenues from new customers within Pharmaceutical Distribution. On a particular note, sales to non-bulk customers continue to increase, up over 7% for the period. In Q2, sales in non-bulk customers represented 67% of the segment total versus 58% in last year's Q2.","Our generic programs continue to perform well, posting a revenue increase of 19% versus the prior year. Brand inflation was about what we expected, in the high-single digits. In Specialty Solutions, we continue to see good revenue growth of almost 70% versus last year's quarter. Other segment profit increased by 12% to $441 million in the quarter, driven by the overall strong performance of generics and the benefit of customer and product mix within the Pharmaceutical Distribution.","With respect to generics, we did see slightly less contribution from new generic launches in this year's quarter versus Q2 of fiscal 2012. And after experiencing unusual generic inflation in the first quarter, we saw a more typical rate of deflation in Q2, aligned with our expectations as certain of last year's significant generic launches are now being lapped.","Segment profit margin rate increased by 34 basis points compared to the prior year's Q2, a reflection of the strength of our generic programs and our focus on margin expansion and customer and product mix. In addition, within customer categories, margin expansion was strong across almost all of our customer classes of trade within Pharma Distribution. As George mentioned, the continued market softness in Nuclear, particularly impacting our low energy or SPECT business, dampened some of the Pharma segment profit growth during the quarter.","Now moving on to Medical. Medical revenue growth was up 3% versus last year or up $70 million. Our acquisition of Futuremed in Canada contributed 2.2 percentage points to the segment revenue growth rate in the quarter. Also, we had one additional sales day in the quarter which positively impacted segment revenue. If you exclude these drivers, year-on-year growth was about flat, reflecting the continued softness we are seeing in key U.S. markets, particularly as it relates to procedural volume.","From a profit perspective, after a less than hopeful start in Q1, we're reporting 11% growth in Medical segment profit this quarter. Commodities had a favorable $13 million impact versus last year. The integration of performance of Futuremed continues to go well. Our preferred products also contributed positively to segment profit. We continue to expand the breadth and depth of our product offerings as part of these key strategic initiatives. These profit improvements were partially offset by customer mix, as well as continued volume softness.","Now let's talk about the Medical Transformation for a few moments. As George said, we made good progress with some of the change management challenges we mentioned last quarter and fully expect that progress to continue. For the second quarter, the impact of the transformation was slightly negative when you consider all related factors, including year-over-year incremental depreciation and program expenses, realized benefits and a $5 million favorable out-of-period adjustment to reflect certain vendor chargeback billings as part of continued cleanup from the conversion to our new platform.","The Medical Business Transformation is one important foundational element of our strategy to reposition the Medical segment in the context of the rapidly evolving future of healthcare, and we continue other important initiatives to position ourselves for this future. These include our ongoing efforts to expand our preferred product categories and our focus on bringing value to the continuum of care. And it also includes a relentless focus on efficiency. In this regard, as George mentioned and as many of you saw in our 8-K filing last week, we are proactively making changes which we believe improve our competitive positioning and market focus.","Total charges expected with this restructuring plan are currently estimated at $79 million. About $33 million of that total are cash expenditures related to employee severance, with the remainder being loss on disposal of assets or facility exit costs. As a reminder, these charges will be excluded from our non-GAAP financials in future reporting periods. The majority of these charges will occur in fiscal 2013 and the benefits from this plan will begin to accrue in our fiscal 2014.","Moving to Cardinal Health China for a minute, which spans both segments, we once again posted strong double-digit revenue growth as we have since the acquisition. Our local direct distribution business continues to exhibit exceptional performance, growing revenues over 80% in the quarter. And overall, our operation there continues to expand its reach into new areas. We are leveraging our growing geographic reach, brand and reputation for data integrity, compliance and operational effectiveness to drive value for manufacturers, providers and patients.","Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter, which include items that had a positive $0.05 per share net after-tax impact on our non-GAAP results. Included in this figure was the exclusion of $0.05 of acquisition-related costs, primarily made up of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. We also had $0.01 worth of impairments and loss on disposal of assets which was also excluded from our non-GAAP results. Partially offsetting these items was $0.02 of litigation recoveries related to legal settlements. In the same quarter last year, GAAP results were also $0.05 per share lower than non-GAAP results, driven by acquisition-related costs.","Now, let's talk briefly about full year guidance. Our consolidated revenue guidance remains unchanged. Taking into account our first half performance and our best estimate for the second half of the fiscal year, we now expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the top half of our previous range, meaning $3.42, $3.50 per share.","I'm not going to walk through all the underlying assumptions behind this EPS guidance as most haven't changed since our Q1 call, but I do want to highlight a few items.","We are holding our interest and other range to $105 million to $115 million, however, we now expect the full year to come in at the low end of the range. As it relates to our fiscal 2013 Medical segment outlook, we now expect revenues for the year to be more in line with what we see in the first half of this fiscal year. Also, we continue to target double-digit profit growth, but we'll continue to watch utilization as it is a large driver of both top and bottom line performance.","With regards to the medical device tax that kicked in on January 1, under today's interpretation of IRS rules, we expect that the negative impact of this tax could be at, or even slightly below, the bottom end of our previous estimate of $13 million to $23 million for the second half of fiscal 2013. As a reminder, this tax will be recorded as an SG&A expense. The IRS provided final regulations paired with interim guidance in December 2012, and has requested additional comments on the interim guidance, so there's always a possibility that interpretation could change over time.","A few final words related to guidance before I wrap up. Our general practice is to not provide quarterly expectations, but I do want to highlight a few issues. First, as a reminder, in last year's third quarter, we realized significant benefits from the generic launches of Lipitor and Zyprexa.","And finally, I would remind you that our guidance has always included certain assumptions on customer contract renewals for both Pharma and Medical, and continues to do so as we look into the second half.","So let me conclude with this. I feel very good about our strong consolidated performance this quarter, but I feel equally good that at the same time, as a company, we are taking the necessary steps to realign our businesses while market environments are evolving and position ourselves strategically and operationally for the future.","With that, let's begin Q&A. Shannon, please take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jeff, you mentioned that second half guidance includes some assumptions regarding contract renewals, so can you provide us with an update on the status of Walgreen and CVS contracts and where are you now in the process?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Let me start off there. Ricky, thanks for the question, and then I'll turn it to George to make any comments as well. First of all, with regards to my comments about assumptions for contract renewals, as we've always said in the past, we start out each fiscal year -- we do make certain assumptions in our forecast, in our plan related to renewals of contracts, and that's true for both the Pharma segment and the Medical segment. And as part of that, we also make certain assumptions regarding which contract may or may not get renewed early, what the pricing may be on those contracts, et cetera, and that all goes into the total set of assumptions that goes into our forecast and plan for the year and obviously, into our guidance as well. So that's standard procedure not only for this year, but every year in which we are facing contract renewals. Regarding the specific status of the Walgreens and CVS contracts, obviously, it's going to be difficult for us to comment there, but let me just turn it to George to...","George S. Barrett","Yes. Ricky, there's very little to say at this stage. What I can say to you is that, as you know, the timing is not in our hands. But I would say that just based on the expiration date of the contract and the typical sequence of things, we would expect that during this March quarter, we would get a good indication as to how this would go. Of course, it's unlikely that we'd be announcing anything until contracts are signed, but that's just sort of a lay of the land, but beyond that, it's hard to provide a lot of additional color.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then one thought on the comments about the March quarter and the generic comparisons. So obviously, this quarter you've shown, at least based on our back of the envelope, very nice step-up in gross profit for the Distribution segment. When we think about that, taking in mind the generic challenges but also kind of like the fact that historically, March quarter was better due to the seasonality of branded inflation, can you quantify for at what percent of that kind of like uptick in gross profit is -- would be sustainable into the March quarter?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Ricky, I'm not sure I fully understand your question. What I will say, though, is that we do expect a negative compare in Q3 related to the specific issue of the value from new generic launches. Again, as a reminder, Q3 of FY '12 was a fairly phenomenal and unique period with respect to new generic launches because we had 2 very, very large branded products, Zyprexa and Lipitor, that were still in their 180-day exclusivity period and obviously, that was very beneficial for us and the other distributors from a profitability perspective. If you fast-forward a year now, those products are now off exclusivity so you would expect that they will be contributing less to our bottom line, considerably less to our bottom line than they were last year. And as I said, the overall comparison of value from new generic launches, Q3 this year versus Q3 last year, is a negative. So that's probably the one thing I could call out for Q3. Regarding the broader question, again, we don't generally give Q3 guidance, so I'll probably have to stay silent on that, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But just to clarify, I think you've spoken about it in the past, but when we think about generics, we think about it as the contribution from new generics but also the generic penetration rates. So I guess the question is, are the generic penetration rates that you've seen year-to-date, should we assume that they are sustainable going forward and should serve as a headwind?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Ricky, let me just sort of comment, and it'll be probably a little more general than you'd like, but that's the way I'll need to keep it for now. So our generic programs are going very well. Our penetration rates are high. Overall utilization in the system is very high. Those pressures that are driving systemwide utilization are not declining and that's all good news for us. And you've probably heard me say this, obviously, the launches are important to us, but we really focus on the notion of value creation throughout the lifecycle of the generic drugs. As you know, that can be a pretty long -- large cycle, so we feel pretty good about where we are and we expect to get continued, real value from our generic programs.","Operator","Our next question is from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a couple of questions on the medical side of the business. I think, George, you made some comments around investing in growth areas for med-surg, and I really had 2 questions. One, can you maybe talk about some of the investments that you're making on that side of the business? And then secondly, a question for you, Jeff, would just be around the margins. If I look at your comments on commodities and if I were to back that out and look at year-over-year growth, it doesn't look like margins are really expanding on the med-surg side of the business. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing underlying from a competitive standpoint?","George S. Barrett","So Lisa, why don't I start -- excuse me, Lisa, why don't I start and then Jeff can pick up. So generally speaking, the focus of our medical business has been extending our footprint, which we've been doing, as you know, trying to make sure that our positioning in the ambulatory centers are in the best position possible. We've done, I think, better on the surgical centers than we have in the physicians' office, but I think that area was affected probably most by the conversions we referenced in Q1, and investing very heavily in the preferred products program. We really do believe that this is a long-term value creator for our customers and for us. So those are the 2 areas that I would highlight as we look at the medical benefit and real focus areas. Jeff, do you want to touch on the second part?","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wait. Before you touch on that, Jeff, if I think about this, George, that should be much better margin business as we go forward because, one, your preferred product has a better margin; and two, generally speaking, ambulatory or physician has better margin than the hospital. Is that the right way to think about it?","George S. Barrett","I think in general, if you look at our priority areas, they tend to be positive to mix. Remember, I talked to you about our focus on not just efficiency but on portfolio mix, and I think what you're saying is largely correct.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And can you give us any idea of how quickly -- what your expectations are over the next couple of years? Do you have growth targets of expansion for private label, as well as ambulatory that you can give us an idea of how to think about this, or is it too early in the process?","George S. Barrett","It's a bit early for us to give firm goals here externally, but you'll probably hear more from us, Lisa, about this as the program unfolds. But we have internally aggressive targets for growing these areas. We think they really are valuable to our customers. And as you said, they also tend to be margin-accretive to us.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Lisa, I will remind you, at our Investor Day a few years ago, we did indicate that our goal in the medium term was to get preferred products to 30% of our segment revenue. Currently it's in the 23%, 24% range. Obviously, with Don on board, we're continuing to look at our strategy and his focus and efforts to accelerate the preferred products have been considerable, and we expect to continue to drive very aggressively on that front. Regarding your question on margins, I would say there were a number of factors driving margins both up and down in the quarter. I'd say on the positive side, clearly, commodities were a positive benefit, which was good news. After 2 years of facing the headwind, it\u2019s nice to have a bit of a tailwind behind us in that regard. Secondly, I'd say preferred product mix within the overall sales contributed to margin. And then the performance of Canada, including the integration of Futuremed, was a positive. On the negative side, we face the normal competitive environment in terms of pricing, and I would say, nothing to notable to note there other than always, our customers are looking for increased efficiency. Secondly, I'd say there was a slight negative impact from customer mix and that was just more a consequence of who bought what during the quarter. And then the third one, which I will highlight again, is really the impact of utilization. That has several impacts on us as you would expect, but probably most notably, particularly when procedural utilization is down, whether that's inpatient or outpatient, given that the large majority of our preferred products tend to be used for procedures, if we're facing a relatively stagnant utilization environment, that limits our ability to maximize the sales of preferred products. So overall mix in the quarter was probably not what we would have hoped if utilization would've been a little bit more robust.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jeff, just a follow-up on the medical guidance for the operating profit. It sounds like you're still calling for double-digit growth there this year. If I -- even if I include the $5 million out-of-period adjustment, it looks like maybe year-to-date, year-over-year, you're up a couple of percent. Is there some catch-up we should be thinking about in the back half? Is there a benefit catch-up from MedTrend or something else, a tailwind in the back half that can get the back half significantly above year-over-year double digits to make the full year double-digit growth there?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. Great question, Bob. A couple of things I'd point you to. Number one, we'll continue see benefit of commodity prices in the second half of the year. Some of the positive boom that we saw, particularly in Q1, really starts to flow through the income statement in Q3. Assuming we don't see a dramatic movement in rates for the next month or 2, for the second half of the year, commodities will be a significant positive. The second thing I'm going to point to is what you referred to as -- we do expect the benefit from the Medical Business Transformation to continue to accelerate over the course of the year. As we said before, we got a little bit delayed by 3 or 4 months at the beginning due to some change management issues, but we're still very much committed to ramping up the benefit each and every quarter and so, as we would expect, net-net, the benefit to be stronger in the second half of the year. And I would say the continued efforts to drive preferred products, et cetera, they should continue to manifest themselves in our results as well. So those are all positive drivers that we expect, not only for the second half of the year, but beyond. I would say slightly offsetting that, we do have the medical device tax which, although it's lower than we were probably forecasting at the beginning of the year, it's still a negative this second half. And then there's still the uncertainty regarding utilization that -- it has been pretty sluggish in the first half of the year, and how exactly that plays out over the next 6 months remains to be seen. So I would say those are the major moving factors for us as we look at the second half of the year.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My follow-up, Jeff, actually would just be around utilization. It seems like, listening to some of the medical device manufacturers and some of the larger hospital providers this quarter, it sounds like they're actually seeing a slight pickup in elective procedure volumes, into year-end specifically. I mean, did you -- you guys are obviously still very much calling this a very sluggish environment. I mean, did you see anything even directionally sequentially that would indicate that things are picking up? Just trying to reconcile some of the updates that we've gotten across the utilization front this quarter.","George S. Barrett","Yes, Bob, it's George. Here's what I'd say, it would even be hard to call it utilization trend. Utilization is unbelievably choppy and it -- depending on the month, the setting, and the source of the data, so even sample size on some of this data is quite variable. So we have not seen what I would say is a discernible pattern. We will see a spike and look with enthusiasm in the next months will roll back again. So we've not been able to yet discern a trend, although there certainly have been periods where it looks like it's picking up but then we've not seen a sustained -- sustained trend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo of Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, I just was kind of curious about some of the comments you made in your prepared remarks regarding generic pricing. You seemed to suggest that in your fiscal first quarter, you saw some very healthy or unusual year-over-year inflation and then that trend reversed in 2Q to more typical rates of deflation. I was wondering if there was anything sort of behind that move or anything we should be thinking about in the back half of the fiscal year as far as generic pricing may be concerned.","George S. Barrett","Great. Thanks, Glen. Here's what I would say about pricing. Jeff really touched on it. The swing from inflation and deflation was largely a product of this year-over-year lapping of those key product launches and that which resulted in the loss of exclusivity. I would say in general, generic pricing has not changed materially since we last spoke the last quarter. So this was largely as expected; I would not describe any material change.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So maybe if I could just ask one more. In the press release, you seem to suggest the profit from the Medical Business Transformation was negative. This process has been going on for several years now and I'm kind of curious, I mean, can you give us a sense for how much additional money do you think you need to spend on this process? What steps are still necessary? And what do you think the timing is going to be to sort of complete this process?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Just as a reminder for everyone on the call, we went live with the Medical Transformation on February 1, and since that point, particularly through the first quarter of this year, we were in the process of getting used to the new system and getting our customers and suppliers used to the new system, and that really is the change management process that we referred to earlier. So it's really been, in Q2 of this year and beyond that we've been able to focus on beginning to really utilize the value the system brings to us and our customers and our suppliers, and getting back to selling products as opposed to getting used to the new system. So it has taken a period of time to get through that, but as George alluded to in his comments, we do believe that we're largely through that process and back on the upswing. Regarding incremental spend, I would say the vast, vast majority of the spend on these programs is behind us. Are we still spending a couple of million dollars a quarter to fine-tune the system? As you would expect at this stage of implementation, yes. There are certain things we're seeing that could be improved, there are certain things our customers are asking for to improve their interaction with the system, and we're making those continued investments to ensure that this system is as robust as possible. But in the scheme of things, those expenditures are very small.","Operator","Our next question is from George Hill of Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jeff, just a point of clarification, a follow-up on Ricky's question. Did I hear it right that we're expecting operating profit in the drug distribution segment to be down and margins to be down year-over-year due to generic comparisons?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","No. What I said is in Q3, the value from new generic launches will be lower in Q3 within Pharmaceutical Distribution than it was last year. And that's really a comp issue in that last year's new generic launches were fairly unique and quite phenomenal from a contribution perspective. But that speaks just to the value of new generic launches. As we've said before, generic profitability in total is driven by much, much more than just new generic launches. It's driven by our penetration of existing accounts, our new accounts, our ability to continue to supply better. And regardless of how the year-on-year compare for generic launches necessarily looks, for this full year, we would expect the overall profitability of the generics to be a materially positive in total.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up in MedSurg, with respect to the most recent restructuring announcement, as I think about just the cash component of that and the employee severance, assuming the company isn't paying severed employees in multiple of their current salary, for fiscal '14, that $33 million figure, probably that figure or greater, you should think about as kind of a earnings accretion component for fiscal '14? Am I thinking about that right?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. I'm not going to get into the specifics of that. That's something we'll cover when we give our guidance for next year. But I will say that some of that severance represents net headcount reduction. But in other cases, it's a relocation of employee headcount. So we are moving some of our production particularly our kitting production, to lower-cost locations. So I would not necessarily say all those employees are going away. They're probably, net-net, we are reducing some employees, but it's really about an overall reduction in product costs related to efficiency of operations and location of production.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, so that $33 million is not like a net salary reduction?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","That's something I would comment on -- that's correct. And like I said, we'll talk about the savings when we give guidance for next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Rhyee of Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe moving over the pharma side a little bit here and getting to nuclear, and obviously, you talked about the procedure volume being soft. Can you just remind us, what procedures have cardiologists been using currently if they're not using nuclear imaging? And why would the procedure volumes necessarily come back at this point if they're managing without it?","George S. Barrett","So, yes. It's an interesting question and I think it's a somewhat interesting systemic question. I think there probably has been some petty oversight when you look at the payers as to how procedures are done, how frequently they're done, what is the pathway that should be followed as it relates to doing procedures. And we're seeing that probably is happening all around healthcare right now. So I think, in general, this is still the tool used, but it's a question of when it's used, at what stage, and I think that's probably what we're seeing. That's why we'd expect, if there's some correction in the system going to the issue of maybe excess utilization, and we're probably seeing this in other areas of imaging, then we might see some correction. I would expect that at some point, we would see a recovery based on the normal demand, based on what's actually happening in cardiac disease.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe one follow-up question on the Pharma side, I know you guys just mentioned that the generic, you have a tough compare on the generics side. But one of your peers talked about a brand manufacturer sort of inflation benefit getting pushed into the March quarter. Based on your fee-for-service contracts, do you expect something similar to that?","George S. Barrett","So again, we're not going to guide by the quarter, but I think what I'd say, generally speaking, is that branded price increases have been relatively robust for our year-to-date. So we won't guide as it relates to what's happening in our Q3 or Q4 specifically. But generally year-to-date, we'd say brand inflation has been relatively robust.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Robust and I'd say generally in line with what we've expected so far. We haven't seen any significant shift versus our expectations.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Muken of ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So on specialty, I know, again, we're coming off of a fairly low base, but it seems like the momentum in that business has kind of continued to you. I know it's been a big focus. Are you starting to see the types of wins or the places where you're having more success in terms of the profile of customer change? What's been the sort of network effect of sort of your increased presence there versus where you were virtually out of the market several years ago? How are you just thinking about the trajectory of how well you're doing in that piece?","George S. Barrett","Well, the trajectory has been good. I think for us, it's been important for us to build scale, which we've been doing. You've seen the growth rate. That was also important in terms of our -- solidifying all those relationships with the manufacturers. They want to make sure they're working with a partner that has good reach, and we've been able to accomplish that. I think our work has really been about expanding, not just that distribution reach but also the services work that we're doing in oncology, in neurology and some work in rheumatology. So trying to provide value drivers for those practices in combination with the work that we're doing in building out our distribution operations has been a good combination. But again, we still have quite a way to go, but progress is encouraging.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And in the China business; again, another area of strength for you. What are some of the new initiatives you're sort of pursuing in that market? Anything on the specialty end? And then where have we been from sort of a tuck-in acquisition standpoint in that region?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Russ, this is Jeff. As I said, we continue to be very excited about the performance of China and maybe even more excited about the future potential of the business. I'll answer your questions in reverse order. In terms of acquisitions, we have now completed the -- we have now signed 6 acquisitions since the original Yong Yu acquisition. So 6 in addition to Yong Yu. Four of those have closed, 2 of those are still in the approval process with the government. I would say all of those deals have been less than $30 million and some considerably less than that, because as I said before, it's not so much about buying large volume, it's about ensuring that we have geographic presence in the key population centers of China, which we view as about 25 locations that are critical to our strategy going forward. So that geographic expansion process continues to go very well, both through those acquisitions and through organic means. At the same time, as you referred to, we're looking to layer additional business models on top of our geographic channel. One of those is the direct-to-patient pharmacies that we've setting up. We now have 6 of those in the country. They're doing very well. And the number of products and the number of manufacturers looking to use those pharmacies to get the products to patients continues to expand nicely. So we're very excited about what we can bring to those pharmacies, which is integrity, compliance and our brand in a way that is very appealing to both the manufacturer and the patient. We also continued to expand our consumer health care business, and this is about bringing over-the-counter health care products mainly from Western manufacturers to retail pharmacy. Just given the nature of the retail pharmacy system in China, it's very difficult for manufacturers to get on the shelf sometimes and get promoted and we provide the opportunity through our distribution and merchandising network to bring products to customers through these pharmacies in a way that hasn't necessarily been possible for Western manufacturers before. So that's very exciting and that's ramping up. We continue to build our med device business. Again, it's somewhat different from our U.S. business given the nature of the Chinese market, but we're having great success dealing with med device and MedSurg manufacturers looking to get their products to market in what is a very complex supply chain in China. So these are all things that we're pushing forward very quickly and I think all have great hope for the future.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick question on the potential market share gains in various channels in U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution. So obviously in the U.S., there's one big PBM customer that was lost, there was one big supermarket retailer that was added. It's been talked about in the investment community. But without naming names, just curious, were there any other material customer wins in the U.S. that maybe helped drive growth in the quarter? Maybe you could talk about it by channel, whether it's retail GPOs or hospitals or whatever. Just trying to get a sense for any other noteworthy customer wins.","George S. Barrett","Yes, thanks. I would say there's probably not anything that would be noteworthy. Again, our concentration on a couple of key accounts, obviously, is one that people are well aware of. But obviously, our distribution includes whatever, 15,000, 16,000 other customers. And so I would say that the ones that you've highlighted are the ones that are worth noting on publicly. But by and large, nothing else that is moving the needle in some dramatic way.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Yes, that's helpful. I mean, all we're trying to compare some of the growth across all the companies in this particular segment and your growth was definitely pretty strong versus some of the peers, so I guess I'll just say congrats on a strong execution.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallucci of Lazard Capital.","Colleen Lang - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","This is Colleen Lang on for Tom. Jeff, can you just talk about your priorities for capital deployment or use of cash for the remainder of year?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. Thank you for the question. I'm not going to put it in the context of the remainder of the year because I think capital deployment is sort of a longer-term strategy. But I would say our longer-term philosophy really hasn't changed from what we've spoken about before. We view it as very balanced and somewhat opportunistic depending on the availability of cash and the opportunities we see in front of us. I think it starts with a commitment to a competitive, sustained and growing dividend payout which we've demonstrated over the past 9 months with a almost 27% increase in our dividend, which I think continues to put us really at the forefront of health care services company in terms of that dividend payout and yield. We're also committed to continuing to fund our organic capital expenditures which, this year, we've guided to being somewhere in the $210 million to $225 million range and most of that tends to be concentrated in the IT space. Beyond that, it really is an opportunistic determination between selective M&A and share repo. We are -- we'll continue to look for nonorganic opportunities to accelerate some of our strategic priorities as we've done in the past and we will continue to opportunistically look to buy back shares depending on the market and our share price and windows of availability, et cetera. In any given quarter, and perhaps in any given year, you could see some fluctuations in terms of the balance. So as you saw 3 years ago, we tended to be tilted towards acquisitions; for the past 2-plus years, we've tended to be tilted towards share repo. But again, that's based on opportunities and availability of cash. Overall, our longer-term philosophy hasn't changed.","Operator","Our next question is from John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","To the Pharma segment, it's a longer-term question. Can you give us your thoughts -- do you think you can hold or improve the EBIT margin where you're showing some great gains as you move into a period with lower new generic launches?","George S. Barrett","Yes, good question. But we really do believe that the margin expansion is a product of multiple parts of our strategy. Part of it is the way we've approached customer mix. Part of it is the way that we've looked at product mix, and particularly, the way that we've driven our generic programs. Part of it is our overall approach to efficiency and the services that we're providing and how we get compensated for those services. So in general, I would say the pattern has been pretty consistent over these past couple of years. Obviously, it's our goal is to continue. That direction of margin expansion is a high priority for us. We measure it religiously. But we're really doing it in a way that addresses customer needs and that's the key. So we've been encouraged at the progress and we really will continue to focus on this very heavily.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then a quick follow-up on Specialty, it sounds like you had very good revenue growth again in that segment. Can you just expand a bit more about what's driving that? Where are you seeing the best traction, which kind of disease categories, what kind of cross-selling are you seeing? Just any elaboration would be great.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I would -- again, I would say primarily, our work has been in -- oncology is where we've gotten the greatest traction. We have had some progress around neurology, which is a relatively new area for us. But again, it's not just the distribution for us. It's building out the technology services. The specialty space has some unique characteristics. Heavy clinical orientation, a bit more orientation around technology, and we've been investing on that. It takes time and it takes the right talent and we've also been building out the right team to do that. So I don't think I'd attribute it to one thing, but I think as you develop the services that enable the practice, it builds credibility. It's a small universe of physicians who talk to one another and we're just generally making progress there. Again, plenty of room to grow, but making good progress.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Just to build on that, as George said, I think right now the dollar growth is coming from oncology. But I would also say we're having great success in penetrating both neurology, as George said, but also rheumatology, and that's really about laying the platform for the future as we see future specialty drugs coming down the platform, particularly RA establishing a strong market share in that area and building on that is very important.","Operator","Our next question is from David Larsen of Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Total revenue from China, is that around $1.5 billion now and do you expect it to continue to grow at a double-digit rate? And can you just comment on operating margins in China? Are those typically better than the book overall?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, we think we're at a run rate now of somewhere between $1.5 billion and $2 billion revenue for China. The margin rates do tend to be better than what we see in the U.S. and we expect that to continue over time. In terms of revenue growth rate, yes, we are very much expecting and driving strong double-digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future as we continue to build our presence there. So yes to all questions.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just real quick on the pharma division, the 34 bps of expansion year-over-year, that looks very, very good compared to what we were modeling. Any sense as to how much of that came from Express Scripts sort of rolling off the books?","George S. Barrett","Obviously, that was a factor and I don't want to get too specific about how much given the competitive nature of our pricing, et cetera. But it was a driver although I don't think was the most important driver for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Willoughby of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jeff, the inventory build this quarter was almost negligible relative to prior years despite a better revenue run rate than we were modeling. How much of that was Express Scripts and more generic's or other factors? And what kind of liquidation would you expect to see over the next couple of quarters?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","First of all, Express Scripts did have some impact on inventory, obviously, as we unwound that account although you have to look at it in the context of payables and receivables as well. But if you're talking specifically about inventory, yes, the unwind of Express Scripts definitely had a positive impact in terms of reducing inventory for the quarter. I think most of that unwind has happened. I don't see any further impact from the unwind of Express Scripts influencing Q3 or Q4. However, I do see continued efforts from both Medical and Pharma to get more efficient about inventory and that effort won't change in either segment.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Don't you have a seasonal liquidation, though, in the current quarter and the June quarter as well?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, we would expect that, although obviously, receivables and payables would move in tandem with that as well. So -- but yes, we tend to carry a fair amount of inventory at year end. And as you said, that was somewhat dampened this year because of the Express Scripts unwind, but then with that inventory would tend to get liquidated in the Q3 and Q4. I think your question was specifically about Express Scripts but more broadly, yes, you would see that trend. But again, keep in mind, for some of the inventory that we carry at the end of the year, we've also got payables for it so it doesn't necessarily all flow to the operating cash flow line.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Shifting gears a little bit to overall OpEx, similar to your peers, all year long and also similar to Street views, current level of operating expenses were again a headwind this quarter, coming in at about 16 bps higher than us in the Street as a percent of revenue. You highlighted M&A, IT, strategic investments, et cetera. I guess I have a 2-part question. One, can you give us the firm level OpEx net of these call outs; i.e. would it have been flat nominally, down nominally, et cetera? And then number two, should we be using a permanently higher SG&A to sales ratio and growth rate as we look forward? Or would you expect the leverage on OpEx to reignite in fiscal '14 and beyond, and maybe what the drivers are there?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Okay, yes, why don't you just take it, Jeff?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, so first of all, for the quarter, if you look at total SG&A last year to this year, and I'm going to talk about non-GAAP SG&A. It's up about $60 million year-on-year. About $12 million of that is related to acquisitions, about $5 million of that related to deferred compensation, which is always a bit of a swing factor in a quarter that can't be forecasted related to stock market movements. $10-plus million of that increase is related to some of our strategic initiatives, including China, especially in preferred products. We've got a little over $8 million of depreciation now related to MBT that flows through each quarter. So I mean, those are the specific things I would call out. I would say the first half of the year, our growth rate in SG&A was fairly robust because of those factors. I would expect that to moderate in the second half of the year. But I would describe the first half of the year as somewhat abnormal in terms of overall SG&A growth rates. But in terms of where it's being directed, I'm actually quite happy that we're placing it in the right places. It's growing into acquisitions which are over-performing. It's going into our strategic priorities. And it's going into our Medical Business Transformation, which we're relying on to drive a great deal of value going forward. So it's very carefully being apportioned throughout the organization.","George S. Barrett","Eric, I would just add, this is something that we actually track very carefully. So it's not just tracking our SG&A expenses, but it's looking at the allocation of those expenses to the areas internal that we deem to be strategically are very relevant to us. So we try to make sure we're not spending in areas where we don't add infrastructure and we are spending in areas where we think it can create sustainable value.","Operator","Our next question is from David Toung of Argus Research.","David H. Toung - Argus Research Company","Yes. Jeff, I think you called out the margin contribution from the China business. You also called out the growth in specialty from a revenue perspective. Can you give some color into the positive contribution from specialty?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. I would say we're not prepared to give the specifics on that. The business is still ramping up. It's still relatively a small portion of our overall profitability. We're happy with where the revenue is going. From a profit standpoint, as we indicated in previous calls, there's some dampening effect from the fact that some of our pharma services revenue that we have been benefiting from previously has dropped off from a unique situation with one of our manufacturer customers. So that's tended to dampen the profit impact over the past few quarters. But we remain excited about the momentum that we're gaining on the sales side and continue to be very focused on how we drive profitability from that revenue into all areas of the Specialty business, but it's probably a little bit too early to comment on the specific profitability from that business.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to George Barrett for closing remarks.","George S. Barrett","Great. Thank you.

Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host Lisa Capodici. Please go ahead.","Lisa Capodici","Thank you, Bryce. Good morning and welcome to Cardinal Health's second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann; and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez.","During the call we will provide details on our second quarter results, full year outlook and an update on our strategic initiatives. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties.","During the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. Our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. In addition during the call we will provide an update to our fiscal 2019 outlook on a non-GAAP basis. We do not provide guidance on a GAAP basis due to the difficulty in predicting items that we exclude from our non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP effective tax rate.","During the Q&A portion of today's call, we ask that you limit your questions to one with one follow-up, so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional questions.","And with that I will turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Let me begin with some comments on our second quarter of fiscal 2019 and then I'll provide a brief update on the progress we're making on our strategic initiatives to drive future growth. With the first half under our belt, I'm very pleased that we're on track with executing our plan. Overall the second quarter came in ahead of our expectations led by the pharma segment.","EPS for the quarter was $1.29 and revenue up $37.7 billion was up 7%. Operating earnings were $637 million and operating cash flow was $372 million. Based on the year-to-date performance we're raising our guidance range for non-GAAP EPS for the full year to $4.97 to $5.17 from our previous range of $4.90 to $5.15. Jorge will walk you through the details and our current assumption.","Our confidence in raising our guidance for fiscal 2019 is based on the tangible results we're beginning to see from the hard work being performed across the enterprise, as we execute on our top priorities. Turning now to the pharma segment, a few comments. Overall this business continues to be powered by our partnerships with strong growing customers and the critical role we play in supporting their mission day in and day out. Serving more than 26,000 pharmacies on a daily basis and 10,000 specialty physician offices and clinics we're integral to their businesses and to their success meeting patients' needs. Further I'm proud that our team continues to develop innovative new ways to enhance the value we provide the customers.","After performance revenue for the segment was up 8% to $33.7 billion. As anticipated our generics program remain the most significant profit headwind and overall generic market dynamics remain consistent with prior quarter. On the positive side, we benefited from improvement in brand volume. Within this environment, driving down our cost and increasing efficiency remains critical and during the quarter, we saw positive impact from the cost reduction initiatives we have underway. An additional highlight was our specialty business which continued its strong momentum during the quarter outperforming our expectations. Specialty once again delivered excellent revenue and profit growth driven by higher volumes as well as mix.","In the medical segment, revenue for the quarter up $4 billion was about flat a year ago reflecting the China and naviHealth divestiture. Importantly, we're making good progress on the major strategic initiatives we have underway to drive better results and longer term growth. Patient Recovery continues to achieve integration milestones including most recently exiting our last major TSA in Asia Pacific in late January. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the longer term growth potential of this business. At Cordis, our stabilization program is also on track and the steps we've taken are beginning to have impact. Service levels and fill rates are up, while back orders and inventory expenses are moving down. The team continues to optimize the product mix and streamline our geographic footprint. We remain confident that Cordis will be on a path to profitable growth by the end of the fiscal year.","Finally, our services business and Cardinal Health at home will once again standout this quarter reflecting ongoing strong demand from both. Services continues to expand it niche providing value added technology and logistic support to our partners, while the at-Home business is capitalizing on a number of larger healthcare trend. All in all the medical segment team is executing and making solid progress. Further, as we look ahead, given our expanded offering of medical products and services coupled with our strong distribution network. We see opportunities to drive long-term growth especially in Cardinal Health brand products.","Let me now turn briefly to our strategic priorities. Beyond my earlier comments on Patient Recovery and Cordis, overall we're making good progress and remain laser focused on how we can deliver the greatest value. With respect to our cost structure as you know back in August, we announced a significant cost savings program. And as Jorge will discuss we're well positioned to exceed both our near term target of $100 million in annualized savings for fiscal year 2019 and our longer term goal of at least $200 million. In addition the team continues to actively review how we operate and seek further opportunities to reduce cost. We have a significant number of work streams and flight looking at both what we do and how we do it.","As it relates to our pharma model, we continue to actively discuss evolving industry dynamics and evaluate new models with both our upstream manufacturer and downstream provider partners. This includes continuing to push with differentiated pricing models with providers and less contingent margins with manufacturers. And finally, regarding capital deployment Jorge will provide a few update. I would just note, that we continue to execute a very disciplined and thoughtful strategy to fund the future growth of the business, return cash to shareholders and maintain our healthy balance sheet. Supporting all of this work, of course are our people. And I'm thrilled that we continue to strengthen and enhance our leadership team.","Since our last call, Victor Crawford joined us CEO of the Pharma segment and he has brought highly relevant skills and insights as we navigate our evolving industry landscape. In addition, just this week Brian Rice joined as our Chief Information Officer to lead our global technology and customer service teams. Brian brings deep experience leading global IT and business services and we look forward to benefiting from his expertise and perspective. In summary, while we still have a lot of work to do there is much to be excited about.","As I look back over the past year, we've made significant progress improving execution, sharpening our portfolio, getting after cost and strengthening our leadership team. Going forward our core distribution businesses will continue to be essential to the healthcare system. We will continue to adjust our pharma distribution business to improve profitability and leverage our medical distribution business with our significant portfolio of Cardinal Health products. At the same time, we will invest in our current growth platforms such as specialty, at-Home and our services businesses.","Let me wrap up by extending my thanks and appreciation to our entire team for their hard work this past quarter and for their dedication and continuing to advance our strategic initiatives. We look forward to building on this solid foundation over the balance of the year. With the ultimate objective of delivering the greatest value for our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve.","And with that, let me now turn the call over to Jorge.","Jorge Gomez","Thanks Mike and thank you all for joining us this morning. We're pleased with the second quarter performance. We're seeing progress in many areas as some of our strategic priorities begin to translate into results. Today, I'll focus on three areas our Q2 results, our full year outlook and updates on a few of our strategic priorities. Overall performance in Q2 was better than anticipated due to a few factors. Several businesses exceeded our expectations, we saw volume favorability in the pharmaceutical segments, better than anticipated expense trends and a favorable ruling regarding the New York State opioid assessment.","Off note, there was also some positive impact from a timing perspective with corporate expenses and other areas. Total company revenue increased to $37.7 billion up 7% versus prior year. Total company gross margin was down 7% from last year to about $1.7 billion. Operating earnings were $637 million. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 28.5% a 2.3 percentage point increase was prior year driven by tax reform and discrete tax items. Our EPS for the quarter was $1.29, a 15% decrease versus last year.","During Q2, we saw a 3% improvement in SG&A due to a divestiture of China distribution and naviHealth businesses as well as the early benefit from our ongoing cost optimization efforts which I'll discuss when I cover our strategic priorities. Interest and other expense increased 18% versus prior year to about $97 million in Q2. This was driven by the change in the value of our deferred compensation plan. As a reminder, this mark-to-market adjustment has an equal offset in SG&A expenses and the net impacts through bottom line is zero.","Q2 average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 300 million, about 16 million fewer shares than last year largely due to the approximately $600 million of shares that we have repurchased year-to-date. Our Q2 operating cash flow was $372 million bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $736 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.2 billion with about $695 million held outside the US.","Now I'll turn the segment results. Pharmaceutical segment revenue increased 8% to $33.7 billion driven by sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. This increase was partially offset by the divestiture of the China distribution business. Q2 segment profit was $443 million versus $514 million last year. As anticipated this decrease was primarily driven by the negative impact from generics program performance and to a lesser extent by customer contract renewals, a China divestiture and opioids litigation expenses. These headwinds were partially offset by the strong performance of specialty as well as by pharmaceutical distribution brand volume and initial benefit from our cost optimization work.","Now I'll briefly provide an update regarding the New York state Opioid Stewardship Act. As many of you know in December. A Federal District Court ruled against this law. As a result, during Q2 we've reversed $5 million we had originally accrued in Q1. We also revert the $29 million we accrued for all of calendar 2017 and for the first half of calendar 2018 which was excluded from non-GAAP as we said previously.","Additionally, we did not need to incur the assessment amount that we originally contemplated for Q2. We continue to monitor this matter and we're following the appeal filed in January by the State of New York. Continuing to medical, segment revenue was down slightly to $4 billion driven by the divestitures of the China distribution and naviHealth businesses offset by growth from existing customers. We saw strong top and bottom line growth in Cardinal Health at-Home and services.","Segment profits decreased 14% to $188 million. This decline reflects increased costs as well as the divestitures I just mentioned. The increased costs related to Cardinal Health brand products and include raw materials prices, SG&A expenses related to TSA exit and global supply chain improvement initiatives. These costs were partially offset by the non-repeat of the prior year Patient Recovery inventory step up charge.","Regarding the raw materials, we're beginning to see some encouraging data points in the spot markets. However, remember the changes in spot prices take time to flow through our P&L due to the lack in manufacturing and supply chain cost accounting roll outs. As part of the broader work [ph] to drive efficiencies across the medical segment we're streamlining the global supply chain for the full portfolio including Patient Recovery and Cordis as Mike mentioned.","Regarding Patient Recovery, we're pleased with the performance of the business and the progress we made to-date. Overall, the integration work is progressing as expected. Our team continues to work through some of the typical challenges being in large integrations and this work will continue over the balance of the calendar year. We anticipate exiting the remaining minor transition agreement by mid fall as planned. Finally, we continue to be on track to meet our accretion goal.","A quick update on Cordis, we continue to make progress on our stabilization plan and metrics continue to improve. We have seen an improvement in service levels and nearly 20% reduction in SKUs and significantly better management of consigned inventory. Now I would like to share few updates regarding our full year assumptions, with half of our fiscal year complete and based on our expectations for certain industry dynamics and business trend. We decided to raise our non-GAAP EPS guidance where range of $4.97 to $5.17. This reflects in narrowing of a range from $0.25 to $0.20.","We made the following additional changes to our full year assumptions. First, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth primarily driven by pharmaceutical segments. Second, though our tax rate may fluctuate by quarter as we saw in Q1 and Q2 we expect a tax rate in the range of 25% to 27% for the full year. Third, we revised our dilutive weighted average shares outstanding to the range of 300 million to 302 million shares. For the segment assumptions, with a strong revenue increase we saw in the first half.","We expect pharmaceutical segment revenue to grow in the mid-to-high single digits. This is mainly driven by brand sales to large customers. One item of note, in January brand inflation increases came in within the range we were expecting. As we have discussed before brand inflation represent a very small portion of our total brand income as income from DSA fees accounts for nearly 95% of our total brand compensation.","Finally, for the medical segment. We expect revenue to be approximately flat. A key factor impacting this change in our assumption is foreign exchange. Let me now provide an update regarding a few of the strategic priority that we have discussed throughout the year. Regarding our cost optimization work, we now expect to exceed $100 million of annualized savings for fiscal 2019. We also expect to exceed the aggregate $200 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2020. We continue to empower our employees to reset spending practices across the enterprise and this work will increase productivity, support our priorities and fuel growth initiatives.","Moving onto strategic uses of cash during the quarter we deployed capital primarily to fund capital expenditure needs of business in our quarterly dividend. Yesterday, our board approved a regular quarterly dividend which will payable to shareholders on April 15. Most importantly, we continue to increase our level of scrutiny and selectivity regarding capital allocation across all categories.","In closing, we're delivering on our commitments year-to-date and we're pleased to deliver Q2 performance that was better than anticipated. As a result, we were able to increase our full year expectations. We're beginning to see our strategic work and our operational performance aligned and we'll continue to build on this momentum.","With that, I'd like to open the line and invite your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and we'll take our first question from Ross Muken with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken","I'd love maybe a little bit more color on sort of the specialty solution outperformance, maybe just a bit of sort of background on maybe couple of the pieces that are kind of contributing and seems like that business is been sort of outperforming now for some time and maybe just give us a feel for in the context. I think the space trying to get better economics on those sort of relationships both on some of the manufacture service but on the base distribution and how you've sort of done in terms of essentially getting fair value for the services you're providing in that business.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks Ross. Appreciate the question. I would say that the performance in specialty is really cuts across several different areas. First of all, our operating downstream to our both physician offices and clinics we continue to see good traction there. Continuing to win some volume in that space and so that's been generating some of the better than expected performance for us. We've also been able to see benefit from just the pure growth of the specialty business alone. Our manufacture partners continue to launch new items, grow their share and that's obviously benefiting us. We've also had strong cost control in our specialty unit like the rest of our units. They're getting after, their activities and really focusing on what are the value added activities. And then lastly our upstream services we continue to gain traction in our hub, our 3PL business continues to win share and so really it's across the board. I wouldn't say it's any one thing particularly that stands out, it's just more across the board, it's all the performance by the team.","Ross Muken","That's helpful and maybe, just to follow-up. It seems like inflation kind of came in at least on the branded side in line. In lieu of all of this sort of noise coming out of the government and Azar sort of latest proposal. I guess how are you thinking about sort of the inflation environment for the rest of the year and what you're going to see maybe for the foreseeable future.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes it's a great question. At least for this fiscal year, I would tell you that really - January is really the month that we expect it to see all of the inflation. So we have very, very little built in for the rest of the year. So that is not something that we would call out as a risk for the second half of the year. It was really a big focus on January for us, would have come within that range that we were expecting. It did come in within that range, inflation that we were expecting and we were able to work with our manufacturing partners there and really get about what we were expecting.","So for the rest of the year, it's really not a factor. As far as next year it's just a little too early for us to comment on that. There's so many moving parts related to that and some of our agreements will be obviously expiring and looking at renegotiating and so we're going to be looking at trying to move more to non-contingent as we can, since we're well over 90% in fact, we're nearly 95% at this point in time that we would look to move more there as we can, but again nothing to rest of the year of any materiality.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","I guess Mike, maybe just to pick up there. If I look at the implied back half guide specifically for the pharma segment, the revenue trending above original expectation so you raised the expectations for the full year there, you left the EBIT expectations the same. So obviously implying slightly worse EBIT in the back half than maybe what you were previously thinking. Just little curios if there is any changing dynamics or things in the marketplace that you're seeing today that maybe you weren't seeing when you laid out the original fiscal 2019 plan that might help explain the maybe implied lower EBIT margin expectations in the back half.","Jorge Gomez","Bob, good morning. This is Jorge. Let me try to help you with that. The first thing I would say is, we with the first half of the year behind us, we feel good about our guidance. We feel so good that we decided to raise our total guidance for the year. If you look at the over performance in Q2, you probably want to think about it in three buckets and certainly from an operational perspective some of our business have been better. We talk about specialty, strong volume in pharma distribution was good in the quarter and some of the business units within the medical segments performed well and so that is given us confidence for deliver results in the second half of the year. The trending is good from an operational standpoint.","In Q2, we also had one-times are non-repeatable items or items that impact - don't have any impact to the bottom line. So for example, the ruling in New York about the opioid assessment, this is something that we have accrued for in Q1, we reversed that amount and then some amount that we had contemplated for Q2 we did not have to accrue and then finally there are some sizable items related to for example deferred compensation for a compensation had a positive impact in SG&A, but a negative impact of the same magnitude in below the line with the net zero impact to the bottom line, so that is something that has no bearing with respect to trajectory going into the second half. And we had some corporate expenses timing between Q2 and Q3 that again they have no impact to the overall year.","So when we look at the benefit in Q2, all the R's and O's, the trajectory of the business as we decided to raise guidance and based on all of those factors this guidance reflects our best estimate for the second half, which by the way as I said before we feel good about the trajectory of most of our businesses within the context of the guidance we're providing.","Robert Jones","Great, that's helpful Jorge and I guess maybe just a follow-up on the pharma segment. Not necessarily new news, but you guys highlighted the generic program as remaining a very large headwind. I just wanted to better understand what's at play there. Is this just because you're lapping strong contribution from last year or is there some changing dynamics in the generic marketplace that is weighing on the generics business.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, thanks for the question. I wouldn't say it's anything new, in fact what I would say is that our generic program performance remains essentially consistent quarter-to-quarter. Remember it's made up of several different things. We're seeing sell side deflation remain consistent quarter-to-quarter. Obviously we've said in the past, we'd like to see that improved but it is least remaining consistent. We have also our buy side Red Oak continues to perform as expected and then we have launches and penetration all of again which are about as expected, but that sell side deflation as we noted at the very beginning of the year, we felt that the pressure from the sell side would offset the positives we see and launches penetration and costing and there would be a net headwind for the year and that continues to what we're seeing. So I wouldn't say there is anything new, but when we look at it in total, the program continues to be our largest year-over-year headwind.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","I want to go back to sort of the early comments around the specialty segment. The performance you're talking about and certainly performance in the overall revenue pharma segment kind of mirrors what we're seeing across the peer group as well. Is there anything sort of characteristic you said that's changing the market overall as well that is kind of that we're kind of seeing this occur more broadly based.","Mike Kaufmann","Not being [indiscernible] out to me, I mean it continues to be a strong growing market. So it's one of the fastest growing components obviously, the pharmaceutical segment. So I just think the pure market growth, the manufacturers are doing a good job of driving growth on their drugs and we're benefiting from that growth from them. And then as I said, we continue to see improvements on our both our downstream penetration with accounts and growth of new accounts and then upstream, we've had some businesses that we've talked about that we were working on and growing for instance our hub which was still relatively a new business continues to improve its performance and our third party logistics business continues to win in the marketplace with the investments we've made in that business, so I wouldn't say anything specific other than it is just overall a strong growing market and we participate in many different areas in it.","Charles Rhyee","Okay and then maybe follow-up for Jorge. I think last quarter you said you were expecting the second quarter consolidated operating profit to be more sort of in line with 1Q. I think you've touched on some of the factors that have lifted the outperformance here in the second quarter. Was there anything - were there any other drivers that you point out and maybe you can help size some of these for us. Thanks.","Jorge Gomez","I already kind of listed all of the items that resulted in the over performance as I've said before. Good underlying trends in most of our businesses and then we had some one-timers related to corporate or timing issues related to corporate expenses, deferred compensation. I think I've covered all of the items that really explain what happened in the quarter relative to our expectations, we're really pleased with how the business has performed this quarter.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink. Please go ahead.","David Larsen","Can you talk a little bit about Cordis, I think you said that there is more effective management around consigned inventory. Did revenue for quarters grow? And what exactly is leading to that, tighter management, the inventory where new technology systems deployed, were new folks hired? Thanks a lot.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks for the question, Dave. Cordis in the quarter was not a driver for us. We continue to make progress. The stabilization plan that Jon Giacomin and team are leading is yielding good results from an operational perspective. Our metrics in that business continued to improve. I think overall the commercial health of that business has been good for a [indiscernible] quarters now and with respect to specific around infrastructure and technology, is what we have discussed before. We have been working pretty intensively in terms of having better data, their demand planning systems, processes around consigned inventory have been put in place and we're beginning to see the overall results of all of this work. So given all of that, we continue to expect that Cordis will be on a [indiscernible] to profitable growth by the end of fiscal 2019.","David Larsen","Okay and then did revenue grow for quarters?","Mike Kaufmann","As I said before, the trend in the business has been positive for the last several quarters and the commercial health is good. There is as I indicated in my prepared remarks overall in the medical segment, FX, foreign exchange was a small headwind in the quarter and that impacts kind of all of our businesses across the medical segment.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our question next from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","When we think for the second half of the year? If we normalize, do you have I think a little bit lower tax rate and lower share count and when we normalize for that. The second half guide seems to indicate a very wide range down on EPS down 4% to up 3%. So when you think about kind of that range, what should we be, what are you watching forward? So what are the risks that could lead you to kind of dead down 4% that could materialize in the next couple of quarters because you know what branded inflation, so you have a pretty good sight of view to that. So what are the other things that could materialize in the second half for you?","Jorge Gomez","Thanks Ricky for the quarter. As I've said before we have been looking at the entire cadence of the quarters with first half behind us, we feel much better about the cadence, about the ramp from first half to second half. There are always items that could create some changes and starting with probably the easiest one that you've seen a few times looked [indiscernible], the tax rate we have narrowed the range of the tax rate but it could be from quarter-to-quarter, it could fluctuate. We could continue to watch other drivers of profitability in each of the segments.","In the case of medical, I indicated that for example cost especially around raw materials is we're seeing good signs in terms of spot market prices, that is something that we continue to watch. So there's a lot of puts and takes and when we put all of those together. We believe the second half of reasonable good ramp up for us and the range is reasonable. I think the most important point is, overall we're raising the bottom of a range, we're raising the top, we're narrowing the range and that is a good indication that net-net all of our risk and opportunities are trending in the right direction and we feel more comfortable about the rest of the year.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay and then one follow-up. When you talk about revenues, you talk about obviously the specialty, the medical, the strong prints volume in pharma. Can you just explain to us and what is driving the strength in brand volume? Because we're not necessarily seeing in IMS [ph] so what's driving that better performance on the branded side.","Mike Kaufmann","I think it's more customer mix than anything. We partnered with some very strong customers in the marketplace that I think are growing nicely and through a combination of mostly organic growth with probably some small M&A themselves there and we're just benefiting from being partnered with strong partners. I think it's really what is, was this than more than anything else.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Cherny","Jorge I want to revisit some of the delta at least in terms of the two quarter performance. You talked about some level of timing related to corporate expenses. That being said, the original commentary you grew sequentially EBIT by about $96 million, usually there is a typical sequential step up in this quarter. But if you think about what was different from this quarter. How much of it was timing oriented versus how much of it was structural in terms of some of the restructuring programs and business optimization that you're pursuing.","Jorge Gomez","Michael, thanks for the question. I won't be able to tell you exactly the relative magnitude of each of the pieces, but I would tell you the items that were timing related or that had no impact to the bottom line are sizable. So good performance from a lot of our businesses, but those two items timing of corporate expenses and is a pretty sizable items. So that is one of the key reasons why we're not letting that flow through in the guidance for the rest of the year.","Michael Cherny","Understood. Thanks I'll get back in the queue.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Lisa Gill","Mike, I just wanted to go back to your comments around quarter three. You talked about refinding the geographic footprint. I think when [indiscernible] together last month, you talked about going from roughly 60 countries to maybe around 45. Can you give us more color on, is that the right number to think about that you're going to go down to 45 countries for Cordis? I understood you said profitability by the end of the 2019, but can you also just leave in your thoughts around Cardinal brand products. We thought an increase in cost here in this quarter, but are there opportunities when you think about the countries now that you're overlaying in Cordis. Have you made the investments you need to make, so that when we think about going towards the back half of this year and that profitability is that driven by your branded products?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, thanks for the questions. Let me try to catch on each one of those. First of all I think, Cordis, there's probably two things we're doing to try simplify the business. One is, not only reducing the number of countries and your numbers you mentioned are approximately right. But we're looking to continue to reduce that number and we're being very specific and detailed as we evaluate each country to make sure that at the end of the day, we're looking at what is the true growth potential in that country, what are all the other potential hidden cost and risk that might be in that country compared to our current footprint and ability to grow? How might we be in that country in a different way? Do we have to have our own commercialization and can we just work with distributors? But I would fully expect to see us continue to reduce our footprint little bit there.","Also the other thing that we've done, is we've taken a really hard look at our skews and so far we've reduced about our skews by about 20% in Cordis because we had a lot of slow to no moving skews which again drives potential inventory risk, also manufacturing cost and so we're trying to focus our customers on the skews that matter for us and move them from slow to no moving type of skews that were out there and move them to the right mix of skews to help our cost structure. So those are two big things that we're doing in Cordis and as Jorge said, the commercial health of the business continues to be strong and we have seen some FX headwinds, but the overall commercial strength continues to be strong and we continue to try to be very careful about, the way we're going after some of our SG&A right now. While we maintain that top line and clean up some of these other things like inventory visibility in that.","As far as our Cardinal Health branded products. I would say that, we're really taking a holistic approach on those, to look not only at the breadth of that line where we manufacture it, how we manufacture it i.e. our overall global footprint. But also taking a look at those countries where we sell those products and are we doing it in the right way. So we want to play in the countries where we believe there is future growth and where we can win and obviously look at other opportunities up to an including exiting countries where we don't think it has the right growth trajectories or the opportunities for us to win.","Lisa Gill","Great. And I guess just follow-up [indiscernible] Jorge. I know everyone keep coming back to try and understand the cadence of earnings. Just so I understand that correctly, when you last told us that things would look sequentially similar between the two quarters. You were not anticipating New York state opioid being reversed. You were not anticipating that, the expense timing around some things and some of the benefit being pulled forward to December as well as deferred comp. so those are kind of the three things that when you look at that, that was the big difference between when we spoke last and what you actually reported in the quarter? Is that the right way to think about it?","Jorge Gomez","Correct. Lisa. It's exactly right. Those are the unexpected pieces that all came in our way.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","So another question from me and coming back to the commodity spot pricing and timing etc. it sounds like you're really not raising the guidance today for that metric. You cited the other three buckets of outperformance for fiscal 2Q. But you know - as coming back to our discussion around this last quarter as you guys mentioned it's hard to calculate the overall inflation, but you do have the example in the 10-K that again the hypothetical 10% increase in key commodity inputs will be about $0.10 hit to overall EPS. So now some of these trends are softening in your favor, you mentioned the data points and everything else. I guess I'm just curios within the current guidance range, could less commodity inflation risk still be EPS driver into the magnitude of $0.10 plus within the guidance range. Just curios for the back half of the year how much climbing inflation could move EPS, was really what the question is?","Jorge Gomez","Steven good morning, thanks for the question. So commodities and raw materials costs continues to be a headwind for the rest of the year up. What I indicated earlier is, that is trending in the right direction. However there is always a long lag between the time we see those positive changes in the spot markets and when we see the benefits in the P&L. So I think the most relevant part about that payment is that, is one of the reasons why we are comfortable with raising guidance because although it continues to be at risk based on the spot prices we're seeing today. We don't believe at this time that could get worse for the rest of the year and so that's how we're thinking about that piece.","Steven Valiquette","So just to be clear then, so the guidance raise today does incorporate a little bit the better outlook on climbing inflation.","Jorge Gomez","Yes. All of the - it is - our views on the trending on commodities is one of the factors that is contemplated in guidance.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Percher","Mike, with respect to the HHS proposal last week and also starting to think about what a world of discounts might look like, there's a question raised around how the actual flow of funds may occur in maybe, if there's a role for distributors to play. I think for your peers, we understand some of their assets and relationships that enable them to play, could you tell us a little bit about how Cardinal might be able to play a role?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes absolutely. First of all, this announcement around the safe harbor changes was not unexpected. And as you can imagine we like many other support efforts to lower prescription drug cost for patients and we're truly committed to engaging with the administration and the entire system to figure out how best to do that. That being said, I guess I would to your answer I'd probably put it in two buckets. I agree there are opportunities for the industry as the whole to help facilitate solutions to get rebates possibly down to the patient. The best way to think about it is, we just like our competitors maintain sophisticated charge back systems already with the manufacturer and with our customer. so every day we're managing thousands of transactions between customers and suppliers and so while this would be definitely be at a more detailed level, if we needed to do something down to the patient that the script. It is something that, as a company and as an industry we believe that we could get after and it's something that I think that the whole industry understands well. The importance of the role that we play in healthcare in general and the important role that we play for manufacturers to be able to do this, so I do think that we are as well as positioned as anybody to continue to help in that.","And then, I know some people have some concerns would it change the overall list prices and other things like that in the marketplace and I think, well if it did, we do feel confident in our value proposition that we talked about multiple times that we work with manufacturers. They understand the value of our proposition and we constantly work with them around that and that we'll be able to adjust, our overall pricing mechanisms with manufacturers to remain whole on the dollar set we receive [ph].","Eric Percher","I appreciate both those comments. So I understand that charge back piece, is there any role that Cardinal plays today at the point of sale?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, in some ways we do. Obviously we work with customers for instance in the area of medication therapy management. Whether you call that point of sale? Are we connected with our customers pharmacy systems? Yes through inventory management, through medication therapy management and through other connectivity of communicating with our pharmacy customers on a daily basis. Yes, we have connection with them specifically related to this particular issue. I think we have enough connectivity that we can work with them through other solutions and through opportunities with the industry to drive benefit.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian [indiscernible] with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Company Representative","Jorge, just a question on margins. As I think about the pharma segment, obviously you had some you're still trying to lap some repricing. But how are you thinking directionally about margin trend past the next quarter in the pharmaceutical segment? Thanks.","Jorge Gomez","Thanks for the question. So as we go into Q3, as all of you know Q3 is our best quarter in terms of pharmaceutical segment margin profit, so that's going to be normally higher than Q1, Q2 and even Q4. Other than that, I don't see any significant change with respect to margins, trends and to pharma business. Obviously a lot of cost initiative that Mike was referring to, a lot of pricing initiatives that we have going on. We are always trying to expand margins in that business and across all businesses. So I don't expect to see any again other than the seasonality in Q3 related to brand inflation. And for this year, within the guidance range we've provided I don't see any major fluctuations in margins for this pharma segment.","Unidentified Company Representative","Got it. Thank you.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Ransom with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","John Ransom","Just following up on that last question. I think we've all - we've been in a three-year journey of margin decline in pharma high single-digit, low double-digit declines. Are you now saying the current, so let's say that your sustainable revenue growth is in the 7% range, are you now saying after lapping this year you think you can hold margins flat and generate high single-digit revenue growth in that segment, are we still looking at margin pressures on absolute basis because of all the things you talked about.","Mike Kaufmann","At this point in time, we're not going to get into FY 2020 guidance. All I can really say is that, we feel good about who we're partnered with our customers and continue to feel that we've partnered with the right folks, we'll win as they win in the marketplace and but as far as margin rate, the impact of our generics program year-over-year. It's just a little bit too early to say whether that will continue to be a headwind or what size that will be next year as we continue to evaluate all of the components, we mentioned we're going to have to - have obviously our thoughts around what the sale side and deflation rates are going to be as well as launches, penetration in buy side and so little too early on that. I can't tell you, that we're going to continue to be focused on being aggressive on cost and being trying to focus on, the areas that we believe we can grow and stay laser focused on those.","John Ransom","Sure and just the other things I appreciate the comments. Just following up on another thread. Let's just say hypothetically that the manufacturers look at the safe harbor changes and decide to move to a low net price model and we see something like on branded drugs 30% compression and gross to net and the actual revenue dollars for Cardinal would be on the branded side, would be compressed. Just help us understand the process by you would have to go back and re-cut, I'm assuming hundreds of contracts between your manufacturers and your customers and is there any sort of safe harbor provision and your contracts are just going to be, sort of lengthy protracted re-contracting cycle as we see a big bang change in the industry pricing.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes great question and couple things. I think obviously we can't speak for the manufacturers, but there is an obviously a lot of things they have to look at. There are lot of implications in reducing lag prices for them that make it a very complicated and somewhat difficult thing to do for them when it comes related to returns and how they would price customers where the differentiated price setting and all those type of things, it gets very difficult. But assuming that just using as a hypothetical, if they did I think there's two things I would keep in mind. First of all remember one of the most important things to keep in mind, is that our downstream pricing is also attached to lack or list price.","And so not only well our overall dollars that we earn from manufacturers be initially reduced on day one, but the overall dollars that we pass to customers would be reduced on day one, too. So there's a natural hedge against the overall size of that, that reduces some of the impact to distributors and then also, secondly as you can imagine with all the talk around this for the last 12 months or so, we have been working with manufacturers to change the way our contracts are structured, if there was a significant change it lacks to be able to renegotiate contracts quickly and for the ones that we're still in contracts with. They know our expectation and more importantly they know our value. They continue to believe, I believe in the overall wholesaler value proposition. They know through our discussions and through our work on our next best alternative that there is no better way to get their products to market, at a fair price and cost.","And I believe what this industry does and believe that the pharma manufacturers do too and they want us to be healthy and so while it's not something you solve in a week, when it changes. It is not something that I would see as a longer term headwinds that our conversations have been very positive on both our value and our ability to change our agreements to reflect the dollars that we currently get.","Lisa Capodici","Operator, next question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.","Kevin Caliendo","Just one quick follow-up to that. What you said earlier that you thought in the contract renegotiations that, on a dollar to dollar basis, it would be the same? Are you thinking like literally in dollars or you're thinking about ROIC, meaning your inventories would be a lot less, your round of capital outlay such that your returns would look the same but maybe not the actual dollars. Or you're actually thinking that the dollars themselves in terms of the contracting you think would still remain the same.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes I still believe that the dollars would be the same. I think that your comment around ROIC, there might be some changes to that as you take a look at overall, the whole model and those things are always considered when we work with manufacturers. When they ask us to carry more or allow us to carry less inventory, we work with manufacturers. But generally we see this as something where we're really truly focused on the dollars that we received as the value for the services, we provide and we would expect that those dollars would be match be very similar over the long-term as where they are today.","Kevin Caliendo","Second question, you mentioned earlier. You don't expect any more brand price increases for the rest of the year. I'm assuming you were talking about your fiscal year. Generally speaking what about the calendar year. I'm not asking for 2020 guidance, I'm just talking about do you expect the typical June or July 1 sort of price increases as well. Do you think there is going to be anything different with that or are you expecting that for the full calendar year that January was going to be much larger percentage in terms of magnitude and depth or breadth of price increases?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes it's a fair question. First of all to be clear, it was our fiscal year I was talking about and that we would expect relatively immaterial increase, not - it wouldn't be zero but we don't expect a significant amount of increase as we see now in June 30. The majority was in January and it occurred within the range we expected. So that was just more to help you understand, we don't see a lot of risk, if it were absolutely zero between what we have in and what's left to do. Regarding the whole year, I don't want to get into a lot of forecasting but this past year what I can say is that, at the beginning of the year we did expect more July increases than we actually ended up seeing. So at the beginning of the year we did expect the old traditional of a little bit in July and then some spread out and more in January. Instead what we saw, was less in July and the rest of the year and more pushed to January. So while the overall dollars were less year-over-year in January or in total for the year, there was a higher percentage in the month of January and so it's hard to say for right now, but it's probably a reasonable assumption going forward, but again it's hard for us and we'll continue to listen to the administration and talk to our manufacturer partners to understand their thoughts around timing of price increases.","Lisa Capodici","Operator we have time for one more question.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Eric Coldwell with Baird. Please go ahead.","Eric Coldwell","So Mike, every distributor has shown really nice revenue upside this quarter. You guys 1.7, ABC 1.6, McKesson over $1.1 billion that's summing up to about $4.5 billion in the quarter about $20 billion annualized, $18 billion annualized. So I guess my question is this, everybody say their growth is because of their big customers doing well, it's sort of unique. But it's really not unique it's the whole sector of the big three. Something has to be happening here because we have generic deflation, brand inflations running at decade low. I don't think most of us are really seeing it in the volume numbers so, I guess my question is this. There has to be a hook. I'm worried that maybe this is your big clients are actually starting to decimate the small independence. You might have a different angle on that, but I'll open it up with that.","Mike Kaufmann","It's a very fair question. It's hard for me to comment on everybody's customer base. Remember there are few pieces due to some acquisitions, by folks acquiring other change in other businesses in the industry, that's having some impacts on various people's growth. Also the other thing to keep in mind and we can't get into detail specific to our customers. But remember at least in Cardinal's case which I can't comment, to is some of our customers buy certain products direct and they may change some of those products from buying direct to buying through us. The amount, their timing of their inventory builds could have an impact, you can have extra day of sales or so in a quarter. It's hard for us to know exactly when they've done that and not done that. So there's probably a few things like that moving around the numbers. I wouldn't say that it's - I would say that it's totally at the expense for instance as your comment around retail independence or anything that we continue to see that class of trade. Have similar trends to the past and continue to be healthy, but there's lot of potential moving parts which is hard for me to comment on everybody's [indiscernible].","Eric Coldwell","Do you think some of the changes with price transparency, the California rule etc.? Is it somehow driving your customers to maybe buy inventory in December that they might have historically bought in January or February? Is there some angle there that we should be investigating?","Mike Kaufmann","It's hard to say how each one of the customers evaluate their balance sheet and what they want to do. It's often hard for customers due to the limited space and stuff they have in their stores to do a lot of extra buying. But to say that I can tell you, that had zero impact I can't tell you. So it might have a had a small impact because there is, as you mentioned a little bit more visibility to some of when price increases are going to occur. So that could be a potential, which is why I mentioned that you'll see potentially quarterly fluctuations on sales because of particularly when you have customers the warehouse pharmaceuticals like we do have several of our large customers warehouse [indiscernible] that depending on day of the month, their views like you said on price increases, service levels those types of things that can cause fluctuation.","Eric Coldwell","[Indiscernible].","Mike Kaufmann","Okay, go ahead.","Operator","I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Mike Kaufmann for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Kaufmann","Great, thank you very much. I want to thank all of you for joining us today because I think you can see the team continues to move forward in executing our plan and positioning Cardinal Health for the future growth. I'm proud of the work the team is doing and as we take steps to further enhance Cardinal Health's competitive position in the marketplace, support our customer base and drive shareholder value and we look forward to reporting on our future progress.

During the discussion today, our comments including an update to our FY 2020 outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release.","During the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up so that we can try and get everyone an opportunity to ask a question. ","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike.","Mike Kaufmann","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Before we discuss our Q2 performance and our outlook for the year, I would like to reiterate a few things we shared last Thursday regarding voluntary recalls for any level three surgical gowns and certain free source packs containing those affected gowns.","The full press release and additional information regarding this issue can be found on our website. First and foremost, we apologize to our customers and their patients. We understand the gravity of this situation and are dedicated to resolving this issue as quickly as possible. Simultaneously, we are doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again. We are engaging third-party experts to conduct a comprehensive review of our quality assurance processes and business practices and we are committed to executing corrective and preventative actions.","As we shared last week, related to these recalls, we recorded a $96 million charge in our Q2 GAAP results. This charge represents our best estimate of costs for the recalls, including inventory write-offs, as well as certain remediation and supply disruption costs such as cost to replace recalled products.","To provide some clarity, $56 million of this is within cost of products sold and $40 million is within SG&A. This charge and any future adjustments made to it will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial results.","On behalf of the entire Cardinal Health leadership team, I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and tireless effort. All of us, myself included, are focused on resolving this issue as quickly as possible for our customers and their patients.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over today to walk through our Q2 results and updated fiscal 2020 outlook. And then I\u2019ll share some thoughts on our path forward.","Dave Evans","Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll start with an overview of our performance for the second fiscal quarter and then provide an update to our fiscal 2020 guidance. In Q2, we delivered earnings of $1.52 per share, an increase of 18% from the prior year. This result exceeded our expectations and was driven by a combination of operating and non-operating activities which I will elaborate on the comments to follow.","Total company revenue increased 5% versus last year to $39.7 billion and consolidated gross margin increased 2% from last year to $1.8 billion.","SG&A increased 3% to $1.1 billion. This increase was driven by higher costs to support sales growth and by fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities. These items were partially offset by the benefits of enterprise wide cost savings measures.","The net result for the quarter with consolidated operating earnings of $646 million, a 1% increase from the prior year. Moving below operating earnings, interest and other income and expense decreased 48% to $51 million. This was primarily driven by the change in value of deferred compensation plan investments and lower interest expense as we continue to execute our de-leveraging plans.","Of note, in the quarter, we paid down more than $700 million of long-term debt and have now paid down nearly $800 million through the first half.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% nearly four percentage points lower than the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of changes in jurisdictional mix. Average diluted shares outstanding were 294 million about 6 million fewer than last year.","During the quarter, we completed $350 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q1. We repurchased 7.3 million shares over the first two quarters and an average value of $48 per share. We now have $943 million remaining under our Board authorized share repurchase program.","Moving on to cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was approximately $700 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.7 billion, which included $788 million held outside the U.S. As a reminder, timing, in particularly the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point in time cash flows.","Moving on the segment results starting with Pharma. We were encouraged to see positive momentum across many areas of the segment. Segment revenue increased 6% to $35.7 billion, driven by growth in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions divisions. Segment profit increased 4% to $462 million, with our generics program being the largest driver. ","As a reminder, what we refer to our \u2013 as our generics program includes sourcing, sell-side pricing, volume, and new item launches. For the first time in several quarters, our generics program reverted from a net earnings headwind to tailwind. At the same time, we continued to see strong growth in our Specialty Solutions business. Brand sales and mix also positively contribute as we manage changing dynamics to capture the value we create through our supply chain. These tailwinds were partially offset by Pharma Distribution customer contract renewals.","Transitioning to Medical, revenue for the segment was flat to prior year at $4 billion. Growth in Cardinal Health at-Home was offset by a decline in products and distribution. As a reminder, products and distribution includes both Cardinal Health brand and national brand products. Overall, Cardinal Health brand volumes have lagged our expectations through the first half. While we recognize we still have progress to make. This validates the importance of our commercial initiatives which Mike will discuss in his remarks.","Medical segment profit increased 4% to $195 million. This reflects the benefits of ongoing initiatives to improve our cost structure including work to optimize freight and IT relationships. These benefits were partially offset by a decline in products and distribution. Medical segment profits are now up 13% compared to fiscal 2019 on a year-to-date basis.","Moving now to our full year outlook. With half the year behind us, we\u2019re raising our full year fiscal 2020 EPS guidance to the range of $5.20 to $5.40 from the prior range of $4.85 to $5.10. I\u2019ll call out a few items contributing to this increase. First, we now have additional clarity regarding external factors we mentioned last quarter that affect the enterprise, including brand inflation, the medical device tax and tariffs.","Also based on the sustained improved trends in our generics program, we now expect the Pharma segment to exceed our original expectations for the full year. A few additional items to note in the Pharma segment as we look to the second half of the year. First, from a year-over-year comparison perspective, recall that it was in Q4 of last year when we started to see an improvement in the generic market dynamics that means we\u2019ll be comping more challenging performance in Q4 of this year.","Second, we now expect opioid-related legal cost to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million for the year with the majority of the year-over-year increase occurring in the back half of the year. As a reminder, these expenses are recorded in our Pharma segment. Third, on brand inflation. While the January price increases from our contingent vendors fell within the range of our expectations, they continue to be a smaller dollar contribution each year.","And in Medical, I\u2019ll remind you of the charge we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 related to quarters. This will affect our year-over-year growth rates in the second half for the segment. Regarding the rest of our corporate assumptions, we now anticipate FY 2020 interest and other income and expense in the range of $260 million to $280 million. This improvement is largely due to the favorability we\u2019ve seen thus far with our deferred compensation plan investments and the benefits of debt deleveraging that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder, we plan to reduce outstanding long-term debt by at least $1 billion in fiscal 2020.","Finally, we expect diluted weighted average shares to be in the range of 293 million to 296 million for the full fiscal year. Given that we are halfway through the year, we\u2019ve decided to narrow this range. Regarding our segment assumptions, we are making one update. With the favorability I discussed, we now expect Pharmaceutical segment profit to decline low single digits. This is a significant improvement from our original expectation of a low double digit decline.","With that, let me turn it back over to Mike.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks, Dave. As we look to the remainder of this year and the next few, we will continue to focus on enhancing our established core businesses and on fueling sustained growth in evolving areas including Specialty and at-Home. In Pharma, let me start by saying we continue to be actively involved in ongoing negotiations of the terms for a global settlement and we remain committed to being part of the solution to the opioid epidemic.","Overall, we have increased confidence in our work to drive growth across the Pharma segment. Our investments in our generic pricing and analytics capabilities as well as continued strong performance from Red Oak and improving market dynamics are enabling our generics program to now be a tailwind for the year rather than a headwind as we previously expected. Also, our investments in both our Specialty and Connected Care businesses enable us to capture value in the ever changing healthcare landscape.","Moving to Medical. I mentioned last quarter that we had multiple initiatives in flight to enhance our commercial approach and streamline our supply chain. Our work in these areas continues. However, with the recent recalls, we are currently deploying our Medical segment teams to meet the most immediate needs of our customers and their patients. While we recognize this will slow momentum in our commercial and supply chain initiatives, we remain confident in the underlying strategies of these work streams, and we are dedicated to their success. We will provide an update on our next call.","At the enterprise level, we remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation approach that prioritizes reinvesting in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and modestly growing our dividends. Opportunistically, we will continue to explore share repurchases and M&A. Across the company, we continue to prudently manage our cost structure. We\u2019re doing this through focusing our resources, improving our processes, and embracing new technologies that create better visibility and velocity throughout the company. Our goal is to be easier to do business with. As this new mindset takes root, we will continue to see a sustainable behavioral shift and ongoing value creation for years to come.","With that, I\u2019ll now pause to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Glen Santangelo with Guggenheim.","Glen Santangelo","Yes, thanks and good morning. Just a quick question regarding the guidance in the Medical segment. I\u2019m kind of curious, does the recall have any implications for the outlook in the second half of the year? Because if you look through the first six months, your operating profit is already up double digits and Dave, as you sort of alluded to you have that easy comp coming in the fourth quarter from that charge last year. So by maintaining the guidance there, it kind of implies that, the operating performance would be pretty weak in the second half. And I\u2019m just kind of curious if I\u2019m looking at that correctly or if there\u2019s anything else there?","Dave Evans","Yes, Glen. This is Dave. Good question. So we \u2013 as you could see, we collected the direct costs and include those in our charge of $96 million. What we have uncertainty on, and frankly at this very early stage is, implications to second half in terms of revenue margin in any disruptions with our customers. So I would say that you\u2019ve read this fairly well and that we\u2019ve reflected some of that uncertainty in the guidance that we\u2019re providing for the second half for Med.","Glen Santangelo","Okay. And then maybe if I could just ask a quick follow-up to Mike with respect to opioids, I think you were sort of forecasting about $85 million of expenses and now you\u2019ve taken your opioid litigation expenses up to a $100 million to $125 million. The framework\u2019s been out there for a few months. It kind of sounds like you\u2019re confident. Why the increased sort of litigation expense now? Hopefully, we\u2019ll winding the stack. Could you maybe give us an update on the timeline of maybe what we should be expecting from here?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, thanks for the question. We are still dedicated to the framework and progress does continue. So that\u2019s a positive. But as you can imagine, these are incredibly complicated arrangements. We have to work through with 50 different states that we\u2019re working with. And so to get this over the goal line, there is a lot of work that\u2019s going to be done over the next several weeks and months to get that done. And even when it\u2019s agreed to, it\u2019s got to get papered. And then we\u2019ve got to work through implementation of the various components of it. And so when you begin to look at all of those costs and the way the spend, we believe, will ramp up. We believe that \u2013 you\u2019re right, the costs are going to go from $85 million was our original to $100 million to $125 million with a significant portion ramping up in the Q3 and even probably a little more in Q4. Next question, please.","Operator","We will go to our next question from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones","Yes. Thanks for the questions. I guess just to stick with that topic, Mike, because obviously it\u2019s so important to Cardinal and to the group. One of your peers talked about narrowing conversations around a potential opioid settlement. You obviously sound incrementally, more positive that this is progressing. Could you maybe just give a little bit more on how many other states, maybe not specifically, but are more states and local governments and municipalities engaging at this point. I think the original framework that we had all seen obviously highlighted just four state AGs and I\u2019m just curious specifically, are you seeing more people coming to the other side of the table?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, thanks again for the question on this important topic. As I said, we remain committed to this framework and we\u2019re very appreciative of the four AGs that took the initial lead on this. They have been working with all 50 states. We continue to get the feedback from those states and look to the various components of the details of the agreement. But it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me right now to try to tell you or handicap how many states are in or out. But I will tell you that the four AGs that we talked to continue to make progress and I think we all believe that this is the right thing to do for the companies and for the country to help get some relief to the people that need it, with not only the dollars we\u2019re talking about, which are important, but equally the other components which are distributing the free goods and working with them on programs to improve the overall monitoring of the opioids.","Robert Jones","No, no, I appreciate that, Mike. And I guess just to go back to this generic program dynamic, you highlighted it\u2019s the first time in several quarters, it went from a headwind to a tailwind. You guys talked specifically about four components that I guess comprise your generic program. Could you maybe just dive a little deeper into what exactly changed to flip the generics from a headwind to a tailwind in the quarter?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. I think a couple of things. I think first of all by far this is the item that drove the difference in our expectations for the quarter. As Dave mentioned, pretty much everything else was right there where we expected to be. Maybe a little bit better, but this was the big driver. And it\u2019s really good performance across all of the components. We\u2019re very happy with Red Oak. They continue to perform at a very high level, not only in getting after cost for us, but also just doing an excellent job on service level. We really believe we have industry-leading service levels, and that really helps lead to maintaining and growing our volumes, which is an important part of it.","So while volumes were a little lighter than we had expected originally this year, due to the situation, as we mentioned, with Fred\u2019s that went bankrupt and some other customers that are winding down a few stores, we are still seeing volume growth. And then the other big factor is going to be just market dynamics. We\u2019ve seen significant improvement in the overall market dynamics on the pricing side. So when you put all of the components together \u2013 and we had a strong quarter on launches. It was really strength across all of the components that made the program over perform.","Dave Evans","Yes, just \u2013 I think, Mike, you hit out at the end there. I think we did have an earlier-than-expected launch of some new items. That was helpful for the quarter. In addition, we had a fairly favorable mix that help drive the results we saw in the second quarter.","Kevin Moran","Next question, please.","Operator","We will go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi, good morning, and congrats on a very good quarter. Mike, going back to your comments on market dynamics and just improved on pricing, digging a little bit deeper into that. When we think about the pricing, are you seeing improved pricing on the sell side versus the buy side? And focusing on the buy side, China is an important source of generic API supply. Given what we\u2019re seeing there with the coronavirus, how does that impact supply \u2013 overall global supply in the marketplace? And what could be the potential implications on potential return to generic inflation? And is any of that in your second half outlook?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. I\u2019ll start with \u2013 as far as the second half outlook goes, we basically are just taking the trends that we\u2019ve seen for the first half of the year around generics, the overall programs and kind of forecasting those out for the rest of the year. We\u2019re not projecting necessarily any improvements or inflation or anything like that. It\u2019s just really about being more confident that what we\u2019re seeing \u2013 now that we have roughly eight months of activity versus five last quarter, which just felt a little too early to call it, we feel like we\u2019ve had enough activity here that we feel good about increasing our guidance related to that. And that is clearly the biggest item.","As far as some color on it, I think the important thing is, it\u2019s hard to really get focused on just the buy side or just the sell side because they work in tandem, and it\u2019s really about driving margin per unit. And what we\u2019re seeing is a much better balance between what\u2019s happening on the sell side in terms of the amount of inflation being less than historical, but also being able to then balance any decreases there with good performance at Red Oak. So that we can continue to manage our margin per unit in a way to be able to have the overall program grow.","And as Dave said, the units and the overall launches helped to that, too. And so that\u2019s really how we look at it. As far as the China API, you can imagine, this is something that we monitor. Red Oak is in charge of that for us, and they do a great job of understanding where raw materials are coming from, where they\u2019re manufactured. And you\u2019re right, there are a decent amount of API manufactured over in China and some of the affected areas. We have \u2013 where we have \u2013 we\u2019ve worked with manufacturers to try to increase supplies ahead of this. I do think it\u2019s something that, based on the amount of supply and the supply chain, is something the industry should be able to work through. But it\u2019s hard to say how long this will last, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to have to keep an eye on, and we will.","Kevin Moran","Next question, please.","Operator","We will go to our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill","Hi, thanks very much. Good morning. Mike, you called out Specialty as being a growth area again in the quarter. Can you just remind us the size of that business and the capabilities versus some of your peers? And then as we think about the potential for IPI and potential changes around reimbursement, can you talk about your thoughts on that? And any impact that you could see in your Specialty business?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. Thanks for the question. Our Specialty business, the last number that we publicly gave for FY 2019 is that we finished around $19 billion in sales, and so that\u2019s where that business is. We continue to expect that business to have significant growth this year across all of its areas. It\u2019s sales into the actual downstream providers in the acute space as well as upstream services to manufacture. So we are seeing good momentum across all three areas in that business and continue to feel good about not only their quality of service to the customers, but some of the investments we\u2019re making in the businesses that we\u2019ll be able to talk about more here in the future, including a recent investment we\u2019ve made in [indiscernible] that was announced that we believe will also be an area of helping in the cell and gene area. So we continue to be excited about the specialty area.","As far as it relates to IPI, I would say this; first of all, we\u2019re in favor of anything that can help reduce the cost of healthcare to the U.S. healthcare system. We know that\u2019s important. We hope and look to folks to be able to find ways to reduce costs for folks. So that\u2019s important to us. The second thing I would say is that when you think about IPI or any of these programs as folks are looking at, the impact to us, I think, is generally where it could impact us in the first order is, does it change list prices, does it mean that the way that manufacturers establish list prices, do they have to lower them, do they have to reduce their price increases? Those are the types of first order of kind of magnitude impact us that we look at.","And as you and others have heard me say, I think that we as a company and as an industry have really worked well over the years in the fee-for-service model to first of all, make anything that\u2019s \u2013 the part that\u2019s dependent on deflate or inflation to be less than 5% of our overall margin rate, so that helps protect us from any impact or what folks might do with inflation rates.","And secondly, the way we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate our ability to renegotiate DSAs over time as WAC prices fluctuate that we still feel very confident that any impact to list prices that we can manage through very effectively as a company and as an industry. The piece that\u2019s really important to us though is the impact to our customers. ","We really look at any of this legislation with the true lens to our customers and the impact on them, and we want to make sure and have commented on past legislation that\u2019s been out there that we have to be really careful that type of legislation doesn\u2019t reduce access or reduce the ability of our customers and theirselves to be able to work with the actual patients to provide the type of care that we know that they deserve.","Lisa Gill","Thank you.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Mike and Dave, I\u2019d ask you guys a little bit more about the generics program contribution in the quarter. And I guess, what I\u2019m looking at is, you guys and your friends in Texas kind of highlighted big beat \u2013 you demonstrated big beats in earnings this quarter that were generics related, don\u2019t seem repeatable either in the next quarter and the balance of your fiscal years. So maybe could you provide a little bit more color on the earlier than expected launch of the new items that was highlighted and maybe the contribution in the quarter? And maybe some more commentary around what was delivered in the quarter that might seem more one-time versus what might seem repeatable on a go forward basis? I know that\u2019s a lot. Thanks.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes George, let me answer that. Look, when we talk about the four elements of what we described as a generic dynamic, those are continuation of trends that we would expect to see in Q3 and in Q4. So we expect to see year-over-year some healthy improvement in Q3. Q4 we don\u2019t expect to see the same year-over-year improvement because Q4 of last year if you go back and look at that, was a quarter \u2013 was the first quarter where we began to see the inflection this deflationary trend. And so we have a much more challenging comp in Q4.","With respect to the accelerated launch of new items, that\u2019s not necessarily a one timer it\u2019s just a pull forward of something that was anticipated later in the year. So I think you can expect, which is why we called our guidance up specific to pharma, we expect to see some positive results in Q3. And then possibly today based on what we see somewhat moderation in the year-over-year comparison in Q4. Does that help answer your question, George?","George Hill","Yes, I think, you covered it clearly. Thank you.","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson","Hi good morning guys. I wish if you could talk a little bit more about some of the specialty profit drivers in the quarter and maybe more broadly beyond that is it sort of an increase in services? Is this the launch calendar? Any additional color you can provide on that would be helpful.","Mike Kaufmann","I think in specialty a lot of this just has to do with the normal growth of specialty. We\u2019re continuing to see certain drugs grow in the marketplace because of their success, particularly in the oncology space, getting new indications and just normal growth. That\u2019s a really big piece of it. Part of it is some of the uptake of some of the biosimilars here and there some of that, while they don\u2019t provide a lot more value than normal branded items and they generally act like that. There are some smaller opportunities on the earning side that earn a slightly better there that\u2019s been a piece of it. We\u2019ve seen really nice growth in our services business upstream with wins in our 3PL business, and our hub and some of our other businesses have continued to grow.","So nothing unique about like large pieces of movement of business or anything. One-timers like that it\u2019s just nice solid growth with the volumes across the board.","Elizabeth Anderson","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Mike Kaufmann","Next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Stephen Baxter with Wolfe Research.","Stephen Baxter","Hey, thanks for the question. So based on how you size the relative components of the Pharma guidance coming into the year, it seemed like renewals are driving at least half of the high single digit to low double digit profit decline you\u2019re assuming. I assume the renewal impact hasn\u2019t changed, so the revised guidance for the low single digit percent decline would seem to indicate a decent amount of underlying growth excluding the renewals and the opioid expenses, which have now moved higher too.","So just wanted to check and see whether you agree with that logic or anything has changed about the sizing of the renewals throughout the year? And therefore, whether we should be expecting segment profits to return to growth on a reported basis as we move into next year? Thanks.","Dave Evans","Steven is Dave. So I\u2019d say your assumptions are all pretty spot on. I would say though that we\u2019re really per usual practice. We\u2019re not in a position to comment on 2021 at this early date. But overall, I think, you\u2019ve got a good hand on. And I understand what we\u2019ve been articulating.","Kevin Moran","Next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. Does your guidance assume any meaningful contribution from biosimilars? Do you continue to view that as sort of an opportunity for you longer term?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, our guidance would assume any of the normal type related stuff for that. But there is nothing new \u2013 no new launches that created the increase related to biosimilars. We continue to think that that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll keep an eye on. I don\u2019t believe it will be a big driver for us in the short term because right now they act more like branded drugs and their overall margin rates are similar. There\u2019s a little bit of opportunity to make a little bit more money on some of the biosimilars, depending on programs we might be able to put in place with customers. But I would not call them a large driver of anything over \u2013 over this year over the short term. But something that we\u2019ll keep our eye on is something to be more of a midterm or longer term driver, particularly if they become interchangeable. And then I think for sure my opinion would change on their ability to be a much bigger driver for us.","Erin Wright","Okay, great. And then where are you in terms of the streamlining of your commercial and supply chain initiatives on the medical side of the business? You suggested that maybe you face a little bit of a setback here in terms of the recent recalls, but would you say you\u2019re still seeing some progress and focused on that front? And also if you could break out the recent quarter\u2019s trends specifically, that\u2019d be helpful. Thanks.","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, on Cordis, I\u2019ll just handle that real quick. Nothing really to report on Cordis outside of what our expectations are, the business is continuing to grow, we\u2019re seeing growth in our profit there and we continue to be really happy with what the team is doing there to meet or slightly exceed the expectations that we have for that business this year. But we don\u2019t see it being a driver outside of what we expected for the year one way or the other. As far as the initiatives in medical, we remain incredibly committed to both of them. There is nothing about the underlying strategies of our commercial realignment or our supply chain initiatives that at this time, I would say, make me feel any differently than we have been talking about.","But as I noted particularly well then both of them, but probably a little bit even more in the commercial side. It has been slowed with the gallons recall. We have deployed some of our sales reps, as well as other people into the field to be actually located at the hospital locations, helping them manage through this challenge that is out there. And it\u2019s really important to us that we take care of our customers and our patients. So because of that it would slow down where we expect to be.","So we have said and committed that our supply chain we would be \u2013 have a plan done by the end of Q2. That plan was done, but as we look at implementation of that plan we are taking into account this disruption that we\u2019re working on and just overall re-evaluating and make sure we look at the overall global supply chain to make sure there\u2019s no changes we would make based on some of the recent challenges. And then again on the commercial piece, we\u2019re on track to get the jobs hired and all that, but we do have folks deployed to customers.","Kevin Moran","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Michael Cherny with BofA Securities.","Michael Cherny","Good morning and thanks for all the details so far. So as you think about the opportunity, you said you have \u2013 you\u2019ve highlighted Specialty as a growth opportunity. Obviously you\u2019re performing well so far in areas of medical. How do you think about that against the backdrop of capital deployment? How do you think about areas where you think your customers are asking for you to do more? And as you \u2013 versus previous capital deployment and M&A opportunities, are there any other components or pieces of the business that you think is makes sense to beef up right now?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, as I mentioned, we still feel really good about having several areas that we would consider our strategic growth areas. I would highlight four of them, Specialty being one of them. At home we\u2019ve talked about our connected care services business and pharma and our medical services businesses. These are all businesses we\u2019re seeing significant growth on the top line and on the bottom line. There are also businesses that are really right on trend, care moving towards the Home and the various things that go along with Specialty and the service businesses. So these are areas where we are prioritizing our capital expenditures to those areas so we can really focus on organic growth. And if there are M&A opportunities out there that would make sense, those would be the areas that you would see us focus on.","Now that being said, we\u2019re going to continue to do all the right things in our core businesses to make sure we maintain and grow those. But for, what I would say, extra allocation of capital, those are going to be key areas that we\u2019re going to focus our capital expenditures on.","Kevin Moran","Yes Michael if I can add, so really, I\u2019d say we\u2019re focusing as well on partnerships in a way that probably more so than we have in the past. And when we do think about our internal capital, we\u2019re really thinking about it in four different categories. You get our maintenance capital where clearly you\u2019ve wrote initiatives like our supply chain, we\u2019re focusing on deploying capital to cost out type of projects, we\u2019re providing capital in areas where we need capacity for growth. But then we are also deploying some capital to explore new growth areas. So it\u2019s a pretty balanced approach, disciplined approach to getting a return on our CapEx.","Michael Cherny","Okay, thanks. ","Kevin Moran","Thanks Michael. Next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays.","Steven Valiquette","Great, thanks. Good morning everyone. So just to follow-up a little bit out of Specialty two things I want just done real quick. First, I was a little bit surprised about the biosimilar because there actually had been a bunch of biosimilar [indiscernible] dollars of the physician channel. But that was not really a driver [indiscernible] just changes the price experience with either customers or suppliers and separating specialty pricing from traditional brand pricing, whether that may have played a role in some of the better Pharma Distribution segment result. Thanks.","Mike Kaufmann","Thanks. I think I picked them up. There was a little spotty on being able to hear, but I think I got all your pieces. So let me see if I can walk through them all. From a change in price standpoint, I\u2019ll look at it \u2013 we\u2019ve been very disciplined over several years in our pharma distribution business to make sure that we\u2019re splitting out our pricing on our Specialty so that it is priced differently than normal brand, so that we don\u2019t \u2013 so we can make a fair return on the specialty drugs and we\u2019ve continued that discipline with any new business or renewals with either, as I\u2019ve said before, specific pricing in that area to maintain appropriate profitability or some types of mix type of penalties in agreements to make sure that if their mix goes the wrong way, that the overall cost of goods adjust. So we continue to be very focused on that in the PD area.","And also in the overall specialty business since there\u2019s very little generics in that space that is priced on a more individual drug standpoint. And again we remain very disciplined in that area to be careful. So I wouldn\u2019t say that pricing changes is either a \u2013 is a driver of our growth in specialty, but it\u2019s also not something that we\u2019re ignoring or I would say is a headwind from that standpoint. As far as growth in specialty overall, I would say it really comes from market growth. The market itself is growing significantly with new indications, new drug launches that the.","Your question on biosimilars, to think about biosimilars, the way to think about it is when a biosimilar launches, you\u2019re either \u2013 you\u2019re not necessarily getting new volume to speak of because it either you\u2019re replacing of current branded drug with a biosimilar. So overall your volume doesn\u2019t generally go up because of a biosimilar it\u2019s just an opportunity to potentially be able to have some market movement capabilities to have customers prefer one over the other. And those are where we can make a little bit of extra dollars when we work with our downstream customers to prefer either the brand or the biosimilar.","But from an overall perspective of drivers, at this point in time, I would not say that that is a significant driver, but I think it over time will get to be a more and more potential driver for specialty. Next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","James Auh","Hey, it\u2019s James on for Charles. Can you give us a quick update on our cost savings program, maybe how much of the $130 million of incremental savings expected this year has been achieved? Is it tracking in line with expectations? And perhaps how much of that\u2019s been reinvested opposed to dropping to the bottom line?","Dave Evans","Yes James thanks for the question. We\u2019re making great progress against that program and we\u2019re still on track to achieve the $500 million target as previously communicated. And I\u2019d also say we\u2019re on track to realize the $130 million or more this fiscal year. So we\u2019re making good progress. We\u2019ve got a pipeline, as you can imagine, we\u2019re tracking all sorts of opportunities and working through kind of stages of maturation. And we\u2019re seeing with strong confidence now our ability to attain the entire $500 million. So we\u2019re really continuing to focus more on not just simply cost out, but how do we try to drive improved value speed throughout the organization, increase our capabilities with the belief that that will continue to drive more savings throughout the future.","With respect to the level of reinvestment we are continually encouraging our organization to press \u2013 Mike and I, with lots of difficult choices and challenges to reinvest this with high returning projects. I can\u2019t quantify for you the exact amount of that, but we\u2019re encouraged that we are seeing more and more opportunities as we build this culture within the organization of encouraging people to seek out new opportunities for ongoing cost improvements, growth drivers, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think the program is one that we should deem as a real success.","James Auh","Okay and just another technical question in the share count guidance, does that include any additional share repo beyond the $350 million from the ASR?","Mike Kaufmann","No. James, that assumes that we completed the $350 million, and there will be no further purchases for this fiscal year contemplated in that guidance.","James Auh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Kevin Moran","Thanks for the questions. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.","Eric Percher","Thank you. I\u2019d like to return to the Medical recall. I recognize you\u2019re still working through the potential impact going forward. But could you provide us some context for how surgical gowns and kits fit into medical broadly, maybe starting with market share, where your customers are turning and impact on other elements of the business?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, I won\u2019t obviously be able to give a lot of detail on market share, but I can give you a little color is that there \u2013 the reason why this is such a \u2013 has a large impact, is that a lot of surgeries in the U.S. use kits. There\u2019s several different folks that compete in that space, but we do compete very effectively. We think with market leading type of quality and services tied to those kits, the ability to design and price those kits appropriately, et cetera. So the idea here is that a lot of surgeries in the U.S. do use kits and because gowns are in almost every kit. Even though when you look at this as an overall relatively small percentage of gowns sold across the U.S. because they\u2019re in kits that\u2019s why it\u2019s having a more \u2013 a larger impact than you might expect.","And so I\u2019ll just stop there and see what your follow-up question is, might be on that, just to make sure I\u2019m hitting the right things for you.","Eric Percher","So I think concerns from the hospital purchasers around impact on utilization and impacts on their business. You started with an apology and are taking that head on. But what is your take on the ability to remedy this and any impact on the business from what this has done to relationships here? ","Mike Kaufmann","Yes. I think any time you have a challenge in any business, it\u2019s often the way you respond, that makes the difference. And I couldn\u2019t be more impressed with how our Medical team from the leader, Steve, all the way down to people into the distribution centers have responded, taking accountability and ownership for this and said, we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make the customers\u2019 life as good as we can, knowing the circumstances. So we\u2019ve deployed hundreds of people we\u2019ve taken out, not only our Medical segment, but the Pharma team and Corporate Functions have also volunteered and sent people, even to the Vice President level, out to the field to pack kits pull things together for customers at their locations to make \u2013 to do the best we can.","And so I believe that the way we\u2019re responding to this is really, really important. And I think that our feedback so far from the majority of customers is they understand things like this can happen, but they respect and appreciate the way we\u2019re responding. ","It\u2019s hard to say how this ultimately \u2013 as Dave said, we don\u2019t know how this could affect our business going forward. And we\u2019re hoping that it doesn\u2019t. But we know that we have created some pain, and the most important thing to us is that our customers know that we are focused on them first and foremost so that they can treat the patients that they take care of that.","But we\u2019re also taking a lot of other specific actions, too. It\u2019s not only deploying people into the field to make things better, but it is also about increasing production of similar or replacement products. For instance, we\u2019re offering our more protective level 4 gowns to help bridge the supply gap. We\u2019ve ramped up production because we do source these gown in multiple locations. And so we\u2019re ramping up sourcing elsewhere. We\u2019re working with folks that make similar products, both brand and I\u2019d say, private label products to ramp those up to get them going so we have those that go in through with surgeries.","So it\u2019s really important that we look at all of these actions to make sure that we\u2019re keeping surgeries going and keeping our customers the pain from our customers as small as possible.","Kevin Moran","Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin Caliendo from UBS.","Kevin Caliendo","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just want to go back to the opioid comment. I think you called out that it could take months weeks or months to get this done. And that would run into two pretty high profile state trials that are scheduled. How does this increase in spending? Does that have anything to do with maybe a longer timeline? Or how should we think about those two state trials coming up in terms of the context of your expected spend now versus what it before?","Mike Kaufmann","Yes, clearly if those trials do happen, our spending goes up, which is why we gave a range, where we\u2019re not trying to indicate that they will or they won\u2019t. We just know they\u2019re out there. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves. We feel really good that we are and will be prepared for those trials that happen. We\u2019re not going to use those trials or have those trials cause us to panic and do something that doesn\u2019t make sense. And so we\u2019re going to continue to work with the four Gs and the rest of the states to get this initial framework done is still our goal. But I wouldn\u2019t look at the increased spending around, particularly related to the trials. Again, there is a range, but it\u2019s more around finishing up the negotiations.","And then you\u2019ve got to go through a documentation process, like actually papering it. And that takes \u2013 will take some significant lawyer time to get things papered and work through all those details. So I think it\u2019s more things like those. And then an implementation process working through the \u2013 how would we distribute the free goods. What changes can we make in the overall monitoring systems. There is a lot of work to be done that will take legal cost. And so we continue to be focused on it, and that\u2019s why we put that range out. ","Kevin Caliendo","If I can ask one really quick follow-up on the API issue, I think, Ricky brought it up earlier. You said that you thought there was enough supply in the chain to manage it. Can you quantify like how much is actually in the supply chain in terms of product? If China were to be a six-week issue or an eight-week issue, would that still be the \u2013 would you still feel comfortable with that? ","Mike Kaufmann","Yes it\u2019s a great question. I can\u2019t really give you that level of detail. I don\u2019t really know where our competitors are. I know that this is something that we\u2019ve looked at, specifically product by product, looked at products that we think have more potential risk of supply challenges because of where the raw materials add in the importance of those products to the healthcare system. And we have been working to ramp up supply and a few of those to carry a little bit extra.","So for, right now, from what we see, we\u2019re not anticipating any problems. But if the shutdowns in China were to go longer or it spreads and creates other challenges, it\u2019s just hard to know at this point in time. But we think we\u2019re managing it to the best of our abilities at this point in time.","Kevin Caliendo","That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks so much.","Mike Kaufmann","Welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go to our \u2013 we\u2019ll take our last question from Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric Coldwell","Hey thanks. Good morning. So in med-surg distribution, you cited that as both a headwind for revenue and profit. I guess I\u2019m a little bit surprised. We\u2019ve seen both inpatient and emergency department volumes increasing here for the last, call it, give or take, two, three, four quarters. And it\u2019s not only increasing, it\u2019s accelerating the increase at least to \u2013 according to some internal data and external data we have. We also had an early flu season. So what\u2019s going on in med-surg \u2013 core med-surg distribution in the U.S.? And what are the challenges that you\u2019re seeing now?","Mike Kaufmann","I think I\u2019ll start here, and then if there is anything to add, Dave can do that. I would say this, first of all, we\u2019re not seeing necessarily anything that would say that the actual med-surg historical volumes are very low-single-digit type of growth has changed significantly out there. So it\u2019s hard for me to comment on what you\u2019ve seen, but we haven\u2019t seen anything, I would say, dramatic in that spot. Remember, last year, we had a lot of lumpiness in our first couple of quarters related to the TSAs. And so some of our compare is, we think, caused by the fact that we\u2019re comparing the last year as we were going off those TSAs. And so if you look at our first half, we\u2019re roughly up 2%, which seems more in line. And so I think we really need to get another quarter or two behind us to understand overall. ","And again, with this kit recall and gown recall, there is a few challenges there. We\u2019re still trying to work through. But there is nothing, I would say, big going on. And from all the work we\u2019ve done by talking to our customers and to our reps, we still feel really confident about what we\u2019re doing in our commercial restructuring the debt over the mid to long term, that\u2019s going to be a large value creator for us. But we\u2019ve got to get through these challenges for that to happen. ","Eric Coldwell","Right. And I know the kit recall really didn\u2019t pop up until January. So I was clearly talking more about the last couple of quarters.","Mike Kaufmann","Absolutely.","Eric Coldwell","It\u2019s just \u2013 I guess maybe the TSA is an issue. We need to go back and revisit, but if we can take this up topline.","Dave Evans","Yes. Eric I\u2019d reiterate a little bit what Mike said, which is, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into a single quarter of Q2 because of all the transitions going on last year. I\u2019m really looking at our first half and saying, how is the first half compared to our expectations. And the first half is really \u2013 it\u2019s very much in line with our expectations.","Kevin Moran","Thanks again for the question. ","Kevin Moran","All right, so let me close. I\u2019d like to close by saying we remain focused on our customers and their patients, and we will continue to deliver on our strategic priorities. Thanks for your questions and your time today, and we look forward to speaking with each of you soon. Take care.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sally Curley, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Sally Curley","Thank you, Sam, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call this morning.  Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied.

We look forward to seeing some of you at the upcoming events.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Cardinal Health's Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett","Thanks, Sally. Good morning to those of you joining the call. We've had another strong quarter, which Jeff will describe in detail in a few minutes.  Typically, I devote most of my time to review the performance of the quarter just ended, but this has been an extraordinary few months, highlighted by 3 significant events, and I'd like to spend my time today putting those events into context.","First, last week, we renewed a very important strategic relationship with CVS Caremark. Second, some weeks ago, we announced that we would not be renewing our agreement to supply Walgreens; and third, we announced during the recent quarter the acquisition of AssuraMed. I'd like to touch on all of these.","Let me start with our recent multiyear agreement to continue to serve CVS Caremark. CVS has been a longtime partner. We've been privileged to play our part in helping them grow and they have continued to bring value to our business. The presence of large customers in any portfolio requires close, strategic economic and operational alignment, and in our relationship with CVS, we achieve those things.","Moving to Walgreens. Our announcement that we would not renew our supply agreement followed their announcement of a plan to invest in and, in combination with Alliance Boots, work with AmerisourceBergen on their supply chain needs. I'd like to give you my perspective on this.  The nonrenewal of any business is really something we or you want. Let me be clear. The loss of a customer the size of Walgreens even at lower margins and with high invested capital is anything but trivial. But over this past year, it had become increasingly difficult for us to align with Walgreens' direction, particularly in light of their Alliance Boots acquisition.  Given this, we had been preparing strategies for the future, which did include Walgreens, and Cardinal Health will be healthier for it in the long run. I don't want to leave this topic just yet. We've listened to many of your questions in recent weeks about scale and I'd like to provide a few quick comments on this.","Cardinal Health is a business of enormous scale. Pharmaceutical Distribution alone will continue to serve 18,000 retail pharmacies as well as thousands of hospitals and clinic pharmacies in the U.S. And biopharmaceutical companies depend on our experience and our reach to ensure that their products get to patients in the safest and most cost-effective manner possible.  We, in turn, depend on their innovation and commitment to patient care in serving the health care system. It's a partnership that is clearly working and will continue to drive strong value for the foreseeable future.","On the generic side, we are one of the largest generic drug purchasers in the world and will remain so, and we expect that this business will continue to grow, particularly as a result of the changing health care dynamics and policy direction coming from Washington. Over these past years, we have deepened our knowledge of and our ability to source products across the global network. This has been extremely beneficial to our customers and to our margin rates. We have the scale and the reach to move market share for our manufacturer partners and to assure best-in-class pricing for our customers. I should point out here that none of this was affected by the Walgreens nonrenewal. As Walgreens has been primarily a direct buyer of generics, they have served largely as a backup on generics contract business. The third important point to this conversation is the enormous strategic relevance of the move we made during this recent quarter to take a leadership position in the market that serve patients in the home with our acquisition of AssuraMed.","There are 2 overwhelming facts that without exaggeration will change health care. First, demographics don't lie. Our population is aging, living longer, and more care will be delivered in the home. That's not opinion, it's math.  And second, the economic realities, largely driven by that demographic shift, will bring pressures to treat patients in the most cost-effective setting and to keep patients from being readmitted to hospitals. Safe, high-quality care in the home will be essential to accomplishing this.  AssuraMed is an important addition to our Medical segment and to Cardinal Health as a whole. It is a natural extension of our strategy to follow the patient throughout the continuum of care in an increasingly integrated health care system. It leverages our experience and our scale in sourcing those products used by patients in other health care settings we serve. It helps us support our health care system's partners, who will increasingly be responsible for the patient after that patient leaves the hospital or clinic, and it will support our retail provider partners, who can use our platform to serve their patients in the home.","And this acquisition brings us directly in contact with the patient, whether that patient is chronically ill or one requiring post-acute care. Think about it.  More direct interaction, more health care on the patients' terms, suited for the patients' life. This is an important new dimension for Cardinal Health, and one which builds on our DNA and supply chain management. We are thrilled to close the transaction and welcome Michael Petras, his leadership team and all of the AssuraMed people into Cardinal Health. The integration is already under way and going very well.","In many ways, these recent events accelerate the journey we began more than 4 years ago. This journey was focused on driving balance and growth by diversifying our portfolio of customers, products and channels. This required expanding into higher-value, higher-margin settings and higher-value, higher-margin products and services, all on a sustainable foundation that requires rock solid alignment with our customers. The progress we've made is significant. Over these past 4 years, we've increased our base of independent retail customers from 3,800 to nearly 7,800, and our non-bulk business now represents 70% of total pharmaceutical sales. Our generic sales have nearly doubled. We've increased our position at our service and product offerings in hospitals, clinics, surgery centers, oncology, urology and rheumatology practices, doctors offices, and now with the AssuraMed acquisition, the home.","For the first time in our history, wherever health care products or services are needed at any stage of the patient experience, we are there for them. We've continued to drive a preferred product portfolio in our medical segment that addresses our customers' needs for more cost-effective medical products. And finally, we've expanded into China, where our unique value proposition allows us to build a strong brand, enhance strategic alignment with its biopharma and medical device companies and participate in a rapidly growing Chinese health care system.  Through these efforts, we have grown our non-GAAP EPS at a compounded double-digit rate, deployed our capital effectively, including a further 10% increase in our dividend announced today. We've expanded our margin rates and more effectively position Cardinal Health to create value in an increasingly patient-centered health care system. Before I close, let me take a moment to put my comments into some financial context. As you may remember, when we announced the Walgreens decision on March 19, we felt that it was important to provide some early indications as to how our fiscal year 2014 might look. At that time, we provided a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share target range of $3.42 to $3.50.","We now have another month of work behind us and some additional clarity on some important moving parts. And although our fiscal year 2014 budget is not complete yet, we would now preliminarily target a number for fiscal 2014 towards the upper end of that EPS range. And we're not sitting still. We will serve the market with a clear sense of purpose, the discipline to execute and the self-awareness to note that there are always areas where we need to get better. I hope this gives you a bit of a window into what we're thinking and I look forward to your questions.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I did want to mention a big event we have coming up here. Many of you know Kevin Moran, our Manager of Investor Relations. Well, next weekend, he's marrying his lovely fianc\u00e9e, Sarah, and George and I just want to take this moment to congratulate him and wish him and his future bride a long and happy marriage.","Okay, back to business. This morning, I plan to review the drivers of the third quarter performance and our full fiscal 2013 outlook. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Let's start with consolidated results. We reported a 28% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal 2013 third quarter versus the prior year's period. This was driven by 2 major items. First and most importantly, we achieved a robust 11% non-GAAP operating earnings growth. Second, our results also included $0.18 related to a favorable discrete tax settlement. Excluding the $0.18, non-GAAP earnings per share grew 8.5%, another very solid quarter of growth.","Let me go through the rest of the income statement in a little bit more detail, starting with revenues. Consistent with our expectations, consolidated revenues were down almost 9% to $24.6 billion due to the previously announced nonrenewal of the Express Scripts contract and the continued pharmaceutical brand-to-generic conversions.  Gross margin dollars increased 7% with the rate up 77 basis points versus prior year. We successfully expanded our year-over-year gross margin rate every quarter for the past 11 quarters, reflecting a concerted effort to drive favorable customer and product mix and a focus on accelerating the growth of certain higher-margin strategic initiatives.","SG&A expenses increased by 4% in Q3 with acquisitions comprising 2.6 percentage points of that increase. We remain very focused on controlling costs while balancing our investments in key strategic priorities. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 41 basis points to 2.36%. Interest and other expense increased versus last year's third quarter due to the funding of the AssuraMed acquisition.","Let me take a minute explain our unusual tax rate for the quarter. We had an abnormally low non-GAAP tax rate of 25.1% in Q3 due to the favorable $64 million tax settlement I mentioned earlier. The settlement resulted in a revaluation of our deferred tax liability and related interest on unrepatriated foreign earnings. Please note that this amount only affects our tax line and has no impact on operating earnings or the segment results. Without that single discrete item, our tax rate for the quarter would have been 36.7%, much more in line with our normal rate. I'll discuss tax assumptions again when we talk about our total year guidance later in my prepared remarks. Our diluted average shares outstanding were 345 million for the third quarter, approximately 5 million favorable to the prior year's quarter.  Our opportunistic share repurchases during fiscal 2012 and the first quarter of fiscal 2013 continue to positively impact our share count.","Now let's discuss consolidated cash flows and the balance sheet. We generated almost $1 billion in cash from operating activities in the quarter. Year-to-date, operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion is slightly ahead of where we were at this point last fiscal year despite absorbing the Express Scripts unwind, which had a negative impact on net working capital. This reflects a strong underlying performance of our businesses. I will point out here that we do expect our fourth quarter operating cash flow to be negative due in large part to some significant tax payments we expect to be making. This is consistent with the assumption that we've laid out for you at the beginning of the year.","Also note in Q3, we raised $1.3 billion of long-term debt at a very favorable weighted average rate of 3.1%. The debt was used for the $2.1 billion acquisition of AssuraMed, and brings our total debt balance to about $4.2 billion, including both short- and long-term obligation. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $2.3 billion in cash on our balance sheet, which includes approximately $370 million held internationally. Our working capital days ended the quarter higher than the prior year, primarily driven by the exploration of the Express Scripts contract and seasonal purchasing patterns.","Now let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss Parma first. In line with our expectation, Pharma segment revenues decreased 10% to $22.1 billion due to the expiration of the Express Scripts contract and continued brand-to-generic conversions. This decrease was partially offset by revenues of some new customers. Of particular note, sales to non-bulk customers continued to increase, up over 5% for the period. In Q3, sales to non-bulk customers represent 70% of the segment total versus 60% in last year's Q3. Our generic programs continue to perform well, posting a revenue increase of 11% versus the prior year. Contingent brand inflation was in the high single-digits, about as we expected. As a reminder, Q3 is typically our highest quarter benefit from contingent brand inflation.","In Specialty Solutions, we had revenue growth of over 60% versus last year's quarter. Pharma segment profit increased by 12% to $498 million, driven by the overall strong growth in our generics programs and performance under our branded manufacturer agreements, exclusive of the volume impact.  With respect to generics, we did as expected. We left contribution from new generic launches in this year's quarter versus Q3 of fiscal 2012. We also had steeper generic deflation sequentially from Q2, but again, overall, our generics program has performed very well during the quarter. Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 44 basis points compared to the prior year's Q3, a reflection of the strength of our generics programs and our focus on margin expansion and customer and product mix. In addition, within customer categories, margin expansion in Pharma Distribution was strong across almost all of our customer classes of trade.  Finally, our Nuclear business continued to make the necessary adjustments to compete effectively in a tough utilization environment.","Now moving onto medical. Medical revenue growth was up 3% versus last year, an increase of $69 million. Acquisitions, including AssuraMed and Futuremed, were the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. Partially offsetting the segment revenue growth was one fewer sales day in the quarter.  Like many others in the industry have noted, we again saw procedural volume softness in the U.S. market, which had some moderating impact on our segment results. Given all that, we're pleased to report 12% medical segment profit growth this quarter. Commodity pricing resulted in year-on-year favorability to our current period input costs of $12 million. Despite the procedural trends I just mentioned, we improved our preferred product mix, which resulted in a positive contribution to segment profit growth in the quarter from these key products.  We saw a slight contribution from AssuraMed in the period. Recall that we closed on March 18, so we only had 13 days of contribution to the quarter's profit. These profit improvements were partially offset by rate compression, driven in part by customer mix.","Let's talk about AssuraMed a little more. Although it's only been part of the Cardinal Health family now for about 6 weeks, we are happy to report that everything is on track. In fact, AssuraMed's integration of Invacare Supply Group is moving faster than planned, and we're starting to see some of the anticipated cost synergies.  In addition, the interest rate on the $1.3 billion debt issuance to fund the purchase price was at the low end of our expectations.  Accordingly, we are increasingly confident in our ability to meet the accretion estimates we provided at the time we announced the deal. I'll wrap up my review on segment performance with a comment on Cardinal Health China, which spans both segments. Cardinal Health China continued its very strong double-digit revenue growth again this quarter. Our local direct distribution business, which provides products to hospitals and retail pharmacies, reported another exceptional quarter, with 70% top line growth.","Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter, which include items that reduce our GAAP results by $0.20 per share compared to non-GAAP. Included in this figure is the exclusion of $0.10 of acquisition-related costs, which reflects $0.05 of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. We also had $0.06 of restructuring costs and $0.04 of impairments and loss on disposal of assets, both largely related to our previously announced restructuring in the medical segment. You may recall that in Q3 of last year, we had a $0.10 benefit in our GAAP results from a reduction in the fair value of the P4 Healthcare acquisition earn-out liability.","Now let's talk briefly about guidance for the current fiscal year. Given our year-to-date fiscal 2013 results and with only one quarter remaining, we are raising and tightening our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance range to $3.57 to $3.71. Again, please note that this revised range includes the $0.18 tax benefit realized in the third quarter. With the exception of our tax rate and the recent addition of AssuraMed, I would say that our overall second half consolidated result are shaping up largely as we expected, with some shift in the balance between our third and fourth quarters. Most of the underlying assumptions, including our consolidated revenue guidance, remain unchanged from our previous comments.","However, I do want to mention a few points. First, the medical device tax impact for fiscal 2013 is now expected to be in the $8 million to $10 million range for the 6 months the law have been in effect, which reflects our best estimate, our best assessment of the current regulations.  From an accounting perspective, this tax appears as SG&A on our income statement. Second, as a reminder, our new multiyear contract with CVS is in effect as of April 1 of this year, and this is reflected in our forecast. Third, our revised guidance assumes a non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter fiscal 2013 of approximately 37%. However, we are in the latter stages of further discussions with state and federal tax authorities on outstanding audit periods, and it's difficult to predict the timing and magnitude of any outcomes, but it is distinctly possible that we could have some discrete tax items, positive and\/or negative, that may be reported as early as Q4 as a result of those discussions. To the extent that there are significant in nature, we will plan to breakout those onetime amount in future periods.  Obviously, any material, unusual or discrete settlements in the fourth quarter could impact our forecasted earnings per share in either direction. My final comments regarding FY '13 assumptions are focused on AssuraMed. We are updating the previously provided fiscal '13 guidance for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles to $120 million to include the closing of AssuraMed. As a reminder, this amount is included from our non-GAAP earnings. Our preliminary estimates for both goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets have been added to our balance sheet as a result of this deal and the details will be included in our Form 10-Q to be filed next week.","Now a word on next year. George mentioned our preliminary view of fiscal 2014, targeting the upper end of the $3.42 to $3.50 range we provided on March 19.  I'd like to reiterate that we are in the midst of our planning processes, and we'll provide more detailed guidance during our Q4 earnings call in August. Along the way, we haven't taken the necessary actions to improve efficiency and position ourselves competitively for the future.","Finally, I want to spend a few minutes on capital deployment, which apply to the balance of fiscal '13, fiscal '14 and beyond. We anticipate that the expiration of the Walgreens contract will result in a net after-tax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2014 of more than $500 million based on the expected working capital decrease, loss after-tax earnings and other cash tax impacts.  Although it is still too early to get into all the specifics as to how we will use that amount or any other capital we'll generate next year, we will remain disciplined on our capital deployment decisions. Our goals remain the same as they have for the past 4 years. Our first 2 priorities are investing to sustain growth in our existing businesses, and growing the dividend at least in line with long-term non-GAAP EPS growth. In his latter regard, as George mentioned, our board has approved another increase in our dividend, taking the quarterly amount up by 10% to $0.3025 per share, effective with the July payment. This quarterly dividend per share is over 40% higher than the dividend paid in April of 2012. Today's announcement brings our dividend yield to approximately 2.8% based on our current stock price. Beyond these priorities, we will continue to evaluate other deployment options, including acquisitions and share repurchases, in a balanced manner to optimize the shareholder return, sustainable growth and our credit position. I fully expect that we'll be buying back at least $250 million of shares in the coming months, and we'll continue to assess additional opportunities.","With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So, I guess the updated earnings outlook's definitely helpful and reassuring. I guess I'm also just curious on your preliminary thoughts on the generic pipeline outlook as it lines up with your fiscal '14. Maybe compare and contrast that with what we're seeing in the current fiscal year.","George S. Barrett","Sure, Steve, I'll take it. This is George. Yes, I think, we've mentioned this before and we're a few months further along and maybe have a little more color. But here's what we'll say at this stage at sort of the macro level. When we're looking at generic launch value, I would probably say with our fiscal years, '13 is probably greater than '14. '15, still early to tell. I would say, right now, it doesn't look all that different than '14, sort of plus or minus. So that would be the quick, very high-level perspective at this stage, Steve.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is fiscal '13 coming in better than what you thought previously, and that's why when you think about '14 and what you said there, that's -- it's really more of the delta on '13 that's changing? Is that the way to kind of think about that?","George S. Barrett","Yes, so as you know, in generics, there's so many moving parts. '13 is probably coming in a little stronger than we modeled and '14, probably not all that different. But, I think, again, there's a few little moving parts that can swing these numbers. So you know that's part of the business that's -- it has some -- takes some forward-looking that is not always perfect, but that's our overall perspective at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Ransom of Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Would you mind just recapping? You said the back half of fiscal '13 was lined up how you thought, but maybe some earnings were pushed into the March quarter over the June quarter. Could you just recap what the key drivers were of that?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. John, it's Jeff. I'll take that. Yes, as I said, overall, the second half of the year is largely coming out on a consolidated basis, as we expected, back earlier in the year when we put together our guidance and our forecasts, with the 2 exceptions that I called. One was the tax settlement that we realized in Q3 and the second was the addition of AssuraMed, which didn't happen until March when it closed. But beyond that, it is largely playing out as we expected, with some slight shift between probably from Q4 to Q3. And I would say that's largely due to the rate of brand inflation that we saw in Q3, and that impacted our contingent buy margin. It was probably a little bit higher than we expected and perhaps a slight shift from Q4 to Q3. I would say that was primarily the major factor that resulted in a bit of a shift.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And I jumped on a little bit late so I may have missed this. But is there any commentary -- there's been a lot of talk in the market about oncology and the sequester? Has there -- anything notable in your oncology businesses as a result of the sequester?","George S. Barrett","Yes, John, it's George. We've got very limited exposure at this point. So the sequestration, certainly, has been a material issue for the oncology and specialty community, but reimbursement pressures have been sort of building over this past year so it's not a particularly new thing. But for us, again, our model is a little bit different. We've been sort of focusing on sort of a different, different approach, and as you know, working very heavily at sort of this collaborative effort between the payers and providers to create value and alignment there. So our direct exposure to that sequestration impact is somewhat limited.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair.","Roberto Fatta","This is Robbie Fatta in for John today. First, a quick question on the Medical Business Transformation initiative, which I don't think we heard much about in the prepared comments. What was the impact this quarter and what do you think the benefit to 2014 might be at this point?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, Robbie, thanks for the question. One of the reasons we didn't talk a whole lot about it is because the medical system that we implemented last year is now very much integrated into the overall business, and really, the focus now is we'll continue to optimize our use of it, and using it as a platform to grow other parts of the business. But that all said, from a pure financial standpoint, it was slightly positive in Q3 in terms of the year-on-year impact of the implementation, including the impacts of depreciation netted against the benefit that we realized. Year-to-date, the benefit -- combined benefit is slightly negative, reflecting particularly Q1 when we had some issues related to change management that we're addressing. For the full year of fiscal 2013, we're still targeting for it to be a net positive for the medical segment. And then I would say going into fiscal '14, I won't give specific numbers, but we do expect to continue to drive the benefit from the transformation. But again, it's less about getting the system to work, which is it at this point and that's largely behind us. That is behind us. It's about now using the system to drive, for example, increased penetration of preferred products with our customers to bring down inventory levels to optimize pricing. So we do expect a significant benefit heading into 2014.","Roberto Fatta","Great. And one other one if I may. You made a couple of comments on capital deployment, and now you mentioned the buyback as part of the overall deployment strategy. Can you talk about how aggressive you might be with a buyback like that? Could you do something, perhaps, accelerate it or is that not really in the cards?","George S. Barrett","As we look to implement our share buybacks, we consider all options and look at what make sense from a timing and execution standpoint. I never want to get too specific about mechanisms or timing. Obviously, you never want to total -- totally signal to the market when you're going to be in the market buying back shares, but I will reiterate what I said, that we do expect to buyback at least $250 million worth of shares in the coming months, and that expectation is reflected in our targeted guidance for next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Stephan Stewart, calling for Bob. Just wanted to follow-up on that share buyback comment. Is that $250 million the only thing contemplated in next year's guidance from a buyback perspective?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Well, first of all, just to reiterate overall from a capital deployment perspective, there's a number of things that we have looked at and will continue to look at. Obviously, we've got a significant increase in the dividend, which, as I said in my prepared remarks, once it's paid in July, will represent a per share payment that's more than 40% above what the April 2012 payment was. I would say that's a significant decision with respect to our capital deployment, and one that we remain very committed to. We'll continue to invest appropriately in the CapEx in the business. So we've got some important priorities we'll continue to support, and that investment will continue. And then beyond that, we continue to look at the balance between acquisitions in select strategic areas and share repo, and I would say both of those will be looked in a balanced and opportunistic way. Regarding the repo, yes, I use the words at least $250 million worth because, again, depending on market conditions and cash availability, et cetera, it's always possible that we could do more, but the reference to at least $250 million is sort of the assumption that's implicit in our guidance for next year.","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just broadly on the medical segment, you did highlight customer mix. I know it's an ongoing theme, but can you maybe expand on that a bit and how much of an impact it's having on your rate compression?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, I would say it's probably been the biggest factor in our rate compression for the past couple of quarters. I'll give you a very specific example of that. Our Department of Defense contract, both -- the overall volumes, but I would say the types of volumes that we're getting in terms of orders from the Department of Defense are significantly different than both of what we were expecting and even what we realized last year and that's obviously driven in a significant part from the fact that we've had a troop withdrawal from the wars that were going on in Afghanistan and Iraq. And that's changed the mix and the type of customers within the Department of Defense that we're servicing and the products that we're providing. So that's one specific example, and I would say a fairly big driver of that mix.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I want to hit on preferred products in medical. I know, recently, you said the mix was around, I think, 24%. I was hoping we could get an update on that. And also, if you could update us on your recent moves in, say, orthopedics or cardiovascular. Last night, on the GPO's call, there was a confirmation of the increasing commoditization of what were previously considered only to be physician-preference items purchases, customers being more flexible, et cetera. I'm just curious if you can give some updates on what you're doing as you move up the value chain there?","George S. Barrett","Eric, I think what we'll do is Jeff will reply to the first part of the question, and I'll jump in with a little bit on the second.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. Just to fine-tune the figure that you quoted, Eric, I think what we said most recently is the preferred products make up about 23% of the medical segment revenues. That was exclusive of AssuraMed. I would say in the recent quarters, that number continues to creep up as we begin to fully integrate AssuraMed and use our product portfolio and sourcing abilities to drive some of our products -- medical products through AssuraMed. Hopefully, that percentage will increase as well. But I would say it's still generally around that 23% level, perhaps, a little bit higher based on the last couple of months. George?","George S. Barrett","Yes, and, Eric, on the broader question, I think we'd concur with the observation that you heard, which is that there is a growing awareness that part of what we see in medical devices is relatively commoditized. And there's a lot of attention throughout the health care system looking at what they call the physician-preferred items. So again, the providers are under tremendous cost pressure, and so our ability to bring them cost-effective alternative is really important. For us, the starting point has been orthopedics, and particularly in the trauma area. So we're talking about things like cannulated screws and drill bits and guide wires and then supporting services that complement that. That's been part of our initial launch, again, in collaboration with EMERGE, which we launched about a year ago. So that's going very well. We're getting a lot of really positive response from customers. So again, I think we'd concur with that observation. And I think this is going to an ongoing trend if you think about, again, where that bar sits on physician preference items, and, obviously, we're talking very regularly now with our health care system partners on this.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had a couple of follow-up questions. First, George, you talked about CVS and a long-term partnership. Is there any changes in your new contract versus what services you provided them before?","George S. Barrett","Yes, Lisa. We're going to be somewhat limited as to what we can say regarding that relationship. I would say that we have a very deep and broad relationship with CVS Caremark, and we're really excited about continuing that. So the exact dimensions of that, the exact lines of business, we can't fully share, but we're longtime partners, very, very creative in looking to each other to find ways of creating value.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then you also made a comment around scale because, clearly, the street has been very focused on this whole idea of scale and what the new Walgreens, Alliance Boots, AmerisourceBergen relationship brings. Do you believe that you need to have some kind of international partner in order to gain scale? And maybe can you just talk from your point of view how manufacturers look at this? Is there a point of diminishing return that you're at a certain size and this is the discounts we're willing to give and if you're 10% bigger than that, the -- it's not 10% incremental savings. How do I think about that?","George S. Barrett","Yes, Lisa, that's a really good question. There's a lot in that one, and I'm going to be somewhat careful in my reply. Here's what I would say, again, scale has to be actionable, very important. So again, having lived on the manufacturer's side, I'm really looking for someone who can do the job for me in market, and that's a really important dynamic. So this has different dimensions on the branded side and on the generics. So on the branded side, what I'm looking for is manufacturers to make sure that my partner can represent my products and get them in and into patients the most cost-effective way. On the generics side, it has a little bit of a different dimension to it. But again, as I said and I think this is really important, our scale today is really significant, and so, again, I would say this, I've learned over a lot of years never to be dismissive of a competitor or another industry move. That's not a smart thing to do, but we've studied this pretty carefully, and we feel very comfortable with our scale, our ability to work with a global system and our ability to make markets for our customers. So obviously, we'll be staying close to this and it's early days.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci of Lazard.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I guess I had 2 questions in the MedSurg area. Firstly, you mentioned the positive impact of commodities in the quarter after it had been a little bit of a drag in the last couple of years. How do we sort of line up, Jeff, on a year-over-year basis as we think about the next few quarters? And then the other question was just around reform. Obviously, you mentioned the medical device tax, but, George, just curious if you had any comments about how you're thinking about the impact of reform on that market? Do you expect volume acceleration or any other things that we should be thinking about?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Tom, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. I'll go first and then turn it over to George. Yes, so for Q4, we expect the positive impact from commodity prices to be relatively small. Current estimate's sort of in the 4-ish million-dollar range of positive impact year-on-year in Q4. Then heading into next year, based on forward curves of the various chemicals that we buy, et cetera, it's a slight negative, a slight headwind next year, but we're probably talking in the 10-ish million-dollar range. So at this point, not a huge swing factor. Obviously, that could change quickly, particularly based on where oil prices move, but again, right now, it's about a $4 million positive impact in Q4 and next year, it's like negative to the tune of maybe $10 million or so.","George S. Barrett","Tom, I'll jump in on the second one, which is a little bit harder to answer related to the Affordable Care Act and how that's unfolding. Here's what I would say to you, we're not building into our models additional volume. That doesn't mean that it may not happen or it's not likely to happen. We just, at this stage, do not know how to model that. There's a lot of issues still in front of us on the roll out of the act. Obviously, 2014 is a key year. We're going to have to see how the exchanges are playing out, and how that access issue really plays out. And so for us, I think we just felt it was more cautious just not to model-in any additional volume based on it, but, obviously, we'll be staying very close to it, and as you can imagine, we're quite active in Washington.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have 2 follow-up questions here. First of all, on CVS, I understand you can't provide much detail. But just to clarify, you said that the impact from the renewal is embedded in the implied guidance for fourth quarter, and then is it also included on your fiscal year '14 initial target of being at the high end of the $3.42 to $3.50?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, Ricky, it's reflected in both.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And when we think about the -- just the sequential delta between the -- what you reported in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, obviously, you have kind of a brand price inflation benefit there, et cetera, but should we think about that sequential step down as CVS, as part of it as being CVS, and can we just take that and factor it into '14?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Again, I'm always a little bit hesitant to get too specific on pricing with any particular customer, but yes, the repricing that we put in place for CVS does take effect April 1 and you can assume that continues into FY '14 at about the same rate. Now obviously, you're focused on CVS. There's lots of other factors into our Q4 numbers and next year's numbers, but with regards to that specific one, I think you got the answer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo of Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, just 2 quick ones for you. First, looking at the industry over the last 18 months, there's clearly been a lot of noise on the contracting front, and the market seems to be very nervous with each sort of -- with these situations. And while I get it, there seems to be a unique story around each one of these contracts in kind of why they're moving. Is there sort of a bigger picture conclusion that we should be drawing because, clearly, it follows a very extended period of time where we never have these conversations? And so if you can give us your assessment of the pricing environment, and is there anything sort of significant in your book coming up in the next year or 2 that you're focused on, that would be helpful.","George S. Barrett","Yes, Glen, let me -- the second part, the last part of it, there's nothing that we would call out in the near-term horizon. Going back to your beginning observation, here's what I would say, I'm not sure I completely agree that this is not a conversation that's happened before, and again, during my tenure here, big contract renewals get big attention, and we understand that. So I don't think I would say -- now obviously, there's been a big industry move in these last few months, so let's not dismiss that. But independent of that dynamic, I'm not sure I would characterize the market as materially different. It is true that, actually, every contract has discrete characteristics, very unique terms, lines of business. So for us, contracts like CVS Caremark and Walgreens were very large contracts. I think it's understandable that they would get a lot of attention and -- but I would not say that, that alters the day-to-day dynamics that we see in the marketplace, if that's helpful.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe if I can just ask one follow-up on AssuraMed. It kind of sounds like you're very positive on the fundamentals with the demographic shifts, et cetera. It also sounds like the integration's going very well, but from the market's perspective, I think there's been some incremental concerns that potentially this acquisition exposes the company to some different sort of regulatory or reimbursement environment that it hasn't had that historical exposure. And so I'm just kind of curious if now that you've been living with the acquisition for a little bit, is there a way that you can sort of sum up what you think the potential reimbursement exposure is, whether it be competitive bidding or more direct government reimbursement? And how should we think about that risk when thinking about the growth of this acquisition?","George S. Barrett","Sure. Yes, Glen, as you can imagine, when we did our analysis, we thought very carefully about the dynamic around reimbursement, and we adjusted for that in our modeling as we approached this business. That's number one. Number two, our exposure on diabetes, DNE, for example, is very limited. So this business has very carefully positioned itself to limit exposure in areas that were particularly heated, and we feel very good about our positioning there. Again, it's an opportunity to really be in a market-leading position in a segment that we know is going to grow and we're going to have to be very, very efficient doing our work, but I would say, today, our exposure to those dynamics are somewhat limited.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken of ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","George, it's obviously been a bumpy last 6, 7 months or so and that comes off of a period where you did a lot of transformational things for the business. As we think about sort of what AssuraMed brings now to the asset group and sort of how the mix, at least, on a profit basis is sort of shifting, I realize you're still have a very big, very powerful profitable Pharma business, but the complexion of the asset seems to be going in sort of the opposite direction and just in terms of where, at least, you're looking to acquire. And so when we think about Cardinal going forward, I mean, do you feel like the historical view of what this asset was is still kind of what the future view is going to be? Or do you feel like we're moving into some of these growthier maybe higher-margin areas, and so the mix and complexion over time is probably to change?","George S. Barrett","So, Ross, a really good question. For me, this not about going in the opposite direction. It's not a departure from a business. It's sort of a turning of the wheel a little bit, an expansion of business. We are very proud to have a market-leading distribution business. It's an important anchor for us in the Health System. It allows us to touch every part of the system and we'll continue to invest in it and make sure it's vibrant and healthy. Having said that, we do think that there's evolution in markets, and it's very important for us to evolve with it and, ideally, ahead of it to see what's in front of us. And so the decision to move into the AssuraMed business really was thoughtful, and it wasn't just about an exciting healthy business. It was about direction of the market that is inescapable that care is going to be shifting. We want to be in a position to deliver our products and perhaps services into those markets. Our business of distribution today is heavily wrapped in a service component. So I'm not -- I wouldn't describe this as a departure or moving in the opposite direction. We've seen ourselves, and I think you've heard me describe this, as a broad-based health services company. I will continue to articulate it in that way, and we're excited about the movement, but we're very keen on driving our core business and making sure that we're doing a good job for our customers.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'll ask this in sort of in a delicate way. If you look at the stock price, it's obviously been flattish now for some time, and I'm sure you're kind of disappointed with sort of the performance, but a lot of it is actually sort of a compression in the multiple versus your peers. And so as you think about sort of what the market is implying on your future growth despite the fact you've sort of raised the dividend consistently, which has sort of been a positive bias for the market, what do you think the disconnect is? And when you sort of look forward to the kind of growth profile of this asset now that we've gotten through this period of kind of customer attrition, once we get past that difficult '14 comp, how do you think about sort of the free cash or the free cash potential or sort of the growth potential of the pro forma asset once we get through that?","George S. Barrett","So let me try to go back to the beginning. It's always tricky to be commenting on how people view your stock price, so I'll give it some care, but here's what I'd say. There's no question that it has been a very noisy last 6 months with large customer renewals, and as you know, an extra ordinary amount of chatter about how that was going to play out or not play out and some big industry moves. So we understood that, that affect has affected the way people saw us for a while. We now are through that period, and, as I said towards the end of my comments earlier, our track record at this point is pretty clear and the progress, I think, has been pretty consistent. We are very optimistic about the future and positioned really well to drive value in a system unfolding in a lot of different ways. So as I said, the last 6 months have certainly been -- or 9 months have certainly been noisy around these industry events and certainly around our renewals. But I feel very excited about our positioning in medical business, around China, around our generics offering, about our growing position in specialty and around the opportunity now to bring value to the home. We have a unique value proposition to our customers and our ability to touch so many products, so many lines of business and so many of those channels is really important. So I feel very good about that and I'll leave it with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Willoughby of Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","George, can you possibly speak to some of the opportunities you see to expand AssuraMed sales channels? Can you do more with the CVS, and is the Walgreens maybe out of the picture in this respect?","George S. Barrett","Bob, so again, I'll be a little bit careful about what we can do with whom. I will say this, the business we acquired has performed very well. We're excited about it, but we also see this as a platform. We have already been working in areas -- for example, our oncology team is in offices. Those offices needs support and medical supplies. We're able to think about how to link that together. We're in urological offices. We have to then be able to follow that patient to the home with supplies. So we see the opportunity to link into our specialty business. We see the opportunity to support our retailers, many of whom have loyal customer followings that need products in the home and they use us for fulfillment. We see products expansion opportunities here. And so we do see it as more of a base. Now, our early priority right now is making sure the integration is going perfectly and that we're executing, but we see this probably in bigger dimensions than the business that we acquire.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen and Co.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Another question on the medical, I think, last quarter, Jeff, you called out, I think it was a $5 million in prior period gains recorded in the quarter. Can you give us an update? Was there any type of prior period adjustments that were recorded here in this quarter? I'll start there.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, thanks for the question, Charles. No, there were no out-of-period adjustments of any note in our Q3. I think we cleaned up most of the issues we needed to in Q1 and Q2. As we sort of went through the implementation and went back to make sure that everything was ticking in tying exactly right, there was a little bit of clean up in Q1 and Q2. But at this point, I believe that's behind us so there were no further adjustments in Q3.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the distribution side, obviously, a very strong performance in the margin, much better than we had expected in the growth -- sorry, EBIT growth. All of your competitors have talked about tough sort of generic comps, given last year. You had Zyprexa and Lipitor. I mean, is that -- did you face that same sort of tough comp issue there? And what were some of the things that helped you kind of get over that?","George S. Barrett","Yes, I'm sure we did face many of those same issues, and from a generic launch perspective, this Q3 was less than last year's Q3. But I think the fact that we still grew generics 11% and posted the type of profit performance and margin expansion that we saw in Q3 is a testament to the strength of our overall generics portfolio and the Pharma Distribution business. As we've often said, clearly, we have to try to forecast generic launch impacts, et cetera, et cetera, but the goal here is not to rely on the launch impact. It's to build a large, growing, sustainable generics business that can drive value well beyond initial launch period for a generic. And I think you're seeing an example of that in our Q3, where our sales performance, our penetration, our generic sourcing efforts are all contributing to a very robust portfolio that can sustain growth even with the ups and downs of generic launches.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Larsen of Leerink Swann.","Chris Abbott - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","This is Chris Abbott, in for Dave. I'm looking at your pharmaceutical operating margins and you obviously posted some strong growth this quarter. As we think of the large customers rolling off, you've now transitioned Express Scripts and you've obviously got Walgreens coming up next year. Does that take a few quarters to kind of fully optimize the expense structure? I mean, was there more sort of benefit to the margin this quarter than last or was it really more about generic launches?","George S. Barrett","Yes, I would say -- if you're talking specifically about Express Scripts, I would say there was very little, if any, incremental expense impact, operating expense impact, in Q3 versus Q2. We had largely made whatever adjustments we needed to make in the Q2 period so that was not a driving factor in Q3. Regarding Walgreens, clearly, until the contract ends, we will service that business to the best of our ability and would never take any actions to jeopardize that. Obviously, once that runs out at the end of August, we'll begin taking the necessary actions to reduce the variable expenses associated with that and then certain fixed expenses in the company as well. But that will happen beginning after August 31 and you'll see the impact of that, really, in Q2 of next year.","Operator","Our last question comes from George Hill of Citi.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Kind of following up on the generic -- I'm sorry, on the drug distribution performance in the quarter looks pretty strong. Can you -- when you think about the margin improvements, can you give us any color on how much of it was performance in the generic programs, how much of it was customer mix, how much of it was just underlying business mix, brand versus generic, that kind of led to the improvement?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, I'm not going to break it out specifically. I would say it is across the board. I think the generics performance and performance under our branded contracts, excluding the volume impact, those are the 2 biggest factors that we called out and they drove the biggest year-on-year improvement. But I would say everything you mentioned was a factor. Obviously, not having Express Scripts versus last year improves the margins just given the size of that account and the relatively low margin nature of the bulk business. I would say -- but even beyond that, our overall customer and product mix has continued to improve. So they all drove it, but the 2 biggest factors were generics and branded margin.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, George, just maybe a strategic question. I suspect with given some of the changes that are going on in the market, we're going to hear about volatility in the channel, in the highly profitable independent pharmacist channel. Can you talk about the stickiness of those customers, especially as we think of who's the real independent and who's the franchisee of the 3 large wholesalers? I don't think the franchisee guys are not likely to bounce around a lot. The independents might be more likely to bounce. I guess, can you provide us a little more color into that market, especially the franchisees versus the non-franchisees?","George S. Barrett","Yes, George, it's a good question that requires, really, some segmentation. This is a very large pool of customers and what we've learned, and part of the reason I think we've gotten better at serving them, is to recognize it's not a one-size-fits-all. You have some independent pharmacy and pharmacy groups that really have tied in closely to your services. They see high value in them. We're a very, very close partner and stickiness is quite high. There are other parts of the market that are much, much transactional...","[Technical Difficulty]","Yes, guys, I think we reconnected, and for those of you who are still on the call, George Hill asked a question about the independents, and given the dynamics of the market, how do we see that playing out and a little bit about the stickiness. And my observation was that this is a market that actually has many subcomponents and part of the reason, I think, that we've done very well in recent years is to understand that, is to target the unique needs of different sub-segments of the independent market. So some of them work as groups of independents, with high service requirements. We're very targeted to addressing those needs, and then there are independents that tend to be -- move much more frequently. I would say we've experienced very good stickiness in our customer base of independents, and I think the better that we do of understanding the unique needs of each of those independents, the greater the stickiness is. I would also add that things like the acquisition of AssuraMed, that allows us to go to them with yet another service offering to say, \"Look, we can help you do fulfillment with your patients who need products in the home.\" That just enhances our value proposition with them. So again, we feel very good about the stickiness here. But again, I would argue that there are subsets inside that large group of independents and, hopefully, that answers it.","And hopefully, some of you are still on the call.  To the extent that you are, I thank all of you for being here and look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming conferences. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Sally Curley, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Sally Curley","Thank you, Kate, and welcome to Cardinal Health's first quarter fiscal 2013 earnings conference call. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to the SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of the presentation which can be found on the Investor page of our website for a description of risks and uncertainties.","In addition, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures is included at the end of the slides.","I would also like to remind you of a few upcoming investment conferences and events in which we will be webcasting. Notably, our Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 8:00 a.m. local time this Friday, November 2, at our company headquarters here in Dublin, Ohio and the Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference at 8:30 a.m. local time on November 14 at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix. The detail of these events are or will be posted in the IR section of our website at cardinalhealth.com, so please make sure to visit the site often for updated information. We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming events. Now I'd like to turn over the call to our Chairman and CEO, Mr. George Barrett.","George S. Barrett","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our first quarter call today. I know that those of you on the East Coast are going through an extraordinarily difficult time and hope that your families and your homes are safe. I'll touch on this again after I cover our performance for the quarter.","We're off to a solid start to our fiscal year 2013. Total revenue for the quarter was $25.9 billion, a decline of 3.4% from the prior year. As you know, we expected revenue to be down for the quarter and for the full year primarily due to the continued shift in dollars associated with the conversion of brand to generic drugs. Non-GAAP operating earnings increased by 6% to $469 million. Our non-GAAP EPS grew 11% to $0.81, up from last year's $0.73.","Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered strong profit growth of 10% on a revenue decline of 4%. This revenue decline resulting from the generic conversions masked the positive sales growth from net customer wins and higher volume in Specialty Solutions. The Pharma segment realized significant margin improvement due to the robust performance under our generic programs and a result of our continued focus on customer and product mix.","Medical segment revenues were up slightly versus the same period a year ago and profit declined by 6%. The profit contribution for medical was less than we expected for the period due to the impact of lower volume with existing customers, as well as the net negative year-on-year impact from our systems implementation we initiated in fiscal 2012. I'll come back to both of these subjects in a moment when I review the segments.","First, the Pharmaceutical segment. Our Pharmaceutical distribution business continued its momentum coming out of fiscal year 2012. From a customer and product mix standpoint, we're seeing continued progress. Our non-bulk sales were 63% of total sales in the quarter versus 57% last year, which is helping to drive an overall improvement in margin. Pharmaceutical distribution profit was also fueled by the continued strength of our generic activities. According to IMS data, total generic utilization now accounts for almost 81% of total prescriptions in the United States versus around 77% a year ago. Clearly, it is important for us to be best-in-class in generics and our progress here continues to be encouraging. Our strong generic results reflect robust sales to our customers and strong response to new item introductions during the quarter.","We continue to record solid performance and build strong relationships with our branded and biotech partners as we support their evolving business needs.","Moving to Nuclear, demand in our low-energy legacy business continues to be soft as the number of nuclear cardiac procedures remains considerably below historical norms. With this in mind, we continue to review our service model, and as a result, we've pursued cost reductions and other efficiencies. In addition, we've made capacity adjustments to align with current cardiac procedure demand. Having said this, our Positron Emission Tomography or PET business continues to be well positioned for the future. We believe PET holds excellent promise and we are investing appropriately. We recently opened 2 new PET cyclotrons in Sacramento and Portland, with an additional site in Chicago expected in the coming weeks.","As expected, our Specialty Solutions unit continued to deliver strong top line growth in the quarter, with revenue up over 70%. Profitability continued to be negatively affected by the loss sustained last year of some significant higher-margin consulting business. Specialty Solutions continues to build important partnerships and market share with health care professionals and payers. At the end of the quarter, we were serving nearly 650 oncology and urology practices, rapid growth as we enter our third year of the Specialty Solutions launch.","Last week, we announced the Vital path integrated dispensing solution, a web-based automated medication dispensing system, which makes it easier for community oncology practices to improve medication safety, inventory and revenue cycle management. We are committed to helping our customers manage their practices so that they can stay focused on patients.","In the payer space, we continue to increase our market presence through innovation, highlighted by the launch of our PathWare, clinical protocol and business transaction system.","Turning to our Medical segment, revenues were up slightly as the increase from last year's successful acquisition of the Canadian Futuremed business was partially offset by one fewer sales day and lower volumes from our existing U.S. customers. As others have reported, procedure volumes for both inpatient and outpatient procedures have been soft, somewhat more than we had anticipated for the quarter. From a profitability standpoint, the quarter proved to be more challenging than we originally modeled for medical. Clearly, the volume softness was a large factor, and although our preferred products did grow by 4%, lower procedure volume muted the growth of preferred products, which generate a higher margin for us. I'll come back to preferred products in just a moment.","Now a few words on our medical information systems implementation or MBT as we've been referring to it. As you know, last February, we went live with this very extensive transformation, the systems and processes by which we service our customers, manage our supply chain and generate information in our Medical segment. At this point, we had hoped to be through the transition and to be generating meaningful benefits, but with any undertaking as massive as this, the timeline has been difficult to predict with precision. I can report that the system is stable and we are achieving the key functionality we sought. I would also knowledge that the change management aspects of the transition have not progressed as rapidly as we had planned. Operational cleanup activity consumed a fair amount of our attention throughout much of the first quarter. This has resulted in some incremental costs and a deferral of benefit realization. Our organization is highly focused on realizing the benefits from this major initiative. We remain confident that a strong return will be realized for both our customers and for Cardinal Health. Now Jeff will provide a bit more detail in his commentary.","Staying with our Medical segment, our improved clinical capabilities, focus on product mix and strategic partnerships fuel our preferred products offering. Despite what has been a challenging procedural environment in the quarter, we look forward to accelerated momentum here. We believe that customers increasingly appreciate the high quality and the value we deliver through these products. In this regard, our new integrated orthopedic solutions offering, launched in the fourth quarter of FY '12, is generating customer enthusiasm. Our health system customers recognize that we offer the ability to save costs through a new business model in the trauma arena that delivers high quality, but lower-priced orthopedic products, along with a specialized distribution and information services platform. Early signs tell us that customers are excited to have a new product and service choices in the very large orthopedic products space.","North of the border, our Canadian business reported double-digit growth for both revenue and profit. The integration of Futuremed, our fiscal year 2012 acquisition, has gone smoothly and we are realizing accelerated synergies. Our business in China has also been going very well. Our revenues in China were up over 30% and we achieved strong profit growth. We will continue to execute our strategy of increasing market share by enlarging our geographic footprint through targeted acquisitions and creating new business partnerships, as well as building new growth platforms such as consumer health and direct to patient. It's been estimated that China's spending on health care could triple to $1 trillion annually by 2020, driven by an aging population and government efforts to broaden health care coverage. We believe that we can make a meaningful contribution in this market and participate in its extraordinary growth.","In summary, we're off to a solid start to the year and we're reaffirming our fiscal 2013 outlook for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.50. Finally, with regard to the just announced decision by our Board of Directors to increase the dividend by another 16%, this decision underscores our commitment to a differentiated dividend, adds to the 10.5% increase realized in July and brings our anticipated annualized payout ratio to over 30% of non-GAAP EPS. These actions reinforce Cardinal Health's commitment to returning capital to shareholders while driving the underlying growth in the business. We will continue to pursue a balanced approach to capital deployment with the goal of creating sustainable long-term growth.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff, just a few words about this extraordinary weather event and our Cardinal Health colleagues. I know that our teams have been preparing for days, but the storm hitting the East Coast is a frightening and dangerous one, one which is already taking its toll on many of them. This makes it all the more gratifying that so many are working under enormously trying circumstances to make sure that every hospital, every pharmacy, every clinic, every physician practice has the products and services it needs to take care of patients. To our people, our customers, suppliers and shareholders, be careful and be safe, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone. My thoughts and best wishes also go out to everyone affected by the storm. Today, I plan to cover the drivers of our Q1 performance and key financial trends, and then make a few comments on our full year outlook. I'll also discuss our recent capital deployment actions. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","With our first quarter 11% non-GAAP EPS growth, I believe we're off to a solid start to the year. Our Q1 EPS growth was driven by 6% non-GAAP operating earnings growth, favorable interest and other and a lower share count versus 2012. Gross margin dollars increased 7%, with a rate up 43 basis points. Distribution, selling and G&A expenses also rose 7%, driven by recent acquisitions which are worth about 2 percentage points of this growth, as well as an increase in IT costs, including our Medical Business Transformation, investments in certain key strategic priorities and $10 million of higher relative deferred compensation costs year-on-year, an amount that is offset in our other expense line.","Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 16 basis points to 1.81%. Interest and other expense came in $9 million favorable compared to last year, largely driven by the changes in the value of our deferred compensation plan that I just mentioned, as well as income related to an outstanding equity investment we hold. If you look at net interest expense only, that line was about $3 million higher in Q1 of FY '13 versus last year.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 37.8%, which is consistent with our prior year's quarter and slightly higher than our expectations. During Q1, we repurchased $200 million of shares, including the $100 million we mentioned in our August 2 call. This brings our diluted average shares outstanding to 344 million for the first quarter, which is 5 million favorable to the prior year's quarter. At the end of Q1, we had $650 million remaining under our existing board approval.","Now let me comment on consolidated cash flow and the balance sheet. Our Q1 operating cash flow was $568 million, which is above last year's amount. Looking forward, and as a reminder, we have previously called out 2 significant items that we expect to moderate cash flow this year, including the negative working capital impact of the nonrenewal of the Express Scripts contract and some large tax payments when we ultimately resolve past IRS audits.","Our working capital days ended the quarter higher than the prior year due mostly to the impact of lending receivables related to our Medical Business Transformation and continued growth in China. Brand-to-generic conversions impacted both our inventory and payable space, however they largely offset.","Now let's move to segment performance. I'll start with Pharma. As we anticipated, Pharma segment revenue decreased 4% to $23.5 billion for Q1 due to continued brand-to-generic conversion, which George mentioned in his remarks. This decrease was partially offset by sales to new customers and higher volume in Specialty Solutions. Of particular note, sales to non-bulk customers were up 7% for the period. Our generic programs continued to perform well, posting an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. Our stores generics drove much of this increase. Brand inflation was about as we expected in the high-single digits.","In Specialty Solutions, we continue to add new distribution customers, growing revenue over 70% versus the last year's quarter. Pharma segment profit increased by 10% to $400 million in the quarter, driven by the overall strong performance under our generic programs within Pharmaceutical distribution. In fact, we saw growth in both our base generic business, as well as a positive contribution from new item launches this quarter.","We continue to see inflation on a few generic products in Q1, which more than offset the deflation on the balance of our generics portfolio. Segment profit margin rate increased by 21 basis points compared to the prior year's Q1, a reflection of the strength of our generics programs and our focus on margin expansion, as well as the industry's brand-to-generic conversions. As many of you are aware, while this conversion is dilutive to revenue, it is accretive to our margin. We also benefited from continued mix shift as our non-bulk customer percentage of sales reached 63% in Q1.","But even with the in-customer categories, margin expansion was strong. In fact, margins were up across all customer class of trade within Pharmaceutical distribution. I was particularly pleased with Pharma's growth and margin expansion versus last year given the favorable $17 million impact included in last year's results for the resolution of certain manufacture-related disputes.","As George already said, Nuclear had a challenging quarter due to volume softness in the low energy or SPECT market. While we have seen softness in the space for a while, the continued downward trend was below our expectations. We are taking appropriate actions internally to adjust our structure and platform to reflect the new environment.","In Specialty Solutions, a downturn in our high-margin pharma services business, in which we disclosed the customer loss in Q3 of last year, continue to impact our year-over-year earnings comparison. All things considered, our Pharma segment performed very well again this quarter.","Now turning to Medical, Medical's off to a slower-than-expected start this year in terms of revenues which are up slightly at $2.4 billion. Let me walk you through the puts and takes. Last year's Futuremed acquisition in Canada contributed 2 percentage points to the segment revenue growth rate in the quarter. Preferred products, over 20% of our Medical segment revenue, continue to be an important driver of the Medical segment sales and profit growth and a key strategic area for us. These items were partially offset by the impact from one fewer sales day in the quarter and lower volume from existing customers. We believe this volume softness is driven at least in part by lower-than-expected procedure volume.","One final comment that relates to both revenue and earnings. Although we typically do not comment on specific contracts, given that the Department of Defense med-surg contract is already in the public domain, I will note the Department of Defense has reduced its order volume from what we were expecting, a decrease which we believe is related to troop reductions.","Profitability in the Medical segment declined 6% versus a year ago due to a few factors. The volume softness I referenced earlier had an impact on profitability as well. The impact of the Medical Business Transformation was a headwind for the quarter, worth a net of about $10 million year-on-year when you consider both the negatives and the positives this period. We incurred $7 million of depreciation, some incremental expenses to refine parts of the system and ensure customer service and have small amount of lost profitability due to orders that may have been temporary placed with backup vendors during the period. Some of the benefit realization we're planning for also got pushed out as we work to ensure customers were getting product on a reliable basis and that the system and process changes were clearly understood. I'm happy to report that the functionality of the system is stable and both internally and externally, we are learning to use the system to its full potential.","On the positive side of the ledger, as mentioned earlier, we did see continued earnings growth in preferred products and double-digit earnings growth in Canada. Commodities and foreign exchange were also of slight benefit during the quarter, in line with our expectations.","Finally, I will remind you that in the first quarter of FY '12, we did incur some incremental expense related to the FDA Presource matter, which are not in this year's results. All in all, although Medical did not get up to the start we hoped, we are focused on taking the right actions in a still sluggish environment and we remain uniquely positioned across product lines and channels. We continue to target the double-digit Medical segment profit growth guidance for fiscal 2013 that we provided on our August 2 call.","Now I'll provide some color on Cardinal Health China, which spans both segments. We once again posted strong double-digit revenue growth and now are beginning to approach an annual run rate well above $1.5 billion. Our local direct distribution business continues to outperform expectations, growing revenue at a rate of almost 90%. We're continuing to expand the product and service platforms, including agreements with medical device manufacturers and partnerships with more suppliers and consumer health to expand the offering in retail pharmacies. China continues to be a strong and exciting strategic growth area for us.","On Slide 6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter, which includes items that had a negative $0.02 per share net after-tax impact. Included in this net $0.02 per share was the exclusion of $0.05 of acquisition-related costs, primarily made up of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which was offset by $0.04 of litigation recoveries related to legal settlements. In the same quarter last year, GAAP results were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP results, primarily driven by acquisition-related costs.","Now let's talk briefly about guidance. As George mentioned, our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance range remains unchanged at $3.35 to $3.50. We still have 3 quarters ahead of us and lots of moving pieces as we consider the rest of the year. Within that overall context, I want to point out a few changes to our fiscal 2013 assumptions. Given the recent share repurchases I referenced earlier, we are revising our full year share count projection to approximately 345 million shares from the 347 million which we guided to in August. In addition, we're updating the previously provided guidance for amortization of acquisition-related intangibles to $86 million, to include a few recently closed acquisitions, although keep in mind that, that amount is excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.","For the Medical segment, our current visibility into commodity and foreign exchange impacts is such that we now expect these items to be a net benefit to our year-on-year medical results, although there are still high volatility in these [ph] input factors due to market price variability. We are also targeting meaningful benefits from our Medical Business Transformation over the next 3 quarters. But given our slower-than-planned start in Q1, our original goal of net accretion for the full year may be a stretch to attain. Everything else remains unchanged.","Finally, let's talk about capital deployment for a moment. Today, we announced a dividend increase of 16%. This decision was based on careful consideration of our balance sheet, capital deployment philosophy, shareholder feedback and desire to continue to augment total shareholder return. Our balanced capital deployment philosophy has remained largely consistent over the past 3 years. Today's announcements are a reflection of this philosophy and also recognize the need to evolve with the environment and our shareholders. For context, over the past 3 years, our strong earnings growth has outpaced our dividend growth. This 16% increase, when taken together with the 10.5% increase realized in July, brings our quarterly payout to $0.275 per share and reassess the anticipated dividend payout on an annualized level to more than 30% of our expected non-GAAP fiscal 2013 EPS. At the same time, we are reaffirming our goal to grow the dividend at least in line with our longer-term earnings trajectory from this new base.","We also repurchased $200 million of shares in Q1 of fiscal '13. We will continue to proactively evaluate our capital deployment opportunities to maximize shareholder value. Finally, I do want to point out that in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned or expect to return to shareholders more than 60% of our actual and forecasted operating cash flow. This followed fiscal 2011 a year in which we dedicated a fair amount of our capital deployment to selective strategic M&A. We believe this 3-year period really demonstrate our balanced and flexible approach, which is to return a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders while investing in sustainable business growth and maintaining the flexibility in certain areas to engage in selective acquisitions which fit with our strategic direction.","So let me wrap up. I'm pleased with our overall performance this quarter, although admittedly we didn't arrive at the results exactly as expected. We still have some work ahead of us in a few areas. And our relentless focus on being best-in-class from a cost and capital efficiency standpoint will not let up. In today's health care environment, it's imperative that we demonstrate each and every day that we are taking waste out of our structures in a process through which we work with our partners both upstream and downstream.","With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","George, can you maybe just expand on some of your utilization and volume comments in the prepared remarks? It's -- I think in the past, you guys have talked about volumes being relatively stable versus your expectations. It sounds like, at least on the Medical side, they were a bit lighter than you thought. What about on the Pharma side, how were volumes there?","George S. Barrett","Yes, why don't we start with the Pharma first. I think Pharma volumes were largely as we expected, very low-single digit increase, and Rx is up probably about as we expected. As a commentary, the Pharmaceutical part of the Health System is, in many ways, the most efficient. And so to the extent that there is sort of movement up and down in the system, I would expect the Pharmaceutical to be a little bit more predictable, and it has been. On the Medical side, it's probably been more choppy, and again, that's the word we've used before, and I probably say again, it tends to bounce up and down. If you look at, let's say, August surveys, outpatient visits were slightly up, inpatient surgeries were down a bit. And so when we look at the quarter -- overall, in the quarter, we saw inpatient surgeries being down. Outpatient were up -- were slightly up. So I would say relative to what we were expecting, office visits, for example, in September were down. So it's been really difficult to discern a pattern, but it was a bit lighter in the Medical side than we would have anticipated.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then a quick follow-up, particularly in light of the recent consolidation announcement on the ambulatory side, how do you feel about that part of your business? How is it doing? And is it still a strategic priority for you?","George S. Barrett","Yes it remains a strategic priority for us, largely, in that, we believe that the integration of the health system is going to require patients to be able to be followed throughout the continuum of care. So we now see a much -- a more highly attempt -- a greater attempt to coordinate care as patients move from acute care into ambulatory settings or surgery settings to physician's office. And you could argue the home as well. So strategically, it remains very important to us. It was a bit of a tough quarter for us on the ambulatory side primarily in that the MBT that, that transformation referred to, which required a lot of change management issues, was probably more challenging for small office practices than you might find for major acute care customers. We're asking people to make changes and they're probably less equipped. But we do expect that our renewed attention to generating business, rather than resolving administrative issues or invoicing issues, will get us back on track. So we continue to see this as a strategic area and we're doing some interesting work to grow that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So George, discuss the procedure volumes, one that caused the soft revenue in Medical or maybe softer-than-expected revenue in Medical? Your large acute care medical the 2 of you [ph] mentioned a lack of price inflation and they continue to talk about some pressure from the larger provider networks now on their ability to price. Are you seeing anything different on pricing? And I was wondering if maybe you could also comment on the progression of the consolidation that we're seeing at the provider -- on the provider level in Medical?","George S. Barrett","Yes, Robert, I would say that we were more surprised by some of the changes in utilization rather than in pricing. I think the pricing environment has been relatively consistent. It's competitive as we always expect. I think where we saw a bit more shift than we had modeled was just this balancing of volume and -- so that was a little bit less than we had modeled. But I would say, that was probably the more noteworthy issue for us during the period. As it relates to consolidation, I think we're going to continue to see a lot of movement in the medical space. As you know, there's sort of a large consolidation across different segments of health care. You're seeing it in the insurance world. We're seeing it in the health care provider world and certainly the Health System's world. So we'll expect to continue to see consolidation. For us, this is a familiar place. We're used to dealing with large integrated health systems. In many ways, it plays to our strength. And so not unexpected for us.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up, just trying to understand the Medical segment guidance a little bit better in light of this quarter's results. So you guys are still expecting the double-digit profit growth. Is that because you know that specific costs there are going to fall away that will help that margin in the profit as we move forward? Or is there some expectations there around volumes picking up again? Just trying to get a better sense of the confidence in your guidance from here.","George S. Barrett","I'm not sure we're projecting a dramatic change in utilization or volume, but I think in particular, some of the issues around our first quarter where we really had to devote a lot of energy on making sure that the administratively, we were well aligned with customers on the changes. In a way, it took our attention away from driving new business, promoting the new products, driving our ambulatory settings. So we spent, for us as a business, probably more of our energy making sure the system was completely stable and that customers were being served effectively. And so I think our ability to get back to business will be very important for us. We also expect, I think, the continued growth of our preferred products will contribute to that margin expansion.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","One other thing I've mentioned as we get towards second quarter and beyond, we do expect to get more benefit from the turnaround commodity prices. As I mentioned in Q1, that was a slight positive for the quarter. In fact, the commodity benefit was about $3 million benefit year-on-year. We do expect that benefit to pick up, at least in Q2 and Q3, which is the quarters that we're beginning to get some visibility in, although beyond that will still depend on how market prices fluctuate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with Leerink Swann.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","The operating margin in the distribution division came in better than what I was looking for. And according to what we've done, it looks like it was a very good generic launch quarter. Can you just give a sense as to, do you agree with that and how you expect margins to trend sort of for the remainder of the year? Do you expect to be able to sustain that type of growth or was it really just a real good generic launch quarter relative to the rest of the fiscal year?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Dave, this is Jeff. I would say it was a good generic launch quarter. We had a number of, what I would say, smaller launches than what we experienced last year, but they added up to a fairly healthy number. And in fact, as I said in my prepared remarks, the total benefit from new generic launches in the quarter this year was actually slightly above last year, which is good and a little bit better than our expectations. But probably the bigger contributor over the quarter was really just our overall performance in the base generics business. We continue to work on penetration. We continue to improve our sourcing. We continue to see the benefits of the expansions we've made into retail independent and other generic sales we've been making. And we benefit from a lack of deflation. In fact, there was actually net inflation for the quarter. So I think all of those things contributed to our strong generics performance. I'm a little bit loathe to provide segment-specific guidance going forward, although I think a common theme you'll see this year is the continued strength of our overall generics portfolio. As we said when we gave guidance for the year, we do expect our overall profitability from generics to be higher in fiscal '13 than it was in fiscal '12. And we're doing -- everyone in our Pharmaceutical segment is doing what they can to ensure that performance continues not only this year, but beyond.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Great. So it sounds like it's somewhat sustainable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had an overall question on the acquisition environment, George. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing out in the marketplace right now? I think everyone is applauding your increase in the dividend. But as we think about the acquisition strategy, whether China or the U.S., how should we think about deployment in those areas? And what are the key areas or products that you're really looking to deploy from an acquisition perspective?","George S. Barrett","Yes, I think we've said relatively consistently that our goal is a sustainable growth model. We're doing everything we can, of course, with our existing portfolio to make sure that, that's happening, but we also recognize that an evolving system, we need to be very aware of the opportunities that might enhance that position for us to compete on the long term. And so we continue to be looking and looking very actively at opportunities to drive value for our shareholders through the right strategic acquisitions. We've highlighted areas, I think, for us that are important. We've talked about everything that grows our business and improves our mix in the retail space. We've done some things there over the past years to improve that. We've talked about how important preferred products are to us and so opportunities to look at moves that enhance our preferred product position. We're an important service provider to health care systems and we've done some small, sort of tuck-in moves to enhance our ability to serve health systems across the continuum of care. And so we've looked at areas in and around specialty, which as you probably know, covers a lot of territory depending on who you're speaking to and what specialty means, but strategically to us, this continues to be an important area and so we continue to look in there. China, of course, strategically, we believe, is an enormously important platform for us. So those are just some of the areas that we continue to look at, and we do believe that every great company has to be replenishing its portfolio, both through internal moves and stretch moves, but also now and again from external moves, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so George, what do think is holding you back from making recent acquisitions? Is it price in the marketplace, I mean especially when you think about specialty, did the assets look very expensive? But is there something else? Is it not the right strategic fit? How should we think about what assets are available and what really fits into Cardinal Health?","George S. Barrett","Well, I hope you'll think of us as disciplined in the way we look at creating value for our shareholders. So we'll look at opportunities -- there are many businesses that may fall in a space that people regard as hot or exciting, but on deep examination, we might find that there's not enough value creation on a sustainable way for our shareholders. And so we look at virtually everything, but we'll take a disciplined approach to it. I think our perspective is, we want to make sure that if we acquire something, we add value to it. We're not just a financial instrument. We believe that we're a strategic health care provider and that -- service provider and that we'll want to make sure that whatever we acquire, that we bring something to the table. And so there are times where you find that, but the price may not be attractive for us and we'll just try to be very disciplined about our thinking here.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Lisa, this is Jeff. Let me expand a little bit further on the China situation, which is somewhat unique as you know. Since the original acquisition of Yong Yu almost 2 years ago now, we've actually signed 5 further, what I would describe as small-ish tuck-in acquisitions. Four of those have closed and the fifth is actually in the final approval processes and we expect to close later this year. All of these acquisitions, I would describe as relatively small. The total equity investment -- by the way, these are all majority portfolio and acquisitions as well, but the total equity investment totals under $100 million. Four of them are really part of our plans to expand geographically, to expand the number of major cities that we have physical infrastructure in. And I would say the fifth is in the category of rounding out our offering to the manufacturers, and specifically, it was buying a channel data management company that allows us to provide to the health care manufacturers much better insights into how their products are being distributed and utilized in the market. So those are the types of acquisitions that we continue to look at. We're being very selective. There's lots of assets in China but a relatively small number that we would actually consider buying, in part, because we want to make sure the cultural fit is right with our organization and they understand our focus on compliance and Western management, et cetera. But there are assets out there we continue to have good success in identifying them and we will continue to make these sort of acquisitions going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So as we think about -- just going back to sort of specialty and then the growth areas have obviously been off of a low base and that sort of contrasts against what we've seen in Nuclear. I mean, in terms of your differentiated businesses there, I mean, how do you feel about how that strategy is coming together? Where are you putting more of your attention? Is it on continuing to sort of find new areas for Specialty? Is it sort of fixing some of the pieces in Nuclear that aren't working? Just trying to get a sense for where we should be focused.","George S. Barrett","So I would -- Ross, I would sort of distinguish the Specialty from the Nuclear space at the moment on as it relates to the way we're approaching it. Specialty is really a business that, for us, is just 3 years old, and so it's about building the platform, about building new tools, some of those technology-based, and about really exploring different business models that allow sort of this connection of the pharma company, the payer and the provider to connect. And we're actually having some very encouraging results there. So we've signed a number of new contracts, both on the provider side and the payer side. Of course, at the same time, we're building our specialty distribution. This probably tends to be a lower margin part of that overall mix, but I would say in general, we're actually encouraged by the growth there. We're early enough in our evolution to continue to really experiment with new models and we're doing a fair bit of that. Obviously, as I mentioned to Lisa, to the extent that we find the right opportunities externally, that sort of supercharge, that we would certainly consider it. But we're making some really good progress there. Our Nuclear situation is a bit different. We have inside the Nuclear business 2 different dynamics at work. One is our traditional legacy business which is in the cardiac imaging, which we're extremely good at, very efficient, really strong position in the market, very much a company that cardiac imaging centers depend on, but procedures have been down. So our key is about optimization there, it's about making sure we've got the right alignment, the right number of pharmacies and that we're building efficiencies. We actually invested in some technology to increase efficiency there. The second part of Nuclear business is really in the diagnostic space for oncology and neurology, and that's where PET comes into play. And while that's early and certainly a smaller business, we remain pretty excited about the evolution of what's happening in the pharma side. Certainly cracking the code on Alzheimer's has been challenging for everyone, but I think the opportunities in diagnostics around oncology and around neurology create opportunity for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Jeff, maybe you want to touch on the guidance a little bit. I think last quarter, you had made some comments on the segment side. On the Pharma looking for op growth, I think, in the mid-single digits. Is that still correct? And then on the med-surg side, I think in your comments you said that you still expect a benefit from the MBT here in the back half of the year, but that -- for it to be accretive, there's a little bit of stress. Does that kind of imply that we should assume op profit -- total op profit is still down year-over-year? And does that also include the impact of the med device tax?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Charles, I'm not sure I understood the second part of your question. Let me try to answer the first one and maybe you can repeat the second. I may not have just heard you properly. We didn't give specific Pharma segment profitability guidance for FY '13. We did indicate that we expected revenue to be down given the brand-to-generic conversions and the impact of the Express Scripts nonrenewal. And we also indicated that we expected a positive year-on-year contribution from our generics programs. I would say those statements are still very much intact. In fact, I'd probably say, based on Q1, we're slightly ahead of where we thought we'd be, really driven by the strength of our generics programs. So I would say, generally, our view of the Pharma segment for the rest of the year remains intact, although we're feeling increasingly bullish about where generics are coming out. But clearly, there's still lots here to go, lots of generic launches to happen or not happen, so I don't want too ahead of ourselves on that one. And Charles, maybe you can repeat your second question, please.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, sure. On the Medical side, when we think about the puts and takes here with your expectations for the business transformation, how it ramps for the rest of the year versus some of the volumes, and I think the medical device tax starts ticking in next year, how should we think about overall operating profit growth or should we -- or decline relative to fiscal '12?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Now I get it. Thanks, Charles. So I would say our basic guidance for the Medical segment, which we gave in August really hasn't changed, in that, we still expect mid-single-ish digit revenue growth versus the prior year and are targeting double-digit segment profit growth versus the prior year. Those haven't changed. But some of the drivers of that have varied somewhat. For example, at that time, we did expect the Medical Business Transformation to be net slightly accretive net of the depreciation. I would say that goal now is probably a bit of a stretch and we may not be able to achieve that given the slow start we got to Q1. On the flip side, the commodity prices have moved in our favor over the past few months, particularly based -- related to latex and oil-based resins. So that will give us a bit of an offset to the shortfall on Medical Business Transformation and some pickup in the latter part of the year as I referenced earlier. Our assumptions regarding the medical device tax impact, which kicked in, in January, have remained about the same, we quantify that in the range of $13 million to $23 million. That's still the likely range, and we're working in Washington and elsewhere to try to get more clarification as to exactly how that will be applied. And our views on volumes, Q1 was a little bit lighter than we expected, particularly as it relates to procedural volumes. We would hope we would get a slight pickup from that in the last 3 quarters of the year but we're making sure that from a cost standpoint, we're ready for a range of outcomes in that regard. So those are basically the moving parts, but the basic guidance in terms of revenue and segment profit really hasn't changed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just trying to understand the breakdown of volume. If you look at your Pharmaceutical distribution, would you say that your same customer volumes were up in the first quarter -- or excuse me, in the September quarter?","George S. Barrett","Honestly, that is such a hard calculation to make because of the brand-to-generic conversions. I mean, if you're looking at sales dollars, they're down, right? Just because of the sheer dynamics of the transition from branded products to generics that we're seeing. I would say, overall -- and again, keep in mind that our large retail customers, when we go brand-to-generic, may purchase a portion of their generics directly from the manufacturer, so that would impact our unit volume as well. But I would say our view of the overall industry volumes, if that's your question, is, I would say, fairly consistent with what IMS is reporting, sort of in the 2-ish percent growth range. When you cut out all that noise, that's a lot of noise, but I think our fundamental view of units is pretty consistent with IMS.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","John, I'd probably add that given the distribution of our business, we probably are pretty good comparisons to the overall system.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Well, maybe asked another way, let's just take your non-bulk customers for a minute. If you were to look at your non-bulk customers, I mean, would you think your -- you mentioned that your revenues were up, so I assume your volumes were up and you're capturing more generics this year versus last year on the same customer non-bulk basis.","George S. Barrett","Yes, John, just to be careful, we rarely have a just bulk and non-bulk. Although, on the independent side, it is non-bulk, but in terms of our chain business, it is often a blend of bulk and non-bulk. So I just have to be just a little bit careful in using that as a barometer. I would say, our independent business -- actually all of our classes of trade, have gone reasonably well. Again, I don't know that -- and probably our generic penetration has been strong, but I don't know how best to characterize each account analysis that you're asking.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I mean, I would just summarize it, I think, generally, same-store sales when you adjust for brand-to-generic conversions and everything else, we're fairly robust with our non-bulk customers. And keep in mind that we had a significant customer win that came into effect April 1 of last year. So we're benefiting from that as well. And finally, keep in mind that our specialty volume also impacts our non-bulk rates. So all those factors helped drive that 7% increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of May Zhan with Morgan Stanley.","May Zhan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm in for Ricky Goldwasser for Morgan Stanley. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, especially given the recent McKesson acquisition and just kind of give a little bit more detail there?","George S. Barrett","Well, we really have a number of competitive environments. Obviously, you mentioned the McKesson acquisition, which is an acquisition that's primarily in the office-based medical surgical supply area. We have our Nuclear business, we've got Pharmaceutical Distribution, we've got acute care. So we really, in many ways, operate in a number of competitive environments and they have their own unique characteristics. I guess as a starting point, I don't know that I would describe any noteworthy change that I could offer you versus our last conversation 3 months ago on an earnings call. Each -- and I've said this before, in many of our businesses, each customer situation has its own unique competitive set. But if you ask me, could I describe an overall general trend or a trend break as it relates to our competitive environments, other than the acquisition you just mentioned which is noteworthy, it would be hard to characterize. Obviously, in the medical surgical office-based area, the McKesson acquisition is noteworthy. Obviously, we continue to evolve our strategy in the ambulatory space and sort of believe that we have a bit of a unique situation there in that our portfolio of products and services, our presence across channels, positions us somewhat uniquely to be able to serve large health systems across their continuum of care, including physicians' office. But I would not describe a major trend break today or a particular trend that I could discern.","May Zhan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just going to say, I'm just looking at what are some of the key generic launches we should focus on for the rest of the year?","George S. Barrett","We generally do not forecast or speak to specific launches in the future. There's a lot of moving parts, as you know, May, as it relates to generic launches, and much of the discussion between us and our vendor suppliers can be proprietary. So we continue to see a solid environment. As Jeff mentioned, there have been some noteworthy launches during this past few months, including Singulair and Actos, 2 of the launches. But going forward, we generally don't provide a lot of guidance on specific product launches.","Sally Curley","Operator, I think we've got time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Our final question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Largely covered a couple of quick technical ones. Bulk sales, can you give us the operating margin for the quarter?","George S. Barrett","Eric, we're trying to get out of the habit of providing the bulk and non-bulk rates on a quarterly basis for a few reasons. Number one, on a quarterly basis, they can fluctuate quite a bit, and it's not really representative of our longer-term trends. And secondly, it's not really the way we look at the business. That all said, I will say that both bulk and non-bulk rates were up in the quarter both versus last year, as well as versus the average of last year.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. I didn't know if you were kind of pulling back some of that data given the Express Scripts change, but I guess we'll live with that for now. It looks like you made a few acquisitions in the quarter. Can you maybe tell us specifically what they were?","George S. Barrett","Yes. The only one of any significant note was the Dik Drug acquisition that we had announced last quarter. It actually closed in Q1 and that's what really caused the increase in our guided intangible amortization for the year. As you recall, that was a regional distributor based in the Chicago area that serviced primarily retail independents. That acquisition, now that it's closed and is being integrated, going extraordinarily well, I think both from a customer standpoint as well as the employees that we've taken into the Cardinal Health family. So we're extremely happy the way that's progressed.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then the last one is a little more strategic. CMS early in the month released detailed data on pharmacy acquisition costs and pharmacy revenues by payer type, subsequently pulled the data, I think it was literally within a day. But any ripple impact from that increased transparency? I'm just curious what you're thinking, and if you guys have had to kind of revisit any of your thoughts in terms of pricing or if your customers are revisiting thoughts on pricing now that all of the data became available, albeit briefly.","George S. Barrett","Right, right. Eric, this is George. We sort of said in the past that the implementation of a reimbursement mechanism like AMP, as designed, was likely to be problematic. That is, in fact, what's happened. The amount of variability in the data coming out of this made it unnavigable. So as a result, I think, this is going to take time to play out. So actually it doesn't really change our views because the transparency did not provide meaningful utilizable data. And so, as we expected, this would take some time to sort out and that the mechanism used here is probably not, at this point, going to be valid. And so that's not suggesting some kind of change for us.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference.

We hope to see many of you at an upcoming event.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining our third quarter call. We had a very strong and balanced third quarter. So let me get right to the numbers.","First, revenue for the period was up 21% versus the prior year, to $31 billion. Second, we reported an increase of 20% versus the prior year in non-GAAP operating earnings of $788 million. And, third, we delivered an increase of 20% versus the prior year of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.43. And as we move into our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range to $5.17 to $5.27. The mid-point of this range would imply a growth rate of 12% for Q4 and a growth rate of 19% for the full year.","I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will go into the financials in a moment, but let me first provide you with more context on our business lines. Both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments had a strong third quarter, reporting double-digit revenue and profit growth versus the prior year. Starting with the results from our Pharmaceutical segment. First, revenue for the Pharmaceutical segment increased 22% to $27.5 billion and segment profit increased 16% to $660 million. Overall, we saw solid performance across the segment, with significant contributions from Pharmaceutical distribution and specialty.","Second, our Pharmaceutical Distribution business performed extremely well in the period. We continue to quickly respond to our customers' needs and strengthen our relationship through our value-added service offerings and, as a result, have out-paced the market in all classes of trade. Our team has moved decisively with the integration of Harvard Drug and we are on track to deliver our financial targets for this transaction.","As you know, generic pharmaceuticals play an important role in our pharmaceutical offering and will continue to play an important role in the overall healthcare system. I'd like to take a few moments to share my thoughts on the environment around generics in the U.S. With demographics driving demand and breakthrough science opening the door to new treatments and, in some cases, cures for our most dangerous, costly and complex diseases, generic drugs are a key component to our system's ability to contain costs through competition and provide the needed headspace to help fund pharmaceutical innovation. We do see some dynamics in the current generics environment which I'd like to highlight and which have some financial implications for the near term.","First, demand is up. We all know the pressure that aging Baby Boomers are putting on the healthcare system, and that pressure will continue to drive volume and growth for years to come. Second, the cycle of patent expirations is never a straight line. It has peaks and valleys with launch and lifecycle of in-market (4:10) brand drugs.","Right now we are in a period of relatively fewer generic launches. This has been true in recent quarters and we would expect this pattern to continue into our FY 2017, with the value from new launches being down from FY 2016. As you know, this can change based on patent cases and we will provide you with more clarity around our launch expectations for next year when we finish our FY 2016 and guide for FY 2017.","Third, the flow of new ANDA approvals coming out of the FDA has significantly increased. The average number of yearly ANDA approvals in the period between 2012 and 2015 was 155 per year. The number of ANDAs approved just in the six-month period between November of 2015 and March of 2016 was 279. The FDA is clearly working through its backlog. Combining this with the heightened election cycle discourse around the cost and value of pharmaceuticals, we might expect that across the portfolio in the aggregate we would see a relatively flat to slightly down generic manufacturer inflation rate in the near future.","Finally, this has been a year in which strategic moves among numerous players in the retail and non-retail sectors has shifted many long-standing generic affiliations. This has naturally caused some competitive realignment, which we would expect to settle out as the coming months unfold. Given all of these factors, we anticipate that the contribution from generics would be more muted in the near term. That is a challenge, but we are well-positioned, well-prepared and we'll be working closely with our customers and drawing on the capabilities of our sourcing through Red Oak.","Turning to our Specialty Solutions group. We continue our track record of delivering very strong double-digit growth. We serve and support our provider customers across a broad range of therapeutic areas and we're expanding our services to support biopharmaceutical companies. This positioning is extremely important as the flow of new innovative pharmaceuticals emerges from BioPharma pipelines.","Finally, on the Pharmaceutical segment, we are beginning to see an uptick in product volumes in our Nuclear business. We are delivering and driving efficiencies in the nuclear diagnostic space and, at the same time, are looking forward to participating in the manufacture and distribution of new therapeutic radiobiopharmaceuticals. Overall, a very solid quarter for the Pharmaceutical segment.","Turning to our Medical segment. Our Medical segment put up some strong numbers in the period. We continued to deliver the tools, services and technologies that thousands of care providers depend on every day. As a result, third quarter revenue was up 13% versus the prior year, to $3.1 billion and segment profit increased 26% to $128 million. As a reminder, this quarter included the negative impact of the Cordis-related fair value step-up, which Mike will cover.","Our year-over-year growth for the quarter was not only a result of strategic acquisitions, which did contribute nicely, but also the result of some very positive contribution from existing lines of business which continue to get stronger. We continue to see growth in the number of accounts we serve and in the range of product lines they purchase from us.","In the period, we saw growth in Cardinal Health consumables, services to hospitals and health systems, surgical kits, lab products and Cardinal Health at Home. Don and his team are driving strong performance and we're very excited to see this kind of growth. And importantly, our strategic positioning in the market has been thoughtfully crafted and is being effectively executed.","For example, we have identified the activities and process of discharge into the post-acute arena as an important area of dysfunction in the overall healthcare system. We have taken some important steps, including the acquisitions of naviHealth and Curaspan, which strengthen our ability to play an important role in helping our customers navigate this critical stage. These capabilities are particularly relevant as we see the emergence of more value-based payment models.","Finally on Medical, the integration of Cordis remains on track. Under the leadership of Cordis President, David Wilson, we have trained and merged our Cordis and AccessClosure U.S. commercial teams, we have finalized our worldwide leadership teams, appointing a new President in Japan and a new Operations Leader to our Cordis headquarters in Zug, Switzerland. We are bringing the best of Cordis and Cardinal Health together. And care providers, patients and investors will see real benefits.","We do have some important work in front of us, though. Of course, we want to make sure that what we call that the Day 2 (8:52) countries are closed and integrated. We've seen some encouraging growth in the EU and would like to see a similar pattern in our Asian markets. And we think there's significant opportunity to expand the Cordis product portfolio.","Let me close with an important point. At a time when powerful forces are reshaping the healthcare landscape, Cardinal Health is not just prepared to respond, but poised to lead. We've worked hard to create a balanced portfolio of products and services that deliver real solutions that address our customers' most pressing challenges. We deliver value across the lines of traditional customer groupings and markets and from a fully integrated Cardinal Health portfolio.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George. And thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. In my comments, I'll first provide some context around our third quarter performance, then I'll give some additional color on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Starting with consolidated company results, third quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.43, a 20% growth versus the prior year. This was due to solid performance in both the Pharmaceutical and Medical segments, which I'll discuss in detail later. Total company revenues grew 21% versus the prior year to $30.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin dollars grew 17%.","Consolidated company SG&A increased by 14% versus the prior year, almost entirely due to acquisitions. Our core SG&A continues to be an area of focus with a disciplined approach to ensure that we maintain a lean, efficient organization. Resulting non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $788 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year.","Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $44 million. Again, this quarter, the increase versus the prior year is due to the interest expense related to long-term debt issued in June of 2015 to fund the acquisitions of Cordis and The Harvard Drug Group. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 36.6%, flat to the rate in the prior-year quarter.","Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 331 million, 3 million shares lower than the third quarter in the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased $300 million worth of shares and, as of the end of the quarter, had slightly under $400 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.","Cash flow from operations was nearly $920 million. And at the end of the third quarter, we had $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Our strong cash flow is the result of our robust earnings growth as well as our efficient management of working capital by our teams. As always, we remain committed to a balanced approach to capital deployment.","Moving on to segment performance. Let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment. Revenues grew 22% to $27.5 billion due to continued growth from new and existing customers as well as the contributions from the recent acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical. Segment profit was $660 million, an increase of 16% versus the prior year.","There were two primary drivers of our profit growth in the quarter. The first is the acquisitions of Harvard Drug and Metro Medical, which are integrating well and meeting our financial targets. The second is the continued growth in Pharmaceutical distribution of new and existing customers, which includes our generics program. Also, while not the primary drivers in the quarter, both Specialty and Nuclear were contributors, with Specialty continuing its double-digit growth and is on track to deliver at least $8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2016.","Pharma segment profit margin rate for the quarter was down 11 basis points versus the prior year. This is a mix dynamic due to the new relationship with a large mail order customer which began in our second quarter. As a reminder, while the new contract has a dilutive effect to margin rates, it is positive from an earnings and capital standpoint.","In our Medical segment, we saw the same sort of uplift across the breadth of our businesses. Revenues grew 13% to $3.1 billion, driven by contribution from acquisitions net of divestitures as well as growth from all of our existing businesses. Medical segment profit grew 26% to $128 million. This was driven by the net contributions from acquisitions as well as Cardinal Health brand products. As you may recall, this quarter, like Q2, includes the Cordis inventory fair value step-up, which was $21 million in each quarter.","Let me give you a little more color on Cordis. First, the onboarding of Cordis continues to progress well. We have filled the key roles with excellent talent and are focused on execution. As I mentioned last quarter, the expected favorability of the lower inventory step-up was a wash with the foreign exchange impact that was greater than we had originally modeled. As we work through the transaction, there are a few mechanics, such as the timing of exiting our transition service agreements with J&J, the closing of Day 2 (15:06) countries and the ramping up and down of certain expenses that could result in variability between quarters.","As you can imagine, all of these moving parts can lead to Cordis results that may not be linear for a few more quarters. Specifically, some of these cause margin rates to be somewhat elevated in the third quarter versus how they may look over the next few quarters. If anything significant occurs, we will let you know. But, again, overall Cordis is performing well.","Organic growth of our Cardinal Health brand products was the primary driver of a 42 basis points increase in the Q3 Medical segment profit rates to just over 4%. Our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio includes private-label consumables and physician preference items. These lines of business are important value drivers for our customers and are key to margin expansion.","Of particular note, this offering is resonating with our customers. In the quarter, Cardinal Health brand products growth was in the low-double digits within our strategic accounts. Additionally, the value of the breadth of our offering is also gaining traction, as our strategic accounts once again grew well above the market this quarter.","Before I move to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, let me touch briefly on China, which reports in both segments. In spite of well documented macroeconomic conditions, our businesses in China continue to perform well, with strong double-digit top and bottom-line growth for the quarter.","Turning to slide number six, you'll see our consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the quarter. The $0.26 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related cost.","Now I'll update you on our thoughts for the remainder of fiscal 2016. Based on our current assumptions, we've tightened our non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $5.17 to $5.27 or growth of 18% to 20% versus the prior year. This range implies fourth quarter guidance of $1.07 to $1.17 non-GAAP earnings per share, a 12% growth at the midpoint.","Looking sequentially to Q4, four things essentially explain the variance from Q3. First, we typically see higher brand inflation activity in the third quarter which comes down in the fourth quarter. We expect this fiscal year will be consistent with this historical trend. Second, as a result of the acquisition of Safeway by Albertsons, we stopped servicing them as of April 1 which has an impact on our fourth quarter comparison. The final two are a higher tax rate and a handful of smaller corporate items.","For our full-year fiscal year guidance, recall that in the prior quarter I mentioned that foreign exchange and a generic pricing environment could impact us in reaching the very high end of our prior range. Neither turned in our favor. Foreign exchange hasn't moved much from our prior expectations. And as for generic drug pricing, we expect the environment to be similar to what we experienced towards the end of Q3, which was slightly deflationary.","Moving on to slide nine of the presentation, I'll walk through the updated corporate assumptions that reflect what we expect as we close out fiscal 2016. First, we expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.5% to 36.5%. Next, we expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be between 330 million and 331 million shares. In addition, we've lowered our expected range for net interest and other expense to $185 million to $200 million. Also, we expect that our full-year CapEx spend will be in the range of $450 million to $480 million. And finally, our updated assumption on acquisition-related intangible amortization will be about $348 million or $0.68 per share.","Now I want to take the opportunity to share a few preliminary thoughts on what we believe will be some of the key drivers in FY 2017. We still have work to do on sizing each of these. So my thoughts will be more qualitative than quantitative. Starting with the Medical segment, we expect strong growth to be led by our Cardinal Health brand products, which will include Cordis. As a reminder, FY 2017 will not have the negative impact from the inventory step-up. Also, we expect growth in our post-acute initiatives, which includes our Cardinal Health at Home business. As in past years, we would still expect repricing our national brand to be a headwind.","Moving to the Pharma segment. As we mentioned, the Safeway contract has expired and will be a factor until we anniversary it in the Q3 of next year. Under our generics program, we expect continued strong performance from Red Oak. As it relates to new item launches, due to the timing of our fiscal year and the shifting of a few product launches, we expect the contribution in FY 2017 to be less than FY 2016. Also, we are currently expecting generic inflation to be less in FY 2017.","As I mentioned in our Q4 FY 2015 call, we initiated a multi-year program to refresh our information systems in our Pharmaceutical segment. This investment is being made to support our significant customer growth and acquisitions. Per our plans, FY 2017 expenses related to this program will be more than what we incur in FY 2016. We have outstanding talent and metrics in place to ensure success.","Lastly, we expect to continue with our current momentum in the Specialty business. As we complete our budgeting process this summer, we will finalize our FY 2017 outlook and will provide additional clarity on our Q4 fiscal 2016 call in August. Let me close by expressing my appreciation to our people who delivered a record quarter in Q3, who continue to do things necessary to position us on the right side of healthcare trends and who I know will work tirelessly and with discipline to achieve our goals and, of course, serve our customers and their patients.","Operator, let's go to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We've got Robert Jones or Bob Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. George and Mike, I appreciate all the details you guys shared around generics and then some of the changes from 3Q to 4Q, but I guess I'm still trying to parse out what was incremental relative to what you had line-of-sight into previously.","If I just look at the implied 4Q guidance you guys highlighted, having a hard time based off the trends in both segments seeing how growth will slow as much as you're implying. So I guess really just if you could go back to some of the buckets you highlighted, what moved against you from where you were thinking about the year previously to how you're thinking about the fourth quarter now?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks for the questions, Bob. I appreciate it. I guess I'll just go back a little bit to emphasize what I talked about and see if that's helpful. So I'm not sure things changed a lot in the sense if you think about what typically often happens between Q3 and Q4 as it relates to the branded inflation piece. That is what we're seeing sequentially. Both in Pharma and in Med, we see a stronger Q3 from price increase activity on branded products. So we're planning to see that again in our Q4. So that's number one.","Second of all, the Safeway contract expired and we quit servicing the business on April 1. So we have a full quarter of the impact of Safeway. Those are the two biggest drivers sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And then we are expecting a higher tax rate in Q4, which will have impact sequentially on it and then also there's just some corporate items, several smaller corporate items, that we expect to happen in our fourth quarter and so that maybe helps a little bit for a chunk of it.","And then the other piece, if you think back to our last quarter, what we were trying to help everybody understand is to get to that top end of our range, we really needed to see FX rebound and generic inflation change, and neither one did. We didn't see really much change at all in FX and so we're not seeing any pick-up from that in the fourth quarter. And in generic inflation, in the fourth quarter we're expecting it to be more like what we saw in the last part of Q3, which, as you know as we mentioned before, was declining in the back part of Q3.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So just to be clear then, Mike, the generic pricing didn't change from what you had thought, it just didn't come back in your favor. Is that a fair characterization?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I would say it didn't change from the second half of Q3, but what we're expecting is the whole Q4 to be more like the end of Q3. So, yeah, I wouldn't say it really changed from what we were trying to help you through, to get to that top end of the range, we needed it to be go back the other way. But it did change from Q2. And then, as I said, we're expecting it to be more similar to the second half of Q3 than it was for the whole Q3.","Operator","We'll go next to George Hill of Deutsche Bank.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Mike and George. And thanks for taking the questions.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess, George, could you provide a little more color on this industry realignment that you mentioned? I don't know if you can get any more granular on what you're seeing and the impact it's having on the business.","And then as it relates to the changes in generic drug price inflation versus deflation, as we look into 2017, is the expectation that inflation will be less than it was in 2016, or are we back to a more normalized modestly deflationary environment?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, George, good morning. Let me start with the second part in a sense, because as I described in the call, there are really sort of a number of factors at work here, including the launch cycle, the rate of approvals, which creates more products in the system, reimbursement dynamics which our customers feel. So this is all part of the dynamic that affect the overall pricing environment. So that's what I was trying to capture, which is that this is really not a single factor, but we're seeing a number of factors that actually come together.","As it relates to realignment, I was really referring to some of the big moves that have occurred over the course of the year. You have CVS buying Target and Omnicare, you've got the move with Albertsons and Safeway, you've got Walgreens and Rite Aid. And so I think those kinds of big moves have a tendency to create a little bit of short-term disturbance and then they just settle out. And I just wanted to highlight that.","But I think what we're describing here is more, again, as Mike said, it is quite different than it was at the early part of the year, of our fiscal 2016. And that's what we're describing. So what we've tried to do with you, George, is to always be transparent about the environment that we're seeing. And this is as clear as we can be about the way we see the environment today.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","And to answer your question, George, about 2017. Mike, do you want to...","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yes. On 2017, George, we are expecting generic inflation to be less in 2017 versus 2016. But, again, it's early and that can change. There's so many factors, as you know, George. I think described several of those that can impact it, but we're looking at it more as what we're seeing in the second part of Q3 and what we're assuming for Q4. If that stays consistent, we would expect 2017 to have less generic inflation than FY 2016.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, Mike, maybe just a real quick follow-up. Can you give us any sense for what OP margins in the core drug business were like in the quarter ex-Optum, ex the acquisitions? And I'm trying to get sense, would we have seen the changes in the deflationary environment in the quarter ex the bigger moving pieces? And the margin deterioration rate that we're seeing in Q4, is that how we should be thinking about the business in what I'll call the near to medium-term?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Gosh, a lot of moving parts on that. I can tell you again, the biggest driver is really the mix dynamic with the addition of the large customer. You also have to remember in Q3, it's our biggest branded inflation quarter, so that obviously has some impact on the quarter. And then you have the acquisitions rolling in and synergies. There's just so many moving parts, it would be hard for me to break those apart, but I think hopefully that's at least enough color to give you a little bit of help.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. It's Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross this morning. I have a question in terms of \u2013 you obviously had some pretty impressive cash flow generation in the quarter. Have you guys changed any of your thoughts regarding capital allocation and, as a follow-up, how you're seeing valuations in the market generally?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I can take it and George can add a little, too. Right now, there would be no change in our capital deployment policy. We're still going to be focused on investing in the business, first, through our capital expenditures and then we're going to stay focused on our differentiated dividend.","And as we've said before, we're going to continue to balance between M&A and stock buybacks. We did do some stock buyback this quarter. As I mentioned, we did $300 million worth of it in this quarter. So we do look at that all the time to see what's the right use our cash and we will continue to do that going forward.","As far as the environment from M&A, I can see George wants to make a couple comments.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just generally, I think our team did a really good job of managing working capital. And so we're very conscious of \u2013 certainly we don't want it to sit still. If we're accumulating cash we will be very, very smart and balanced I think about how we deploy that.","As it relates to valuations out there, the primary driver for us, as you know, when we look at anything related to an acquisition is the strategic fit and how relevant that is to the changes in front of us in healthcare and whether Cardinal can be an advantaged owner of any given asset. And so we think a lot about those execution things.","Obviously, valuation when it's coming back to a better place, certainly makes those transactions can make them more attractive. But at the driver is always going to be that strategy piece and how we, as Cardinal, can create value from it.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","That makes a lot of sense. And then just as a follow-up, I was just wondering in terms of you mentioned that obviously Red Oak was a contributor in the quarter. Have you seen any change in outlook in terms of how it's been helping you guys or any change in the way you're working with that structure?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I was just at the board meeting in the last week and continue to be incredibly excited about the talent at Red Oak. It's just a fantastic team. Our relationship with CVS continues to be both strategic and positive to work together on opportunities with Red Oak, not only today but going forward.","Clearly, we'll be lapping some of the initial opportunities that we saw in Red Oak. When you go from nothing to starting up and executing as quickly as we did, we had some large incremental upticks over the first couple of quarters. And that would be coming down a little bit. But as far as it continuing to be a benefit for us, we continue to see Red Oak to be a positive driver for us going forward in the future and we continue to be excited about it.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","I'd just add we continue to talk to a lot of our manufacturer partners and I think they really appreciate the simplicity of the way that we created that model and they know what to expect and how to work with us. And so the team there and Mike and the board at Red Oak have done a great job.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Perfect. Thank you so much.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. I have a couple of questions here. The first one, George, if we step back, right, and we think about the generic pipelines, the generic inflation environment and the industry dynamics, how should we think about the long-term growth for the distribution segment in a normalized environment? So beyond fiscal year 2017 in the nuance of contract gains and losses, but just when we think about the core industry drivers.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, good morning, Ricky. At this point, obviously we're not going to be guiding long-term forecast for our business unit. But let me just give some color to the Pharmaceutical Distribution business. We are incredibly well positioned. I'm not sure that I've ever felt that we're better positioned, certainly through my tenure here, in terms of the way that we're creating value for customers, the strength of those relationships, the opportunities in front of us to continue to use the value creation that has occurred through I think the strength and capability of Red Oak on generics. Demographics are certainly a positive for us. So I think our long-term view is quite positive.","We are going always have these dips related to activities in the market or pricing dynamics or launches. But fundamentally, I think this business is really robust, we're extremely well-positioned and we feel very optimistic over the long-term of about its growth prospects. And I think you've seen over this last couple of years that our positioning has improved quite substantially.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, obviously, we heard that you won the Kaiser contract on the Med Device segment. So congrats on that. Can you maybe share with us what you think differentiated your offering versus the incumbent, what's included in that contract, if any of the new businesses that you've acquired are in it? And also, there's still a decision pending on the drug purchasing contract. How do you think about this opportunity? And are there any read-throughs between the two, or are these completely separate decisions?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. Thanks for the question, Ricky. Yeah, look, we did confirm that we were awarded the Med-Surg supply for Kaiser. We do expect that probably to transition over the coming quarters. I do think it was really about the broad capabilities of Cardinal to create value in a market going through a change.","I think, again, it's not fair for me to speak for Kaiser, but I think the general dialogue was really about the future, about the evolution of their business, how they're going to have to serve a customer base that continues to be treated in different care settings and our ability to take care of that as well as the services and technologies that we may be able to bring to them that improve efficiencies in their operations.","So I think increasingly that discussion is occurring with our largest customers. They understand that complexity is increasing and that those partners that can help them navigate that are probably more attractive as they go forward. And I think that was a differentiator for us. Again, being careful not to speak for them.","There are other lines of business, obviously, that we serve to the market and Kaiser is looking at those. I could not comment on the status of any of those. It's not appropriate. I will say that we're well positioned with Kaiser or anyone else on other lines of business, whether or not that's a surgical kitting or service to the home or pharmaceutical distribution. So as I said earlier, I think I really like our positioning, but I don't think I can comment specifically on Kaiser and those lines of business and how that's going to unfold.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Willoughby of Credit Suisse.","Unknown Speaker","Penny Willoughby (37:05) in for Bob. It doesn't look like Cordis has any impact on your working capital balances. Should we be expecting any shifts in future quarters, for better or worse?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I think that is Bob's daughter, Penny (37:19). It is Bring Your Child to Work Day. We have hundreds of kids buzzing around the halls here. So good morning.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, do you want to take this?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, absolutely. I'm sure that Bob has a smile on his face like we do here when we walk in in the morning being able to do that. Penny (37:36), I would say that right now I don't that the Cordis acquisition will have a huge capital change in either our capital deployment policy or in our cash flows or anything going forward.","I still feel really good that with all the other moving pieces we have in our businesses, we're always focused on managing our capital as tightly as possible, making the right investments at the right time, whether it be with our supplier partners, our customers or in M&A or stock repo. So I don't think it's going to have any material change going forward.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Penny (38:12), for the questions.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you for the questions.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Percher of Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I'm still trying to wrap my head around sequential trend. And if I understand you right, it sounds like on the Pharmaceutical side, you're seeing normal seasonality and then Safeway, so it sounds like we could use Q4 as a proxy moving forward. So I ask that first.","And then the second half would be in Medical at the segment level, obviously a very strong quarter. You won't have the $21 million headwind next quarter. But you mentioned that there's going to be some timing issues over the next couple of quarters. So I guess, first, can I confirm that around the Pharma side and then your thoughts on Medical?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so from Pharma, yeah, the first two big items I talked about were more majority Pharma. But, again, part of the branded inflation, when I talked about part of that also in Medical. Medical also sees a slightly better Q3 than Q4 from a price increase activity. But clearly you're absolutely right, the largest piece of that branded inflation component happens in Pharma Distribution. And sequentially Q4 is always a much smaller quarter than Q3. And then the Safeway piece is the other piece. So, yes, on Pharma, that would be it.","As far as Medical goes, yeah, that's what I was trying to get a little color. As we're bringing on Cordis, again, some of the things I mentioned. And we've got several different types of transition service agreements that we have in place with J&J, each with different timing of when we roll off of those and how we can work through those. We have different Day 2 (40:00) countries coming in on different timing and then we have certain expenses where we're ramping up on new head count and then also getting after the synergies and taking expenses out in other areas.","So all of those things create some variability between quarters. And so, again, those Cordis results may not quite be as linear as you would expect them to be for a few more quarters until things normalize for us.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Are there dollars flowing out today for the transition services that will dissipate and then at the same time you may have higher upfront costs to stand up, the same (40:32)?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, I think that's a really good way to look at it because we're incurring costs to stand those up, then they transition out. And then net-net, we expect all of that to be a positive force. As we mentioned, in FY 2018, as we exit FY 2018, we expect to be at $100 million of synergies on Cordis. So we're still expecting that as we exit FY 2018.","But there'll be a lot of noise as we're standing up, at the same time we're still on and then we roll-off those transition services agreements into what we think are going to be better cost situations for us. But, again, I think it's really important to know that the underlying Cordis business is doing really well, done an excellent job of staffing up, both from management and the sales teams.","Operator","We'll go next to Lisa Gill of JPMorgan.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. So, Mike, when you talked about 2017, and I know that, at this point, it's qualitative. But you are highlighting Medical versus drug. And if you look at the results in this quarter, and I know the previous question asked about next quarter and how do we think about it going forward, but can we talk about some of the underlying drivers in more specifics to this quarter and how to think about them going forward?","And my first question would be around private label, the Cardinal products. Can you give us any indication as to what percentage of the sales that was? Does your new contract, for example, include private label for companies like Kaiser? And how do we think about the growth component of that as we start to think about 2017 and beyond?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I can't specifically get into what the product mix will be with Kaiser. But as you can imagine, with any customer we have, we're constantly looking to be able to shift them to our products, both to save them money and improve our margins and work together positively. So that's the goal with every single customer we have.","As far as some of the other private label products and the percentage, I will tell you that it is going up significantly. But we plan to give a more detailed update at our Dublin Day in June, when Don is going to spend some time walking through how all of those mechanics are working and how things are going. But suffice it to say we're seeing some nice improvement, both as a percentage of revenue as well as a percentage of margins on our products. So that's a real positive.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me add to that, Lisa, just to give some color. In the last two years, we've probably added 2,000 SKUs to that line. So this has been a very focused effort to expand that line, which we think really creates value for our customers and for us.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And, George, I think historically at your last Analyst Day, you talked about a goal of 5.75% as a margin for the Medical segment. Do you feel that you can get there with the assets that you have today and private label? Or do you think you need to make incremental acquisitions to add to the offering to ultimately get to that goal?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead, Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I don't think anything has changed from the last meeting that when we talked about this before, again, it's an aspiration, which means it's something that is not simple, it's not a lay-up to get to.","But when we really take a look at what we have on tap, both internally with our organic growth with Cordis, with our growth in our distribution services business, with our new post-acute business acquisitions, At Home growing faster than we expected, et cetera, we expect to see very good performance against that goal organically. But we also have said we would expect to get there we would need to do some more M&A.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Francis of RBC Capital Markets.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning. Again, a couple of different items that you've already covered, but quickly on the generic pricing front. George and Mike, are you guys in a position, given your look at the broad portfolio of products, to see on the uptick of ANDA approvals at FDA, if there is a targeting effort going on by FDA to look at some of the lower competition, higher-priced pockets of the market to potentially create additional competition and, therefore, lower pricing in the market? Or is this something that you guys just don't have a good window into right now trying to figure out directionally where the market's going?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Dave, that's a great question. I wish I knew the answer to it. I'll give you some historical perspective, but I cannot tell you about the inner workings and how they're seeing this. Historically, the FDA has been very conscious of getting first drug to market and always took priority to make sure that they could do that to encourage competition. Whether or not they're targeting specific drugs is really hard to say. I don't think we would have line of sight on that.","You know that they've expressed publicly and to Congress that they're really working hard to dig out of the backlog. What is probably worth also nothing is the inflow into to them continues to be very high, but the outflow has increased but the incoming number of applications continues to be really robust. But I don't think we have enough line of sight or insights into their thinking to know that they're targeting particular drugs.","Dave Francis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. A quick follow-up, shifting back to the Kaiser win. As you look more broadly at the marketplace, you've seen other leading health systems out there identifying the physician preference item issue from a cost perspective. Where would you say the market is relative to recognizing some of the overall trends that you guys are trying to get after relative to the changing reimbursement environment and how that might play out for you over the intermediate to long-term? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is essentially part of the work we do in our segmentation. There are certainly systems who are very much on top of some these trends and pushing very hard to improve efficiency through standardization. And there are others that are just at a different stage. So it really varies across the country and across the systems.","And I would also say, different programs have different sales cycles. So for example, on the consumables side, you're probably going to have a faster sales cycle than you will, for example than on the physician preference side and where you want it, it requires a little bit more buy-in in the system. So I think you'd have to look at those a little bit differently from the commodity-type consumables to products that are more used in the traditional physician preference area. So, again, it varies a little bit by product type and it certainly varies a lot by system.","Overall directionally, as we've seen more bundled payment models, more payment for performance, shifting financing models I would say this trend is well understood and most institutions are trying to push in that direction. That's probably good news for us.","Sally J. Curley - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator?","Operator","We'll go next to Garen Sarafian of Citi.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, George and Mike. So I just wanted to go back to your generics commentary. So for a bit of clarification, but more a clarification at this point. You mentioned flat to slightly deflationary environment. But previously you've stated you're protected to the down side. So you'd be protected to the extent it becomes deflationary, is that the right way to think about it?","And maybe related to the generics again. If there's any way you could help us think through qualitatively the size of the generic contribution step-down in fiscal 2017 in either moderating inflation or in new introductions, that would be helpful.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, let me take a couple of comments and if I miss something, please feel free in the follow-up. But I think first of all, yes, when it comes to inventory, we are price protected on inventory. And so I don't have any concerns that as we see deflation on any generic inventory or any item that we have any generic inventory risk. So let's just take that one off the table first. That one's not a concern.","As far as we what think the rate of deflation will be, obviously, that's a tough one. But there is a lot of market commentary out there around it. And from what we're hearing if you listen to some of the various manufacturers and the discussions, what we're assuming is probably similar to what they're seeing is that we think that our expectations for next year are probably going to be very similar to what those are that you're hearing from the manufacturing partners.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would just add that, again, as Mike said, you're talking a little about the purchasing and the inventory. But there's also the market side, which is reimbursement pressures. And we have to live in that environment and so we're very sensitive to that. And that's a part of the dynamic as well.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, and also when we're in a net deflation environment, that doesn't mean there's no inflation. That just means that the net deflating items will be more than the net inflating items and that's how you get to a net deflationary. So don't interpret our comments to say we expect no generic inflation over the next year. I always believe there's going to be some. It's just going to be net down.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe touching on Red Oak. It's clear you've been very pleased with the results of your JV so far. But what's the bar you're trying to set in upcoming quarters and years to the extent you can share? So maybe taking a step back, now that you've established your joint venture as a successful purchasing entity in the past two years or so, what will Red Oak need to do in two years, three years from now in addition to what they're doing now for you to consider them to be a success?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a great question. I think some of the basic things you would have to do at any business. You've got to be able to add and develop talent and make sure that it's sustainable. And that's something that I have no concerns that we won't be able to do, but that is something that any business has got to do.","I think you've got to continue to increase your data and analytics capabilities so you can understand and be more proactive on various opportunities to either lower cost or find new folks in the system that can help you get after increasing competition where you may need it on certain items, understanding what's going on in the API environment and working backwards.","I think those are always important. Understanding really well what's going on with the various legal cases, all those types of things are really important as you work forward. And then obviously scale is important, too. And I believe that's another great piece about Red Oak is when you look at both Cardinal's success recently and over its history as well as CVS' progress, then you're going to see scale continuing to increase, which I think will always be beneficial to Red Oak.","Operator","We'll go next to Greg Bolan of Avondale Partners.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question. So just from a capital deployment standpoint, I know you guys obviously used $300 million of the $700 million this quarter. Just thinking about and in a sense going back to Bob's question earlier, moving from 2Q to 3Q obviously, a few levers were pulled, buyback being one of them. I guess as we think about moving into the fourth quarter, is there an opportunity to become more aggressive with the buyback authorization, or at this point feel pretty good with that $400 million, that should last at least through to the end of this year and obviously re-address what's authorized as you think about fiscal 2017?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question, Greg. As you can imagine, with a company with our scale and breadth, there's a lot of things going on from an M&A standpoint that we're constantly looking at as well as looking at whether stock repurchases is the right opportunity. So as far as the numbers go, you're right, we do have just a little less than $400 million left on our stock repurchase program.","So if we do see some opportunity in the fourth quarter, if we do believe that is the right place to put capital, we do have some ability to do that without any further board authorization. But to be able to say whether we'll do that or whether we'll do an M&A, it's really hard for me to do at this time and something that I can just tell you we constantly evaluate where's the best place to deploy our cash.","Greg Bolan - Avondale Partners LLC","That's great. And then just one quick question going back to an earlier question on Medical segment operating profit. Organically it absolutely you can see that the incremental profit margin is accelerating in that business. Clearly that seems to be, George, going back your comments around the large number of SKUs that have been introduced on the branded side. I guess if you think about the mix in Medical segment revenues and profit, is it safe to say that the operating profit contribution from the branded products is around double that of the contribution to revenues?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Greg, let me try that. I don't think we can break that out for you. I'll probably answer more generally and I hope the color will be useful. We always see, and I mentioned this on prior calls, that on the branded side of Med Surg distribution, those have over a long period of time have been declining.","What has been happening, and this is sort of what we've been describing to you guys, is that the range of services that we provide that are high value, the number of products that we're providing in our private label, the mix of our business, the work that Don and his team have done, is beginning to bear fruit. And so what we're seeing is what I would describe is our organic \u2013 what you'd call organic, it's so hard for me to actually parse that out these days, but some of our historical lines are doing very well. They're competing well in the market. We're expanding the products and services. And I think that's beginning to bear fruit. So I can't break out the components for you or predict it, but what I can say is that directionally is a very positive thing.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, the old numbers, just so you remember, was that our Cardinal Health preferred products and consumable products in total as a percentage of Med segment profit, as revenue it would be in the low-20s of Med revenues and in the higher-30s for Med segment gross margins.","And that is something that we plan to update ay our June Dublin Day when Don gets into a little more detail about the Med segment and as he gets a chance to evaluate what's going on with the Cordis acquisition. But it's safe to say it will be much higher when you see it.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from David Larsen of Leerink Partners.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. George, you mentioned in your prepared comments something about reimbursement rates to your customers. Can you expand on that a little bit more and maybe touch on hospitals, docs, retailers and how you see reimbursement rates trending for that group?","And what do you think of this Part B rule that was proposed? What impact could that have on your business? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Dave, let me start with my comments were primarily addressing the retail side, but I'll be happy to weigh in on the others. So, yes, I think the dynamic obviously, all the payers, whether it's the government or private payers, are working very hard to contain cost, reimbursement is one of the tools that they have. And so as they press those customers, we have to be there to support our customers and make sure that they're able to compete and run their businesses. So it's just a dynamic in the market that we have to live with and we're very sensitive to. I think our customers trust that we understand this dynamic.","As it relates to the Med B proposal, as you know, this got a lot of attention and got a lot of pushback. Let me start by saying it doesn't really have much impact on us very specifically, so that's important to note upfront. I think this is, again, an attempt \u2013 we'll see CMS trying to continue to do things to contain cost, to push us towards a more value-based system. Directionally, we understand that that's just very, very hard to do and they've got to be careful as they do that not to hurt providers who really are working hard to deliver care every day. And I think what they bumped into here was some very strong pushback in the provider world.","So I do think we'll see an active CMS. We expect that. I think they will make proposals regularly. Some of those will come through and stick and I think some with the system will say those are tough for us to adopt and they have adverse consequences. And this is probably one those ones where the market pushed back and particularly the physicians saying this was particularly painful for them. But this is part of the dynamic that we live with I think today.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Couldn't the biosimilar component of the Part B rule be a benefit to your model?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's an interesting question. I'll probably be a little careful in answering because it's so early. The biosimilars, Dave, are still emerging. As you know, because you don't have this driver of the AB rating, it doesn't get the kind of instant uptick that you see with the launch of a traditional generic drug. And so I guess hypothetically the answer is yes, but we have to just recognize we're in very early days on the biosimilar side and I think a lot to play out still.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kreger of William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. George, earlier in the call you talk about a fair amount of customer consolidation within the Pharma Distribution business. Can you just remind us how you think that ripples through with pricing trends as some of those relationships come up for renewal for you?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have seen a fair amount of consolidation, certainly among the biggest players, biggest purchasers. I think, first of all, this is sort of unraveling \u2013 not unraveling, probably unwinding. Some of these are still in regulatory approval.","I think in general consolidation is a phenomenon that we've experienced over a lot of years. We're used to it. I think the question that we think about when we look at those consolidated customers is not just are they bigger, but so they have new kinds of needs, to stick needs where we have tools that can support them.","So I think the key for us as we think about these is not just whether or not we can be efficient in order to be price competitive, but as those combinations occur, do we have unique sets of skills that allow us to create value for those merged or different kinds of entities? I think increasingly we do.","So I think it's clear that we have scale and that we can be price competitive. But I think it's also other things that we want to be able to bring to any player, whether or not that's on the institutional side in hospital and health systems, or whether it's on the retail side.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And a quick follow-up on the Medical side. Where are you seeing the best traction with your private label and branded products? If you could characterize that, I'm curious if it's the big IDNs, if it's smaller, are you seeing any patterns emerge as you get more scale in that business?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's a great question. I wish I could discern \u2013 we're very good at analytics. It would be very hard to discern a pattern. We do a lot of work to segment our customers. It really varies. It's very specific to the account, the nature of their buying organizations, how active the CFO in the C-suite is in the activities deeper in the organization. So it really varies a lot and it would be extremely hard to discern a very clear pattern.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Interesting. Okay. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in here, guys. Just one question. George, you alluded to beforehand with naviHealth, just curious how you're looking some of the programs that are going on in that area, so like the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative, also I think the more recently the Joint Replacement one. And can you talk about how naviHealth is helping you position there, particularly in BPCI? My understanding is that program is not really open, it's still sort of pilot. So where are we in terms of process and when do you think that's going to be broadly opened up for hospitals again?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. So let's start with the basics. I think some of these programs we just have to remember are in their early phases. But there is, Charles, I think no question that there's a push both from the public through Medicare\/Medicaid and through private payers to try to encourage payment models that are not fee-for-service so that are some kind of value-based program.","The tools that we have in naviHealth are really interesting. And, again, remember that these have been primarily directed through the naviHealth history at helping hospitals direct care post-acute. But I think that that skill set of being able to look at how to identify different ways of creating payment models, how do you help the hospitals that are going to have to live in that world, how do you help them navigate this. I think what we have in naviHealth is enormously valuable.","And I think actually for a relatively small business, it's generated a lot of discussion between us and our customers. But, again, BPCI is early. CMMI, looking at that program, early days in all of these but the direction I think is unambiguous. I think there's more push to move away to the extent possible from the fee-for-service. And I think tools of naviHealth and the work that we do in Curaspan, which touches 600 hospitals in their customer base and 8,000 post-acute providers, those kinds of tools I think are going to be increasingly valuable to us.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","With naviHealth, have you seen that already with the hospitals they serve and as you're looking to help direct the appropriate discharge location and that's how you can save money for the system? Is that advantaging on your AssuraMed side on the home distribution business yet?","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't want to get ahead of us here, again. Remember, it's early. But I think it's safe to say that the discussions that we're having with large institutions around naviHealth help us as Cardinal Health position ourselves in the big sense as understanding the challenges and the forces in the market and having sets of solutions and tools that we can bring to bear. So I think as an asset in the Cardinal Health portfolio, it is creating some unique conversations. And, again, I don't want to get ahead of us. It's early, but we're quite encouraged.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","George S. Barrett - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome","Michael C. Kaufmann - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, guys.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to George Barrett for any additional or closing comments.","George S.

Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sally Curley. Please go ahead.","Sally Curley","Thank you, Kayla, and welcome to today's third quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements.

We look forward to seeing you at an upcoming event.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett","Thanks, Sally, and good morning to everyone.","We had a solid third quarter operating performance. Our businesses are competing well, and the moves we're making continue to position Cardinal Health on the right side of health care trends. Based on our work through 9 months and what we're seeing in our markets, we are reaffirming the guidance we've provided this January of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.85.","Total revenues for the third quarter were $21.4 billion, a decline of 13% versus last year's third quarter. This decline was expected, as last year's revenue number included sales under our now-expired Walgreens supply agreement.","Our gross margin rate expanded by nearly 80 basis points to 6% for the quarter.","Our third quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.01, down from $1.20 last year, for reasons that Jeff and I will cover later in our remarks.","When we initially provided guidance last August, we anticipated an unusual year given the expiration of the Walgreens contract. Now after completing 3 quarters, I want to acknowledge our entire team for executing against our strategic goals and for the 6% non-GAAP operating earnings growth that they've delivered year-to-date.","Now on to the segments, starting with Pharmaceutical.","As expected, revenues for our Pharmaceutical segment declined 15%, which was partially offset by sales growth from new and existing customers. Strong performance from our generic programs helped to partially offset the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, resulting in a 9% segment profit decline for the quarter. I'm extremely proud the way over our Pharmaceutical Distribution team is competing in a unique transition year. For the period, revenue increases outperformed the market in all classes of trade, obviously with the exception of chain pharmacy.","Our 50-50 generic drug joint venture with CVS Caremark is making progress, and our teams are deeply engaged in working through all the details so that we'll be able to -- excuse me, that we will meet our target go-live date, which we have said would be as early as July 1. The new venture will operate under the name Red Oak Sourcing, LLC, will be comprised of key talent from both Cardinal Health and CVS Caremark and will be located in Foxborough, Massachusetts.","At the same time, we continue to build strength with our other customer groups. For example, we just recently renewed our Pharmaceutical Distribution agreement with Kmart, one of our larger generic customers.","For independent pharmacists, we continue to broaden our set of offerings. As a recent example, we have a new suite of offerings designed to help pharmacy owners navigate the new reimbursement requirements for the CMS Star Ratings. Our program focuses on providing insights on how best to achieve the quality ratings, which are now so important to inclusion in networks. We continue to believe that pharmacy will play an expanding role in our health care system, and we are committed to the industry to help enable this growing role.","Our Specialty Solutions group continues to deliver excellent growth. We are sustaining our strong upward trend in our core specialty distribution and our platform to support our biopharmaceutical partners.","During this recent quarter, we announced the acquisition of Sonexus Health. Sonexus Health offers biopharma manufacturers comprehensive commercialization solutions in the U.S., including access in patient support, distribution and pharmacy services, all aimed toward ensuring patients receive and successfully complete the therapies they need. Sonexus Health complements and grows our current specialty team's offerings and creates a truly best-in-class patient-centric hub.","Based on all available data, more new specialty medicines were brought to market in 2013 than ever before, and we know this is a health care area in which we will play an increasingly important role.","I'll end with just a quick note on our Nuclear business. We did see some revenue and profit increase in the quarter compared to a year ago. This is certainly good news, and we appreciate the team's hard work.","Our Medical segment performance was solid. Revenue was up 7% to $2.7 billion, and segment profit increased 11%. There was, however, a discernible softness in utilization during the quarter, some of which would seem to be weather-related, but which is extremely difficult for us to precisely quantify.","We did see increased penetration in our targeted strategic accounts, but our progress during the quarter was slowed somewhat by utilization softness and by volume shortfalls in our surgical kitting business.","Having said this, we are continuing to build out our preferred products portfolio, and recently took a significant step with the announcement of the acquisition of AccessClosure, a leading manufacturer and distributor of extravascular closure devices in the United States. AccessClosure gives us an outstanding lead product, the Mynx product family. But equally important, it gives us a scalable platform, a strong customer base, a low-cost service model and a seasoned management team.","As you know, last year we launched our orthopedic trauma solutions to an enthusiastic response, and the acquisition of AccessClosure broadens our offering in another physician preference category. With both cardiovascular and orthopedic trauma product lines, we can now address some of the most significant customer pain points.","Our medical consumables business continues to grow faster than the market, driven by share gains from new product launches as well as from new channel penetration. We're also driving growth in our consumables in the home health channel through AssuraMed, and recently launched our first products under the Cardinal Health label. AssuraMed continues to contribute meaningful profit growth and margin accretion for the Medical segment. Edgepark, the direct-to-consumer business, reported especially strong revenue and margin expansion as patient count continues to grow.","It's just common sense that our health care system will have to take a more active approach to managing the growing population of people who need care in the home. And we have moved decisively in this space. We see a system in need of innovative ways to reduce cost, while at the same time, improving quality, safety and the patient experience. These are not mutually exclusive goals. And with this in mind, we built a strong capability and contemporary Lean Six Sigma methods, and recently launched an educational program for health care providers in partnership with the Ohio State University's Fisher College Center for Operational Excellence. This program, the Academy for Excellence in Health Care, is targeted at acute care and surgical centers, focuses on clinical and operational performance management and uses experts from Cardinal Health and the OSU faculty. Our initial sessions addressed issues raised by participants from leading health systems, and some of those topics included the patient care model, improving the pre-procedure experience, inventory management of high-cost specialty pharmaceuticals and improving post-anesthesia care unit throughput.","Turning to China. We had another quarter of very strong growth on both the revenue and gross margin lines. And as we've told you before, the business is on track to deliver about $2.5 billion in sales this fiscal year. We remain very optimistic about its growth potential. We will continue to play a meaningful role in China's health care evolution by playing out our strategy of enlarging our geographic footprint, creating new business partnerships and bringing our expertise to new opportunities, such as direct-to-patient. As an example, similar to what we do in the United States, we're supporting China's hospital [indiscernible] Initiative by working closely with hospital pharmacies and introducing hospital pharmacy management and services. We now have 10 hospital pharmacy pilot projects with some of the largest hospitals in China.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I want to welcome David Anderson to the Cardinal Health Board of Directors. Dave has an extraordinary track record and recently retired from his position as Senior Vice President and CFO of Honeywell. We look forward to Dave's contributions, drawn on his 2 decades of experience as CFO of high-performing public companies.","And with that, I'll hand the call off to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George, and hello, everyone.","Let me begin by echoing George's comments regarding our year-to-date results. Delivering 6% non-GAAP operating earnings growth given the Walgreens headwind we faced coming into the year is a testament to the organization's performance focus and the strength of our business portfolio.","Now on to the third quarter results. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter.","We reported a 3% decrease in non-GAAP operating earnings in our fiscal '14 third quarter versus the prior year period, driven by the expiration of the Walgreens contract.","Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.01 met our expectations, but were down year-on-year. In addition to the contract expiration, this decline was also driven by an unfavorable tax rate comparison versus the prior year period, which had included a positive tax settlement worth $0.18 per share.","I'll now go through the rest of the income statement in a bit more detail, starting with revenue.","As expected, consolidated sales were down 13% to $21.4 billion. Gross margin dollars increased slightly versus prior year, and we continued our strong track record of margin expansion, with the rate increasing almost 80 basis points.","SG&A expenses rose 3% in Q3, primarily driven by acquisitions, including AssuraMed. Our core SG&A was essentially flat year-over-year, evidence of our enterprise-wide commitment to controlling costs and to adjusting our expense base in response to changes in our customer mix. We remain focused on improving the efficiency of our operations while continuing to invest in our key strategic priorities. Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 26 basis points to 2.6%.","Moving below the operating line, interest and other expense came in $28 million better than Q3 in the prior year's quarter. This is mostly due to a $0.06 per share gain related to the sale of a minority equity interest in 2 investments.","Recall that last quarter we mentioned a possible gain, which is reflected in the revised guidance range we provided at the time.","The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 37.7%, in line with our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, this was a tough compare versus the prior year's unusually low 25.1%, again, a result of an $0.18 benefit realized in that period.","Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 346.8 million for the third quarter, about 2 million higher than last year. During the quarter, we repurchased $340 million worth of shares, which brings our fiscal year-to-date purchases to about $390 million. At the end of March, we had just over $1 billion remaining on our board-authorized repurchase program. We remain committed to our capital deployment strategy, and so far this fiscal year have returned to $700 million to shareholders in the form of share repo and dividends.","Now let's discuss consolidated cash flows on the balance sheet.","We generated $820 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. Year-to-date, OCF of $1.8 billion is slightly favorable to our expectations and reflects the net positive benefit of unwinding the Walgreens contract. As we previously noted, there is typically a large degree of operating cash flow variability from quarter-to-quarter, and we expect our Q4 operating cash flow to be quite light. We ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash in our balance sheet, which includes approximately $480 million held internationally. As a reminder, our acquisition of AccessClosure is expected to close in the coming weeks and that will result in a net outflow of $320 million to complete the deal.","Our working capital days decreased versus prior year, primarily due to the Walgreens contract expiration, which reduced our days sales outstanding.","Now let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss Pharma first.","Pharma segment revenue posted a decrease of 15% versus the prior year period to $18.8 billion. The prior period included approximately $5 billion of sales related to the Walgreens contract. The current period includes strong sales growth from new and existing customers.","I'll note 2 other items. First, as George mentioned, our revenue growth was strong in each of the Pharma Distribution channels, excluding chain, of course. Second, our other Pharma segment businesses have strong revenue growth compared to the prior year period, including China, specialty, and somewhat surprisingly, Nuclear.","Pharma segment profit decreased by 9% to $452 million, driven by the Walgreens contract expiration. The decline was partially offset by strong performance from our generics programs. With respect to generics, sales and profits from total generics programs exhibited very good year-on-year growth in the quarter. This is a result of the emphasis we have placed on building the strength of our programs over the last several years, the overall robustness of the market and the effect of specific manufacturer price increases.","Let me provide a little more detail. First, our generic source sales continue to be strong, up 19% for the quarter. Second, we saw slightly more contribution from new generic launches in the third quarter versus the prior year period. The net effect of generic manufacturer price changes on our portfolio sales resulted in slight inflation in the third quarter. Finally, in Q3, we continued to see some generic manufacturer price increases on a relatively small basket of products. Compared to Q2 we realized a sequential decline in related margin benefit. Looking ahead, there's a fair degree of uncertainty with respect to Q4. And as we've noted in the past, we have been relatively conservative in our modeling of the -- of this contribution because it is so difficult to predict. I'll also note that we saw brand inflation in the low-double digits, which was slightly better than we expected. On our Q2 call, we mentioned this quarter is typically our strongest quarter for brand inflation benefit, but that we had also experienced what we thought was about a $0.02 swing from this quarter that we realized in Q2.","Finally, I'll note that the Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 15 basis points compared to the prior year's Q3 due to our mix of higher-margin business this year.","Now moving onto Medical segment performance.","For the third quarter, Medical revenue grew 7%. The segment profit was up a solid 11%, with the profit rate expanding by 15 basis points. Top and bottom line performance is primarily a result of our movement to home health and the integration of AssuraMed, which has gone well.","For AssuraMed, we continue to be on track to achieve our original estimate of least $0.18 of non-GAAP EPS accretion for the full year. As a reminder, we lapped the timing of this acquisition in Q3.","In addition to our home health platform, our strategic IDN accounts also continued to grow, the result of our focus on these very large networks of hospitals and ambulatory sites that tend to buy a lot of our products and services because of their complex operations. It was particularly rewarding to see this growth in a slow utilization environment. The segment's performance was partially moderated by the effect of overall procedural volume softness and reductions in Presource kitting volumes.","Now a quick note on Cardinal Health China, which spans both of our reporting segments. Our business in China again posted strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, up 33%. We noted last quarter that the overall pharma market in China had been experiencing some turbulence due largely to the impact of some government regulatory actions to improve the integrity of the system. It appears the impact of these actions on growth is diminishing. However, growth is still not back to what we've been seeing prior to these actions.","Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The variance in non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs, which reduced our GAAP results by $0.10 per share. In Q3 of last year, GAAP results were $0.20 lower than non-GAAP results.","Switching gears, let me provide a few comments regarding our expectations for the balance of this fiscal year.","We are maintaining our non-GAAP EPS range of $3.75 to $3.85. In past years, we would typically be narrowing our range going into the fourth quarter. However, this year, we had a couple of fairly large swing factors that still have a fair amount of potential variability to them. Specifically, achieving the upper half of our guidance range will mostly be dependent on 2 factors in particular: first, a return to the levels of benefit from generic manufacturer price increases that we saw in Q2 of this year; and second, realization of our Q4 tax rate, which resulted in us achieving the low end of the provided full year tax rate range.","In closing, we are pleased with our results so far this fiscal year. Our presence across the continuum of care provides balance to our performance, and we believe this is a strong strategic advantage for our customers. Our talented team continues to drive results and remains focused on serving our customers well and executing against our strategic priorities.","With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of quick questions here. Let me start with the Medical segment. So obviously, with the Medical segment, with the acquisition in the quarter, what's the feedback that you're getting from the IDNs and how their kind of like thinking about you increasing your scope in medical devices? And are they more open to some kind of like the genericization [ph] of devices?","George S. Barrett","Ricky, it's George. I'll take that. Yes, I think we're going to get great response from IDNs and health system partners on our program. I think everybody's looking for new ways to do business, recognizing the world is changing. They're very much aware that, in particular, there's a whole category of what they think of as physician preference items, which caused a kind of inefficiency in the system. So I think we're touching a part of their overall cost structure that is really meaningful, and that's -- as you know, we started in the orthopedic space, particularly along the trauma line, which is probably the most commoditized of the kinds of products, we're getting really good response. We've actually been expanding our program that we launched with a relatively small line of products. That product line is expanding, and hopefully, over the next 6 to 12 months, we'll be able to describe a pretty significant expansion of that. Our entry into the sort of cardiovascular with the acquisition of AccessClosure is a really important step for us, and primarily, today, that work is being done in the cath lab. But it really opens up doors for us. And again, I think our customers recognize this is a place to really alter behavior, to increase standardization, which they know is going to be central to being able to manage cost and getting the right outcomes.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And is the relationship directly with the IDNs? Or are you also going through the GPOs?","George S. Barrett","It's really both, it's really both. So we've naturally -- we are -- we have to have those direct touch points to the IDNs and to specific hospitals, but we continue to work closely with GPOs as well.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just my last question, and maybe you've mentioned it in the prepared remarks and I missed it. But obviously, a lot of uncertainty around the expectations for Nexium and Diovan, and it seems that different companies are taking different approaches. So is the [indiscernible] contribution from Nexium in 4Q guidance or did you take it out?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Hey, Ricky, this is Jeff. Good question actually. In our internal forecast, we're not really counting on any benefit from either Nexium or Diovan this year. In fact, the benefit from those potential launches, for us, is probably more of a first half of fiscal '15 event.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I might have missed it a little bit earlier, but when I look at the revenues in the second quarter -- I'm sorry, the March quarter, I generally think of it being -- correct me if I'm wrong, I generally thought of the March quarter as sort of your strongest revenue quarter in distribution generally, on par with the December quarter. But we see a fairly steep drop-off here. Can you touch on what other factors might have been affecting that?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, thanks, Charles. This is Jeff. I'll try to take that. Actually, I would describe the revenue in Q3 as quite strong. If you actually strip out the Walgreens impact for our Pharmaceutical business, which, I think, is what you're referring to, we actually grew over 9% with the rest of the business. And that really reflects strength across the board. As both George and I alluded to, we had above-market growth in all of our channels in Pharma Distribution with the exception of chain, and that was obviously driven by the Walgreens loss. But on top of that, if you look at the rest of the businesses within Pharma, we had great growth in specialty, 33% growth in China, good growth in Nuclear, which, as I've said, was somewhat of a surprise but a very positive one, obviously. So we actually feel very good about the underlying growth that we saw in Q3. Now is it possible -- that all said, is it possible that there was some dampening of script volumes in Q3 because of the weather? We've been hearing from some of our customers that, that in fact was the case. And so if there was any dampening in Q3, that might have been a factor that was driving it. But as I said, our underlying growth was strong at in excess of 9%, excluding the Walgreens impact.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So would you -- is it fair to say you didn't see really any weather -- I mean, when you book revenues, is it when you ship to your customers? So unless you got stopped by the weather to deliver, does that affect how you book your revenues?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, obviously, we book them when we ship. We sort of get the second order impact from any weather-related issues. Like I said, a few of our Pharma customers did mention that the script volume may have been impacted by the weather to some degree. Again, it's always tough for us to calculate that very specifically because of the second-order effect. But based on what we're hearing, there probably was some moderation from that. I'd say on the medical side, it's probably a little bit easier to calculate, although still difficult. We definitely saw some weather impact on our lab business, and it also appears to have impacted physicians' office and hospital business as well. So I would say overall, for our company, there was a slowdown in utilization related to the weather, although again trying to quantify that specifically, given the nature of our business, is somewhat difficult.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one quick follow-up on Medical. You kind of talked about sort of softness in the Presource kitting. Is the Presource kitting, is that where you do -- is that the trauma kit where you're -- or where you have a lot of the preferred products going into?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","No. Presource kitting refers to the surgical kits that we -- surgical kits that we prepare for surgical procedures in the hospital. And outpatient and surgery center facilities. They're usually custom kits that are prepared for specific operations. That is separate from our merged [ph] trauma portfolio. Now it could be that some of those trauma products could be in a procedure tray, but when I was referring to the Presource kitting, I was really referring to the broader custom procedure trays that we provide.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So we heard earlier from another peer some conservative commentary looking out over the next 12 months. We'll get guidance from your other peer in a week. Are you at a point in your planning process where you can comment on your expectations over the next 12 to 18?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Hey, Eric, it's Jeff. I'm probably going to frustrate you a little bit with my response. But the simple answer is no. We generally provide our guidance in our Q4 call, which will be in August this year. In main part because we're still going through our planning processes. Until we complete those, we're really not in a position to provide quantitative guidance for our fiscal '15. That all said, let me provide a couple of qualitative comments on drivers and our approach heading into next year, and I'll go through these in no particular order. First, we continue to expect the accretion from the CVS generic sourcing JV, net of the accounting for the quarterly payment to CVS, to be accretive. We said that at our December Investor Day. And based on everything we know to date, we continue to very much expect that to be the case. The other thing I'll mention about the CVS JV, as George said, we're still on track to be up and running as early as July 1. But it'll take time for the contracts to flow through and the benefits to ramp up. So clearly, we're not going to see a lot of benefit day 1. It will progress later, ramp up over the course of our fiscal '15. Second point I'd make is, we're going to continue to maintain our conservative posture with respect to health care utilization. And as we said before, we're not going to try to forecast when ACA volume upticks might kick in. That's proven to be a very difficult proposition. And we decided some time ago that, for the purpose of our internal forecast and planning, we will be relatively conservative and really not try to model when ACA-related volume might kick in. And we expect to continue that as we forecast for fiscal '15 as well. On the subject of being conservative, we're also going to continue to be somewhat conservative when trying to forecast the benefit from generic pricing relative to what we experienced so far in fiscal '14. As I said in my remarks, and as we said multiple times, generic price increases from manufacturers are a very difficult thing to predict, given the fact that it affects a very small part of the overall portfolio, less than 5% of our products. So again, we're going to continue to be somewhat conservative in terms of forecasting any benefit we might get from generic price increases. We do expect growth next year in virtually all of our key strategic priority areas, including specialty, China, preferred products and hospital services. As you know, we've continued to focus on those for the past year, invest in those. And I fully expect our fiscal '15 plan will reflect some of the fruits of those investments.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A commentary I may have expected, but perhaps a little bit more conservative, I guess, the outlier here being that you do expect the JV falling through in line with where you were, that's very much on par. Do you think you'll be in a point to give us guidance in terms of the benefit you're receiving from that when we get full year guidance?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I'm not going sure we're going to give a specific number related to it, quite frankly. But it will be reflected in whatever guidance we give in August, our best estimate of the net accretion that we'll get from that JV. And you stated it correctly, we continue to believe that it will be a net accretion when you add everything up. And then we continue to feel very good about the potential benefit from that JV, again, reflecting that there's going to be a ramp-up period.","Operator","We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George and Jeff, I just wanted to kind of follow up on the previous question about third quarter results relative to kind of where you were just a quarter ago. I mean, you gave a lot of color regarding the year-over-year growth rates. But if I kind of look sequentially from fiscal 2Q to 3Q, your revenues were down pretty sharply in both segments, and your profit was down almost double that rate in both segments or -- and actually even more on the Medical side. And so I hear you kind of called out on some specific drivers, whether it be weather, JVs, lower volumes or lighter generic profitability. I'm just wondering if there was anything else that might help explain or reconcile the sequential decline we saw from fiscal 2Q.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, I am going to speak mainly about profit, Glen. So on the Pharma side, I mentioned that the sequential benefit that we realized from manufacturer price increases on generics wasn't materially less in Q3 than it was in Q2 -- which by the way was pretty consistent with the way we had modeled it as well. So that was a driver of that sequential reduction that you referred to. I also mentioned the fact that although we saw good brand inflation in Q3, there was a partial pull-ahead into Q2 of probably about $0.02, and again, that is something we had referenced during our Q2 call. On the Medical side of things, I would say Q3 was one of the weaker quarters we've seen in terms of overall utilization. How much of that was due to weather? How much of that was due to a lighter flu season? Keep in mind that Q2 was fairly strong from a flu perspective, Q3 was noticeably lighter. But overall, we did see some relatively weak utilization. I'd also say from a year-on-year growth perspective in Q3, we lapped the AssuraMed acquisition in the quarter, so that resulted in some dampening of growth year-on-year.","George S. Barrett","I might just add a little color, Glen. From the Pharma standpoint, our Pharmaceutical segment, actually our revenue numbers, again, stripping away the expiration of Walgreens, were really good, actually. So we competed very effectively, and we like our positioning there. And on Medical, as Jeff said, it would be really hard to point to any meaningful competitive or operating performance difference between the last quarter and this quarter. Essentially the main change being the environment and, as Jeff said, the lapping of AssuraMed. So from a competitive positioning standpoint and where we are, actually feel pretty good about it.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So maybe justify -- Jeff, just clarify what you said with respect to fiscal 4Q. It sounds like you are expecting another significant step-down in the profitability of the Pharmaceutical segment just basically to be in line with the midpoint of your guidance, but yet the biggest swing factors will be some uptick in terms of generic pricing and maybe the Q4 tax rate. So is it fair to say, embedded within your expectations for next quarter, you have continued very conservative assumptions with respect to generic pricing?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Absolutely, Glen. We do -- our current forecast implies another fairly significant sequential decline in benefit from manufacturer price increases on generics. Now as I said, though, we could be wrong on that, and that is the biggest swing factor in where we'll end up within the range. So I would second what you just said. I would also mention that we modeled it pretty accurately heading into Q3, but we're going to continue to be somewhat conservative on that point.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It seems like your kind of execution in the China business continues to be a net positive for the overall company. I mean, as you sort of think about the growth trajectory there and what you've learned now being sort of a broader international business and your key partner on the JV continues to kind of search for assets in Brazil, I mean, how are you thinking about some of the rest of world opportunities? And obviously, your peers have gone into Europe. So how are you thinking about some of the emerging markets, the opportunities, as you've kind of seen what else is developed in some of these regions?","George S. Barrett","So Ross, why don't I start, and then we'll let Jeff join me and probably some specific comments about China he might want to make. We've continued to look everywhere where we think there may be opportunity for us to explore competitive advantage. Remember that we do this really by business line. So obviously, the thing that gets the most attention, of course -- and we've seen major move in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business in Europe, for example, from our competitors. But for us, we'll look very carefully at every market, and we'll look at it with a pretty disciplined eye. And we'll look at it by our business lines. So again, we will -- we have a fair amount of experience in our senior team. We do sell a number of our products in the markets around the world. That's likely to expand. We're looking at individual markets really across the globe. But again, we'll do it with a very disciplined eye, with a goal of making sure that we can enhance our strategic positioning; that we've got a reason to compete, meaning, a reason to win; and that it serves [ph] our shareholders and other stakeholders well. So we're pretty active looking across the world. But again, you have to remind -- I think remind yourself that we have multiple lines of business, and we'll consider them both in the broad context and by line of business. I don't know if you want to add to that, Jeff?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","The only thing I'd add is every news [ph] that's going into China, I think any time you make a move into an international country, you have to do it with a sense of purpose. And you can't dabble, honestly. Any international country requires a pretty significant management focus. And so any decision we make to enter additional countries has to be made with recognition of that, that it's going to take a fair amount of management time and attention, as it should. So if we are going to enter a country, it's going to be because, as George said, we can win. And that we're prepared to invest the necessary management time to being successful. And we could add value and deliver a good return for our shareholders. So none of those decisions will get made lightly. But we'll continue to look. And if we can find markets that can turn out to be as successful as China has been so far, that's great. And we'll apply our learnings from entering China into any significant future opportunities we find.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Not to be dense on this, the follow-up on the 3Q cadence. I know you guys referenced why revenue was a little bit down sequentially, and profit dollars, obviously, subsequently down as well. But if I look back historically 3Q in both segments is also your highest profit margin quarter. And I understand some of the timing issues you mentioned that would impact that. But for both segments, clearly, the operating profit margin is probably lower than what we have grown accustomed to in this particular quarter. Anything else worth calling out as far as mix or anything else within each segment that might have driven that?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. Thanks for the question, Bob. First of all, I think it is important to remind everyone that this is -- Q3 was the second quarter we haven't had Walgreens, and that's going to continue through -- in terms of lapping that loss, it's going to continue through the first quarter of next year. I think we had such a strong quarter in Q2 that perhaps people lost sight of that. But we're still facing the drag on revenue and operating earnings year-on-year from that loss. I'll also say about Q3, actually, we're pretty pleased with where we ended up. We basically ended up exactly where we were forecasting to be. We overachieved versus plan. And yes, there was some lightness in utilization, particularly in Medical, that was a bit of a disappointment. But as George said earlier, from a competitive standpoint, from a strategic priority standpoint, we continue to be firing on almost all cylinders, which is important. And I think it bodes well for the future. So I -- quite frankly, from our perspective, Q3 came in as or slightly better than we expected, and we feel pretty good heading forward.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess, Jeff, you mentioned some of the things to keep an eye on for next year ahead of official guidance, obviously. I just -- I guess, one specific question I had around contracts, can you remind us of your exposure to the DoD? Anything you'd call out there as far as how you're thinking about repricing that renewal? And then I guess, just along those lines, any other contracts that we should have on the radar as we think about modeling fiscal '15?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. So most of this, if not all of it, is public information, so I'll repeat what's in the public domain. Our total Pharma revenues, annual revenues from the DoD are about $600 million. We have 2 specific regions that we service the DoD. The contracts for both of those regions expire in our Q4 of next year. Now obviously, it's something we'll be very focused on during the next couple of months as the contracts come up for rebid, et cetera. But quite frankly, in terms of impact on FY '15, given the timing and given our overall exposure to the DoD, we expected it to have a fairly minimal impact on our fiscal '15. In terms of other contracts, Bob, I'm happy to say, actually, that if you look at our large pharma contracts, which is what I think you're referring to, we're really pretty well positioned through the end of fiscal '15 with all of our large customers. And as George alluded to, we're happy that we were able to extend the Kmart contract well into the future. And that's very important for a number of reasons, including the fact they're a fairly large generic buyer of us. So from a contract stability standpoint, we're probably better positioned now than we've been in some time. And obviously, you all know that the CVS distribution contract is extended for a number of years as well. So good overall stability.","Operator","We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wonder if maybe you could just give us a little more color around the CVS JV go-live. For example, what portion of generics do you expect will purchase through the JV come July? Is this going to be rolled on over time, Jeff?","George S. Barrett","So Lisa, I'll start, and then I'll let Jeff jump in. Again, you can assume that pretty much all of our generics are going to roll through that joint venture. There could be unique hospital lines that -- Injectables that are not. But you should assume that this is really going to be our generic sourcing model. And we can't provide too much detail beyond what I said in my comments, Lisa, except I will just say this: As Jeff said, we feel good and confident that we'll cover our financial obligations under the JV structure. We've made great progress. There are moving million -- 1 million moving parts in getting to the finish line, and the teams have been really working hard to get to that target date. The spirit of cooperation is incredibly good. And I think we're at a point where we're having good conversations with manufacturers. I think they appreciate that we're building up a pretty transparent model. And so from that standpoint, we're feeling good about it. I don't know, Jeff, if we can add much here.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Just to your -- when the sourcing sort of rolls into the JV, I would say that the JV will be responsible for virtually all generic sourcing from day 1. When I was referring to ramp up, I wasn't really referring to us gradually giving responsibility to the JV, because that does happen day 1. What I was referring to is really when the JV would be able to realize significant benefits in terms of repricing contracts, et cetera. That will ramp up over time, as you would expect, because it's not like we'd be able to redo every contract on day 1.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then you mentioned the renewal of Kmart and the fact that it's a large generic customer. I'm just curious, are you seeing any increased interest from other customers in your generic business now that you have this JV cooperative?","George S. Barrett","Yes, Lisa, it's a great question. As you know, there's been -- these last 6 to 12 months have been a period of incredible amount of movement around the pharmaceutical industry. I would say there certainly is increased interest from players who might be at a smaller scale as to how they can best achieve a greater position. I can't go into great detail. But I think your hypothesis that this is likely is right on. And we'll continue to just be thoughtful and in touch with everyone who can be a player in this field. So yes, I think it's reasonable to say that there's continued and probably increasing interest.","Operator","We'll go next to David Larsen with Leerink Partners.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can you guys touch on what you're doing to work with your independent pharmacy customers to basically help them improve the way they deliver care? We're hearing a lot about how retail pharmacies are becoming more providers of care. Any thoughts around how you're helping them along that path?","George S. Barrett","Yes, I'll touch on it. The model that we've evolved really with the independent pharmacy is essentially to provide an extraordinary amount of service support to them to enable them to do the thing that they're most likely to compete on effectively, which is getting out in front and engaging directly with the customers. And so our programs really cover the gamut from generic programs, obviously, reimbursement tools. I mentioned this, help on the CMS Star model. Just a little detail, that's really -- the way this works, CMS has implemented a rating system for all plans -- Medicare plans. And so the ratings come with bonus payments related to certain things. We're working with those customers to do that. We're helping them build centers for diabetics inside their stores. We are doing some programs for them that help fulfillment on the home care and dealing with patients who are elderly and have unique needs in their pharmacies. So I would say the basic concept is a huge wraparound kind of service system that allows them to operate in the most effective way they can in their community. Very specialized, very targeted. It's not a one-size-fits-all. And I think that's where we've gotten better in recent years, is that we've been able to really target these customers, segment them and understand that each of them has to compete differently in their own community. And I think the better we understand how they compete and what we can do to help them, the more effective we'll be. I think our retail business is showing the signs of that high service and high-touch model.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Great. And I'm also hearing about how hospital IDNs are obviously forming accountable care organization types of programs, and a lot of these are including pharmacies in their networks. Is that part of the it?","George S. Barrett","Yes, it is, yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So on the preferred products and the med-surg segment, Jeff, what percentage of gross profit would you say preferred products comprised of at this quarter?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, Greg. Great question, and obviously, something we watch very closely. It was about 36% of gross profit for the quarter.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And still, call it, 23-ish percent of med-surg revenues?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","22%, 23%, in that range.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And so with this acquisition, obviously you're planning on moving into other areas beyond interventional cardiology. But as you think about the contribution to -- from preferred products to that segment gross profit line. I mean, it would seem to me that over the coming years this is going to be -- this acquisition and just obviously layering on additional kind of high-end or high-tech-type devices will enable you to kind of basically transform the segment margin higher. And I just -- I guess, I was just kind of wondering, is this something that you view this acquisition and what you're going to do with it, as well as all of the other things that you're doing on the core business transformative to the segment gross profit margin?","George S. Barrett","Yes, Greg, why don't I start and then, again, I'll turn it to Jeff. Yes, this is really at the heart of the strategy. This is, again, a place where we know it's a significant need for our customers. I think it's change of behavior that's going to really alter their game, not necessarily squeezing 1 more basis point out of some product. It's really about a change of behavior. Much of this requires standardization. And I think we're seeing an increasingly receptive customer to this. And we've started to make some moves to build out that platform. So in ortho, we had already begun to do that. You mentioned the high tech. I would say we've started really on the lower tech, which I think is the more appropriate place to start. The key for us is evidence-based equivalents. That's what we're focusing on. And building that case, starting in trauma. In cardio, we've really started with this acquisition. We wanted to make sure that we had a company with credibility, a product line that had some reach, a management team that we believed in, and actually, a relatively efficient low-cost service model, go-to-market model. And we believe that was AccessClosure. We get that. So this allows us, again, to think about other areas. For example, again, thinking more along the lower end of clinical differentiation, more like guide wires or catheters or diagnostic catheters that might be used in this setting. So again, the way to think about this is starting really on the lower end and making sure that we can build the support there in our community. Just to go back to ortho, I would also remind you that we are, I would say, pretty significantly ramping up our capability and the product line in our trauma area because, again, we started with a relatively thin line. And what's important is to be able to have a, really, a basket of products. So we do think that this has the potential to really change the game for our customers. And in terms of our own margin rate, should be very positive.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, just to build on that margin rate question, Greg. As we said in our December Investor Day, our goal is to achieve a Medical segment profit margin rate of at least 5.75% by fiscal '17. And there's really 3 things that are going to drive it, and one of those things is not getting paid more for core distribution. That's not our expectation. But we do believe that the things that we can wrap around our supply chain capabilities will be key drivers of that margin expansion. And specifically, that's preferred products. And as we said at the time, our goal is to get the gross margin contribution from preferred products to about 45% of the overall Medical segment gross margin. Secondly, continuing to aggressively build our home health platform. And thirdly, layering on additional services that we can provide to the hospitals that are clearly very high margin. So it's really those 3 initiatives that are going to drive our margin expansion over the next 3 [ph] of years.","George S. Barrett","Sorry, again, just to reinforce because it's important. We really are focused on a particular part of the market, and these are really, at the moment, it's areas where clinical differentiation is not really relevant, not -- and then where standardization, the benefits of standardization would be really compelling. So just wanted to make sure I highlight that.","Operator","We'll go next to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","George, I wanted to kind of -- I want to pick on your expertise here. And I want to ask, from your background, how much variance is there in the contracting between the drug wholesalers and the generic drug manufacturers? Because with the new purchasing entities that have been formed by some of your peers, it seems like there's a lot of new bells and whistles that trying to be introduced to how the contracts are structured between the manufacturers and the wholesalers. So I guess I would ask, are you guys seeing more bells and whistles being introduced? And George, I guess, from your time at Teva, can you talk about how much variance there was in the contracts between different types of wholesalers, different types of customers?","George S. Barrett","Yes. So George, great questions. Part of which I can answer, part of which I can't. So in terms of differential on pricing, that's just not something I can speak to at this point. I think you guys have to use your own judgment as to how you would believe a different size and scale might influence how pricing is delivered from manufacturer to the channel. Obviously, we --- there's enormous amount of work we've done in this internally, but not something we can really share. In terms of the bells and whistles question, it's a really interesting one. I would argue this, that having sat in the manufacturer's seat, you want this system to be pretty simple. And so, in fact, attaching too many bells and whistles is not necessarily where we want to go. I think we want to simplify the relationship with the manufacturer. I think we want to have a great line of sight between them and us. I think we need to be able to demonstrate to them that we can create value for them. That certainly is market share and our ability to influence market share. But it's also having a model that they connect to and that works for them. So yes, I would say we're not trying to attach things to the model. We're actually trying to simplify in many ways and make sure that when we go to the market as a single joint venture, it's very straightforward, very clear, very transparent, they know who they're working with. I don't know if that's helpful.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. It is helpful, I guess, from the entity perspective. But I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, how should we think out about the procurement savings that you and CVS are going to achieve? We're dumb sell-siders. We think about this in terms of dead [ph] net price reductions versus will there be rebate structures, GPO structures, GPO fee -- or GPO admin fees, pay-to-play structures. So that's -- I mean, that's the type of complexity that I'm talking about, and we're just hearing about lots of interesting structures that are being examined. I'm trying to figure out how much of this is new and how much of this is normal.","George S. Barrett","So historically, there have been multiple -- very quick context, there have been multiple ways that companies deal with the generic manufacturers. Again, let me be very clear, though. We want to keep it simple. So our goal is going to -- is really going to be to do that, not to add layers of complexity. What I can't give you, and I think was the beginning part of your question and I simply can't do that, is how much value is there coming from the venture. And the only thing we can share with you at this point is what we've shared when we announced, which is that we've got an obligation under the joint venture agreement. We feel positive that we'll cover those obligations. And that we expect this to be accretive. But again, transparency, simplicity is probably going to be more of the order of the day in our model rather than adding layers of complexity.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And last one I'll hop off with -- is can you update us on generic drug private label strategy?","George S. Barrett","I'm sorry?","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Generic drug private label strategy?","George S. Barrett","Yes, let me try to do this very generally. To me, in the U.S. market, again, let's talk about the U.S. market. And that's primarily today where we're competing in generic drugs. We don't really believe that the label, whether or not it will be for private label, is a relevant dynamic for those that are making the purchasing decisions. So other companies may choose to go down that path, and we totally respect that and understand it. And maybe it's part of a procurement strategy. And to that extent, we'd always evaluate those things, so we don't rule them out. But as a commercial downstream market strategy, we don't believe in the U.S -- and this has been tried over the last 40 years -- in the U.S., we don't think that's a particularly relevant thing. But certainly, as part of our procurement strategy, if we thought that helped us in that part of the business, we're always open to it and never rule it out.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I missed a couple of your comments on the generic inflation stuff. I know last quarter, you characterized it still as abnormally high inflation on a relatively small basket of products. I guess my question is just big picture, where do we stand on resolution of supply shortage situations? Big picture, are we seeing those circumstances starting to dissipate a little bit? Are we seeing an increase in shortages? Just want to get a sort of a big picture comment on that.","George S. Barrett","Yes. Sure, Steve. I'll start this, and again, Jeff is always free to pile in here. We've said pretty much through the early part of the year that we thought we were seeing some relatively unusual pricing patterns, if you can even use the word patterns. Obviously, these tend to be individual markets. I always remind people that thousands of generic drugs, it's thousands of individual markets. We have -- we did expect to see some moderation during the second half of the year. And then that's what we saw in Q2, we were not far off our expectation on that. So I think the question about what's happening in the market and the disturbances, I'm not sure that we've seen a lot of change there. There continue to be disturbances in the market, significant disturbances in the injectable space, in the hospital space, as you know. And that has made it very complicated for the system. And I know that there a number of both policymakers and a lot of the companies trying to figure out how best to navigate that environment. But I would say we've continued to see some manufacturer shortages. And I'm not sure that has materially changed. But it moves from product to product, as you probably know.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","The only other color I'll add, Steve, is that the number of products that actually had an increase in Q3 sequentially was slightly higher than what we saw in Q2, although still under 5% of our portfolio. However, as I said earlier, that the net benefit to us from price increases in Q3 was materially lower than Q2.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Garen Sarafian with Citi.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up question regarding your joint venture and just the ramp-up. I'm wondering, how does the progression of the ramp occur? I'm just trying to figure out why wouldn't -- especially if the model is to keep it simple, if it would hit its run rate by the end of your fiscal year next year, so within a 12-month period? Or is there something -- inherently something that's longer term such as contracts that you can't get out of that require a 3-year period or something? So if you could just elaborate on that a little bit would be helpful.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. Thanks, Gary. Good question. What I've said before, which we still believe to be the case, is fiscal '15 will be a ramp-up period and that's because it will take time to renegotiate new contracts. We also have some contracts that still have to play out in fiscal '15 -- existing contracts, I'm referring to. That all said, we do expect that we'll hit probably a more normalized run rate in fiscal '16. I don't think we're looking at a multi-year ramp-up period. But again, just to repeat, probably '15 will be a ramp-up period and '16 will be more of a normalized run rate.","Operator","I'd like to turn it back to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks.","George S.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Sally Curley.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you, Anthony, and welcome to this morning's call to discuss Cardinal Health's fourth quarter and year-end fiscal 2017 earnings and fiscal 2018 guidance. With me today are Chairman and CEO, George Barrett; CFO, Mike Kaufman; and VP Investor Relations, Lisa Capodici. George and Mike will have some prepared comments, and then we'll move into Q&A.","Since we will be making forward-looking statements, we need to remind you that the matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to the SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slides at the beginning of the presentation found on the Investor page of our website for a description of risks and uncertainties.","We will be ending today's conference call promptly at 9:45. To more efficiently get through our question-and-answer queue, we're limiting each individual to one question with one follow-up. As always, the IR team will be available if you have an additional question.","There are a few items I want to highlight today. First, you may see a second posting of our 8-K filing today. The components were initially misclassified on the SEC website, so we're fixing that. But there is no change to the content. And second, we'll be presenting at the Robert W.

It has been an honor to be a Cardinal Health Investor Relations officer and to serve you for nearly a decade. I'll continue to work closely with George, Mike, and Lisa to make this transition as seamless as possible. Lisa has more than 30 years of finance and IR experience. And she and her team will serve the company well.","So after more than three decades as an IRO and spokesperson, more than 120 earnings calls, more than 400 sell site events, several thousand investor meetings, and millions of frequent-flier miles, I'm looking forward to parlaying all that experience into my new Savannah-based consulting business. I've made great friendships with many of you that I know will stand the test of time. And I look forward to catching up with you over the coming weeks.","Now on to the earnings call. George?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, and thank you for joining our year-end call. These past 12 months have been trying ones for those of us in health care. Our fiscal 2017 was a year of challenges but also a year in which we took important actions to strengthen our market positioning, grow our scale, add new long-term drivers of growth, and improve the overall balance of our integrated portfolio. These actions will have significant impact over the next two years to five years.","With this in mind I'll devote most of my commentary to the year completed and the year in front of us, letting Mike provide details on Q4, which came in largely as we expected.","Before I begin, I'd like to make a quick comment about our guidance for fiscal 2018. Our perspective on the environment and our operating performance for FY 2018 has remained fairly consistent since we provided an early outlook back in April. We will however, take actions this year, which have some impact on our EPS for fiscal 2018 relative to that early outlook. We feel confident that this work will accelerate our growth rate trajectory in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Mike will cover these incremental items in his commentary.","While demand for the health care products and services we provide continues to grow, powered by demographic changes that will only accelerate in the years ahead, a combination of market dynamics, policy uncertainty, and economic forces made our FY 2017 among the most difficult years to model and predict. The impact of those dynamics was most pronounced in our Pharma Distribution business, where pricing was a material headwind that was mostly associated with generics.","We have talked about this pricing phenomenon all year and spoke about it extensively in April. Along the way however, we have also indicated that most of the Cardinal Health portfolio has been performing extremely well. And we feel confident that we are well positioned for the long term. Let me emphasize, I like our position in the markets in which we compete.","That said let me give you some observations about our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. It remains an anchor tenant in our portfolio and very valuable to the broader health care system. Cardinal Health manages an intricate network, which includes complex contracting, global sourcing, extensive regulatory interfaces, and a vital interconnection between manufacturers, providers, and patients, giving us a leadership role in the safest and most secure pharmaceutical supply chain in the world.","Ours is a business of enormous scale, innovation, and efficiency, both in terms of operations and return on capital. And perhaps most important, it provides a critical and valuable service to our thousands of retail, hospital, and institutional pharmacy customers and their patients, as well as our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners.","Having said this, there's no doubt that pricing dynamics, most notably in generics, has been a challenge for our Pharmaceutical Distribution business. And at a time where we were getting little benefit from new generic product launches. This dynamic weighed heavily on our numbers in FY 2017.","To be clear, we are taking actions to address the changes in the market, including, one, employing advanced analytics and pricing strategies; two, reducing SG&A costs; and three, pursuing novel approaches to grow our consumer product offerings for our customers. We are taking these steps at a time where our service levels and line item fill rates are at historic highs, our customer retention numbers are outstanding. And our PSAO network, the group of pharmacies for whom we negotiate network inclusion, continues to grow, now serving over 5,600 members.","We support this work with a suite of valuable services, including a growing medication management program, tele-pharmacy, inventory management, and reimbursement support, all of which help enable our customers to better compete and better serve their patients.","We've built a strong model in Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health. And it continues to contribute nicely and is a source of strength for us and our customers. Recently we've designed a program to enable Cardinal Health and CVS Health to jointly source our OTC and consumer products. While this offers a considerably smaller opportunity than that associated with our generics program, we still believe that this scale will be beneficial to our customers and to us.","Our Specialty Solutions group generated outstanding growth this year with annual sales now exceeding $12 billion. We've grown along all dimensions, expanding our therapeutic reach and growing both our acute customer base and the number of clinicians and physician practices we serve. And we expect this trend to continue.","We've also grown our service offerings to our bio-pharma partners, helping manufacturers obtain global product approval, make informed strategy decisions, and expand product reach. Our patient support hub improves patient access and adherence, helping to ensure that patients get the right medicine in the right way, at the right time, and stay compliant with their treatment pathways.","So this was also a strong year for our nuclear business. And we now serve more than 1 million patients each month. Of particular note, we are now the only alpha radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in North America and have received Health Canada, EU, and FDA market approval. The first commercial batch of Xofigo was manufactured in June and has already been used by patients.","Our Medical segment showed excellent growth this year with contributions coming in broadly. Our Medical\/Surgical Distribution unit had the strongest growth in recent years. And we drove growth among critical business lines, including surgical kitting, lab, and medical services. We also had excellent growth from our post-acute activities, which include naviHealth and Cardinal Health at Home.","Five years ago our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio contained 4,800 SKUs in 470 categories. Today we have nearly 12,000 product SKUs spanning 850 categories to support customers who seek standardization and cost efficiencies in product category where there is little clinical differentiation. As we integrate the newly acquired Patient Recovery business from Medtronic, this number grows to nearly 21,000 product SKUs spanning more than 1,200 categories.","Now let me take a few minutes to provide an update on Cordis. We have always placed patient care as the top priority in our work. Very early on in the integration of this business it was clear to us \u2013 and we shared with you \u2013 that given our priority and the number of interfaces with J&J that we would need to navigate as we built out a global infrastructure to fully stand up the business, achieving our target synergies would take longer than originally modeled. We are creating a global platform. And the actions we've taken to build this infrastructure will prove particularly valuable as we integrate the 25% of the Patient Recovery business which operates outside of the U.S.","On the Commercial side we've made considerable progress over the year. We saw solid sales growth in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Europe. Our U.S. business, which had a slow start as we merged the organization with our AccessClosure business, is getting its sea legs. And the progress has been encouraging.","As we look to next year for Cordis, while much of the heavy lifting is behind us, it's still not complete. We are getting some commercial momentum and have signed distribution partnerships to expand our product portfolio, which now includes a coronary drug-eluting stent, a side branch stent to treat significant coronary bifurcation lesions, and balloon catheters.","Finally, turning to the Patient Recovery business, we are tremendously excited to have closed this transaction late last week. This is a product line that has been on our radar for many years. It is a product portfolio that fits naturally into the work that we're doing across the continuum of care, in product categories and channels with which we have enormous expertise.","The addition of the Patient Recovery business into our Enterprise portfolio strengthens our ability to offer a broad line of products and services, which are extremely important to our customer base across multiple channels. There is much to be done to integrate this business. And we are so pleased to welcome to the organization our new colleagues from around the world, a highly talented group of people who share our values and our commitment to quality.","Through it all our people have remained passionate in their commitment to improve the efficiency, safety, and quality of health care. Our organization has remained firmly focused on delivering value to our customers, keeping them in a competitive position, so they can best serve their patients. And we've maintained a clear perspective on the long-term enduring value of our enterprise.","With these priorities front and center, we are taking a number of actions during the upcoming year to continue to drive efficiency, better align the organization so that our customers can take full advantage of the comprehensive strength of our enterprise offerings, enhance the long-term positioning of our portfolio, improve the execution of our global products organization, and support our people.","I'd like to focus on one of those actions, our portfolio analysis. We are committed to creating value through an integrated portfolio across the enterprise, which we regularly review to ensure that, one, we are or can be capable of establishing a leadership position; and, two, the line of business is valuable to our customers and furthers our mission of helping to make health care more cost-effective, safe, and high-quality. With this discipline in mind, we are evaluating certain aspects of that portfolio for alignment with those goals.","As an outgrowth of this process, we are exploring strategic alternatives for our Service and Distribution business in China. Our China business has shown solid growth in the years since the acquisition of Yong Yu. And our Chinese colleagues have done excellent work in building out the portfolio. The China market clearly has outstanding potential for further growth. However, to take full advantage of this growth and to attain the market leadership we seek, it would take a level of investment that we believe could be more effectively deployed in other parts of our portfolio.","As I mentioned at the beginning of my commentary, very little has changed in our expectations for FY 2018 since we spoke to you in April. Underlying that early outlook was an assumption that our Enterprise operating performance would grow. Four months later, that underlying assumption remains unchanged. We are running this business with the long game in mind. Our goal is to create enduring value for all of our stakeholders. We do intend to take some actions this year, which we think are important to our future and which will position us to accelerate growth in FY 2019 but will negatively impact our EPS for FY 2018.","As a result, we expect our fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.10. Mike will cover this and walk you through the numbers to bridge our early outlook to today's guidance. As we move beyond fiscal 2018, we expect to see strong growth in 2019 and beyond. For historic perspective, some of you will remember that we made similar decisions during another challenging year in 2009, when we provided insights into how we saw the future. At that time we said that we needed to make strategic decisions and key investments to provide reliably high performance.","Since the spinoff of CareFusion through the end of fiscal 2017, we've delivered total shareholder return of 272%, including reinvested dividends. Our approach then was the same as it is now: Make the important moves today for a more financially secure future. We are well-positioned to play a vital role in health care and its transformation. And we look at all our decisions and actions with our ability to create value for the long term as the backdrop.","Let me finally address one more important topic. You should expect to see us take a more visible role in helping to address the national opioid epidemic. We intend to make a serious investment to support efforts to address the opiate crisis. Like others around the country, many of us at Cardinal Health have been touched personally by this public health crisis. And all of us are deeply troubled by the devastating impact that drug addiction is having on our communities.","We are, however, encouraged to see those communities come together with policy makers and acknowledge that this is a multidimensional problem, one that cannot be addressed meaningfully by a single player or by standalone efforts. The search for blame is the enemy of the search for solutions. Addressing this national crisis requires open dialogue among all stakeholders, coordination, and work on both the supply and the demand side.","Nine years ago Cardinal Health Foundation launched its Generation Rx initiative to combat drug abuse and misuse. And now we are building on that platform with a pilot program targeted at some of the hardest hit counties throughout Appalachia. Partnering with law enforcement, educators, and community groups, we will be working to promote education, prevention, product donations, and implement drug takeback strategies. With this work we believe we can have a positive effect on some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods. We look forward to telling you more about our plan in the coming months. And we are engaging with partners across business, regulators, and non-profits to have the greatest impact.","This commitment is part of who we are at Cardinal Health. We know that solutions require planning and time and cooperation. In spite of market challenges and policy uncertainty, our people manage to stay focused on one thing: serving their customers so that patients can receive the care, services, and products they need. For that I am most appreciative. And I thank all of our very committed members of the Cardinal Health team around the world.","One final note before I turn the call over to Mike. As many of you know, Sally Curley, our SVP of IR and my partner for these nine years, has decided to join her husband in Savannah, Georgia, where they will plant stakes in the ground, set sail \u2013 one of her great joys \u2013 and set up her own consultancy. How Sally can pick her husband over Cardinal Health is a mystery to me. But we are excited for Sally, and we'll miss her daily presence. She has been recognized consistently over the years as one of the leading practitioners of her craft. Moving into FY 2018 we will benefit from the training that she has provided to her team. And we will have her with us through the early fall, ensuring a smooth transition.","And with that, thank you, Sally. And I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call. As George said, it has been a trying year but also a year of significant accomplishments, as the organization has taken a number of important steps.","I will divide my comments into two primary areas. First, I plan to provide some greater specifics and clarity on our numbers for the quarter and the year. Then I will give you some additional color on our FY 2018 and provide a financial bridge from the early outlook we provided in April to our updated FY 2018 guidance. The financial results that I provide this morning will all be on a non-GAAP basis, unless I specifically call them out as being GAAP. Slides 7 and 11 of the presentation on our website include our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables for the fourth quarter and full year.","Let me start by discussing the financial performance for the quarter and full year as detailed on Slides 4 and 8 respectively. The quarter ended up largely where we guided when we spoke in April, except for our tax rate, which was lower than expected. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% to $33 billion, while full year revenues increased 7% to $130 billion. Fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased 1% and were flat for the full fiscal year. Gross margin rate decreased in the fourth quarter and full year by 22 and 35 basis points respectively. The drivers for these three items are best explained when I cover the segments in greater detail.","SG&A expenses increased for the quarter, largely because of our important investment in the IT system refresh in the Pharma segment. Again this major project, which we refer internally as P-Mod, is designed to improve long term customer service and interactions. So far it has been on time and on budget. And I feel very good about the success of future phases.","For the year SG&A expenses increased largely as a result of strategic acquisitions and the impact of the P-Mod project. This was partially offset by lower incentive compensation and disciplined management of expenses. Non-GAAP operating earnings decreased 1% to $640 million for the fourth quarter and decreased 4% to $2.8 billion for the year.","Moving below the operating line, for the fourth quarter net interest and other expense was $65 million, which is roughly a $20 million increase over the prior year. This increase relates to the costs associated with our financing of the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business, which as George mentioned, we were thrilled to close over this past weekend. The drivers for the full year variance are consistent with those noted for the quarter.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27% for the fourth quarter. The tax rate was notably lower, as we saw tax benefits from the realignment of foreign subsidiaries in anticipation of closing the Patient Recovery acquisition. In addition, there were several other discrete tax benefits in the quarter, most of which will not repeat in fiscal 2018. This resulted in a full year effective tax rate of 32.6%.","Our fourth quarter and full year diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 318 million and 320 million, respectively. We did not execute any share repurchases during the fourth quarter. However, our fiscal 2017 total share repurchases were about $600 million, which, combined with our differentiated dividend payout, totals a robust $1.2 billion in cash returned to shareholders. We continue to have $443 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program.","The impact of all of these items resulted in an increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS of 15% to $1.31 for the quarter and an increase of 3% to $5.40 for the full year.","Moving on to operating cash flow. We generated $724 million in the quarter, an improvement over the prior year. Operating cash flow was lower than we expected for the quarter because of nearly $400 million of vendor payments that were made early due to some changes included in our Q4 P-Mod implementation. The impact of this will be resolved in Q1 of FY 2018.","Our full year operating cash flow was $1.2 billion, of which we deployed $387 million in capital expenditures. Key areas in which we were invested were around acquisition support and improvements to our existing infrastructure, including P-Mod.","Overall, we ended the year with cash including short term investments of approximately $6.9 billion, of which $569 million were held outside the United States. This unusually high cash balance includes the proceeds of the $5.2 billion bond issuance in June. Remember that $4.5 billion was designated to fund the Patient Recovery acquisition with the remaining amount mainly to fund the debt payments made in July.","The $6.1 billion Patient Recovery acquisition, completed this past week, was funded by the $4.5 billion of the bond issuance, cash on hand, and borrowings of $700 million under our existing credit arrangements.","Now let's move to the Pharmaceutical segment performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. You can refer to Slides 5 and 9. Pharma segment revenue in the fourth quarter grew 5% to $29.6 billion. For the year revenue grew 7% to $116.5 billion. Both the quarter and full year increases were driven by growth from Pharmaceutical distribution customers and strong performance in the Specialty Solutions business.","Segment profit for the fourth quarter decreased 7% to $505 million, primarily driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing as well as the ongoing investment in P-Mod. These were partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing.","Segment profit for the full year decreased 12% to $2.2 billion due to generic pharmaceutical pricing and to a lesser extent the loss of Safeway and lower branded manufacturer price appreciation. Again the solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing provided some offset to these numbers.","For the fourth quarter and full year our segment profit margin rate declined 22 and 40 basis points, respectively. These declines were largely due to generic pharmaceutical pricing, which we have discussed throughout the year. Consistent with recent comments, while this continues to be a headwind, the environment, while still competitive, seems to be stabilizing.","Now let's move to Slides 6 and 10 to review the Medical segment results for the quarter and the full year. Revenue for the quarter grew 6% to $3.4 billion, driven by contributions from new and existing customers. Revenue for the year grew 9% to $13.5 billion, driven by contributions from new and existing customers and to a lesser extent acquisitions. Fourth quarter segment profit increased 13% to $138 million, reflecting solid performance from post-acute solutions, favorability from compensation related items, and growth in distribution services. These were partially offset by performance in Cardinal Health branded products including Cordis.","For the year segment profit increased 25% to $572 million due to the contribution from post-acute solutions, Cardinal Health branded products including Cordis, favorability from compensation related items, and growth in distribution services. Medical segment profit rate for the fourth quarter and full year increased 22 and 56 basis points. Both increases were driven by the same factors affecting the segment profit.","I know that George gave you some high level thoughts on Cordis, so let me give you some further details. As you know we've been working over the past 18 months to build out our global infrastructure for Cordis. The costs of this build out have been more than expected and have had a negative impact on SG&A and gross margin for the quarter and year. Specifically, the cost of moving manufacturing and standing up our back office services has been more expensive than we modeled. But I feel we have solid plans to address this in the first half of FY 2018. Mainly due to these increased costs, we did not achieve our fiscal 2017 accretion target of $0.15.","In addition to the higher SG&A and manufacturing costs, mainly outside the U.S., there are two other factors that affected the accretion this fiscal year. First, we experienced lower than anticipated sales from partnership agreements. These agreements, while behind our original projections, are on a significant growth trajectory. And second, we incurred higher than planned write-offs for excess inventory.","With the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business, the investments that we've made in standing up our global business are important to best position the Medical segment over the long term.","Now on to the details of fiscal 2018. My forward looking comments will be focused on non-GAAP. since we do not provide GAAP future guidance, due to the difficulty in predicting items that we don't include in our non-GAAP EPS. Starting on Slide 13, we expect mid-single digit percentage growth in our consolidated company revenues and expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.10.","Let me bridge this guidance to what we provided in our early outlook in April. First, we experienced some additional discrete items, mostly in taxes, that caused us to finish higher than we expected. This higher finish of about $0.06, when including the cost of issuing the debt for the Patient Recovery acquisition, impacts our FY 2018 growth rate. Also we recently included three additional items in our FY 2018 guidance that total about $0.16 that we had not included in our April early outlook.","First, we have identified some customer initiatives and actions we plan to take in fiscal 2018, which will benefit us longer term. The majority of the items sit in the Pharma segment and are why we lowered our segment profit assumption from high single digit decline to low double digit decline.","Second, as George mentioned in his remarks, we intend to make a serious investment to support education, prevention, and local communities in their efforts to address the opioid crisis. And finally, we are in the process of evaluating some tax planning that will be a headwind in fiscal 2018 but will benefit us over the longer term. This is reflected in our full year tax rate.","So in summary, the bridge from our April 18 early outlook to our guidance of $4.85 to $5.10, consists of about a $0.06 higher finish combined with about $0.16 of discrete items we believe will help us for the coming years. We are confident in our assumptions and have identified the key elements that will affect us in the coming year. This has been a thorough process. And we are well positioned now to achieve these results in fiscal 2018 and beyond.","On Slide 14 you will see five corporate assumptions for fiscal 2018. First, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35% to 37%. As I've mentioned on prior calls, we only provide full year guidance on tax rates, as they have natural quarter-to-quarter fluctuations resulting from discrete items.","Second, we are assuming diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 319 million to 320 million. This assumes share repurchases will offset dilution and will occur in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we plan to pay off notes of about $550 million in June of fiscal 2018. This is part of our commitment to pay down $1.5 billion of debt during the next three years.","Third, we expect net interest and other expense to increase to $340 million to $360 million, due \u2013 mainly due to debt issued for the Patient Recovery acquisition.","Fourth, we expect capital investment to be in the range of $500 million to $540 million, which includes costs associated with the integration of our acquisitions and the important ongoing investment in P-Mod.","And finally, we assume amortization of approximately $370 million or $0.78 [per share], which includes all acquisitions closed as of June 30. Again this is excluded from non-GAAP and does not include amortization from the Patient Recovery business, which is expected to be significant.","Now let me drill down to the Pharma segment assumptions you will see on Slide 15. Beginning with revenues, we expect a low to mid-single digit percentage increase versus the prior year. Please note that we expect first half growth to be significantly lower than the second half, due to the lapping of certain customer changes.","As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we expect Pharma segment profit for the full year to be down low double digits versus the prior year. Other key assumptions for Pharma are, first, generic drug prices are modeled to deflate in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year. When we talk about generic market pricing, it is forward looking and includes the impact on both the buy side and sell side.","Next, we are modeling brand drug manufacturer price changes of 7% to 8% inflation for the full fiscal year. Of note, as we exited fiscal 2017 less than 10% of our brand margin is now contingent on inflation. There will be incremental expense related to the continued investment in P-Mod to support growth. Also there is an incremental contribution from new generic launches year over year, but the benefit will be significantly less.","Next, there will be incremental contribution from Red Oak Sourcing but less on a year-over-year basis. We expect double digit growth in revenue and profit from the Specialty Solutions business.","And finally, our model assumes that we have a full year of contribution from Cardinal Health China. As a reminder, China reports in both segments but primarily contributes to our Pharmaceutical segment. For fiscal 2018 the revenues for Cardinal Health China should exceed $4 billion. As George mentioned, we are exploring strategic alternatives for this business.","Let's now move to expectations and assumptions for our Medical segment for fiscal 2018, which you can find on Slide 16. We expect revenues to increase in the high teens percentage range versus the prior year. We also expect strong double digit segment profit growth. Other key assumptions for Medical include, first, the Patient Recovery acquisition is accretive by $0.21, integrates into the Cardinal Health brand business, and has an inventory step-up in the first half of fiscal 2018 of up to $100 million. In addition, we expect solid growth from all of our other Medical businesses and that the second half segment profit margin rate will exceed 6%.","One large headwind will be the loss of a significant portion of the VA contract. The full effect began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as the transition to the new suppliers took much longer than expected. Finally, we are not modeling a reinstatement of a medical device tax. Another item of note is that in our first quarter of 2018, in accordance with GAAP accounting principles, we will adopt the new accounting treatment for the tax effect of share-based compensation. We do not expect a significant impact on EPS as a result of a discrete tax benefit or expense.","While we don't generally provide quarterly guidance, I do want to provide some color on what we are seeing for Q1. First, we will see a tough comparison in the Pharma segment associated with generic pharmaceutical pricing in the first quarter. Second, in the first half of fiscal 2018 we expect to see the inventory step-up for the Patient Recovery business. Next, expenses related to P-Mod will negatively impact both our first and second quarters of fiscal 2018. And finally, we will see considerably reduced contribution from the change in the VA contract. As a result of these items, we are currently modeling roughly 20% of our full year non-GAAP EPS in our first quarter.","Now for 2019. Given the actions we are taking this year, we are targeting non-GAAP EPS of at least $5.60. As we exit FY 2019, we'll be a business that has multiple engines of growth, increasing balance across the portfolio and excellent alignment with health care trends.","Thanks for bearing with me through my rather long prepared remarks. And I'll now turn it over to the operator to start Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking the question and for all the information there. Maybe, George or Mike, you talked about China a little bit earlier. Can you talk about sort of how is that currently \u2013 is that currently still in the guidance as we're looking forward? And can you give a sense for the magnitude of its \u2013 sort of the contribution it's given the business in case something happens?","And then secondly, I think you mentioned in the Medical business you acquired within Cordis, a drug-eluting stent. Do you have \u2013 is there any kind of approval processes you need to go through to market that in the U.S.? Or is that something currently just in Europe? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for the question. As it relates to China, we are assuming a full year of contribution in China in our FY 2018. So it's assumed to be all the way through June 30 of this year.","But then we are assuming \u2013 and when we say at least $5.60 of earnings in FY 2019, we are not including China in our FY 2019 guidance. Now since it's probably a follow-up question, we are assuming there'll be some redeployment of capital. But right now in our at least $5.60, China would be slightly dilutive to us in our FY 2019 numbers. And, George, would you like to handle the stent?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes. Sure. Hi. Good morning, Charles. On the second part of your question, the drug-eluting stent was actually not part of the Patient Recovery business that we acquired, but actually done through partnership. If you remember, we talked about the fact that we'd be adding to the portfolio largely through opportunities to partner. And that's what we've done here. So it's an approved product and not something that we acquired through the Patient Recovery business.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","And by the way, to be clear, this is not for the U.S. market right now.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. And if you listened on my comments, I made a comment that the partnership agreements were on a significant growth trajectory for FY 2018. And this would be one of the items that we expect to drive that growth for us in FY 2018. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with UBS.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for all of the color. And, Sally, again wishing you best of luck in the new role. So just wanted to understand some of the additional customer actions. As you think about the investments you're making, how many of these do you view as defensive, reactionary? I know there's a lot that's positioning for the long term health of the business. But part of I think what I'm trying to understand and I think some other people are trying to understand is just are these going to be truly one time in nature in terms of strength of the business now? Or is there a need over time, especially in an increasingly competitive market, to continue to pursue these types of investments for the long-term health of the business?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Michael, good morning. It's George. I'll take that and then Mike can jump in. I think our perspective in dealing with our customers is always sort of on the, how do we grow opportunity? How do we see the opportunity to partner more deeply with them and create growth over the long term? And so while I can't go into details on these programs, that's sort of the underlying assumption. As we mentioned earlier of course, as you said, it is a competitive market. But our position with our customers is strong. There are things that we see that are opportunities to solidify those relationships and create new value. And that's sort of what is the focus of our work.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. And I wouldn't see these investments as something we have to make incrementally each year. This is something that again we have an option to make this year. If we don't think we'll get the right returns out of those investments, we don't necessarily have to make those. And that could provide some upside for us this year. But we thought it was prudent to build these in, because we think there's some things that we'd like to do that we think are important for us to be able to solidify where we're headed in 2019 and beyond.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Great. I'll turn it over to other people. Thanks so much.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Morning, Ricky.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So my first question is around your generic deflation assumptions in the mid-single digits. Sounds like you incorporate sell side and buy side. So can you just give us a little bit more context in terms of what are you seeing in the market right now? And how do you think the pricing will play out throughout the year? Because to your point, you're giving us like more forward-looking thoughts around pricing.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. A couple things. I'd say first of all, as we've mentioned, we thought it was \u2013 the curve was steepest during our first couple quarters of our year. And we've started to see less steep of a decline in our second half. And to us that indicates that there's clearly been some stabilizing in the environment from what again we're seeing as well as what we're hearing from the teams. And so what that means is we would expect to have some tougher compares in our Q1 and Q2 this year. And then we would think the comparisons to the prior year would get better in the second half of the year. So that's the first thing I would say.","When we say we're including the buy side and sell side, what we're basically saying is that when we get lower acquisition cost, sometimes that will translate into lower market pricing. And sometimes that's an opportunity for us to take a look at our margins, always keeping in mind our customers and making sure that they can compete in the marketplace and that they have the appropriate generic pricing that they need to have. And so ours is just basically an all-in of what we're seeing from the terms of our ultimate sell price downstream to the customer. So generally, I would say that the good news is what we're seeing is it looks like the market is stabilizing over the last several months.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So my follow-up, I have a follow up on the Medical segment, but also a clarification on what you just said. So first on the generic assumptions, it sounds like you are really thinking about it from a comp perspective in the second half of the year. So it'd be great if you just can confirm that for me.","And then on the Medical segment, when you talked about the delay in sales coming from partnership agreements, that are now kind of like starting to pick up, what was it about the relationship that led to that kind of like slow ramp-up? And any lessons that you learned that you think could help you to improve when you sign up these new type of customers?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. So, yeah, on the generics, I would say that again all I'm saying is that since the curve was steeper in the first half of last year, we would expect the comps on generic deflation to be a little tougher in our first half than we would in the second half. And hopefully that answered that.","As far as the partnership agreement, I'll mention it and George may have a couple quick comments in. Yeah, I think we've learned a couple different things. No \u2013 I wouldn't say any real concerns. Just generally that sometimes just getting it down on paper and actually getting it signed and all the terms and conditions agreed to just takes a little bit longer than you think. And then sometimes when you're working with the partners, the timing of which they think they'll get approvals, whether it be overseas or in the U.S., just take a little longer than they expected. So it's really more about getting the I's crossed \u2013 T's crossed, I's dotted and these approvals that just slowed it down.","But nothing at all that makes us concerned that this isn't the right strategy, isn't going to be a significant portion of what we do. I think customers \u2013 these partners see us as a great go-to-market partner, not only because of our distribution capabilities, but because of our commercialization capabilities with the significant sales activities that we have in place and an excellent sales team.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, Ricky, I actually don't have anything to add to that. I think that's exactly the right response.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Morning, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","So just digging back into the sort of 2019 color that you gave, I'm just trying to sort of back into the underlying profit growth. So you talked about a pretty decent step up in accretion from the Medtronic deal. So an incremental $0.34 in 2019. And obviously you've got some moving parts on the China piece. I mean it seems like the underlying growth is somewhere in the 5% to 6% range.","I guess, one, is that right in terms of profit? And if so is it really thinking about sort of the improved results in the second half? And then kind of run rating that into 2019 in both of the underlying businesses? Or is there sort of other assumptions in there to kind of be mindful of as we kind of get into that picture? Again I realize you're not going to give a ton of color. But just maybe broad strokes as how you're thinking about that progression?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. So I think obviously one of the things that we'll see is we really believe that the Pharma Distribution business will be stabilizing. And FY 2019 as we continue to lap some of the headwinds that we've had both in terms of some customer changes as well as generic market pricing, we believe that we're going to continue to see really strong growth in our Specialty business, which its base continues to get larger and larger, so that strong growth becomes more and more meaningful.","We won't have any inventory step up for the Patient Recovery business, which as I mentioned that we're targeting to be up to $100 million. Plus we expect to see growth in that business as well as Cordis and other businesses.","We have some negative comp, things that we mentioned that were one-timers last year that affect this year that we won't have that noise in the numbers.","Overall demand \u2013 we expect base overall demand to continue to grow. We also expect some really nice growth as we've seen this year in our core Med business in \u2013 the post-acute and the distribution services area have done a very nice job in Med this year. And we are excited about them in the future. And then also there's some opportunities with capital deployment. So I would say those are the broad strokes as to why we feel good about where we're headed in FY 2019.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe \u2013 this morning one of your customers was acquired by KKR, but also there was involvement from Walgreens, in PharMerica. I'm sure it's hard to comment. But I guess in those cases, can you just give us a sense for the profile of a customer like that? The sort of materiality to the business? And how you think about risk during these sort of transition periods?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, Ross. Why don't I start? First of all, obviously we just saw the news this morning. And so it is hard to say much, other than that PharMerica has been a customer. And our agreement goes through June of 2018.","We've been in an industry that has seen the chess board move around a fair amount. We will occasionally be on the right side of those movements. We'll occasionally be on the wrong side. And that is true for all of us.","I would say in the big picture, this is not a material issue for us. But you certainly are seeing an industry that is going through some changes over these last couple years. And we'll probably see more now and again. But we feel like we have a very robust base at this point, strong positioning. And our customer stability is quite high.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks very much and good morning. George, I was wondering if you were seeing any changes on the manufacturing side. So any of your contracts that maybe weren't under a fee-for-service relationship previously? Are you seeing any changing in any of the contracting right now on the manufacturing side?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Good morning, Lisa. So I'll do this carefully. Obviously the conversations that we have with our manufacturer partners are proprietary. And we're careful about that. I will say the industry is going through some interesting changes over these last couple years. And so we're trying to make sure that in our conversations with our branded partners, both sides are reflecting those changes.","I think Mike sort of captured one of them, which I think is very significant. Which is we're just going to see less and less that is in contingency that is tied to something other than a fee base. So I think directionally we'll see more moving towards a standard fee base. And I think Mike captured that and gave you a little bit of economic sense of that. I would think that trend is going to continue.","But by and large I think conversations are productive. I think we are hopefully respected for the value we create. And we have great respect for the partners that we work with on the manufacturing side.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, as I mentioned, we said in 2017 was a little less than 15% was contingent, but we exited at less than 10%. So we would expect our 2018 to be less than 10% to be contingent. And we are continuing as George said to have very productive conversations with some of the folks in that less than 10% bucket. So we'll see where that goes. But I feel very good that we're doing the right things to reduce our exposure there.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And then my follow-up question, Mike, would just be around the $0.16, where you talked about first seeing customer initiatives on the Pharmaceutical segment. Can you just give me an example? I'm just trying to understand what kinds of things you're doing and then the investments that you're making around your customer segment?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. That's hard to do, so I really can't do that. It's just we have some different discussions that we're doing with various customers that again if we think together with them, that leads to the right type of situation that we find to benefit us in 2019 and beyond, we'll make those investments. And if we don't then we won't make those. And you will see some upside from us for the year related to not making those investments. So I can't really give you more detail than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. Can you speak to the strength in the Specialty business that you've alluded to? And how should we think about the quarterly progression here? And what's driving that business?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","So let me start. I'd probably say that I don't know that I can give you much about the quarterly progression as it relates to Specialty. Again I think beyond \u2013 Mike may want to just give further color on Q1 that he mentioned. But our Specialty group has just been on a very strong pattern here. I think we've built out a lot of capability. We're clinically very strong. I think our analytics are very strong.","And what we've been able to do I think is grow in both our ability to serve more therapeutic areas downstream and create more service offerings for our biopharmaceutical partners on the upstream. And obviously we are also aligning with the trend that's happening in the pharmaceutical and biotech world, which is more products that are being approved and are in development are specialty drugs.","So I think we've been \u2013 seven years or eight years ago we made an important turn in the road to really double down in this business. And we've made a few acquisitions. We've done some great things organically to grow. And we've built out some real capability. And we like to see ourselves as a thought leader in the space. So I think it's an encouraging sign, great direction, leadership is strong. And we're thrilled with the team that we've got there.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, I don't see anything lumpy or anything like that happening in Specialty. I think it should be strong, steady growth throughout the year.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. And on potential redeployment of capital following the China exit. As you further diversify kind of your business or have been in recent years, what other verticals have you contemplated, whether it be in contract research services side or alternative (56:25) such as animal health? Anything like that? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, why don't I take that? Qualifying that as it relates to redeployment of any capital that may come in from the China activities, that's one we can't comment on at this point.","In terms of where we are strategically and the portfolio, there are areas that we think are very important, most of which we are now competing in and competing very effectively. So I wouldn't say that there is a marked hole in the portfolio. I like where we are on the Pharmaceutical side. I think we touch all channels. I think we touch all of the manufacturing world. And I think our reach is extensive. We said a couple years ago that Specialty needed to be bigger. It is. We said that generics needed to be bigger. It is. I think we're doing the things we need to do there.","On the Medical side I think our business at this point is really driven by the value that we can create for our customer base. And if you look at our customers, whether those are an IDN customer or a straight hospital customer or a clinic, our ability to provide a really broad basket of related services and products right now is pretty extensive. So we'll always look for opportunities to increase scale or competitive strength, but I wouldn't point you to a particular area of weakness right now.","Again the other piece I'd add is our post-acute work has been really interesting. And I think we're quite strong there. And we sort of took an early position in that space. So I wouldn't say that there's an area to highlight as a weak area, but I think we're on the right paths there. And I think the portfolio looks strong and highly connected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just to follow up on generics, I know to Ricky's question earlier, so you're assuming mid-single digit deflation for the full fiscal year. But you also said that you think that it's starting to stabilize. So just parsing the details, I mean are you basically expecting this to turn flat to positive once we anniversary the market disruptions or as we get to the back half of the year?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No, I wouldn't say that we would see it going to flat or to the positive. In fact, the history of generics wouldn't indicate that that's typically the case. As we said a few times, we've had a couple years where we did have a net increase, had net inflation in generics. But typically it is a net deflationary environment. So we would assume it to stay in a deflationary environment, just not as extreme as we saw for the first part of this year. And I think that's probably just the best way to summarize it.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","I got you. And then my follow up, you mentioned something about investment in opioid measures. If you don't mind just walking us through what you're thinking of doing there? And then as we've seen this in the press, obviously a lot of focus on you guys and your exposure there. So if you don't mind giving us some color on what you think with all the investigations your exposure is, given what you do for opioid drugs?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Let me do the second part first, and then I'll come to the first part of your question. Some of the basics. We operate a very strong, robust suspicious order monitoring system and process that not only meets our regulatory requirements, we believe it exceeds what is required of distributors. We're doing our part to prevent the diversion of drugs.","I would also say though, it is important that everyone do their part in dealing with this issue. I said in my comments earlier that the search for blame is the enemy of the search for solutions. It's something I say often in our organization. But it is especially true in a complex situation like this. What we really need is for all of the stakeholders to work cooperatively and ultimately to address both sides of this issue. And so I think that's important.","As it relates to legal cases, I'd just say this. We're going to vigorously defend ourselves. We believe that the lawsuits do not advance the hard work needed to solve the opioid abuse crisis. And we are going to do the things that we think are important in the public good to help in a place where we've got some knowledge. And so we are doing this and have been doing this in education. We've talked a lot about our Generation Rx initiative. Some of you know about it. We haven't been that visible in the public about it. But it is actually a really important program in helping to combat drug abuse and misuse. We are working with law enforcement. We're working with educators. We are working on product donations to help in a crisis. We've got takeback strategies.","So what we are probably going to be doing in terms of our focus is working in the regions where the \u2013 we're really going to pilot this in regions where it is most acute. And we feel that's very important. So it's an action that we want to take. It will build on the work that we've done. And we think it's important. And we're going to do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. George, could you talk a little bit more about how you view the international opportunity? It seems like on the one hand you're signaling that you're backing away from China at least on the drug distribution side. But on the other hand you're investing on the Medical side with Cordis and Medtronic. So how do you think about international as a growth opportunity going forward?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Hey, John. Yeah. Great question. You actually drew a very valuable distinction, important one for us, which is we're looking at \u2013 and I think I've always said this to you as we look internationally. We look at the services part of our business with a different lens than we look at the product side. Let me put it very plainly. We have a big product business. We want to sell those products in every market in the world. Those tend to be opportunities where scale is advantageous to us. It drives manufacturing costs. And there's sort of a virtuous cycle of having that scale.","Service businesses transport with greater challenges. It's harder to create value out of service businesses. We entered China because we saw a unique opportunity. We knew it was a business that was in a market that was growing. There was a roll-up that was likely to occur and that we felt we could bring something to that market. And I think that we have. And our teams have done a great job there. They've really grown that business.","But I think what we are seeing there is to have the kind of leadership that we seek is going to require a deployment of capital that can be more effectively deployed elsewhere. And so I think it's just for us a question of how quickly and what does it take to achieve that leadership position. And so that's driving our decision in China. But I do think that the distinction that you drew is an important one. We tend to look at product lines and product businesses a little bit differently than we do those service businesses.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then a follow-up for Mike. Can you just talk a bit more about investment scenarios in fiscal 2018? It looks like CapEx is slated to be up significantly. It looks like over 30%. What sort of investments are you planning on making in the coming year?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. As far as overall capital deployment, you're right. We would expect CapEx to be, as we said, $500 million to $540 million. We still plan to maintain our dividend policy of a 30% to 35% payout. And as I mentioned, we also committed to pay down about $500 million of debt each year for the next three years. So those are three important things for us in terms of capital deployment. And obviously after that as we always have, we'll continue to look at opportunistic repo and M&A that fits strategically with the business.","Specifically as it relates to CapEx, the biggest piece of that is going to be our P-Mod costs that \u2013 continue to make those investments over that multiyear project. And then there's also some dollars that were significant into some of the acquisitions. The Patient Recovery business will have some initial capital that we want to put into our plan for this year, as well as continuing to invest in some of our other recent acquisitions. So those are the biggest ones. And then we'll continue to invest obviously in all of our infrastructure, whether it be our buildings, IT systems, et cetera, at our other businesses that we continue to do across post-acute and specialty, et cetera. But those are a couple of bigger carveouts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and farewell, Sally.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Morning.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You'll be missed by many. Mike, sorry to come back to this. But in your prepared remarks on generic pricing you stated that it remains competitive but seems to be stabilizing.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And maybe we're mincing words here. But when can you declare victory, that it has indeed stabilized? I think to an earlier response you implied it's lapsing of the quarters. But wanted to see if there's something else that we're missing?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I would just say this. I'm not sure that you can ever declare \u2013 I wish that I could say on November 15 we ought to be good to go. But that's just not the way it works. I think it ebbs and flows, depending on various things going on in the market. And I think that when you have various launches that happen, multiple players, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it has always ebbed and flowed. That's been the case \u2013 I've been here 27 years now, and I've seen it.","I think what we've tried to say is that we're used to dealing with those normal ebbs and flows. What we saw in the late last year and the first half of this year was a little bit more extreme, because there was a lot of noise in the marketplace. And it seemed like those ebbs and flows were just a little bit more extreme. And what we're saying is it's not that it's stabilized in the sense of no competition. It's just that it's going back to what I would call more historical norms. And, George, I don't know if you want to add \u2013 ?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Garen, that's an interesting question. And let me frame it. And it's probably aligned with what Mike was just saying. Historically you see deflation in generics. So in a way victory is just going back to typically our ability to model it very effectively. We actually have been able to model it very effectively. This was the most challenging year for us in terms of being able to predict and model it. It just looked a little different than we had seen. So in some ways victory is actually just knowing that we're seeing patterns that are familiar and that we can model more effectively. And I think that's my version of victory on this one.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. No, that's actually very helpful. And then just moving on to the Medical side of the business. Hospital utilization trends have been weak thus far in the quarter. It doesn't look like it impacted you this quarter. But anything that you've observed? And what are you assuming for fiscal 2018? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, Garen. It's \u2013 yeah. From the data that we've seen, it's relatively flat utilization. I still \u2013 and I think I've said this to a number of you. I do think that in a way that defies gravity \u2013 I mean, we know that demographics are driving more people to need health care. And so I do think what we're seeing, and I think we'll continue this for a while, is some choppiness associated with shifting benefit designs. But ultimately I think demographics will win out. I mean that's the reality. Our business has been growing. I do think our value proposition is resonating perhaps differently than it did three or four years ago. And as a result, we're positioned well with market leaders. And I think our share position is good.","So I think we're not assuming a big increase in utilization in our upcoming year. I think we'll continue to assume it's relatively steady as she goes. No major changes. Again, my view is that underlying that there are some issues that are probably going to continue to grow over years.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Partners.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Let's assume you do sell the business in China. Can you talk about any restrictions on what that cash might be? Can you take it back into the U.S. and buy back stock? Or any thoughts around that would be helpful. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Obviously that's something we are obviously thinking about. And as you can imagine are doing the appropriate planning to do the right things to be able to have access to that cash. So at this point in time I can't say a lot, other than we would not expect to be limited with at least a large portion of any net proceeds that we have.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then for these $0.16 of discrete items, that's in addition to the $0.50 that you mentioned last quarter? Is that correct? And then would any of that $0.16 \u2013 are those like separate discrete projects? Or would some of that potentially be perhaps pricing a bit more aggressively to win new business? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Good question. Really they're two separate things. When I was really talking about the discrete items that were greater than $0.50, I was really trying to call out things that caused FY 2018 to be down from FY 2017. For instance, if you have a discrete tax item that doesn't repeat in 2018 that you had in 2017, then you obviously create a headwind. Or if you have a reserve adjustment that was positive in 2017 that isn't going to repeat in 2018, then those are the types of things I was talking about.","So that greater than $0.50 obviously finished a little bit higher, because taxes got a little bit better. And that's why we finished a little higher, which created a little bit more headwind for 2018. So that was that bucket.","What I was specifically talking about on the $0.16 plus the $0.06, so a total of roughly $0.22, was where I was really trying to help you bridge our guidance that we gave of $4.85 to $5.10 back to the April early outlook, where we said that we would be down flattish to mid-single digits.","And so that $0.22 really helps you reconcile roughly midpoint to midpoint if you look at it of what happened. Because since April we went back and said as we were establishing our budget, what else that we think is important to do? And so first of all \u2013 not really part of the budget \u2013 we finished $0.06 higher, but then we had the other $0.16 as I mentioned is from customer investments we decided to build in that again, if we do not do them, those will be potentially things that we would be able to give back this year in terms of overperformance. But we think those are good investments that we're working through with various customers. I will say those are not just being more aggressive in the marketplace. That's not at all what those would refer to.","And then it's some tax planning that we're doing in order to put ourselves in the best position. And then as George mentioned, it's some significant investment into fighting this opioid epidemic that we are planning to do in 2018 that we think is an important thing for us to do as a company to step up.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I think we've \u2013 go ahead.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike. And also, Sally...","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Morning, Steve.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I enjoyed the partnering action over the years. And thanks for taking the question here. Just quickly on brands. We heard that one of your peers talk about some pressure in mid-calendar 2017 from just recently converting more branded drug manufacturer contacts to fee for service. So I was just curious if Cardinal made any changes around that in the past several months? And is that playing a role in the near term results and outlook? And then I have a very quick one-line follow-up question.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that we can't get into a lot of specifics, but we have been working as I said with some of the suppliers that were in that contingent bucket that had a portion of contingent. And some of those suppliers we have reached new agreements with. And other ones we're still working through with. So that's why I said we went from around 15% to less than 10% now being contingent.","Was there a little bit of noise on some of that? There is a little bit of that. Nothing I would call as significant in our 2018 numbers. But yeah, there was a little bit of trade-offs as we worked through with some of those manufacturers. But we feel really good in general about where those came out and some of the other components of the deals that we were able to strike.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And just quickly on Red Oak, you mentioned I think for FY 2018 maybe a little bit less contribution year over year. I'm just curious. Can you remind us just how much the annual payments were from Cardinal to CVS in fiscal 2017 that just ended? And then is that expected to change materially at all in FY 2018?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. The annual payments to CVS are $45.6 million a quarter, and those payments are locked in for the rest of the deal. So there will be no change in the impact of those payments in FY 2018 to FY 2017. But again the value that we're seeing from Red Oak net of those payments continues to be very, very positive.","Just quickly because we're running late on time, we're really going to have to make the next question our last one. And then anybody else that didn't get a chance to get in, please, we'll hopefully answer your questions as we do one-on-one calls today or throughout the next several days if you need to get your questions answered. So let's go to the last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Appreciate you guys sneaking me in, and I'll just limit it to one. Looking at fiscal 2019, the kind of early guidance you guys have given there, obviously pretty unprecedented for Cardinal to be providing guidance two years out when wrapping up the fiscal year. So I guess just maybe, both George and Mike, just a little bit more on the thought process behind this? I would think honestly, given how fluid the environment has been that visibility would be still somewhat limited, especially that far out. So how should we think about your confidence in the drivers behind fiscal 2019? And maybe just the thought process behind kind of taking a step out and providing that to us today?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Bob, thanks. It's a fair question. I think it was important for us as we looked at our business. We have been over these last nine years, we've had moments where we've had to reset, invest, and drive for future plans. I mentioned that during my prepared comments. This is sort of one of these moments. Part of this is the conditions of the market. Part of it is the moves that we've made.","We felt as we started looking out at the business, particularly having deployed some capital and some important moves, that it would be valuable for you to understand how we saw those and to sort of lay out our aspirations. And so I think it's partly a way of sort of framing how we see the business and the evolution of the portfolio. You've seen us make \u2013 announce one potential move here in China. Over the last week we've closed another transaction that we think strengthens our business on the product side.","So as we talked about it and felt that it would be helpful for us to frame that out for our investors to give you a little bit of sense of our direction, our portfolio, and our sense of optimism going forward.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","All right. Folks, thank you for staying with us. It was I know a long call today. I know there are one or two, maybe three or four of you who did not get a chance to get questions in on the call. We will make sure to be available to you during the day.

Please go ahead, madam","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you, Lorena. Good morning, and welcome to Cardinal Health's third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by our CEO, Mike Kaufmann and Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Gomez.","During the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of risks and uncertainties.","Today's press release and presentation are posted on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.","During the discussion today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures and reconciliations to GAAP are included at the end of the slide presentation and press release.","During the Q&A portion of today's call, please limit your questions to one so that we may give everyone in the queue a chance to ask a question. As always, the IR team will be available after this call, so feel free to reach out to us with any additional question.","Mike will provide an overview of our third quarter performance and discuss some strategic actions we have underway as we plan for fiscal 2019 and beyond. Then Jorge will provide some additional financial detail and color.","And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Lisa and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us. Let me start by saying we recognize that today's results did not meet your expectations or ours. The biggest variable driving these results was some unanticipated disappointing performance from our Cordis business which masked an otherwise better than expected quarter.","The Cordis performance not only reduced our non-GAAP operating earnings but more significantly, it created a higher non-GAAP effective tax rate. But for the Cordis tax issues alone, non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.52. We will walk you through the details.","As you'll see, on an operating earnings basis, overall results came in largely as expected. In fact, the majority of the business, with Cordis being the notable exception, performed in line with or above plan highlighted by better than expected results in the Pharma segment.","Let me start with some overall results, then move to segment details. Then I'll give you a broader perspective on our priorities and our plans to optimize our performance going forward and positively impact the trajectory of our business.","Revenue for the third quarter reached $33.6 billion, up 6% from last year, and non-GAAP operating earnings grew 3%. Non-GAAP EPS decreased by 9% to $1.39 for the quarter versus last year's $1.53. While Jorge will go into more details, a higher than expected non-GAAP effective tax rate resulted in a $0.19 negative impact to non-GAAP EPS. $0.13 of this was related to the current and forecasted results of Cordis.","Operating cash flow was strong. It exceeded $750 million for the quarter. In addition, we received approximately $850 million in net proceeds from the February 1 divestiture of our China distribution business.","In the Pharma segment, revenue for the quarter increased nearly 5% to $29.7 billion, driven primarily by growth in business with existing customers offset in part by the previously announced loss of our contract with Prime Therapeutics. Segment profit for the quarter was down, but less than anticipated. So we were pleased with this performance.","Contributing to the results, we saw strong performance from Red Oak. However, it was not enough to offset generic deflation. A strong flu season contributed some upside and brand inflation has tracked generally in line with our expectations.","Of note this quarter was the renewal of our contract with Optum. We are very pleased that we extended and expanded this important relationship and our contract now extends through the end of our fiscal year 2024. Optum has been a customer of ours since August 2015 when we signed our first multi-year agreement. We look forward to deepening our relationship with them and pursuing new ways to partner and collaborate. Beyond Optum, we are excited to have signed some additional new business and completed key renewals with a number of smaller existing customers.","Before I turn to specialty, I want to mention the efforts by the entire industry to combat the abuse of prescription opioid pain medications. As you know, we launched our Opioid Action Program last fall. In this quarter, we began distributing Narcan free of charge to more than 40 organizations who are providing the product to first responders and law enforcement.","Just last weekend, more than 150 Cardinal Health employees volunteered with our friends at Kroger to staff 105 take-back events in 26 states. And we are continuing to provide grants and support for education and advocacy to prevent misuse and abuse. All of us at Cardinal Health are committed to being at the table. We are continuing to focus significant time and effort to help alleviate this public health crisis that has touched many of us and our communities.","On the specialty side, this business continues to exceed our expectations. It delivered double-digit top and bottom line gains, reflecting growth with both new and existing customers. Nuclear, while not a large contributor, also performed well. So overall, Pharma performance was better than expected.","Turning now to the Medical segment. For the quarter, the Medical segment posted revenue growth of 15% while segment profit increased 34% versus the prior year. Growth was driven by the Patient Recovery acquisition, partially offset by the continued challenges at Cordis.","We are very pleased that the Patient Recovery business continues on track and we are making good progress on the integration. We are executing on our plan in hitting important milestones as we prepare to transition this business off of the TSAs. Our team is laser focused and we understand the importance of getting this right. There's a lot of hard work being put in by our integration team and we appreciate their diligence.","At Cordis, while we are making progress, there is still much work to be done for this business to meet our expectations. We are pleased that year-to-date performance has shown growth on the top line, and we are seeing progress in international markets including China, where sales are up double digits.","In addition, our introduction of a drug-eluting stent to the offering is going well and the pipeline looks promising. However, as we've noted in previous quarters, operating cost and inventory reserves continue to be challenges. Both came in even higher than expected this quarter and continue to weigh on profitability.","We are moving aggressively to stabilize this business. Jon Giacomin has taken on this challenge in his new capacity as the Medical segment CEO and he and Pat Holt, Cordis' new leader, have spent the last few months digging into the business. Together with the Cordis team, they are executing on a series of initiatives to improve performance and drive profitability. However, this will take time.","We must not lose sales momentum and we need several tools in place to enable significant progress. For example, the recent launch of our new global supply chain platform will be critical in providing the team with better inventory visibility. It will also provide better insights into demand so we can more effectively and profitably manage this business.","In addition to the launch of our supply chain platform, work is underway to help us do four things. First, we are implementing new process and technology improvements that will better manage our Cordis consigned inventory.","Next, we will refocus the product portfolio to enhance efficiency and profitability. Additionally, we continue to look at ways to reduce the cost structure. And finally, we will enhance our capabilities around demand planning to better ensure we have the right inventory in the right markets to capitalize on sales opportunities and reduce inventory reserves.","We expect that Cordis will be on a path to profitable growth by the end of FY 2019 and remain confident that the business can be a significant contributor over the longer term. On a positive note, while the year-over-year contribution to segment profit growth was relatively smaller, we continue to see strong demand and execution at our at-Home, NaviHealth and medical services businesses.","So overall, while we continue to work through a couple of challenges, the Medical segment had success in many areas and we are confident in its potential to continue to deliver a differentiated value proposition to customers and contribute as a long-term driver of high margin growth.","Turning now to our outlook. As you've seen from our press release, we are forecasting a more modest fourth quarter and Jorge will walk you through the specifics of how we are thinking about the quarter and full year.","As we look ahead, we are now anticipating FY 2019 will be more challenging than previously expected. While we will still have the tailwinds of Patient Recovery in Red Oak and subsequent U.S. tax reform, we now see significant headwinds including Cordis performance, customer repricing, the loss of PharMerica and continued generic deflation.","Taking into account both the headwinds and the tailwinds, the company should see some modest growth in non-GAAP EPS in FY 2019 based on the updated FY 2018 guidance of $4.85 to $4.95. On our August earnings call we will provide specific FY 2019 guidance and more detail as we usually do at year end.","Within this context, as we think about the future, FY 2019, but also longer term, our team is taking a hard and fresh look across the business to determine what the right steps are to drive long term growth for the benefit of our shareholders and other stakeholders.","Over the past four months since Jorge and I took on our new roles, our management team has been carefully assessing both where we are and the potential opportunities that we have the best position Cardinal Health in what we know is a rapidly evolving industry landscape.","We know we have terrific opportunities to continue to capitalize on the strengths of our model, the complexity of the supply chain and the stickiness of our customer relationships. While we are in the early stages of our work, what I can say is that we are taking a comprehensive and objective look across the business with a view towards better leveraging our unique and broad portfolio of assets to drive profitable future growth.","Among our priorities, we are focused on three key things. Number one, our business mix. We know that we need to have the right composition and balance in our portfolio to fully capitalize on industry tailwinds and opportunities for growth. In addition, we are actively looking at select portions of our business that are poised for outsized growth and focused on scaling our performance in them. We are carefully considering the right investments to achieve both of these objectives.","Number two, our cost structure. Execution is essential to sustainable performance. We are taking a fundamental and in-depth look at the best opportunities to drive efficiency and lower our manufacturing and SG&A cost to improve our ability to compete.","Finally, number three, our capital deployment strategy. We're examining how to best utilize our strong financial profile and capital to drive value for our shareholders and other constituents. We are carefully considering how we balance our various short and long term needs.","The entire team is highly energized to advance and implement the right strategy for the future of Cardinal Health. We have an exceptional portfolio of assets, a tremendously talented and dedicated organization and a critical position in the delivery of Global Healthcare.","We look forward to building on this incredibly strong foundation to drive future performance and increase value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our plans as we update them and develop them further.","With that, let me turn it over to Jorge to discuss more detail on the financials.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. Good morning. As Mike said, we are focused on execution and we are actively working through our near term challenges to deliver the results that we all expect. We will achieve these objectives by enhancing efficiencies, reducing complexity and cost in a systematic way and ultimately generating sustained growth and delivering value.","Today I will cover three key topics. First, I will review our results for the quarter and give some additional detail by segment. Second, I'll share some thoughts on our outlook for the total year. Finally, I will provide some thoughts on our next steps to build a path toward growth.","The financial results that I provide this morning will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless I specifically call them out as GAAP. Slide seven of the presentation includes our GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the third quarter.","Operating earnings was in line with our expectations this quarter but fell short at the EPS line driven by a substantially higher tax rate. Beginning with the total company results, diluted EPS for Q3 was $1.39, a 9% decrease versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a substantially higher tax rate which I will explain shortly.","Revenue increased 6% versus last year, totaling $33.6 billion. Total company gross margin dollars were up 11% to $1.9 billion versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 18% versus last year in line with our expectations. This increase was primarily driven by recent acquisitions including Patient Recovery. Consolidated operating earnings was $781 million, which represents 3% growth versus the prior year.","Moving below the operating line. Net interest and other expense was about $81 million in the quarter. The increase versus the prior year was primarily driven by the interest on the debt issued to finance the Patient Recovery acquisition. Our Q3 effective tax rate was 37.5%, a 5 percentage point increase versus the prior year and about 7 percentage points more than what we expected for the quarter.","Two primary factors account for this unfavorable variance. First, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we had several favorable discrete tax items which drove last year's Q3 effective tax rate to an unusually low 32%. Second, in Q3 this year, Cordis performance drove an unexpected reduction to pre-tax income in certain geographies. These require a year-to-date true up of approximately $0.13 per share relative to our Q2 expectations.","Additionally, we book provision to return adjustments of $0.06 that contributed to a higher than anticipated increase in the Q3 effective tax rate. These unfavorable tax adjustments reduced the benefits from U.S. tax reform this year and we now expect our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate to be between 32% and 34%.","Third quarter diluted average shares outstanding were approximately 315 million, about 2.7 million fewer shares than the third quarter of fiscal 2017. During the quarter, we completed share repurchases for a total of $300 million bringing our total fiscal year to date repurchases to $450 million. We have about $1 billion remaining under our board approved share repurchase plan.","Operating cash flow was very strong for the quarter. It came in ahead of our expectations at $754 million. During the first nine months of the fiscal year, we generated approximately $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. Our cash balance as of March 31 was $2.2 billion with about $600 million held outside the U.S.","I'll now transition to segment performance which you can find starting on slide five. The Pharmaceutical segment delivered strong revenue growth of nearly 5% in Q3. Revenues were $29.7 billion in the quarter. Sales growth was driven by both Pharmaceutical and Specialty distribution customers and was partially offset by the previously announced expiration of the Prime Therapeutics contract and the divestiture of the China distribution business.","Segment profit for the quarter decreased 2.5% to $596 million. This reflects a modest negative impact from our generics program performance, even taking into account the strong flu season. This favorability from the flu season will not continue into Q4. Segment profit for Q3 also reflects a positive contribution from the Specialty Solutions business.","As a reminder, the early completion of the China distribution business divestiture on February 1 is reflected in Q3 results and will more significantly impact Q4.","Now, I'll turn to the results of the Medical segment on slide six. Revenue for the segment grew 15% in the quarter to $3.9 billion, primarily driven by the Patient Recovery acquisition. Medical segment profit increased 34% to $199 million during Q3. This increase was driven by contributions from Patient Recovery and was offset by lower than anticipated performance primarily in Cordis, and to a lesser extent, other Cardinal Health branded products.","Patient Recovery continues to perform in line with our expectations. As Mike said, our teams are making good progress in preparation for the TSA exits that begin this summer. Other areas of the Medical segment performed well in the quarter. We saw nice growth in Cardinal Health at-Home, lab and services. Also our strategic accounts were up for the quarter. As we discussed in our last call, we continue to face challenges in the Medical segment mostly with Cordis. We are working through the headwinds in the Cordis business. We've seen revenue growth year to date primarily driven by our business outside the U.S., particularly in China where we saw double digit revenue growth.","On the operations front, we're actively working to position Cordis on a path toward growth. We have implemented several supply chain work streams to enhance our global demand planning capabilities and consignment process. As part of this initiative, we implemented new ERP functionality which allowed us in Q3 to identify inventory positions in certain geographies that require higher inventory reserves. This new functionality gives us greater market visibility and will help us continue to reduce complexity in our global supply chain. The weaker than expected Cordis performance and higher inventory reserves are major contributors to the higher than anticipated tax rate for the current quarter and full year. Though we are actively deploying operational improvement efforts, it will take time to yield the results we expect.","Now I will transition to GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments for the quarter which you can find on slide seven. A $0.58 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition related costs.","Next I'd like to discuss our guidance for this year found on slide nine. Based on Q3 results and expectations for the fourth quarter, we have revised our full year guidance to a range of $4.85 to $4.95 from our previous range of $5.25 to $5.50. This revision is primarily driven by Cordis operating performance and its corresponding impact to the tax rate that I mentioned earlier.","For our full year corporate assumptions found on Slide 10, you will see that we have several changes. First, based on my earlier commentary on the tax rate, we now expect the full year tax rate to be between 32% and 34%. We are reviewing options to address the Cordis related tax rate increase that we're seeing in the second half and mitigated negative impact in the future.","We have revised our diluted shares outstanding to a range of 315 million to 316 million shares. We expect our interest and other expense to be between $330 million and $350 million. We also expect our capital expenditures to be between $400 million and $430 million.","Lastly, we're updating our acquisition related intangible amortization to $575 million. Our Pharma segment assumptions are on Slide 11 where we have three changes. We now expect our full year segment profit to be down to a range of high single to low double-digits. This is an improvement from our previous assumption of down low double-digits.","Also, we now expect to see mid to high single-digit deflation in generic drug prices and better than expected incremental contribution from Red Oak Sourcing. While generic deflation is slightly higher than our original expectations, we've seen moderation in deflation versus last year and sequentially. Keep in mind, our generic deflation assumption is a point-to-point calculate from June-to-June.","Our Medical segment assumptions are on Slide 12 where we have two updates. First, we now expect Medical segment profit to be down high teens for the year excluding Patient Recovery. This reduction reflected business dynamics that I discussed earlier, specifically related to the challenges we continue to address in the Cordis business and to a lesser extent in our Cardinal Health Branded products including exam gloves. Second, we will not achieve the 6% margin rate in the second half of fiscal 2018, again primarily due to Cordis' performance.","Now, let me share a few additional thoughts that I think can be useful to help you understand the remainder of the year. As you know, we had about $0.08 in our second half for customer initiatives. As Mike mentioned, we extended and expanded our relationship with Optum which represents about half of our planned customer initiatives for fiscal 2018.","In addition, we discussed on our Q2 call that the China distribution business divestiture will be a loss of $0.05 for the full year, mostly in Pharma. Also, we anticipate that the operational challenges with Cordis will continue through Q4 and fiscal 2019.","In closing, we're focused on creating a path toward growth in fiscal 2019 and we are committed to developing and implementing a strategy that will position Cardinal Health for long term success. To that end, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are proceeding with a detailed operational review which will include growth and efficiency initiatives as well as portfolio optimization and capital allocation. We'll share more about this in August.","With that I'd like to open the line and invite your questions.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Ross Muken in Evercore. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hi, good morning, guys. Obviously a lot on the update. Can you just help us in terms of interpreting kind of what we should learn from 4Q and that 4Q guide about 2019? I know you probably don't want to go into too much detail on 2019. But Mike, you sort of laid out some of the headwinds or incremental headwinds the business is facing. But obviously some of those are occurring in the quarter and then some things may not continue in the future. And obviously a huge swing factor is the tax rate. So can you just help us understand sort of in that 4Q run rate as we lift off relative to what you've talked about, at least qualitatively, what's already captured, what's not captured, what are the other things we should be considering? And then anything you can give us on the tax rate would be helpful.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Hey, thanks for the question, Ross. A lot of pieces there. And as you said at the beginning, we're going to really be limited here because we really want to take some time and continue our analysis and update folks at the time of our year end guidance, and at that time. So right now all I can say is you kind of talked about it. As you can imagine, we see some tailwinds from things like tax reform and Red Oak. But some of the other items that you mentioned around repricings and other pieces are going to be some headwinds for us.","So right now, what we can provide you is, and we just, again, want to try to be helpful at this time is that we would expect to see modest growth off of the $4.85 to $4.95 guidance that we gave you. And we plan to come back with a lot more detail and thoughts around that in August.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe just, Mike, just I realize just maybe on the tax rate, because that is so sensitive, can you help us understand a bit better what are the key drivers we have to look for that's causing that to be above what one would expect an effective rate to be in the new tax reform environment, and then what the path is back to a more normalized rate longer term? Because I'm assuming a north of 30% rate is probably not where the business ends up on a very long term basis.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Ross this is Jorge. I'll take that question. With respect to the issue that we're facing, in simple terms, the downturn in the Cordis performance results created certain losses in certain jurisdictions where we cannot out take the benefit of those operating losses from a tax perspective.","Obviously we are reviewing multiple options available to address the \u2013 to your question, the going forward impact and we expect to be in a position to take action within the next few months. I think overall the impact from U.S. tax reform will continue to benefit us and we expect to see a decline in our tax rate going forward. The exact impact from the dynamic that we have going on right now is something that we will be \u2013 we are evaluating and we are finding options to address that long term.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","And if you remember last time on the call, we also mentioned that with U.S. tax reform, the positives of it, because we're a June 30 year-end, we had the six months' worth of that. But as we mentioned before, we wouldn't be able to see those benefits double in our FY 2019 because some of the other components of the Tax Reform Act that have a negative impact on us don't actually kick in until our FY 2019.","And that, we said we would still be evaluating those and we're still at that point because there's still some clarity being given on those items and so we're still working through those. Again, we said that U.S. tax reform would still be a net positive for us in 2019. But because some of those negative items don't kick in until July 1, we're still evaluating those too.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question?","Operator","Next question is from Glen Santangelo in Deutsche Bank.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, yeah. Thanks, and good morning. Mike, I just want to follow up on some of the comments that you made with respect to the new management is sort of working with the board to take a comprehensive look across the businesses. And I know you probably don't want to go into too much detail there, but I'm trying to get a better sense, are you assessing whether you think maybe you need to add more pieces to try to make what you have work a little bit better? Or are you trying to more single that maybe you need to do a full blown evaluation of everything that you do have and maybe start considering shedding some pieces? So any additional elaboration there would be helpful.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Actually, don't see it as either one of those. First of all, I think the change in management, for us, we really feel lucky that we were able to take Jon Giacomin who has a tremendous track record as our leader on our Pharmaceutical segment and someone I've worked with a long time, and actually has a lot of knowledge of the Medical business based on some of his prior history within Cardinal, or outside of Cardinal and within Cardinal. So John has been moved over to be CEO of the segment and he'll bring a very disciplined and focused approach to what all we're doing there.","And then we changed out the leader of the Cordis business with someone who was actually running our Asia-Pac business within Cordis, which was doing incredibly well. He's a very seasoned leader, knowledgeable of the business, has a good track record with the business, and is a guy that we have a lot of faith in. So as far as leadership changes, we've made those two initially and we'll continue to add some talent in the Medical segment in some areas that we think could be beneficial.","We actually feel really good about our portfolio in Medical. What we're disappointed on is really just our execution in a few areas, again particularly and primarily related to Cordis. So I don't really see an absolute need to add pieces. I think in the future we still completely believe in the strategy of having a product business on top of a distribution business.","And after we get a chance to absorb the Patient Recovery acquisition and get the Cordis business back on a growth trajectory, we'll continue to look at more pieces. But I don't think we need to have those. And at this point in time, we're always going to be evaluating our entire portfolio but there's nothing sticking out to me that there's something that we need to shed in order to be able to operate effectively going forward.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And maybe just one quick follow up on generic pricing. I mean, it felt like through the winter months maybe we were starting to see some of that generic price deflation abate somewhat. Now you're kind of signaling maybe it's getting a little bit worse. And so could you maybe just give us a sense for maybe what we saw through the winter months and what we're seeing now? And do you expect that this is going to translate into any additional sell side pricing pressure? And I guess I'm kind of curious also, why do you guys disclose so much about generic pricing? Aren't you just signaling to your customers that they should be asking for greater discounts?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I think \u2013 look we always have to balance what we try to disclose to be helpful to you guys as while as what's a competitive situation. But what we're really saying is we're not at all saying that we think it's deteriorating. In fact, what we're seeing is that it is moderating from last year and sequentially from the last quarter. So all we're saying is that originally when we looked at our point to point number, we expected to finish in the mid-single digits down from point to point. And as we look at it, we think it might be slightly worse than that from that point-to-point, but still better sequentially and versus the prior year. And so we continue to see it moderate. So we aren't seeing \u2013 and I wouldn't characterize it as seeing it more aggressive, necessarily, pricing in the market. We just didn't \u2013 it's just not moderating as much as we originally thought it might. Next question, please.","Operator","Next question from Michael Cherny in Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, team, and thanks for all the color so far. I just wanted to follow up on the customer repricing commentary you had relative to 2019. You mentioned the Optum expansion, some of the customer initiatives. As you think about heading into 2019 and the moving pieces of your business, is Optum the only pressure you see relative to customer repricing, or how you think about the rest of the business in terms of what could pressure into 2019? Broadly speaking, I don't know if you can give an exact number, but just maybe give some qualitative comments about how you see that shaking out over the next year.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Obviously, we can't go into any customer details, but I'll try to be helpful here. Optum is clearly one of them and Optum is one of our largest customers and we're excited to renew and expand our relationship with them. We also have repriced some of our other customers during this year. And so as you can imagine from our budget process, roll in the impact year-over-year for that. And as we looked out at our contract expirations over the next 12 to 18 months, we also take a look at those to understand the timing of when some of those customers may reprice and build all of that in. So that's what we take into account to do that and we do expect that to be something that we have a larger maybe portion than normal to do next year and that's why those customer repricings are significant for us.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. I'll jump back into the queue. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Michael. Next question.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","Next question from Robert Jones in Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Hey, thanks for the questions. Mike, just wanted to get a little bit of a better understanding of the size and scope of the Cordis issue. Obviously there's been several revisions along the way around the business. You guys have given a lot of commentary this morning on it. But if I just look at the performance in Medical in the quarter, I'm curious if Cordis is actually profitable today as we look at 3Q. And then you talked about getting back to profitable growth by the end of fiscal 2019. I'm just wondering if you could share some more specificity around what steps you need to take in order to get the business back to profitable growth by the end of next fiscal year.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Couple things. First of all, I would say inventory reserves are one of the biggest issues we're having. As we came off the TSAs and have been working through this, our ability to be able to understand all of the demand signals, roll those demand signals up, turn those into manufacturing plans and then correspondingly having visibility to both the consigned inventory as well as our own inventory across our network on Cordis, particularly outside the U.S. It's obviously much easier for us in the U.S. but outside the U.S. has been much more difficult than we expected it to be.","As we said in prior quarters, we said we would be rolling out some IT projects and solutions. We rolled one of those out in this past quarter which started giving us more visibility to our inventory and as you might expect, as we rolled that out, that visibility pointed out to us that we had some inventory that needed to be reserved against due to excess amounts in certain parts of the world. So that drove some inventory write-offs that we had and we're going to be rolling out some further detail IT systems to give us more clarity. And so we believe that we're going to be working through some challenges and getting our inventory at the right levels in the right spots in order to \u2013 and that's probably going to create \u2013 has and probably will create some inventory reserve challenges.","Second of all, when you don't have as good of demand signals, it's hard to run your manufacturing plants as efficiently as you would like to and so that's been a challenge for us on our cost side. And so as we get better visibility into that, we'll be able to do the types of things we need to do in our manufacturing plant to reduce cost.","And lastly, setting up the ex-U.S or O-U.S. cost structure related to the commercial organization and the other pieces has been more costly than we anticipated. And we so far have been erring to doing everything we need to do to support our sales team so we don't have any impact on our top line. And that has caused us to have more expenses than we expected to, again, particularly outside the U.S. where 70% of Cordis' business are. So that's the big things that are causing it. And as you can imagine, we have work plans on each one of those to get after those in order to get us back on track for profitable growth at the end of 2019.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, I appreciate all that Mike. And just one quick follow up on your repricing comments as a headwind to 2019. I'm just wondering, is that normal course of business as you re-up important customers like Optum, or is that something incremental to what you've been seeing in the market?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, I would say it's more normal course of business. We operate in a very competitive environment. And while we have great relationships with our customers, they're always looking for us to be able to provide some additional value to them. But this is nothing where we're seeing necessarily different pricing in the market or competitive nature than we have in the past. We just have a large share of repricings ahead of us in 2019 that we're going to need to work through.","Next question, please.","Operator","Next question from Charles Rhyee in Cowen.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Yeah, hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, sorry to stay on the Medical topic here, but last quarter you guys actually posted a really good result in Medical. And if we backed out the inventory step-up charge, it would've been even better. Can you give us sort of a contrast and compare like what changed really in the last three months that \u2013 because it seemed like last quarter, things were actually going in the right direction. Maybe you can give us a sense on what reversed so much from last quarter to this one?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. It's really Cordis, is by far the biggest component of it. It is \u2013 again we rolled out that inventory system during, late in our quarter. And as we rolled up and took a look at our inventory really for the first time to be able to see it a lot more clearly across the globe, it created a large inventory write-off in the quarter that was a significant hit to our operating earnings in Medical. Exam gloves also continues to be a challenge in the quarter, but that was the biggest one with the Cordis write-off.","Then, as part of your work what you have to do is you then have to re-look at your forecast for Cordis. And what happens is when you take a look at our inventory write-offs we've had, the performance of the business, as I mentioned, the various components, and you forecast where you're going to be for the year. As Jorge gave some color on, it changed where we believe our income was going to be in various jurisdictions and that caused us to have to go back and restate what we expect the tax impact would be on Cordis. I know that's below the line, but that was what drove the tax component that also had the impact on EPS that we mentioned.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","I see. So just to be clear, what you're saying is that if you had this inventory system in place a quarter earlier, we might have seen some of these effects earlier than now?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Oh, absolutely. Had we had it in place, we probably would've seen some write-offs at that time. But it's again hard to know. You do the best you can with the visibility you had. It rolled off. Well, when the system rolled on, we got better visibility. We were able to assess in a better way what our inventory situation needed to be from the reserves.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Okay, great. Thank you.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Next question please.","Operator","Comes from Ricky Goldwasser in Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi, good morning. So I have a couple of questions on the drug distribution side. So you talk about better results in distribution and I know that you highlighted specialty in Red Oak. But it seems that there's some conflicting remarks. So if we think about Red Oak, you talked about the fact that it was a headwind to operating income in the quarter. And then you also said that performance from Red Oak then is not enough to offset deflation. So can you give a little bit kind of like context? Is it that just price deflation from manufacturers is picking up and you are not able to garner the same pricing power over them through the purchasing consortium?","And then secondly, what does that mean to sell-side pricing? Does this mean that we're seeing more price concessions that you need to give to your independent customers?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Ricky. I'm not how \u2013 as far as the comment around Red Oak being a headwind. Red Oak was absolutely not a headwind at all. Red Oak has been and continues to be a tailwind for us and we feel actually absolutely great about Red Oak. We think they continue to perform better than anyone in the market. We like our model. We like where we're going. We like our talent. No issues at all with Red Oak; continues to be a tailwind.","What I was trying to indicate was that the generic deflation within the quarter was more than the over performance of Red Oak and so just to tie that piece out.","And so in total, what we're saying that we're not seeing anything really different in the marketplace from pricing pressures from our customers or from competitors. So we don't see the environment being different than we had been expecting it to be other than we just looked at where we actually thought we would finish at June 30. And when we were looking at that, we thought that we might not be \u2013 we said we'd be down mid single digits. And we think we might be somewhere between mid-single and high-single digits. But again, still better sequentially and better than last year on where generic deflation is.","So my summary would be Red Oak's still a tailwind. Generic deflation is moderating. It's just that Red Oak is not enough itself in order to offset what we saw toward generic deflation in the quarter.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And if we step back and we think about what do you think the sustainable growth rate is for the drug distribution business?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. At this point in time we'll take a look at that and give some more color when we come out with our 2018 guidance. We still have a lot of work that would \u2013 or, I'm sorry, our 2019 guidance. We still have a lot of work to do to understand all the various components of both the Pharma and Medical segment and we'll do that and give more color in August.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question?","Operator","It comes from Lisa Gill in JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning. Mike, just I want to come back to Cordis just one last time strategically. So when we think about Cordis and the asset that it is, can you help me to understand why it's important to the portfolio? When we think about cross sell, I know there's a lot of sales outside the U.S. Is this your anchor to build out your medical supply business outside the U.S.? I just really want to understand \u2013 I understand the commitment that you're making to try to rebuild this business and everything that it's going to take on your side, but I just wanted to understand the strategic rationale for doing so.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No, thanks. Good question and I appreciate it, Lisa. I think you hit it pretty well there in the fact that when we first bought Cordis, again, we think that it fits within our ability to bundle and work with our customers to bring a total package of products that our value proposition could help them have equal or better products at lower cost.","So we think it fits well within our overall product offering to customers in the U.S. And then externally, it really helped us get a base of being able to grow and sell our products outside the United States. By being 70% of its volume outside the U. S., what that did is caused us to be able to and begin to build an ex-U.S. infrastructure. Granted, that building of that infrastructure has been more expensive than we thought. It hasn't gone as well as we thought. So we're clearly disappointed and absolutely will own up to that.","But we learned a lot from doing that and we were able to set up third party logistics companies, set up a HR processes and all those things. And we've been using that in order to put on top of that the Patient Recovery business that is outside the United States.","And so we're able to leverage off of that as well as some other moves that we've made to take back some of our other products outside the U.S. that we were going through others to be able to sell that so we can offer a lot more robust product offering outside of the United States. So I think that's a good piece of our strategy and why we still feel that's a good fit for us.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so as you evaluate that, I mean, so it's been a couple of years since you bought Cordis, about almost a year for Patient Recovery. What's your timeline where you say, yes, this is \u2013 obviously, I mean, if we see the numbers turn around then it's a yes, it's working. But do you also have a timeline of you know what? Maybe this isn't the strategy that makes sense for us. Maybe we should stay more so in the U.S. and think about maybe divesting things rather than investing in them. I think that's the big question for a lot of us is just to understand your process how you're thinking about this and what the timeline is for those types of evaluations.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Fair question. It's hard to put a specific timeline on that. It's something that we are clearly doing. I think there's various degrees too. There's also being outside the U.S. in 60 countries or are you outside the U. S. in 30 or 40 countries? So I don't think it's necessarily all in of whether you want to be outside of the U.S. or not.","It would be hard for me to imagine at this point in time not wanting to be outside the U.S. with our significant breadth of products, many of which in our Patient Recovery business as well as Cordis we think can compete effectively outside the United States.","But whether or not we need to have the breadth of 60 or 70 countries or not, that's something we're absolutely looking at at this point in time right now and whether each and every country is where we need to be. So we're going to continue to evaluate that portfolio, but feel that we have some really great products that we think can help people outside the United States as well as in the United States.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Next question,","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","From Erin Wright, Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks. I guess beyond Cordis, can you give us an update on the Medtronic integration process here? And can you speak maybe to some of the other businesses as well within the segment and naviHealth for instance and the prospects there? And then I'm curious how core is the exam gloves business to your Cordis business overall? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Great. So couple things there. Just the last piece, the exam gloves business would not be tied at all to the Cordis piece. That is just a large volume commodity type of a product that I think every distributor has to have access to and have a private label offering on in order to have a low cost alternative for it. So I think that's just one of the staple products that everybody needs to have to be a product company and distribution company.","And it's just that with the limits on availability for the product and some commodity challenges, it's creating some headwind right now, as I've mentioned in the past, because we have a lot of downstream fixed contracts that we're working through.","As far as Patient Recovery, the Medtronic acquisition of the Patient Recovery business, that continues to go well. We continue to hit our milestones. One of the things that we've done and that Jon was able to do with his leadership is he was able to tap back into the Pharma side and bring over some excellent talent from the Pharma side to help join the team on Medical.","And so Jon's done a nice job of taking a look at where we could use some various folks, bring some people over that are experts in areas like inventory management, data management and things like that to help the team. And of course we operate as one Cardinal Health. And so the Pharma team's happy to contribute whatever resources we can in order to get it right.","So, so far, that acquisition is going well. We begin to roll off of some of the TSAs in our mid to late summer and that'll be a kind of a new big checkpoint for us to make sure that goes well. But so far, we still are feeling like we're on track and hitting the milestones that we have.","As far as the other businesses that you mentioned, we're seeing really strong demand for naviHealth and our at-Home business in particularly are two that we feel really good about. We continue to see that trend of care moving more towards the home. Both of those businesses compete in that space and both are, we believe, best-in-class in that space. And so we're seeing a lot of demand not only for just core everyday services that they offer, but for folks to want to partner with them in various unique ways in order to drive volume. So we feel really good about both of those businesses as well as our portfolio of medical services businesses, freight management and others that we have that we're also seeing very nice performance from.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then could I just ask a quick one on CapEx, because it stepped down for the year. I guess should we expect a meaningful step up in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","At this point in time, that's something that, as Jorge and I look at all of our spends of capital, that CapEx, we're always going to want to make sure that we're investing appropriately in the business, but at the same time being very careful because we know what that creates in the future. And so this was more of just us over the last 60 days or so evaluating what was out there and also reprioritizing some of our focus and bandwidth on other projects that just then we did need to spend some of the capital that we had previously anticipated to spend.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Next question is from David Larsen in Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you talk a bit about the inventory management system that the Medtronic Patient Recovery business is on? Like what is your level of visibility into those products? And are we at risk of seeing a similar situation with that business line from what we're seeing with Cordis now? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. First of all, couple things. The Patient Recovery business remember is more 75% in the U.S., much smaller volumes outside the U. S. So that's first thing to know and it's actually just coming into our warehouses and part of our everyday offering. And so from an inventory visibility standpoint, very little concern on Patient Recovery.","Second thing related to Patient Recovery and our other medical products, they're not consigned inventory type of items. And so that creates a different level of inventory visibility challenges that we don't have in Patient Recovery.","As far as Cordis goes, I would say that we still have additional levels of inventory visibility that we would like to see. But we are going to \u2013 we feel a lot better where we are today, as you can imagine, by having the visibility that we got. The biggest area of challenge that we have is not so much in our own systems to seeing inventory visibility. It's in our consigned inventory. And so that's really where we have to take it to the next level is around the consigned inventory to get better visibility there to make sure we don't have any additional write-off concerns in that part.","One other thing I would say too is that back to the Patient Recovery in general, those products don't have expiration dates where the Cordis products do have expiration dates and that's what's creating some of the inventory challenges. It's not just that you have over inventory potentially, but if you have some that are expiring, you're going to need to reserve those.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And that's helpful. Thank you. And then for the $0.16 of client investments that you've been planning on and opioids for fiscal 2018, have those occurred yet or not? Will they occur in 4Q or will they push into fiscal 2019? And then are those recurring in nature? Like will we see those continue indefinitely? Thanks.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Dave, I'll take that question. So as we indicated before in the second half of fiscal 2018, we've accounted for about $0.08 related to customer investments. And with the Optum repricing, with the Optum extension, we have utilized probably half of that, most of it in Q4. We continue to look at all opportunities to expand relationships with our customers. And as it relates to how we should think about that going forward, I think that Mike alluded to our expectations going forward, especially in 2019 as it relates to the normal cycle of renewals of certain customers in 2019.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","And as far as the rest of the $0.16, the other $0.08, the tax component, we talk about that part has basically been spent. And then the piece of opioid as we said would be moved back into our second half. So we saw some spend in Q3 and would expect the rest of the spend to happen in Q4. So really the vast majority of the $0.16 did get spent in \u2013 will get spent this year other than a portion of the customer initiatives.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Operator","Next question from John Kreger in William Blair.","Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Courtney Owens on for John Kreger. So I notice you just called out some of the differences from an inventory perspective between Patient Recovery and Cordis. But just kind of outside of that we're just trying to see what's significantly different about the Patient Recovery business in the sense that like what have you learned since your integration with Cordis to avoid some of the issues that you're seeing with Cordis right now as it relates to the Patient Recovery business? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. A couple things. Again back to the inventory. This nature of having inventory with expiration dates, the fact that it's consigned inventory in Cordis versus not consigned in Patient Recovery. I think we clearly underestimated the needs and requirements of being able to have inventory visibility at a deeper level than we anticipate or understood that we would have through that process.","So while that's a learning for us in Cordis, it's not a big deal, as we said, for Patient Recovery because it's not as much U.S. and it doesn't have \u2013 or it's not much outside U.S and it doesn't have expiration dates. So while it's a learning, I would say that's not one that's a hugely valuable one to us for Patient Recovery.","I think the areas where we really had some learnings was around estimating what our cost structure would be. When we came out with Cordis early on in our quarter and recently we've been saying that we underestimated what our costs would be stand up the ex-U.S. infrastructure and to work through all of that. And we knew that going into Patient Recovery which we've now have since end of July of this past year, and so we estimated our costs, we were much more realistic about setting those up and understanding what it would be to do that. But I think that's probably the biggest one is understanding what it would take to do it.","The good news too is by already having established relationships with third-party logistics companies, setting up some of the infrastructure, again, outside the U.S., we were able to leverage that same infrastructure and so some of the learnings around how to contract and what we need from those service providers also was helpful.","Courtney Owens - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Next question from George Hill in RBC.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. First is a housekeeping question for Jorge. With the Optum renewal, is there a prior period adjustment retroactive that impacts Q4 that artificially weighs on results?","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No. There's no retroactive adjustment there. We just signed the agreement and the accounting and the economic impact is all prospective.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then like I guess I'm going to hit Cordis one more time. If you bucket the three challenges, one I'll call operational, two I'll call competitive, three I'll call kind of end market challenges, as we look out to 2019, I guess can you rank order the challenges? It sounds like most of them are operational which you guys should be able to fix. I guess I would just ask you to address the other two because we've talked a lot about the inventory system. I guess talk about the market and talk about competitive as it relates to the outlook for that business.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Obviously it is a competitive marketplace but we feel good about our ability to compete in the marketplace. And then one of the things that we're doing that I think is helping our competitiveness in the marketplace, besides some of the great work Jon and team are doing around the commercial structure, our ability to bundle with other products, our ability and training with our sales reps, is also by adding to the portfolio so we have more in the bag.","And as I mentioned, our addition of a drug-eluting stent has been an important component of our commercial competitive ability to compete going forward. And we feel really good about the quality and the acceptance of that stent and expect that to be something that we would see growing going forward. And we're actively working with other players out there to look at other products that we can add to our bag in a very capital efficient way by partnering with folks to bring them in. So I like our competitive positioning. And part of where that's indicative is this is a business that historically had not grown in a long, long time. And so far year to date, we are seeing growth year over year in our top line.","So where I get encouraged is we're seeing a top line that is \u2013 while we still think there's opportunities to grow more and do some things, we're seeing it actually grow year over year which is different than history. We're seeing a bag that's expanding. We just haven't been able to turn it through to a drop through to the bottom line because of the inventory reserves and the operational issues that we have.","So for me, clearly it's the operational issues that are the biggest concern. And I think we have the right folks and the right plans in place. It's going to take some time because we don't want to do anything rash that would hurt our momentum on the top line. But the team is very focused with detailed work plans, metrics and timelines to get after getting this business back on track.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And if I could just maybe sneak in a third one real quick for Jorge. Jorge, just what volume levels do we need to see in generics given the depreciation that we're seeing in generics? What kind of volume growth do we need to see to grow EBIT in that segment? Thanks.","Jorge M. Gomez - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Well that is a level of detail that we normally don't get into. And as we have discussed a number of times, there is a lot of variables that come together to generate growth when you think about ASP, units, Red Oak. So we look at the totality of all those variables when we try to estimate the growth. So there's multiple combinations of all of those variables that result in either growth or decline.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Next question please.","Operator","Comes from Brian Tanquilut in Jefferies.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a quick question. As we think about generic pricing and your qualitative comments about FY 2019 EPS, what are your views on or thoughts on where that trends? Or what assumption are you making as you made those comments on EPS growth? And also how would you characterize generic inflation expectations today versus 2016 calendar?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take a stab at that. I think a couple things. We're not ready to give any specifics around 2019 at this time and where we would expect it to be. Right now we would assume that we'd continue to see deflation. But at what level, it's still something we're evaluating. Again, what I can emphasize is that what we've seen versus last year and what we've seen sequentially, we have seen generic deflation moderating. But as Jorge said, not only within generics do you have to understand all the various components, but when you're repricing and thinking through deals with customers, you have all of the components to take into account which would be branded mix, generic mix, specialty mix and all of those as we reprice.","And so I think one of the things that we need to do and we are continuing to do is assess the overall on all the buckets within our customer go to market strategies and pricing in order to manage our profitability appropriately going forward and drive growth.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","And Mike just a follow-up to that. As we think about your repricings, are you seeing any ability to increase compliance rate requirements? Or what kind of leverage do you have in these contract negotiations as to your price?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, it really depends on the customer. As you know, some customers are already buying 100% of their product from us. And so it's obviously then hard to take that up above that, but we do have other customers that aren't buying all their generics from us. And as you can imagine, any time we go to work with a customer, we look at all of the components that they could buy from us including consumer health, brand and generics and look to partner with them so that if they would like to see a price decrease, what can they give us in terms of additional volume that might help offset some of the impact that we feel?","So we continue to see that as an opportunity for us to penetrate not only in generics, but in other areas like consumer health. We'll continue to push on that. And I would say typically in most contracts on renewals, we do tend to see improved penetration of generics and oftentimes private label and other products.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, next question.","Operator","Comes from Eric Percher in Nephron Research.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. I may stay on generics because I have a feeling the stocks will react to the commentary today. I want to make sure I understand. There was a comment that there was a negative impact from generic program performance. I know later you said that your expectation was for substantial improvement. You didn't quite see that but you did see improvement this year. I know you also said that Red Oak was strong. So I just want to come back to that simple comment about negative impact from generic program performance and was that just relative to your expectation for the year?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, that was relative to our expectation for the year that when we put together what we are seeing in generic deflation which, as you said was moderating but not moderating quite as much as we expected, Red Oak's over performance, then all the combination of wins, losses, penetration, et cetera, generic launches. When we put that all together, the net impact of that is that our generic programs was net negative but again, still better than we expected it to be.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, thanks.","Lisa Capodici - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Steven Valiquette in Barclays.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning, Mike and Jorge. My line dropped earlier so thanks for fitting me back in here. Just on the topic around the FY 2018 guidance around generic price deflation, obviously your guidance is sell-side based. But if we do focus on the buy-side generic pricing for a moment, is there any update on the whole discussion around the generic manufacturer portfolio rationalization and whether that's creating any changes in pricing trend so far in calendar 2018? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. I wouldn't say that we've seen any material impact yet from that. We have \u2013 as you can imagine, the Red Oak team leads all of those discussions for us and again, glad we have such a talented group up there to be able to do that for us. They constantly are working with manufacturers and we want to work with manufacturers. And we understand some may need or want to discontinue certain lines.","We work with them on the timing and at the same time, knowing that we're focused on getting the best everyday cost possible, we'll look for other folks to maybe put them back into those products if we need to in order to make sure we're maintaining the cost. So at this point in time I would say we're not really seeing any material impact. And going forward, I feel like with Red Oak, both its talent and its game plan, we feel like we're positioned well to compete in an environment and still be effective at getting after cost, even as manufacturers look at reducing their overall product lines.","Steve J. Valiquette - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So it sounds like if deflation is moderating, that's not really the driver of it. It's basically other factors within the overall generic portfolio.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","I think from us, the deflation component again goes back to the sell side. So that's more based on the competitive environment. As far as Red Oak being able to get after cost and find better cost for us, it's not seemed so far impacting their ability to go \u2013 continue to lower and drive lower cost for us. Thanks for the question.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","All right. So I just want to thank everybody for taking the time to get on the call today. We gave you a lot of information today to digest. We hope you found it helpful. And Jorge and I and the IR team look forward to talking to many of you today and over the next coming days. Take care, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. And this will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation ladies and gentlemen.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Sally Curley, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Sally Curley","Thank you, Kerry, and welcome to Cardinal Health's earnings conference call this morning. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to the SEC filings in the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of the presentation found on the Investor page of our website for a description of those risks and uncertainties.","In addition, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, and information about these measures is included at the end of the slides. I'd also like to take the time this morning to remind you of a few upcoming investment conferences and events. We will be attending one-on-one meetings at the Citigroup Global Healthcare Conference on February 25 and the RBC Global Healthcare Conference on February 26, which are both in New York, and on March 3 at the Cowen Annual Healthcare Conference in Boston. In addition, we will be webcasting our presentations at the Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference on March 4 in Orlando, Florida, and at the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference on March 13 in Miami, Florida. Details for the 2 webcasts and events are or will be posted in the IR section of our website at cardinalhealth.com, so please make sure to visit the site often for updated information. We look forward to seeing you at an upcoming event.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett","Thanks, Sally, and good morning to everyone. We had a very strong second quarter operating performance, closing out an excellent first half to our fiscal 2014, so let's get started.","Total revenues for the second quarter were approximately $22 billion. The decline was 12%, as our revenue line no longer included any sales from the Walgreens supply agreement. Net of this, we experienced growth with existing customers and contribution from the business.","We achieved a very solid increase in our non-GAAP operating earnings. In a quarter where we felt the full impact of no longer serving Walgreens, we were able to achieve a 10% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings. Our gross margin rate expanded by 120 basis points to 6% in the quarter from 4.8% last year, and our gross margin dollars increased by 10%. I will note here that we achieved strong margin expansion and operating profit increases in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical segments.","Our second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.90, down from $0.93 last year. This decline, however, includes a charge of $0.16 per share related to a tax reserve. We had mentioned this on our first quarter call and said that it could occur as early as second quarter. As you may recall, our first quarter EPS had an $0.18 benefit from the resolution of some historical tax matter. Note that for the first half of our fiscal 2014, non-GAAP EPS stands at $2.00, an increase of 15% versus last year after the puts and takes of those discrete tax adjustments. So based on our year-to-date result and the strength of our operating performance, we are now raising our guidance to a new range of $3.75 to $3.85 for fiscal 2014 non-GAAP EPS.","Before we talk about the segments in more detail, let me take just a few minutes to discuss our joint venture with CVS Caremark, which we announced in December. You may remember that during our last earnings conference call, I talked about some of the changes in our marketplace and noted that we had been evaluating and would continue to evaluate all options to sustain and expand our competitive advantage and to deliver meaningful and lasting values for our customers and our supplier partners and our shareholder. We believe that the CVS Caremark joint venture accomplishes those objectives. We created a purchasing combination of tremendous scale, which we know is critical in generic. It allows us to bring together 2 of the most knowledgeable and experienced generic-sourcing teams in the world. The 50-50 venture is structurally straightforward. We're not changing the service model or our operating platform. The venture is focused solely on global sourcing for the U.S. market. It allows our 2 companies to pursue our independent strategies to serve our own distinct customers as we see fit, and we will accomplish this while maintaining the capital flexibility to continue to invest in other growth and high-return alternatives.","We believe there will be opportunities to work strategically and collaboratively with our generic manufacturer partners to explore new ways to create value. Finally, as we announced in December, our teams are hard at work with the goal of being operational as early as July.","Now, onto the segments. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered solid profit growth of 9% on a revenue decline of 15%. We were pleased to see this strong volume growth from new and existing customers. Our segment margin expanded by 54 basis points, driven by the strength of both generic and branded programs and by the product and customer mix initiatives that have been an important part of our strategy for the past few years.","I'd like to take a moment to discuss our presence in retail pharmacy. Of course, we were very excited to announce the extension of the CVS service agreement for an additional 3 years through June of 2019. We remain deeply committed to retail pharmacy. Whether that is delivered through a chain drug, a food and drug retailer or one of our thousands of independent pharmacy customers, we believe that pharmacy must and will play a more vital role in the delivery of health care. With this in mind, we will continue to deliver best-in-class products and services to ensure that our pharmacy customers can serve this valuable role in an evolving health care system.","Our Specialty Solutions team continues to deliver robust growth, validating our perspective that working at the intersection of the provider, biopharmaceutical manufacturer and payer will be important for the future. Over these past 3 years, it has been important for us to build scale in specialty distribution in order to enable greater touch points with clinicians. Now that we've achieved critical mass and through building out more services, operational and clinical, to serve these providers, we are beginning to realize some of the benefits. At the same time, our Specialty Solutions team has been gaining momentum with our biopharmaceutical partner. We are increasingly able to offer the innovative clinical capabilities these manufacturers require to serve patients who often have distinct needs and, at the same time, navigate a complex reimbursement environment. And we've created the teams and made the moves to build a best-in-class, patient-centric hub, serving the needs of patients and reinforcing the work of our manufacturer partners.","Finally, on Specialty, we're seeing an increasing interest among payers who want to see better alignment in the system to improve cost-effectiveness.","Our Medical segment performance was strong. Revenue was up 13% to $2.8 billion, and segment profit increased 40%. The largest contributor to that growth came from our AssuraMed acquisition, the centerpiece of our strategy to serve patients in the home. Although acute-care utilization remains somewhat soft, we experienced growth in our existing customer base and increased penetration in our targeted strategic accounts [ph]. Our ability to provide new service offerings is extremely important, as our customers take on new configurations and experience different economic and regulatory forces. Building our preferred products portfolio remains a top priority and a high priority for our customer. Our ability to grow here addresses an important pain point for our customers, hospitals and ambulatory, and we are committed to providing a comprehensive solution set, and this goes beyond the products and includes services and analytics. Customer response has been strong, and we will continue to add to our growing portfolio of clinical alternatives to mature medical devices.","Our medical consumables line continues to gain solid traction. Our product launch rate in the first 6 months of fiscal 2014 was considerably higher than we've ever had. We're moving quickly to add high-quality, high-value options for the customer. Looking forward, we believe we can increase our medical consumable penetration in nontraditional medical channels, such as home health and long-term care.","As we look to home health, AssuraMed reported a very solid quarter, again, outperforming our ideal [ph] model. We remain very committed to following the patient to the home. The demographics are inescapable and the cost-effectiveness of keeping patients well cared for in the home is hard to dispute. To help support our strategy of serving patients in the home, during this past quarter, we made 2 tuck-in acquisitions in the urology, incontinence and ostomy care area, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to draw on the strength of this platform.","Turning to China. We had another quarter of very strong growth on both the revenue and profit line. The sales run rate for this business is now approximately $2.5 billion, and we feel very optimistic about its growth.","China is a unique market going through a very rapid evolution. We continue to play out our strategy here of enlarging our geographic footprint, creating new business partnership and bringing our expertise to new opportunities such as direct-to-patient. We finished the quarter with 28 direct-to-patient or DTP specialty pharmacies, as we move toward our goal of at least 50 across the country, an example of an innovative health care solution to delivering high-cost specialty drug to the patient's hand. We also completed the acquisition of a specialty retail pharmacy company during the quarter that, combined with our existing retail pharmacies, gives us national coverage and e-commerce capabilities. We will continue to expand this chronic care work with a focus on very disease-centric patient support models.","Let me conclude by saying that this is a period of extraordinary change for health care and for Cardinal Health. It's uncommon to experience a moment like this, a moment which requires those of us who have the privilege and the responsibility of being in health care, to demonstrate our ability to innovate and to evolve in a way which can move us toward a system which is higher quality and more cost-effective. I thank our people for demonstrating the readiness to step up to that challenge and for their fine performance.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George, and hello, everyone. This morning, I'll be reviewing the drivers of second quarter performance and will provide additional detail on the full year, including our decision to raise our fiscal '14 guidance range. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported a 10% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings in our fiscal '14 second quarter versus the prior-year period, driven by margin expansion across both of our reporting segments. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 outperformed our expectations, but were slightly down compared to the prior-year period. This decline was driven by an anticipated discrete tax charge of $56 million based on proposed assessments of additional tax. This unusual $0.16 per share unfavorable impact was triggered in Q2 and mostly offset the favorable tax settlement gain of $0.18 per share in Q1 of this year. Including this unfavorable impact, Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share grew a robust 14%, a great quarter of growth. Again, to be clear, both the Q1 positive $0.18 tax benefit and this Q2 $0.16 tax charge essentially offset each other and both have been contemplated in our guidance since the beginning of the year. We mentioned this in our Q1 call.","I'll now go through the rest of the income statement in a little bit more detail, starting with revenue. Consolidated sales were down 12% to $22.2 billion, which was better than we expected. The decline was due to the expiration of the Walgreens contract, which was partially offset by sales growth from new and existing customers. Gross margin dollars increased 10% to 6% of revenue, with the rate up a strong 120 basis points versus prior year. This continues our 3.5-year trend of margin expansion.","SG&A expenses rose 10% in Q2, primarily driven by acquisitions, including AssuraMed, as well as increase in incremental incentive compensation accruals related to the company's over-performance. Our core SG&A was essentially flat year-over-year, evidence of our enterprise-wide commitment to controlling costs and improving the efficiency of our operations while continuing to invest in our key strategic priority.","Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 52 basis points to 2.6%. We have now posted operating margins greater than 2% in 4 of the last 5 quarters, and we are making progress towards our longer-term aspiration of consolidated non-GAAP operating margin greater than 3%. You'll notice that our net interest and other expense came in $4 million higher in Q2 than in the prior year's quarter. This was mostly due to the new $1.3 billion of debt we issued in February of last year associated with the AssuraMed acquisition. Non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 43.3% versus the prior year's 36.8%. This unusually higher rate was primarily driven by the discrete $56 million tax charge I mentioned earlier. Please note that this amount only affects our tax line and has no impact on operating earnings or the segment results. As I had mentioned previously, we anticipate both a positive tax impact in the first quarter and the Q2 unfavorable impact when we originally provided our FY '14 tax guidance range. I'll speak about update in that range in a moment.","Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 346.2 million for the second quarter, which is about 3 million shares higher than last year. Fiscal year-to-date, we repurchased $50 million worth of shares, all in Q1. And at the end of December, we had $1.35 billion remaining on our board-authorized repurchase program. We'll update you on share count assumptions for the full year later in my prepared remarks.","Now, let's discuss the consolidated cash flows in the balance sheet. We generated approximately $40 million in operating cash flow in the quarter. Year-to-date, operating cash flow of almost $1 billion is about where we expect to be given the unwinding of the Walgreens contract. Of note, the net working capital component from that unwind is essentially complete. And as a reminder, there typically is a large degree of operating cash flow variability in sequential quarters.","Moving on, at the end of Q2, we had $2.7 billion in cash in our balance sheet, which includes $446 million held internationally. Our working capital days decreased versus prior year, primarily due to the expiration of the Walgreens contract.","Now let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss Pharma first.","Pharma segment revenue came in better than we expected. However, it did post a decrease of almost 15% versus the prior year period to $19.4 billion. This is the first period where we reported a full quarter of revenue loss in Walgreens, which amounts to just over $5 billion. This was partially offset by sales growth from new and existing customers.","Pharma segment profit increased by 9% to $482 million, driven by strong performance from both of our generic programs and branded agreement, including the impact of price inflation. This was partially offset by the expiration of the Walgreens contract. Unlike our first quarter, this quarter reflects the full operating earnings impact of this expiration.","I'll also note that each of our Pharma segment businesses had strong profit growth compared to the prior-year period.","With respect to generics, sales and profits from our generics programs exhibited very good year-over-year growth in the quarter. This is a result of the emphasis we have placed on building the strength of our programs over the last several years, the overall robustness of the market and the effect of price inflation. I'll also note that as anticipated, we did see less contribution from new generic launches in this year's quarter versus the prior-year period.","For the second quarter in a row, the generic deflation rate was essentially flat year-on-year. I do want to note that our generic performance this year has included what we believe to be abnormally high inflation on a relatively small basket of products. Because generic pharmaceutical pricing is still difficult to predict, we remain relatively conservative in our forecasting for this segment.","In addition, we saw strong performance under our branded pharma contract, with brand inflation in the low-double digit, which was slightly better than we expected. We also saw a few branded price increases that occurred late in our second quarter, which we had modeled to occur during our Q3. Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 54 basis points compared to the prior year's Q2.","And moving onto Medical segment performance. Medical revenue growth was up 13% versus last year. Home health, reflecting our AssuraMed acquisition, was the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. As a reminder, we will lap this acquisition in our third quarter. And given that it's becoming increasingly integrated into our operation, we will not call it out separately starting in Q4.","We also saw volume growth from our existing customer base, as we continue to focus on strategic hospital network accounts, which tend to utilize more of our products and services to drive efficiency in their supply chain. Our strategic accounts grew 7% for the period.","Medical segment profit grew a robust 40% in Q2, primarily driven by the performance of our home health platform, AssuraMed. As George said, the AssuraMed integration has done very well, and we are on-track to achieve our original estimate of at least $0.18 of non-GAAP EPS accretion for the full year. Other factors positively impacting segment profit included contribution from planned efficiency initiatives and preferred product. Partially offsetting the Medical segment profit growth was a year-over-year increase in incentive compensation, much of which is based on total company performance and allocated to the segment.","Now a quick note on Cardinal Health China, a business which spans both of our reporting segments. Our business in China, again, posted strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, up 37%, and we saw solid margin expansion.","Let me pause for a moment to comment on the overall pharma market in China, which has been experiencing some turbulence recently. Based on external estimates, it appears that the market was growing at a rate in the mid- to high-teens in the first half of calendar 2013. Due largely to the impact of some government regulatory actions to improve the integrity of the system, the growth rate dropped to high-single digits in the second half of calendar '13. However, we are starting to see some signs of recovery and forecasts point to a return to mid-teens growth in calendar '14.","Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter, which include items that reduced our GAAP results by $0.11 per share compared to non-GAAP. Included is $0.10 of amortization and acquisition-related costs. Also included in this figure are $0.02 for restructuring and employee severance and $0.02 of impairment on loss on disposals of assets. In Q2 of last year, GAAP results were $0.05 lower than non-GAAP results, primarily related to amortization and other acquisition-related costs.","Now, I'll talk briefly about guidance for the current fiscal year. Given the strong operating performance in the first half of the year and our outlook for the next 6 months, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS range to $3.75 to $3.85. We are also updating a few of our underlying corporate assumptions. First, we are increasing our anticipated diluted weighted average shares outstanding to a range of 345 million to 347 million for the year. A few reasons for this. We are forecasting a fair amount of option dilution in the second half of the fiscal year. Also, we are limited in how often we can go to market to buy back shares during the first half of the year. We still plan of repurchasing shares worth at least a couple hundred million dollars in the second half, with exact timing and amount to be determined based on the market and other factors. Given all this, we have incorporated a range of possible share count outcomes in our EPS guidance.","Second, we are reducing our interest and other assumption, but widening the range to $105 million to $130 million due to a possible gain on an investment which may impact the second half of the fiscal year.","Third, we had a slight increase in the expected amortization of intangible-related assets to approximately $184 million or about $0.34 per share, which captures a few small tuck-ins we completed in the quarter.","Lastly, we are revising the full-year expected tax rate range to 35% to 36%. The large discrete items we anticipated for the year have now been booked in the first half. We do expect a higher tax rate in the second half of fiscal '14 compared to the first half.","As we look to the second half, I wanted to point out a few other differences versus the first half of fiscal 2014. First, we had about a full quarter of earnings from Walgreens in Q1.","Second, we believe that the amount and rate of generic inflation in the first half of the year was unusually high [indiscernible] with a more moderate impact in the second half.","Third, recall that when we announced the CVS JV, we knew there would be some related costs during the second half of fiscal 2014. Finally, Q3 is typically our strongest quarter for brand inflation, and we expect that to happen again this year. However, we did see inflation on a few products in Q2 that we had modeled in Q3. That may skew our usual seasonal earnings pattern in Pharma somewhat. But most importantly, we continue to expect to build on the momentum of our strong business, and particularly our areas of strategic emphasis.","In closing, I would like to thank the Cardinal Health team for a very strong first half. Their tenacity and execution against our strategic priorities continues to pay dividend. I'm looking forward to the second half of fiscal 2014.","With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, our first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Zachary William Sopcak - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Zack in for Ricky. I wanted to start by asking about generic inflation and your assumptions for the second half. There was news last week that Ranbaxy had an import ban on one of their plants, and just curious on your thoughts on how that might impact generic inflation and if that's considered in your more modest guidance for the second half?","George S. Barrett","Yes, sure. Why don't I take it? I'll touch on, first, the general environment, and then -- and maybe a little bit more specific around Ranbaxy. So let's start with this. We've indicated and you've heard, and Jeff reiterated, that it's been a bit of an unusual stretch in pricing. We've seen price increases on a number of products, and the number is above what we have historically seen. But I'd remind you here that we carry thousands of generic products, and so when we look at this period, fewer than 5% of these products are experiencing meaningful price increases. So just again, recognize that it's a relatively small subset of the generic portfolio. It is difficult, and Jeff said this, to predict, as you look forward. I think just taking the appropriate assumption here that the recent months have been somewhat unusual and that this dynamic moderates going forward. As it relates to the Ranbaxy problems, again, this is a by-product of some work that we've seen with FDA. The FDA certainly increased its capacity to do inspections outside of the U.S. Clearly, for some companies, that has posed a challenge or a spill-in [ph] for the certain facilities. We, as you would imagine, are very careful to make sure that we stay on top of all the global supply dynamics and, in many cases, utilize multiple sources as a result. I would not say that the specific story around Ranbaxy will have any impact on our business as we look to the rest of the year and going forward. So it's -- they're a player in our mix, but one of many, and won't have any impact on us going into the rest of the year.","Zachary William Sopcak - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then just on CVS, just curious, as you've talked with current customers, what their early reaction has been now that it's been 6 weeks or so past the announcement. And if there's been any indication of more interest in purchasing generics from Cardinal due to this deal?","George S. Barrett","Sure. So why don't -- again, it's George, I'll take this again. We've actually had great support from our customers. It's been a noisy stretch, as you know, in the last year. And I think given some of that noise in the market, in many ways, it's been reassuring to our customers that we'll always be in the best position to keep them competitive. And so I would say, generally, we've had great support. I would also add that I think making sure that our joint venture was really a 50-50 relationship really told our customers or other customers that no external party would be dictating or influencing our strategy to serve them. So I would say, thus far, we've had really good support from our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess, the underlying results in Pharma continue to be better. It's hard to tease out all the components. It seems like, obviously, we talked about inflation. If you had to look at some of the other pieces that have most surprising to you, at least in the last maybe 3 or 6 months of development, obviously, China maybe is not one of them. But what parts would you say, in terms of how the team has executed, have been kind of the biggest standouts for you in terms of some of the said [ph] outperformance?","George S. Barrett","Why don't I start and then maybe I'll turn it to Jeff. So here's -- you know that we have a pretty broad portfolio. We tend to because of size of certain of our business lines talk only about 1 or 2. It's very common that, that's what happens. But reality is we have a lot of business lines. And actually, what's been happening is many of them are going well. It's one of the nice things about having a portfolio, you have some [ph] of these puts and takes. We've been getting some pretty good performance across-the-board. And so I think that, that's really largely what's at work. So as we said, on our Medical business, while utilization has been sort of stopped, our focus on key strategic accounts and on key business lines, on mix has been really helpful to us. Our team's doing great job there. On our Pharmaceutical segment, we're getting growth in specialty. Obviously, we talked about generics and our work there. And so I think it's really sort of a balance issue, but maybe I'll let Jeff jump in and provide a little more color.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, I agree [ph]. As I said in my remarks, we really had good performance across-the-board in the Pharma segment. I mean, you briefly mentioned China, Ross. And, yes, we had a very good quarter in China. Now, we expected that. We expect very big things from our China operation, and albeit it's still a relatively small contributor to the overall profit of the corporation, we do expect strong growth there, and we very much got it [ph], in spite of the fact that the market was a little turbulent in the quarter. As George said, specialty posted good revenue and profit growth in the quarter. And we're really seeing our specialty team, they've really hit critical mass in terms of distribution size. They'll take advantage of that positioning to offer other services to manufacturers and providers and payers and that's beginning to drive the profit line for them. Interestingly, we saw better-than-expected results in Nuclear as well, and our team there is doing a really good job of responding to a very tough environment. And we've seen some -- a product, in particular, do quite well for that business. So we are seeing some good trends in Nuclear as well. Yes, it was a very encouraging quarter in many respects, that we really were hitting on all cylinders in most of the business within Pharma. Likewise, on the Med side, I highlighted a few things which were really important to us. One is the continued growth and impact of our home health platform and the fact that we tried to identify some external asset that we can bolt on to that, that are very accretive to us. So that was the great sign, in addition to the growth of the underlying business there. And the overall growth of that market, which is growing, looks like somewhere in the 6% to 8% range. And then finally, the 7% growth in strategic accounts is also very important. And these are accounts, by the way, that we've identified within our portfolio as being very large networks of hospitals and ambulatory sites that tend to buy a lot of our product and services because of the complex operations, and we can provide a host of services and products to them that can help them manage those networks. And seeing 7% growth in that portfolio was also very encouraging. So lots of good news to report for the quarter.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe, you guys were able to kind of attack the whole generic sourcing question in a pretty capital-efficient manner, it leaves the balance sheet and your capital deployment capability in a pretty good place. I mean, as you see the tuck-in or midsized M&A environment today, how would you sort of characterize it versus where we were, I don't know, 3 or 6 months ago, just in terms of activity and the breadth of targets right now that are still out there for you to analyze?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I think it's a fairly attractive environment right now for the types of assets we're looking for. Particularly now that we've got a year, for example, of AssuraMed under our belt in terms of integrating that core platform into our business, our ability now, in turn, to find smaller tuck-ins that make sense to bolt-on to that platform, has increased. And as we've been looking for those assets, we're certainly pleased by what we've seen, including the 2 that we did in Q2. In China, we continue to do small tuck-ins. We completed 2 more in the second quarter, one which really gave us additional geographic expansion into a new region and the other was the one that George referenced that added to our specialty pharmacy network and gave us e-commerce capabilities. So we'll continue to pursue those types of acquisitions. I would say though, those tend to be relatively small acquisitions, but very important to building on our strategy in time. I'd say more broadly, we continue to see small to midsized assets that makes sense for the portfolio. And to the extent the price is right and the economics makes sense, we have the platforms to put them on, and we remain encouraged about those possibilities.","Operator","We'll move now to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to -- on the profit side on the Pharma business. It clearly feels like we're living in a pretty robust inflation environment on both the branded and generic side. I guess, just bigger picture, that trend would obviously seem counter to what we're seeing the push to be in overall health care today around savings. I guess, if maybe you guys separately, branded and generic, if you could talk a little bit about what do you think is driving this? Is it really more structural? Is it more circumstantial? And then, I guess, more importantly, how sustainable do you think it is in both of those areas?","George S. Barrett","Bob, it's a really good question and a hard one to answer. This is George. I'll start. But let me just offer this as a starting point in Pharma, which is sort of maybe something we forget often. In the big picture, in the United States, our Pharma spend is the smallest part of our challenge, when all said and done. By the way, that doesn't mean any individual who's got a very expensive drug that they're -- they've been prescribed doesn't have challenges, but we're talking about a small percent of our overall spend. And actually, as you know, systemically, the growth of Pharmaceutical spend has actually been slowing. So I do think part -- as you know, part of that is sort of the level of generic penetration. So from a big picture standpoint, as a health system, actually our bigger challenges are really in our medical system than in Pharmaceuticals. Now having said that, we do think that there are periods that can be a little bit more unusual. This has been sort of on the generics side probably more noteworthy. It's really difficult to predict what's going to happen, but I do think it's always worth reminding ourselves that when we look at the Pharmaceutical segment, really, what you have is a huge number of products that are generic and highly generic, meaning penetration is extraordinarily high, and then a number of typically more specialty drugs that have unique characteristics. And I think that is a trend that we'll continue to see. And so I think, in a way, I think our model, we feel very strong about the model. We're extremely efficient. We work very well with our manufacturers. I think our fee-for-service kind of system is working and is working efficiently. And so, as I said, sort of in the big picture, I think you'd have to look at Pharmaceutical system as relatively efficient across-the-board. That doesn't mean that individual products wouldn't get some attention for their pricing, and we'll just have to continue to watch for them. But I think, in general, what we've done in our assumption is moderate our expectations as it relates to inflation just a little bit more to the historical norms and we thought that's the more cautious mode [ph].","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And I guess, just George, following up on the cash position, it doesn't seem like, again, there's a ton baked in on buybacks. It doesn't seem like that will a big source of deployment, at least relative to the current outlook. I mean, is there any more insight you can share with us on your priorities without, obviously, getting too specific? Are there things on the table right now that have kept you more cautious on getting more aggressive on the buyback?","George S. Barrett","Yes, so I don't think for us it's a matter of cautious on buyback. I think we've always seen a capital deployment strategy that's very focused on returning long-term value to shareholders. So we've done that through investing in our core activities, in the dividend, in looking for acquisitions that strengthen our long-term competitive positioning, and buyback is as part of the equation. So that will still be the case. In terms of priorities, I'll let Jeff weigh in a little bit on it as well, as it relates to our priorities, again, we talked about strategic areas that we think are very important, and those are going to continue to be areas that we watch carefully. That doesn't mean there's always going to be the right acquisition opportunity there. But we've talked about generic, we've talked about specialty, we've talked about our home health and ambulatory platform, we've talked about medical consumables, we've talked about Preferred product, we've talked about China. So these are all areas for us that we believe are on the right side of where health care is going. We'll continue to invest in those. Jeff, I don't know if you want to add anything to it?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, just 2 other things, Bob. We remain very committed to a dividend. As you know, we view the dividend payout we have as being an important part of the story, in conjunction with our earnings story, and we're committed to maintaining and growing that dividend over time. And as I indicated at the Investor Day, our target is to remain in the 30% to 35% payout range for our dividend. With regards to repo, the fact that we've done relatively small amounts [indiscernible], as I mentioned $50 million in Q1, really, has nothing to do with a reticence to buy back more shares. It more had to do with timing in the first half of the year. Our inability, for a good chunk of the year, really, to enter the market because of some pending announcements, which have since been announced, by the way.","Operator","The next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, I just want to ask you about the CVS JV. I mean, I think you said in your prepared remarks that you're expecting that to sort of begin in earnest maybe on July 1. Could you kind of talk about it? If not much is changing with respect to how you buy generics today, like what has to happen over the next 6 months to prepare for that? Do you have to unwind certain generic manufacturing purchasing contracts? And if you could just elaborate on that a little bit more. And then maybe, Jeff, as we think about the fiscal '15 model, I know you don't want to comment on that today, but is it reasonable for us to start modeling the payment to CVS in fiscal '15 and maybe incorporating some cost of goods sold benefit within our fiscal '15 estimates?","George S. Barrett","So, Glen, I'll take the beginning of your question, then I'll let Jeff jump in with the second part. So actually, it's a really good question because it's a reminder of how many moving parts there are in a product -- in our product line that are thousands of product families with many, many suppliers, different length agreements and different buying models. So it -- I can't go through all the individual details, but I think the answer, Glen, is there are a million of them. And actually, it's sort of the irony, as we talk about, this is a very straightforward design, which I think it is, taking out all the operational complexity, at least logistical complexity, but just simply aligning buying strategies, policies, procedures, existing contracts and commitments, is not a small piece of work. And so we have to do that in a very efficient way. It's already underway, and we feel good about that progress. But it is a lot of moving parts, and I'm really glad that we've got 2 talented teams that know what they're doing.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Glenn, it's Jeff. On the question about payment, at the risk of confusing a lot of people, let me try to explain how that's going to roll out because it's not -- the actual accounting for the payment is not as straightforward as the actual cash flow. So as you know, we are committed to a payment of $25 million a quarter to CVS starting with the beginning of the joint venture and continuing for a period of 10 years, and that's a fixed $25 million payment each quarter. However, the actual accounting for that payment is more of an amortization over time and reflects accrued interest, et cetera. So the actual amount you'll see, particularly in the early quarters, will be slightly higher than the $25 million payment and, really, that's because of the way the payment gets discounted and accrued interest grows out over time. The second point I'll say is that depending on when all the final documentation gets completed with CVS, if that happens this year, we'll actually start amortizing that payment as early as this year, and we expect that to begin as early as the beginning of Q4. Again, hopefully, I haven't confused everyone too much on that. With regards to your second question regarding benefit, we did say at our Investor Day that we expect the JV to be accretive to us in our fiscal '15. We continue to stand by that, which means that the benefits we would expect from the JV would more than offset the accounting of the payments next year. And as I said, the accounting of those payments next year will be slightly more than $25 million a quarter. So that gives you a rough idea, sort of our minimum expectations for the benefits next year. We also do expect that they will phase in over time. If the JV starts on July 1, we definitely wouldn't expect all the benefits to start on July 1. It'll take a good part of a year for us to really ramp up to what I would describe as the more full run rate.","George S. Barrett","Let me just add again, with all the millions of moving parts we just described, we are really excited about this. I think we really know that the U.S. is the largest generic market in the world. It's a single market, it's got secured and known financing systems, incredibly important to manufacturers. And so I'm really excited about being able to put these 2 teams together to do work in this environment. And we think it's going to create great opportunities for us and for our customers and for our manufacturers, so we're excited about it.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, maybe if I can just ask one follow-up question on AssuraMed. In your prepared remarks, you seem to suggest that the deal is sort of outperforming your original deal model. I was wondering if you could elaborate like where's the source of upside coming from? And then, Jeff, as sort of we think about the outperformance in the quarter, I think we're all trying to sort of figure out where the incremental benefit's coming from, like how would you stack the potential outperformance of AssuraMed on the current quarter and the decision to raise the guidance for fiscal '14?","George S. Barrett","So, Glen, I'll start. Here's what I would say about -- if you remember, when we acquired AssuraMed, we told you that, essentially, it has 2 components. One is basically a B2B business and one is more of a B2C part of the business. The part that we're seeing more dramatic uptake is in the B2C side. And so we expected that, systemically, this would be an area of growth. We think that their demographics are clear, that more patients will be treated in the home. And then as you also know, hospitals will be penalized for readmissions. And so I do think that we expect sort of systemic growth here. We also believe that we have a certain kind of scale, a tremendous sort of billing capabilities, a very high-touch model and that we're an attractive referral here. So what's happening is we're getting perfect [ph] referrals from physicians, from payers that's driving that business, and I think our high-touch model really worked. So I think that's the part of the business that I would say has been driving it and probably outperforming.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","So Glen, just continuing on that, just going through the various elements of the business. On the Medical side, I would say, as we said, the AssuraMed has outperformed our original view of expectations and it continues to grow very well. But I wouldn't necessarily say it was the biggest surprise in the quarter. We expected it to do well, and it delivered on that. Elsewhere on the Med side, I think the growth of our strategic accounts has been a very positive surprise for us. We've invested a lot in those accounts in terms of products and services, and we expected good things. But I think we've seen some growth that is even above what we would've expected, so that was great to see. On the Pharma side, I would say there were 4 or 5 areas that performed better than we expected in Q2. Generic inflation was better as we alluded to. The core performance of the generics portfolio was better than we expected. Brand inflation was a little bit better than we expected. And both specialty and Nuclear outperformed our expectations in Q2. So I hope you can understand why we're pretty excited about the quarter. We saw a lot of very good results across-the-board. It's probably driven by the environment, granted, but a lot also driven by just the strong performance of our organization.","Operator","We'll now move to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe just staying with the Medical for a second here, obviously we've talked a lot about AssuraMed, can you talk about how we're doing with Preferred products, and was that a big contributor in the growth in the strategic accounts? And then really, where do we think we're going here in terms of the pipeline of products in terms of sort of what type of technology are we going after at this point?","George S. Barrett","So again, I'll start, Charles. Yes, I would say the preferred product portfolio is going really well. I mentioned that our first 6 months was an extremely high run rate relative to anything we've done historically. Again, with, again, that typically sort of had their waves of product, and we had to sort of map that through the year. We expected good performance, and thankfully, our teams are really executing on that. I think this is really, as I said earlier, it's a pain point for customers -- for our customers. They have enormously high spend in sort of the complexity of their supply -- number of -- of products that they carry, and, essentially, helping them build a formula that's more efficient is really an opportunity for them. So this is sort of that classic win-win situation where we believe that we can move share from manufacturers, whether that's our own product or someone else's. We, because we move share, we capture some of the margin and we can create value for our customers downstream, and that's sort of the key to it. It's going well. I'm not sure it's the sole explanation for why our strategic accounts are doing well. I think that's sort of a combination of things. I think we've identified complex systems who have complex needs. They're no longer, for example, simply a hospital and maybe a clinic. They're now multiple hospitals with multiple clinics and cancer centers and surgery centers and maybe affiliated doctors' offices, and I think they're increasingly looking for companies that have the tools to sort of be a solution provider and help them deal with very changing environment. I think that's been at the heart of it. I think our team has identified those kinds of customers with those distinct needs. And I think that's allowed us to do a better job of serving them. And we're going to work really hard to continue to provide new services and offerings that allow them to compete in a rapidly changing environment. Jeff, anything to add there?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, I would say Preferred products were a driver of dollar growth in the quarter. And I think what was also very exciting was the continued increase we're seeing of Preferred products in our overall portfolio as a percent of gross margin. As you may recall at our Investor Day, Don Casey indicated that our target was to get the Preferred products to at least mid-40s%, 45% as a percent of gross profit for the segment by fiscal '17. And for reference, he gave a historical number, which was in the mid-30%s. Actually, in our Q2, I would describe that percentage mid- to upper-30%s. So we've already seen a tick up, and we expect to continue that trend over the next couple of years as we achieve our target. So yes, there are a lot of things that are driving the overall net margin expansion in Med. Obviously, the growth of the home health platform, the growth of strategic accounts and Preferred products were all important drivers of that very impressive margin rate increase in the quarter.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","In terms of the Preferred products, I mean, in terms of the type of products you're doing, I know you're talking about like -- you've talked in the past, in the trauma kit. I don't know, you've kind of touched on it in the past here and there. Any potential to sort of move up the technology ladder, or is that something to think about in the future?","George S. Barrett","Yes. So this really relates, I think, in many ways to the sort of what we think of as the physician preference items. We've started -- if there's a spectrum: at one end being products that are extremely highly clinically differentiated; then the other end, products that tend to be really not clinically differentiated. We've sort of focused on the lower end, and I think that makes sense as we're sort of building presence and building credibility in the market with this program. So trauma was a very smart place for us to start. There's a huge amount of interest from our customers, and we're working there up the Ortho line. Wound management is another area that we've been working on. So we are carefully analyzing every line with this question of where -- how much clinical differentiation exists in a given product line and where does it not exist. And I think that's allowed us to start to build sort of a strategy of moving along that spectrum. And we're still at the sort of early end of that. But I'm very excited about it. I think our customers will see a big opportunity if we can continue to execute.","Operator","We'll move now to Tom Gallucci with FBR Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I guess, just one set of housekeeping item and then another sort of follow up on some other questions that you've already answered. Just, you mentioned the pull-forward of a little brand and price inflation from what you expected in the March quarter. Can you frame at all what we're talking about there, roughly speaking, Jeff?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","It was probably worth a couple of pennies of earnings shift, Tom.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess, you mentioned a few different times the better growth of your strategic customers on the med-surg side. And I think, George, a question or 2 ago, you started to get into a little bit of what you're doing there, can you just get a little bit more granular? I'm curious about the types of services that you're starting to offer there incrementally to some of these types of accounts? Is it a matter of -- is there buying physicians and you can also service physicians? Or just the mix of things that you're doing would be helpful.","George S. Barrett","Yes. Sure, Tom. I mean, this is, again, it's a bit of a long story, so I'll try to summarize it. So obviously, we can provide the traditional medical\/surgical supplies that we've always been able to do. We also can support them both in their acute-care centers and in their ambulatory centers within a line of products that includes surgical kits. We can do freight management. We can do RFID tagging. We do consulting on operational excellence. We do what we call ValueLink, which is essentially where we actually stage all the materials in our warehouses, so it's a purely, truly just-in-time system. So I think we can tell them, we can serve both your acute-care centers, we can serve your oncology clinic, we can serve your physicians' offices. So it's a combination of lines of business and touch points across what is an increasingly complex system, the entire continuum. And in many cases, we can follow that patient to the home. And so that's the overall picture. And I think the more the system integrates, the more complexity is introduced into it, the more that plays to our ability to say, \"I think we can provide some solutions to deal with this complexity.\"","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Right. And you're clearly gaining business with existing customers. Are you winning new customers of this nature as well, given the breadth of product that you can offer?","George S. Barrett","I would say -- I don't know that there has been a monumental change in market share. I think we're doing a really good job with our key customers. I think we've done some segmentation to know who's likely to be a winner and most likely to be able to draw on the tools that we bring. There's always some movement up and down of customers back and forth. But I don't think there's been huge share swings as much as it's been our ability to drive value for existing customers as they change their configuration. I think we have seen a share of wallet changes though within the hospitals where we may have been servicing the hospital itself, and we were able to win their large ambulatory network as a result of that experience. And those are the customers that are actually winning in the market right now, these large complex IDNs that have both strong acute settings, but also ambulatory settings that are tending to be the hospitals that are winning share in the market and being very successful. And then obviously, those are important customers to win with.","Operator","We'll move now to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions. First, on the drug distribution side of your business, I think, Jeff, you called out in the quarter that you had impact from new customers, as well as expanding relationships. Can you talk about maybe the size of the impact, if any, of new customers in the quarter?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I would say, they're a relatively modest size. There were no huge changes of customers in the quarter. I would describe them as small to mid-size. But we continue to make good progress, with picking up some new customers and, as I said, our existing customers showed good growth in the quarter. So in both respects, it was very positive.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And the growth of your existing customers, is that now that you're distributing more generics, distributing more product or is it just the growth of the existing customers that you have?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I would say both. I mean, it depends on the customer. Fortunately, we have some very strong customers in the market, CVS, for example, which continues to post very good results and obviously, we benefit from that as well. But in addition, we continue to sell customers the opportunities to buy more products from us, including generics, and we continue to have good success in doing that. And will continue to be a big theme of ours as we go out to increase our share of wallet with customers, if not win some new -- small to mid-size customers.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You've also commented a lot, say, about the hospital network accounts and the ability to build out Preferred products and now there is [ph]. Is there any way to quantify what the white space opportunity is with these accounts, number one? And number two, where are you taking that business from, is that from other smaller distributors, are they self-distributing in the hospital today?","George S. Barrett","So let me start. We probably can't give complete line of sight on the opportunity. I would say that it's really sort of early days. So today, we're just really scratching the surface on the acute-care side, which has been primarily where our Preferred products have been going. What's really interesting is our customers, those 10 customers are beginning to realize that there's real value driver. Because I think, in a sense, Lisa, it's not going to be enough for people to squeeze 1 more basis point out of a procurement. What really is going to matter is changing behavior and consolidating the number of products that you use, being more efficient about that, is a change of behavior that can really be valuable to a system. The other thing I would note is that we basically have had no Preferred product position in the ambulatory care to-date or in the home, very little. And so, I think we see opportunities to expand in the acute-care centers, but also in these other channels where basically we haven't really even touched the opportunity. So we're pretty excited about this, because it really is kind of a sort of change of behavior that has material value to our customers versus just squeezing out 1 more basis point from the supply system. The second part, I think, Jeff. I'll let Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","A few comments to add there, Lisa. First of all, again, because our focus has been on some of these larger, more complex accounts, those also tend to be the accounts that have been continuing to consolidate, bought, buy [ph] others. And obviously, we benefit as they buy others, whether it'd be smaller hospitals or surgery centers or physician offices and as they continue to get bigger and more complex, both our size and our ability to service them there uniquely grows as well. But from a one point, to I'd state, in some cases, we're doing work that was previously done by the hospital itself. And really, that is a significant goal of ours to help the hospital focus on treating patients and allow us to manage their supply chain in a more comprehensive manner. And when we can do that, that's very much a win-win usually for the hospital and us, and then, I think in a couple of cases where we've picked up some additional ambulatory business that sort of -- was part of a larger hospital, they probably were some smaller players that were servicing those accounts that didn't necessarily have the ability to compete with us on the whole network. So it's -- all 3 of those have been part of the driving force.","George S. Barrett","I'd probably just want to add again, just as a reminder, it is a tough system out there. So the other thing that we tried to do is really focused on efficiency. And you've heard us talk about that over the last year. And so it's both creating the opportunities for those customers and also recognizing that, in this kind of system, we've got to be incredibly efficient and we work really hard at that.","Operator","And we'll move now to George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess, George or Jeff, as we look at the inflationary environment in the branded drug space recognizing that the old spec buying days of 2004 and 2005 are behind us. How should we think about kind of the company's leverage to -- and kind of profit contribution from -- that you're able to capture from this kind of pretty high branded drug inflationary environment? And maybe could you -- can you give us an update on whether we want to think about it on a quarterly or an annual basis, how much of operating earnings in the drug segment is coming from your ability to capture a spread on branded drug price increases?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. It's less than 20% of our branded gross margin now. And I would say, overall for the segment, it's well under 10% of the gross margin of the segment. So it's not near the significant swing factor that it would have been 5 or 10 years ago. And honestly, generally we're pretty good at predicting what the impact will be for the full year. I think the difficulty we always have, especially, these days, is guessing which quarter it's going to be in. So it does have the ability to swing a quarter fairly materially, and as I said, the swing from Q3 to Q2 probably, was about a $0.02 swing. But over the course of the year, it's a factor, but becoming increasingly less of a factor, and as I said, less than 10% of our gross margin in the segment.","George S. Barrett","And I would also add that particularly these very expensive drugs -- biopharmaceutical companies are very careful about how they do this and manage it pretty carefully. So it's not a giant swing factor for us.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the med-surg. Can you talk about the margin expansion -- kind of the core business x the AssuraMed business? So we talked earlier that AssuraMed's outperforming kind of the acquisition model. How is the business x AssuraMed performing from a gross margin perspective?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, I don't want to break down too much here, because AssuraMed is pretty much a part of our overall Medical segment. But obviously, it was a significant driver for the quarter. I would say, excluding AssuraMed, our revenue growth overall in the Medical segment was in the lower-single digits. And we felt some slight margin expansion on that.","George S. Barrett","And that's primarily mix.","Operator","We'll move now to John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","George, can you give us any observations on health care consumption? Did you see any interesting shifts, either from a third [ph] perspective or the early impact of the ACA?","George S. Barrett","For that, I wish I could answer that one, John. I'm going to try, though. It is been -- and you probably heard this from other companies, really difficult to tease out a discernible trend on overall utilization and consumption. You probably heard some people talk about sort of late year spiking and whether not that might have to do with some benefit design issues around the system. I've heard people speculate that there were some apprehension about whether or not -- the changes in policy of the Affordable Care Act might influence their future access to -- their position. And so we tried to sort of look at all that. But to be really honest, we just can't tease it out. There are so many moving parts, so I don't think I could say there's a discernible trend. What we can say is, we see a procedure utilization. So there are certain things that we can see. We see in-hospital, ambulatory and what I would say is that, that trend -- the softness that we're seeing in acute-care procedures is probably one that we would highlight. But I don't know that I could say, we could identify a particular trend right now, just because there's so much noise in the system and so many moving parts. And I think it's just going to take a while for this to shake out. We've not seen -- I would say any uplift, and I'm sure you've heard, as you follow the insurers, any particular uplift from new patients in the system yet, not at this stage. Just one additional comment on utilization. We always tend to focus on the hospital and physicians' office settings, but, I think it's important to keep in mind that we have another very important channel and that's the home, and we still see that market growing at a rate of 6% to 8%, which is obviously very encouraging and very important going forward.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Excellent. And just a quick follow-up. You referenced to some newer customers within pharma. Are you having -- or seeing any discussions about some of the self-warehousing change, shifting any generic purchasing back into the distribution channel?","George S. Barrett","Let me touch that. I think there is -- I'll do this carefully. I think there is an interesting evaluation that any company now has to do as it relates to their own scale relative to what's happening systemically. I do think that may raise some interesting opportunities, but I do think that the gap between some of the larger players and the larger purchasers of generics, and smallers -- it might be widening. And so, if I am a smaller player now, I'd probably have to think carefully about what's the most efficient way for me to source my generic products. And I do think that given some of the changes in the market, there's probably a lot of, I would say, probably, a lot of evaluation going on in many offices to try to figure out the most efficient way, given some of the dynamics in the market. So we're hoping that, that represents an opportunity for us, but it's too early to say.","Operator","We'll move to Greg Bolan with Sterne Agee.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So just going back to Charles' earlier question. George, you had mentioned that if you think about the spectrum: to the left, not really clinically relevant; to the right, very clinically relevant PPIs. And you talked about the fact that Preferred products are contributing about 35 -- I think you said mid- to upper-30% of medical gross profit. So is it safe to say that the driver of that increase has really been to the left, so the lower end PP -- at the lower end consumables? And I guess, as you think about, as you move up the technology scale towards the higher end PPIs, is that what takes you from, say, 35% of gross profit to, say, 45% of gross profit by fiscal '17?","George S. Barrett","Greg, it's a good question. And I think -- I am going to try answer this along 2 dimensions. Well, the first part is, yes, because you asked about whether or not it's primarily on the lower end, the left if we were diagramming it. I think the answer to that is, yes. It's clearly on the more commoditized end today. So think about growth, our growth plans work along 2 dimensions. You might even say 3. Let's say dimension one: Increase penetration with existing accounts, who tend to be acute-care hospital focused from as long as [indiscernible] most procedures are. So that's one dimension. Second dimension would be our new channels. So as those opportunities might arise in surgery centers or ambulatory settings, that's a second dimension. And the third, which is actually really exciting, is moving along that spectrum, would be moving upward and to the right towards products that, actually, when you really examine the data, you discover that are probably not clinically all that referenced. So it's really both going forward, with [indiscernible] physician referenced items. And probably if we look at a time horizon, it sort of the new product adding new dimensions is probably a little bit further out as we go, and that's from the time respect [ph].","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then -- just real quickly. How would you characterize the commoditization of PPIs? I mean, I'm assuming that's a good guide for you in profitability. Any kind of update on what you're seeing out in the marketplace, George. Just as it relates to PPIs that were once seen as, well, PPIs, but now becoming more, I guess, commoditized? I mean stents kind of come to mind, but any comments there?","George S. Barrett","Yes, certainly not about stents, but about the general direction. Here's what I would say. I think this is not a new discovery. I mean, I think if you look inside a complex health system, they would probably understand that historically, the departments sort of ruled and so what happened was every department has their own preferences, physicians have their own preferences and the system was able to accommodate that. But I think, it's been understood for quite some time that, that probably could be done more efficiently. Here's a noteworthy change. The noteworthy change, is that given some very different environmental forces, the more senior folks in the hospital are more aligned with the fact that something needs to be done about this, and I want to actually say that physicians are on board as well. So I think there's more of an awareness inside that health system with a changing demographic and a changing regulatory environment and changing reimbursement environment, that they need to focus on this area of inefficiency and we're helping them do that. So if that makes sense to you. So it's not just our promoting it, it's hospitals and health systems recognizing that they should take action on it, and I think that's probably a noteworthy change over these last year or 2.","Operator","We'll move to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So the 54 bps margin expansion in Pharma Distribution was obviously quite strong. I guess, would you say, most of that would you say was tied to the core operational improvement? Or is it possible that the rolloff of the lower-margin Y [ph] contract contributed a major portion of that? How would you characterize each of those without getting too specific? Just trying to get a feel for that.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","It's Jeff. I would say there are 3 significant drivers. The largest one, by far, was the performance of generics, both our core performance and the impact of price inflation. Second, was the rolloff of the WAG, which as you would expect, was lower-margin business than our average business in pharma. And then, I think, third was slightly higher brand inflation than we saw last year in Q2. Those were all 3, I'd say, material drivers, in that order.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. One other quick one. Just I think if I heard you right, you mentioned that because the just reported quarter was so strong, that the historical pattern of the Pharma Distribution results being stronger than March quarter versus the December quarter may not necessarily repeat themselves this time around. But just to clarify, does your comment pertain to the segment operating profit dollars, or the operating margins or both, when doing that sequential comparison?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I was referring to dollars, but I was talking specifically about the impact of brand inflation, which typically is the biggest driver of our seasonal peak in Q3. I would say that will be less of a skewing factor this year than perhaps other years. That make sense?","Operator","We'll move now to Bob Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a quick one. Will the CVS joint venture have any discernible working capital effect? And also, on the inventory build in the quarter, a bit surprised, I guess, with the Walgreens business gone, were you not taking title to the Walgreens inventory, is that the situation?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","With respect to Walgreens inventory. No, we were taking title to the Walgreens inventory, which is why we recognized the sales on our income statement historically. But I would say, on average, we carried fewer days of inventory for Walgreens than I'd say the pharma segment on average. In part because a good chunk of the Walgreens business was bulk, and we would tend to hold bulk inventory for a relatively short period of time. But had to skew the overall WAG inventory down and make it lower than the overall average. So, that's why you saw an increase because of the mix shift. Bob, I forgot the first part of your question.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The CVS JV, does it have any balance sheet impact?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","No, it does not. There is -- under the current structure, there is no inventory that flows through the JV. So really the only asset the JV has are the physical building it's in and the people that reside in there. The actual product flows flow through the respective companies.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just on China, I think you mentioned $2.5 billion revenue run rate. It's at a margin better than the base business was my understanding. What is the asset base look like for that business now?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","We haven't disclosed this publicly. But I will say that assets in general for businesses in China, particularly in our space, tend to be higher and really referring to working capital. And that's primarily because receivable days with hospitals, just by market convention, tend to be longer in China. They're closer on average to 80 days, and obviously they're much shorter in the U.S. So it is a more working capital-intensive business than our U.S. business. That's also by the way, why, we're looking at other areas to grow into that are much more capital efficient in China. So for example, our direct-to-patient business is a very asset-light business for the most part. So we continue to look for ways to improve our mix and improve our return on capital.","Operator","And we'll take Eric Coldwell with Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Most of my topics have been covered at this point, but just a couple of quick ones. Specialty growth, I know you said it's strong, but I didn't catch the rate. And if you can talk about what classes of trade and maybe what therapeutic classes you're seeing the best trends in? And then just one quick follow-up.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, the revenue growth for Specialty Solutions was 38% in the second quarter, which obviously continues the good revenue growth trend we've seen over the past couple of years. I would say the bulk of our business is still in the oncology space. We continue to build out into other areas, like rheumatoid arthritis and a few other emerging areas. But the bulk of the growth to-date has been in the oncology space.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And Jeff, what specific trades to classify [ph] on oncology. Is it community, is it outpatient hospital, where are you seeing the biggest demand?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Most of that growth is driven by sales through community oncologists. I will say, though, that we have seen a shift, and it's been a fairly well publicized shift over the past year or so of more infusions happening in hospital settings as the community oncologists have generally shrunk over the past year or so. That all said, the community space is still a very important and robust one and really, a very important part of our business and our growth story going forward.","Operator","And our final question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I think, if I heard you correctly, yes, the Walgreens revenue impact was about $5 billion. So I'm just looking on a year-over-year basis, if I back $5 billion out of fiscal 2Q '13, you still beat by, like $1.7 billion in terms of top line growth. And I think you mentioned that the new customers were somewhat modest in size. Can you just talk about the revenue upside, where that came from just generally, please?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Well, I mean, modest in size is a relative term, right? Just given the nature of pharma, it doesn't take a whole lot of customers to have a pretty significant dollar increase in revenue. And we saw good growth from our existing customers. It was really a combination of both of those. But your point that the revenue upside in pharma was a positive surprise to what a lot of people were expecting, I would agree with you. And, quite frankly, it was better than our plans as well. And I think that's a testament to our sales teams who have done a great job over the past year going out and letting customers know what we have to offer, offering creative solutions, and [indiscernible] pick up share of wallet. So, yes, I think the underlying trend that you pointed out was a very positive one.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more quick one. In terms of your specialty capabilities, has there been any impact from sequestration at all or not really? And then, in terms of your relationship with CVS, could that longer term possibly be a way to sort of expand your specialty business?","George S. Barrett","Yes, I'll take it. I think -- again, restate the first part on the special question?","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Impact from sequestration or not, I imagine not.","George S. Barrett","Yes. It certainly had an impact on customers across the system. I think it had a very, very modest impact on our business. As Jeff mentioned, we've been building scale. We've not been terribly exposed to some of the dynamics that were associated with the sequestration. So certainly as we look around the system, sequestration has been difficult thing for many, many physician groups. But it really did not have much impact on us, just given our model. Again, the second part, I'm sorry, David?","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And long-term, your joint venture with CVS, I imagine there might be ways to sort of grow that relationship?","George S. Barrett","Yes. So here's the way you ought to think about this: I think our joint venture itself is really dedicated to the global procurement of generic products for the U.S. market specifically. Obviously, our relationship with CVS Caremark is deep, and having this joint venture certainly, only strengthens it. So we'll continue to look for opportunities to see how we can collaborate in areas that create value, and if specialty is one of those areas, certainly, we will explore it. But don't think of it as a part of the joint venture. I would think, just to make life simple, think of the joint venture as specifically dedicated to this generic procurement strategy, but certainly we'll explore and continue to explore other ways to create value for one another.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks.","George S. Barrett","So, look, it's been a longer call, but great questions, and we appreciate that. All the good questions. We appreciate your continued interest in Cardinal Health, and I wish all of you the best for the New Year. And we'll see you all soon.","Operator","Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Sally Curley, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Sally Curley","Thank you, Nicole, and welcome to Cardinal Health's First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements, and the matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of the presentation, found on the Investors page of our website for a description of those risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about these measures is included at the end of the slide.","I would also like to remind you of a few upcoming investment conferences and events in which we will be webcasting. Notably, the Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 8 a.m. Eastern on November 6 at our headquarters here in Dublin, Ohio; and our invitation-only Investor and Analyst Day on December 10 in New York. The details of these webcasts and events are or will be posted on the IR section of our website at cardinalhealth.com, so please make sure to visit the site often for updated information. We look forward to seeing you in the upcoming events.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett","Thanks, Sally, and good morning to everyone. Our fiscal 2014 is off to a very strong start. Our first quarter performance demonstrated growth and balance and progress on our key strategic priorities. There's a lot to discuss so let's get right to it.","Total revenue for the first quarter was $24.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year as we lapped the loss of the Express Scripts business and absorbed the expiration of our Walgreens contract, which occurred at the end of August. We were able to partially offset this revenue loss with growth in existing customers and the contribution from new business.","Our non-GAAP EPS grew by 36% to $1.10, helped by an $0.18 benefit from the resolution of some historical tax matters. Looking deeper, the results show we achieved a very healthy 13% growth in non-GAAP operating earnings, fueled by strong margin expansion and operating profit increases in both our pharmaceutical and medical segments. For those of you keeping score, our year-over-year gross margin rate has expanded every quarter for the past 3 years.","We also had an outstanding cash flow performance, generating $950 million in the quarter. Importantly, the wind down of the Walgreens work was done very efficiently and effectively. Our team did an outstanding job. They were able to dramatically reduce our inventory while maintaining the uncompromisingly high service levels we expect and Walgreens worked closely with us to ensure a smooth transition for us and we do appreciate that. The bottom line, our balance sheet is rock-solid and our growth is very healthy. We are well-positioned to continue growing and to seize quality opportunities wherever they emerge.","Based on our first quarter results and the strength of our operating earnings performance, we are now guiding to a new range of $3.62 to $3.72 for fiscal year 2014 non-GAAP EPS. This guidance reflects a full year tax rate assumption that is unchanged from our original expectations, although we do expect to see some quarterly fluctuations in the rate and Jeff will give you some more detail on this.","I'm sure all of you saw this morning our announcement of the authorization of a new multiyear share repurchase program for $1 billion. This will allow us flexibility as we execute our balanced capital deployment philosophy. I'd also like to take a few minutes to give you my perspective on recent moves in the marketplace.","The world is rapidly changing and no industry more so than health care. In these past 18 months, we witnessed and participated ourselves in several noteworthy realignments in our industry. Clearly, last week's announcement that McKesson is acquiring Celesio is the most recent. For our part, we try to bring our collective experience and insights to the moves that make us stronger and better positioned. We will be uncompromising in our commitment to uphold and grow a decisive competitive advantage and top-tier returns for our shareholders. Many factors contribute to our sustainable competitive advantage, but I'd like to call your attention to a few. First, our unrivaled touch points across an increasingly integrating system will be more efficient, effective and connected across the continuum of care. Second, we have the size and impact to create benefits for our customers and to create clear share opportunities from manufacturer partners. Third, we deliver a world-class execution. This is a standard against which we will constantly measure ourselves. And finally, we are an organization with the unwavering discipline, imagination and the flexibility to bring solutions to systems badly in need of them.","By the way, I'm hearing some beeping. I'm hoping that everyone is able to hear us. I'm going to continue on, assuming that beeping is not getting in the way of things.","All this requires having a capital and a flexible capital deployment strategy to compete in the world going through a rapid change. These things are all strengths of Cardinal Health and we can use periods of industry change to expand them. As always, we'll thoroughly evaluate all options to expand our competitive advantage and deliver even better returns and we'll continue to take options for growth available to us. We are ready to move and we'll do so decisively when the lights are green. But we will follow a simple principle with discipline, any decision we make must deliver meaningful and lasting value to our customers, our supplier partners and to our shareholders. Not all opportunities that present themselves are created equally. It's our responsibility to know the difference and act accordingly and you should expect nothing less of us.","Now on to the segments. Our Pharmaceutical segment delivered robust profit growth of 8%, on an expected revenue decline. Our segment margin expanded by 29 basis points. Our growth in both new and existing Pharmaceutical Distribution customers reflects the value that we've been bringing to them through both our branded and generic programs. Our pharma margin was further expanded by our continued progress on our sourcing programs and our product and customer mix initiatives. Our pharma team continues to perform well in the retail independent space and we see continued market share growth. As you know, this has been an area of focus over the past few years and we remain deeply committed to retail pharmacy.","We're continuing to see steep revenue growth in Specialty Solutions and we're picking up new accounts at an excellent pace, especially in the oncology services and distribution area. In addition, we've been adding to our clinical talent base in specialty and we're seeing the benefits. Our thesis in Specialty Solutions is that we can create significant value in connecting providers, payors and biopharmaceutical companies in collaborative ways that result in better patient care at lower cost that will be central to specialty pharmaceutical care and that's why it's at the core of our specialty model. The environment around nuclear imaging remains challenging, but our Nuclear business continues to adapt effectively to market conditions.","The Medical segment performance was strong. Revenue was up 13% to $2.7 billion and segment profit increased 43%. The key driver was AssuraMed, which accelerated that growth and we also saw volume growth in our existing customer base and penetration within our targeted strategic accounts. Investments in strategic platforms and a strong focus on our efficiency initiatives also contributed to a sharp segment profit increase compared to a year ago.","Building our preferred product portfolio remains a top priority. It's an example of what makes Cardinal Health tick. We listen to our customers and then act. Their needs and expectations drive our decisions. The preferred product portfolio addresses our customers' need for lower-cost alternatives to mature medical devices. In fact, we introduced more new preferred products in this fiscal first quarter than we did all of last year. Our priority is to be ready and able to meet changing needs, so we've adapted our go-to-market model to ensure we're 100% aligned with market trends. As a result, we're getting more products to more patients more cost-effectively throughout the continuum of care. In line with this, the trend toward home health care is unlikely to diminish with today's strong focus on cost containment and greater health care consumerism. Our March 2013 acquisition of AssuraMed, the leading distributor of medical products to the home, gives us a tremendous platform through which to move into this market. AssuraMed is performing well, with profit contribution exceeding the acquisition model. The expected synergies and efficiency gains are being realized. We are only just beginning to leverage this platform across the Cardinal Health organization.","Our Medical segment continues to innovate. This past Tuesday, we jointly announced with FedEx our new strategic alliance by combining our health care expertise, third-party logistics capabilities and specialized facilities. With FedEx's global transportation, logistics and technology capabilities, we will offer tailor-made, third-party logistics and supply chain solutions for the health care industry.","Turning to China. First quarter revenues were up nearly 30% year-over-year. Our strategy here remains to enlarge our geographic footprint, to create new business partnerships and to bring our expertise to new opportunities such as direct-to-patient and consumer health. A lot has been happening in China and Jeff will touch on that in a moment, but one thing is totally clear, health care in China will continue to grow. We're very well positioned to play in a central role in this rapidly expanding health care marketplace.","As you know, we've made several acquisitions in China over the past 2 years, largely focused on building out our geographic footprint. Most recently, we closed on an acquisition that will broaden our capabilities and will give us a platform to begin building out an e-commerce business for nonprescription products. This platform will be used as both a B2C platform and in conjunction with a rapidly expanding direct-to-patient pharmacy network.","As I finish up today, let me make a few quick comments in the Affordable Care Act. As is well documented at this point, the rollout of the exchanges has experienced its challenges. As you remember, we've been clear from the start that we were not building into our guidance any upside based on short-term expectations for new volume in the system. This is a major piece of legislation, we recognize that these are early days and that the opening pitch has just been thrown. We're going to stay on top of this and we'll be ready for whatever comes next.","I'll conclude by welcoming Patricia Hemingway Hall, President and CEO of Health Care Services Corporation, to our Board of Directors. Pat has built a distinguished career on both the provider and payor side of the industry and we look forward to the wealth of knowledge she'll bring to our board.","I also want to thank Jean Spaulding, who'll be stepping down from our board next week. Her insight and guidance over the past 11 years have been invaluable. Her legacy will be lasting and we wish her well. So again, we're off to a great start to fiscal 2014.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George, and Happy Halloween, everyone. In case you're wondering, I am dressed as a Canadian today. This morning, I'll be reviewing the drivers of first quarter performance and provide additional detail on the full year, as well as our somewhat atypical decision to raise the fiscal 2014 guidance range after only our first quarter.","You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion. Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported a 36% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share in our first quarter versus the prior year's period. This is driven by 2 major items. First and most importantly, we began fiscal '14 with great execution across our businesses, posting a 13% increase in non-GAAP operating earnings. Second, our results include an unusual tax benefit of $0.18 per share. Even excluding the $0.18, non-GAAP earnings per share grew a robust 14%, a great quarter of growth.","Let me go through the rest of the income statement in a little bit more detail, starting with revenues. Consolidated sales were down 5% to $24.5 billion, which was better than our expectations. The decline was due to the expiration of the Express Scripts contract, which we have now fully lapped and the Walgreens business, which just ended on August 31. Gross margin dollars increased 9% to 5.15% of revenue, with a rate of 68 basis points versus prior year. SG&A expenses rose 6% in Q1, primarily driven by the recent AssuraMed acquisition and partially offset by planned efficiency initiatives. Our commitment to controlling costs and improving the efficiency of our operations resulted in a decrease in our core SG&A spend versus the same period last year.","Our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 36 basis points to 2.17%. We've now posted operating margins greater than 2% in 3 of the last 4 quarters. You'll notice that our net interest and other expense came in higher in Q1 than the prior year's quarter. This is primarily due to the new $1.3 billion of debt we issued in February associated with the AssuraMed acquisition. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.7% versus the prior year's 37.8%. The uncharacteristically low rate was primarily due to beneficial tax settlements totaling $63 million in the quarter. Please note, this amount only affects our tax line and has no impact on operating earnings or segment results. Without those discrete items, our tax rate for the quarter would've been about 37%, much more in line with our normal rate. I'll discuss tax assumptions for the full year later in my prepared remarks.","Our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 343.7 million for the first quarter, which is about 700,000 favorable to last year. During the quarter, we repurchased $50 million worth of shares. And at the end of the period, we had $350 million remaining on our board-authorized repurchase program. Today, as George mentioned, we announced that our board authorized a new repurchase program for $1 billion. This plan is in addition to the $350 million remaining under our previous plan.","Now let's discuss the consolidated cash flows and the balance sheet. We generated $950 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, which greatly exceeded our expectations. There were 2 major factors that contributed to this strong cash flow generation. First, our strong underlying operating earnings performance; and second, the wind down of the Walgreens contract, which contributed over half of the first quarter's cash flow, as we reduced inventory levels significantly and faster than we originally anticipated. Given this accelerated wind down, we would not expect to see a similar level of cash flow contribution in the second quarter.","On the Walgreens unwind, I echo George's comment and thank our team who ensured that we exited the Walgreens contract smoothly, balancing extremely high service levels with a rapid reduction in inventory.","Moving on. At the end of Q1, we had $2.8 billion in cash in our balance sheet, which includes $475 million held internationally. While our working capital days decreased versus prior year, I would like to note that our working capital metrics are distorted this quarter due to the expiration of the Walgreens contract in mid-period. We don't believe these metrics provide meaningful measures compared to the prior year's period and, therefore, we'll not be providing these metrics in the quarter.","Now let's move to segment performance. I'll discuss pharma first. Pharma segment revenue came in better than expected, although it did post a decrease of 7% to $21.8 billion, driven by the expiration of the Express Scripts and Walgreens contracts. This decrease was partially offset by volume growth from new and existing customers. As a reminder, we lapped the Express Scripts contract expiration this quarter. And given the August 31 Walgreens contract expiration, revenue from Walgreens was $1.7 billion less than the prior year's quarter. Pharma segment profit increased by 8% to $433 million due to contributions from across our businesses, with strong performance from both our generics and brand product portfolios. Given the nature of the wind down of the Walgreens contract, the expiration did not significantly impact our operating earnings compared to the prior year period. We do expect the contract expiration to have an adverse impact on our period-over-period comparison results of operations during the remainder of this fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal '15. This has been incorporated in our fiscal 2014 guidance assumption, which I'll discuss in a moment.","With respect to generics, we did, as expected, we lapped contribution from new generic launches in this year's quarter versus Q1 of fiscal 2013. Nevertheless, sales and profits from all generic programs exhibited very good year-over-year growth in the quarter, reflecting the emphasis we have placed over the last several years building the strength of our programs and the overall robustness of the market.","Sequentially from Q4, generic deflation moderated slightly from the lower-single digits to essentially flat. We also saw strong performance under our branded pharma contracts, with brand inflation in the low-double digits, about or perhaps slightly better than we had expected. Pharma segment profit margin rate increased by 29 basis points compared to the prior year's Q1, a reflection of the strength of our generics programs and our focus on margin expansion, including customer and product mix. In addition, within customer categories, margin expansion in Pharma Distribution was strong across almost all of our customer class of trade.","Now moving on to Medical segment performance. Medical revenue growth was up 13% versus last year, an increase of $319 million. The AssuraMed acquisition was the primary driver of revenue growth in the quarter. We also saw volume growth from our existing customer base, a result of our continued focus on strategic hospital network accounts, which tend to utilize more of our products and services to drive efficiency in their supply chain. Medical segment profit grew 43% in Q1, primarily driven by AssuraMed. As George said, the integration is on track and we continue to be excited about the growth we've seen in the home health market and the potential of the AssuraMed platform. I will note that we remain very confident in our original estimate of achieving at least $0.18 of non-GAAP EPS accretion for the full year. Other factors positively impacting segment profit included contribution from planned efficiency initiatives and growth in our preferred products portfolio.","Now I have a few words on Cardinal Health China, a business which spans both of our reporting segments. Our business in China again posted strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, up 29%. While we're on the subject of China, let me take a few more moments to comment on the environment as we see it. First, although we continue to see news around the slowing of industrial growth in China, the health care market in China is growing and will continue to grow at rates well in excess of GDP growth rates. Demographic changes, lifestyle trend, the expansion of health insurance programs and the government's pledge to support the development are all factors that make health care in China an attractive place to be. Second, the recent compliance investigations by the government authorities are affecting the promotional activities of certain pharma companies and we expect this to moderate growth in the near term. However, we continue to remain bullish on medium- to longer-term growth and, in particular, our ability to build on our unique brand of supply chain excellence, integrity and service offerings.","Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter, which include items that reduced our GAAP results by $0.11 per share compared to non-GAAP. Diluted is $0.09 of amortization and acquisition-related costs, which reflects $0.08 of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Also included in this figure is $0.02 of restructuring and employee severance. In Q1 of last year, GAAP results were $0.02 lower than non-GAAP results, primarily related to amortization and other acquisition-related costs.","Now I'll talk briefly about guidance for the current fiscal year. As you know, we provided an initial guidance range in our August call of $3.45 to $3.60. Given the strong operating performance in Q1, we're now raising our range to $3.62 to $3.72. I will add that it's unusual for us to update guidance this early in our fiscal year given the amount of time that's still ahead of us. However, this year, we have made an exception due to our first quarter results and the strength of our operating earnings performance.","Most of the underlying corporate assumptions remain unchanged from our previous comments. However, I do want to mention a few points. First, we're not changing the full year expected tax rate range of approximately 34.5% to 36% that we provided in August because it's really impossible that the favorable impact of the first quarter tax settlements could largely be offset by unfavorable discrete items in future quarters of fiscal 2014. Put another way, quarterly tax rates will fluctuate throughout the year, but we expect our full year rate to end up somewhere within the original range we provided. Let me be clear, our changing guidance is unrelated to taxes. Second, we're essentially holding our anticipated diluted weighted average shares outstanding less than or equal to 343 million for the year. Although I don't like to telegraph exactly what we may do regarding share repurchases, I will say that, at a minimum, we'll offset dilution. And our existing authorization, combined with the new board approval, gives us ample flexibility as the year progresses. Third, we reduced our interest and other assumption by $5 million and now assume a range of $140 million to $150 million. Finally, with regards to cash flow and as I noted earlier, we were able to realize the majority -- another majority of the working capital benefit from the Walgreens transition in Q1. This positive cash flow will be partially offset by the continued after-tax loss earnings and a LIFO-related cash tax impact later this year. The timing of all these moving parts, as a result, we're seeing most of the positive cash flow early in the year, while we expect the offsets to occur through the remainder of the year. We continue to project that all these moving parts will net to more than $500 million of cash flow for the year.","In closing, I would like to thank the Cardinal Health team for a very strong start to fiscal '14. It is exciting to achieve these levels of growth and margin expansion and it only happens with the hard work and dedication of our employees. I'm optimistic about the rest the year of as we continue to build on our strategic priorities. And I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at our Investor and Analyst Day on December 10.","With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken of ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess, in the pharma business, maybe just to start with the quarter, can you talk a bit about sort of what you've experienced in the independent channel? Obviously, you sort of been in transition there for a number of years post the Kinray buy. It seems like you have a lot of momentum, the customer base, you've really done increasingly better with. There was a big conference recently. What's sort of been your experience there and how would you think your growth rates kind of compare to market?","George S. Barrett","Yes, look, as you know, we've devoted a lot of energy and a lot of resource in recent years to our retail customer base and diversifying that base, as you know. And I think the commitment is paying off. We've attracted talent to focus in this area. Our offerings are broader, are more creative, allow them to compete. That's not just in the Pharmaceutical side, that's in the front end, that's in other tools, for example, in helping them set up a diabetes center in stores. So I think we're building capabilities, I think, that set of customers feel that from us and I think they recognize that we are focusing. So I would say that we have probably expanded our market share a bit, but I'll probably not attribute it to a single thing. I think it's really sort of a comprehensive effort that has been going on for now a good 4-plus years. And Mike Coffman and his team have done a great job of strengthening our position in that side of the market.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And you touched upon at the beginning, there's obviously a lot of change going on in the industry. A lot of it in terms of the investor focus continues to be on the procurement of generics, obviously, something you have a unique perspective on given your background. I mean, as you think about the way you're contracting in markets today and the changes you've made to sort of your generic strategy over time, what are the key things you're thinking about as your peers continue to do things that are a little bit atypical from sort of the historical perspective? What are the things you're looking for? What are the things you're trying to focus on to make sure you're competitive in that market? And how are the conversations go with the manufacturers? Obviously, it's a little bit of a slippery slope for them in terms of seeding too much price versus what the trade-off is for volume.","George S. Barrett","Right, that's a really good question and probably deserves a very long answer, but I'll try to give it a summarized perspective. Obviously, a lot is happening, we all know that. Much of that, by the way, it's still relatively early stage, so it's so hard to discern exactly the implications of all that. Here's what I'd say about what's happening for us. Our sourcing program have just simply gotten better every year. We have a deeper team, we've got greater capabilities, including really global knowhow. We work with our manufacturer partners really closely. I would say, if I had to describe one of the changes that's most notable for me, is the level of strategic dialogue and discourse that we have with those manufacturers. And I think we do a really effective job coordinating our sort of upstream and downstream. I think we do a much better job on connecting the sourcing to our go-to-market model. So I think there's a lot happening. Our teams deserve a lot of credit. They execute really well. And we've gotten bigger. And I think that has helped, there's a bit of a virtuous cycle that occurs. But it's not about 1 dimension. It's not -- obvious, scale matters. Strategic relationships matter. Awareness of the strength of any given company in any given product area matters. And understanding how to deal with a market that has occasional disruptions matters. And so I think we've just done a good job of improving every aspect of the way we think about sourcing, both tactically and strategically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just really had a couple of questions on the med-surg side of your business. Clearly, you talked about preferred items, continuing to see increases there. What are your expectations over the next year or so? And then secondly, any expectations at all as we move into the Affordable Care Act and increasing utilization on that side of your business in your relationships with the hospitals?","George S. Barrett","So let me start with preferred products. I think in a broader sense, we are seeing increasing attention in the provider space among hospitals and the integrated systems on what they call physician preference items. And I think they recognize that this is an area where efficiency needs to carry the day and that is not historically been the case. This is an area that we're very focused on. We've done really well in growing this space. I would expect that to continue to grow for us. A lot of our preferred products fall into this category. And as you know, we've done some things to sort of take a step forward in the system. So for example, again, our partnership with EMERGE, which is really in the orthopedic trauma area, while it's early, we're seeing real enthusiasm and a lot of demand from our customers on this. And so we'll continue to roll out that program and I would expect that we'll add additional categories going into the future. So I expect preferred products to be a driver for us. On the broader question of our customers, it's really a unique time, as you know. There's a huge amount of change, a lot of experimentation in the market in terms of trying new models. And for us, I think our ability to touch all parts of this system matters here because I think we can gain insights from being able to connect all the players in the system and start thinking about their solutions from a broader perspective. It's no longer just simply how do you drop a basis point out of your medical, surgical distribution. It's how do you create solutions that allow them to change the game a little bit because I think more than we're thinking about more significant changes than just focusing on an individual price, it's not going to get there alone. So we -- I think we've done a good job with our sales organization of realigning around those strategic partners. And we're trying to be very creative, very open-minded. We don't do one-size-fits-all. And I hope they will see us as a company that you can go to with your basic convection problems and we have some solutions that we can bring.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And George, when we think about that in the context, of margin and maybe this is a question for Jeff, if I remember historically, your private label Allegiance product has a much better margin. And so as we think about these preferred products, is this a nice margin-enhancing opportunity over the next couple of years?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Lisa, it's Jeff. Absolutely. I mean, virtually everything we're doing in the medical space these days is geared towards margin expansion, whether it'd be our entry into the Home Health or our focus on providing additional services to our hospital customers or expanding in the surgery centers, in physicians' office space and definitely, preferred products are very much in the forefront of that as well. We've said previously that right now, with the inclusion of AssuraMed in the overall portfolio, our preferred products make up about 20% of the revenue in the medical segment. From a gross profit standpoint, that's closer to the mid-30s. So just from that, you get a pretty good idea of how much higher margin the preferred products are. Clearly, there's opportunities to continue to expand that portfolio very aggressively and it will enable us to drive up the Medical segment profit margin over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greg Bolan of Sterne Agee.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So as you think about your portfolio over the next several years, how would you characterize the concentration of limited stores generics relative to total brand generic conversion? I know it's a difficult one to predict, but just any directional comments will be very, very much helpful.","George S. Barrett","Greg, it's George. I wish I could give you a great answer on that. I mean, I think that we will have and continue to have certain products that have, on the generic side, characteristics that probably bring fewer number of competitors. Now that could be a statutory exclusivity. It could be a court case, as one we just saw in a complex drug. I do think that we see some of the more complex drug posing greater challenges for the manufacturers. And so there are those that will have the capabilities to do those things and those who are probably working a little bit lower in the spectrum of complexity. So I would say, we'll continue to have a mix of products in our 4,000 generics. You're probably always going to have 3,500 plus that feel more typically commoditized and then a smaller set, whether that's 100 or 200, that have unique characteristics. I would -- I don't see why -- catalysts for some change there. I think the characteristics that we're seeing are -- have been seeing for a while are ones that we see at least into the near term.","Gregory T. Bolan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then just last question, as you think about your medical-surgical portfolio, we've talked about in the past kind of moving up as it relates to just the, I guess, the ASP, the sophistication of technology or medical equipment that you're offering on a preferred basis. But any updates that possibly you could give us as it relates to the partnerships you're thinking about, maybe with an x U.S. manufacturer, one may be coming to North America or potentially acquiring IPs or the development capabilities? Any commentary there would be very helpful.","George S. Barrett","Yes, probably only general commentary, although really good questions. We're very, very much focused in building our preferred product program, and we recognize that there are categories that probably have a lot of very mature products, and those are places where you'd naturally see some opportunities. You can imagine that we are exploring many. We'll probably provide a little more color on this in December when we get together. But you should assume that we think about this quite broadly rather than a single product line. We recognize that there are opportunities. And opportunities to work collaboratively with some well-known companies. So we're sort of open-minded about hedges, but you should assume that we have a wide screen here not an incredibly narrow one.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I apologize if you guys got into this. I've been jumping around some calls this morning. But on the guidance raise, I just wanted to confirm, Jeff, that's all operational? I guess, said another way, the assumption is that the tax rate goes up considerably for the balance of the year, is that right?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","That's absolutely correct, Bob. We have not changed our full year tax rate assumption one bit. There will be some volatility in the quarters. Like we saw in Q1, we had a significant positive benefit, we are expecting to see some significant negative benefit potentially later on in the year, so it'll average out over the course of the year. But our assumptions in that regard have not changed one bit. So the raising guidance was 100% related to operating performance.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just one on generic pricing. It looks like you guys noted flat generic pricing in the quarter. We've seen similar anecdote across the industry. I guess, what's your view, George, on what's driving this? And then maybe if you could just help us understand how you're thinking about generic pricing going forward, what's reflected in the current guidance, that would be helpful.","George S. Barrett","Yes, thanks, Bob. Again, you've heard me say this before so I apologize if it sounds like a broken record. Modeling this going forward is, as you know, really difficult. But Jeff did mention that, I guess, we characterize sort of moderating deflation and in some specific generics, inflation. Again, we're talking in general on those about sort of smaller subset of products rather than the broader portfolio. But nonetheless, it can have an impact. I think in terms of market conditions, it's driven by a number of things. Certainly, there's consolidation in the industry. There've been some real supply challenges, as you know, heightened inspection intensity, a number of things that have given some, let's say, disturbances to the market or have caused some companies to focus more specifically on a group of products and essentially not others. So I think those characteristics have -- which we see today are the ones that probably we've been seeing for the last at least 6 months. And so it's probably a number of things contributing to this environment, but that's basically what I would see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a quick question on the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. So backing out Express and Walgreens, then you get to about 14% organic growth rate for the segment. Can you give us some color when we think about the Pharmaceutical margin improvement in the quarter? If you can help us quantify or understand what percent of it was really driven by the transition of the lower-margin business versus organic.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Ricky, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. First of all, let's be clear, Express Scripts contract did have a negative profit impact year-on-year for the quarter. The Walgreens contract actually did not have a material profit impact and that was really due to the nature of the unwind and how various things happened as we were going through the transition. To answer your question about margin rates, I would say there were 3 major contributors to the 29 basis points or so that we saw for the quarter. The biggest was the overall performance of our generics portfolio. And then the other 2 were the disappearance of the Express Scripts numbers in this year's quarter and the wind down of the Walgreens contract. Those were the 3 very significant drivers for the quarter, but the biggest was our generics programs.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And when you think about kind of like the organic growth, should we assume that those rates will continue for the remainder of the year?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I'm not going to give you specific guidance on the margin, Ricky. But I would expect that our margin rates year-on-year will continue to show improvement for the course of the year due to the customer mix, again, obviously, we don't have Walgreens anymore going forward, but also just because of the continued performance of the overall business.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallucci of FBR.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I had 2 questions. The first one was just in the med-surg business. Can you sort of frame the growth that you saw x AssuraMed? And are you seeing any inflection points in utilization in the marketplace that you can perceive?","George S. Barrett","Why don't I start on utilization and then we'll sort of talk generally about how we're doing. I would still describe the overall utilization environment as relatively soft. I probably would not be able to say there's been a deterioration since our last call, nor would I say there's a discernible uplift. But I would say still relatively soft. An exception, however, would be in the home health space. I do think that just the forces of the market are going to increase demand in the home. And we see that and we're continuing to observe a line around those changes. But we are seeing some really good performance generally. And Don Casey and his team had done a great job of thinking about the changes in the market and seeing some progress in a number of areas of the business. Aside of AssuraMed, part of it has to do with, again, delivery of services at the right time in the right place to the right sets of customers. Jeff, I don't know if you want to add to this.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes, I think the most significant change we saw in this quarter was really the growth in our strategic accounts. And these are generally the larger organic IDN accounts that have considerable networks, including both hospitals, surgery centers and physicians offices. And they've been a focus of considerable attention from us over the past while, in particular, because we're the only player that can fully service the needs of those entire strategic account networks. And we really saw that pay off are in Q1. Those accounts were up 8% on the top line, which is really, I think, a validation of our efforts. And I think what's also important about it is that growth is being driven by very often them choosing to increase their preferred product portfolio, to increase the services that they're buying from us, et cetera. Because they're really seeing opportunities by increasing their portfolio purchases from us to increase the efficiency of their supply chain network. So I would say that was probably the most significant change that we saw in Q1.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then just a follow-up, George, I appreciate your comments sort of about the landscape and the evolving world that we're in. You talked a little bit about your perspective vis-\u00e0-vis the manufacturer. Can you tell us anything about the conversations or the questions you're being asked from customers in light of what your competitors are doing out there?","George S. Barrett","From customers or from our manufacturer partners?","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","No, no. You certainly talked a little bit about manufacturer before, so I was really thinking about retailers, et cetera, what they're thinking or saying to you?","George S. Barrett","Yes, as it relates to our broad base of customers, I would still say that a lot of the things that all of us are talking about here on this call are not generally their day-to-day worry. Their day-to-day worry is competing in a unique time with some formidable competitors, with challenging reimbursement rates and all the dynamics around how they compete in their communities. I would say that, that's primarily the conversations that we have with them, is about how do we help them compete and do their work rather than a lot of conversation about what's happening upstream. I would say, it's not typically -- obviously, they're aware of it, but it's still early to even -- for them, to even discern how that may or may not impact them. And so I think, right now, they're really focused on day-to-day competition, how do they do it and how do we help them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Steve Valiquette. So I'm also trying to juggle 3 calls at once, so I'm not sure I've quite mastered that skill yet. But just a couple of things from the press release, you mentioned that both generic and branded programs showed strong performance. Would you characterize it further that maybe one of those was a bigger contributor than the other? There's been a lot of talk around generic inflation tailwinds. I'm wondering if that was maybe a bigger part versus branded? Yes, sorry, go ahead.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","That wasn't us that was cutting you off, sorry, Steve. But I will answer your question and then you can continue if you'd like. For the quarter, generics programs were a bigger contributor than branded programs, but I would describe both of their contributions as meaningful for the quarter. But we were pleased with the entire product portfolio. By the way, we're also pleased with the progress in nuclear and specialty as well, which really together as a group, made up the pharma results.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I don't want to ask a redundant question, but did anybody ask about the revenue upside in the quarter? It was pretty meaningful versus consensus and I'm just trying to get a sense for whether that was maybe just some over time from maybe Walgreens on the roll off of that, or just other factors maybe just strength within the existing customer base, or just as generic erosion is not quite as severe now that we're anniversary-ing the big wave from 2012, is that part of it as well?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","That's a good question, Steve. First of all, it wasn't because of Walgreens. Actually, the Walgreens revenue transition happened exactly as expected. And as I mentioned, it actually was worth the $1.7 billion of decrease year-on-year for the quarter. I would say the other factors you mentioned though were all drivers. First of all, we did pick up some incremental business with existing customers, as well as some new business. We saw good volume growth organically with our existing customers. We did see a little bit stronger brand inflation than we had budgeted for. And as I said, just generic deflation was probably a little bit more moderate than we expected as well. And then on top of that, specialty had a nice pick up in Q1 as well from a revenue standpoint. So I'd say all those were contributors to an above-expectation performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a clarification regarding the EPS range for the remainder of the year. I know, Jeff, you said that guidance excludes tax benefit. But can you just clarify that, that applies to $2.70 to $2.80 for the remainder of the year?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Just to be clear, the guidance does include the $0.18 tax benefit in Q1, but it also includes an expectation that, that will largely be offset later in the year by negative tax adjustments. So net-net, all the tax is in there, but when you net them all against each other, they end up back at where we expected the tax range to be for the year, which is 34.5% to 36%. Well, my comment was that the change in the guidance range going from $3.45 to $3.60 to $3.62 to $3.72 was in no way linked to any changes in our assumptions about taxes. Really, the tax situation this year is really just a matter of timing in the quarters. Our basic expectation for taxes has not change at all.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So can you just help me through it, because I'm a little bit slow on that. What does that imply for the remainder of the year? Because I get 2 ranges, either $2.70 to $2.80 or $2.52 to $2.62.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","The range you should be assuming including taxes $3.62 to $3.72. What that implies, though, is that in a future quarter, we would likely have a significant negative tax impact which will offset the positive that we saw in Q1 and so those largely net against each other. But the $3.62 to $3.72 is the right range.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, I just wanted to follow up on some of the commentary you made with respect to generic pricing. Kind of sounds like you've been talking about more moderating deflation rates now for a couple, few quarters. I'm kind of curious to see if you're willing to call that a trend at this point. And then this quarter, it seems like a couple of you have called out certain supply disruptions and I'm kind of curious as to what's been driving the margin more. Is it the supply disruptions or is it the moderating rate of deflation?","George S. Barrett","Well, it's a hard one to answer. Let me try, Glen. I think the pattern that we've seen, we have seen now for quite some time, deflation on the bulk of products, on the bulk of products, largely as expected. On a few products that we modeled, the deflation was lower. And then on a few products, we actually saw some inflation. So that is -- those are sort of the big moving pieces. There are thousands of pieces in that equation, but I think that is the pattern that we've seen. And I'm not sure it's changed dramatically. And again, the question is, when you say trend, like would I model it going forward in the future, I would say right now, there's nothing in the market we're seeing that's going to change that, basic competition is as it is. We will very carefully watch every court case to see whether or not that -- we had one recently -- affect the number of competitors in a given product. But it has been a pattern that we've seen for some time. So as we talk about disruption, I really put that in the context more of whether or not there is some sets of products where competition seems more limited. And I think what can happen when you have some supply disruptions is the market that maybe had 6 or 7 players now has 3 or 4, or 2 or 3. And that may have a tendency to stabilize prices in that set of products. And I think we have seen some of that over the last couple of years. You've seen some well-publicized cases of some companies going through some facility issues. FDA, as you know, has done more for foreign inspection in recent years. And so I think that is a part of our current environment. And I expect that to continue. And so that's partly what we're seeing. How to tell you exactly how much is attributable to a disruption versus just sort of competitive behavior would be really hard to discern. I just think it's part of the general environment that we're seeing.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe if I could just ask one follow-up. I know you don't want to comment on calendar '14 and '15, but as you look at the patent expiration schedule over those -- over the next 24 months, we on The Street all have the tendency to want to look at the dollar value of brand going generic. Do one of those 2 years look bigger to you, or bigger opportunity for you versus the other, or they both look good, or neither as good as what we saw in the past couple of years? How would you characterize it?","George S. Barrett","Yes, so it's really early. I'm sorry, can't give you a full answer on this one. It's -- we just started our '14, it's hard to characterize '15. I think if we go back to the beginning of our year, we talked about the pattern, we probably saw '15 not altogether different than '14, but that was really in our fiscal year. It will be hard for me sort of off the top of my head to sort of give you a quick answer and probably would be a little bit hesitant to do so at this stage anyway. It's very early. But I would remind you of this and I think maybe our current performance highlights that. Jeff mentioned that our contribution from new products was actually less in this period and yet we had a very strong generic performance. So I guess, I'd remind you that while generic launches influence our performance, there are a lot of other things that actually contribute to how we generate growth and profits under our generic program. And we've been able to do that even in the face of what, I guess, you would call a headwind on new launch values. So that's just sort of a reminder.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","George, you mentioned specialty as a contributor. Was most of that coming from oncology, or are you seeing nice growth in the other therapeutic classes as well?","George S. Barrett","Yes, John, I think we're seeing growth everywhere, but oncology was probably the biggest driver in this particular period.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then a follow-up on medical, if you're willing. Could you give us a sense of how your operating income across medical breaks down into some of your key client categories? I'm thinking home care, now that you have AssuraMed, versus institutional versus perhaps ambulatory?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I'm not going to give you specifics, John, because we don't break it down that way publicly. I would still say our hospital and hospital-related business is the largest chunk of both revenue and earnings, followed by Home Health now with the addition of AssuraMed, followed by sort of pure ambulatory physicians offices, et cetera, that are unrelated to large IDN. That's sort of the rough order. Obviously, the biggest change there has been the big step up in Home Health over the last couple of months with the inclusion of AssuraMed.","George S. Barrett","I think I'll probably add that the rates don't necessarily follow that pattern. So the rates would probably be higher in the more ambulatory settings where the cost to serve and the requirements, how you do that, the pick\/pack operations and everything else is quite different. So I would say the rates are probably -- I'm not sure, they're completely inverted but more on the home ambulatory as you move back towards the big items.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom of Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Sorry if I missed this, but could you, Jeff, could you help us understand the next 3 quarter effect of not having Walgreens in your numbers from an EPS standpoint?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Probably not, is the honest answer. I'm always a little bit low to give directly attributable to a customer and I'm sure Walgreens wouldn't appreciate that either. But I will say, it's probably a repeat of what I said earlier, Q1, there was very little, if any, earnings impact, just given the nature of the wind down, despite the fact that revenue was down $1.7 billion. That will not be the case for the next 3 quarters of this year or the first quarter of next year until we lap it. There will be a meaningful both revenue and earnings impact, but all that impact has been reflected in our guidance from day 1 and continues to be reflected in our guidance.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That was a math question. You gave me an essay.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I was a lit major.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","English major, obviously. Okay. And then George, I know you touched on this, but just to kind of reset, obviously, your 2 competitors have done large deals overseas, trying to move toward global sourcing. You obviously ran a big generics supplier. Is there a card for you to play here potentially, or did you just not see the need for it? And what do you think the -- is there an opportunity cost in not pursuing what your competitors have been doing?","George S. Barrett","Yes, so as I'm going to give you, of course, an answer. You're going to hate it because it's going to be quite general, but I think we'll have to go with that. Which is, right now, we're competing very effectively and I like where we are. You can imagine that we're not sitting still. We have a pretty broad-based knowledge base of what's happening in markets around the world. There's very little that we don't explore. So as I mentioned, I think we are well positioned, but we are going to stay very open-minded about new ways to create value and -- but that has to be real value for customers and our suppliers and, obviously, for our shareholders. So we'll -- I guess, what I would say is, I think there are chess pieces always available and we'll keep our hands on those chess pieces. But we'll deploy capital with an open mind, but I'd say, with sort of a disciplined hand, always conscious of making sure that we're in the most competitive position. I know it's a very broad answer, but that's the best I can do for now.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's fine. And then shifting into a little more of a micro topic. How far -- if you look, say, 5 years out in the U.S. and think about cost containment pressures intensifying, how far off the value curve do you think, let's say, off-brand devices could get to? I mean, could we start talking about the equivalent of generic knees and hips and things like that, or do you think there's a limit to what can be done there?","George S. Barrett","Yes, so I'm not going to give you a specific answer, but I think it is reasonable to assume that we might view that we need both innovative medical devices, which continue to be developed. And I think actually some of the pressures will to be -- to develop more of them. But I think on mature products that we do need, given the cost containment pressures, some way of bringing greater competition to those products, we are on that issue. We understand that. I think your question is right on the mark. And it's not certainly complete analog to what we see in generics where you have sort of a mechanism that we call an AB rating that creates the go-to-market model. But I do think there are ways to do this, but it requires, I think, unique sets of skills. Those are clinical skills that we're building, that requires a go-to-market strategy. And you need to be doing it based on data and not just on a wish. And so we're doing all those things to put ourselves in a position to help support a system that probably needs some ways to reduce costs on some of these older, more mature products.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","George, I see Teva's looking for a new CEO. You're not getting antsy on us, are you?","George S. Barrett","I had a very public comment yesterday explaining that I was not a candidate. As you know, I've got great admiration for all that they do and had great experience there. I'm having a great time leading Cardinal Health and very committed to seeing our continued progress.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. Well, that really wasn't a trick, that really wasn't a trick. But the quarter was a treat, good job. 3 questions on specialty. I'll make it 1 question wrapped into 3 subparts. First off, I missed the growth rates. Second of all, can you give us a sense on where the oncology growth share is coming from and what's the nature of that business, community, hospital, other? And then third part, if distribution growth is accelerating more than services growth around specialty, does that lead to margin compression in the group or are you getting scale efficiencies that can allow overall specialty profitability to improve?","George S. Barrett","Let's start with Jeff.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Eric, it's Jeff. Let me start. We didn't give the number for specialty, but I'll give it to you now. Our Specialty Solutions group grew revenue 41% in Q1. George, do you want to take it from there?","George S. Barrett","Yes, I would say, primarily, it's coming in the community setting for now. Here's what I'd say. I think we're getting additional scale in distribution which gives us additional positioning and just sort of credibility in the offices. I do think that the services that wrap around this work is always critical. I think many of us can do distribution and I think we certainly established ourselves as a very credible and now a scale-based player in the distribution side. But I think it's very important to be able to deliver the kind of services that can help them in a very different world. And that's where things like our PathWare tools and other tools that help sort of connect these 3 players with the patients. Obviously, the 3 players being the biopharma company, the provider and the payor. But I think the wraparound services are very important for us.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And generically, on the margin profile, faster growth in distribution, does that weigh on the profile, or are you getting scale efficiencies there?","George S. Barrett","I think we expected our growth on the distribution side to be heavier. It's the nature of it. Obviously, distribution margin's relative, certain kinds of service margins are lower. But it's not negatively affecting our projection and how we expected this growth to occur. This is sort of as we saw it, we're pleased to see the growth on the revenue side, because it just means we're getting more presence.","All right. Listen, I think we're going to wrap up the call. So first, those of you who know, Sally is a rabid Red Sox fan. So we've been just trying to keep her on the ground today, she's a little excited. I'll just conclude by saying, it's been an excellent, excellent start, I think, to fiscal '14. And we really look forward to seeing all of you. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to seeing you in December and thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sally Curley. Please go ahead.","Sally Curley","Thank you, Jennifer, and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call today. We will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to the SEC filings and the forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of the presentation, found on the Investor page of our website, for a description of risks and uncertainties.","In addition, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures.

We hope to see many of you in an upcoming event.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett","Thanks, Sally. Good morning, everyone, and thanks to all of you for joining us on our third quarter call.","I'm pleased to report another strong period of results, with third quarter revenues of $25.4 billion, an increase of 18%. Third quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.19, up 18% from last year.","Based on the strength of our performance year-to-date, we are increasingly confident that we will finish our fiscal 2015 in the upper half of our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $4.28 to $4.38.","This is an extraordinary time in health care, and our organization is doing an outstanding job of serving today's needs, while at the same time, leveraging on our experience to address the demands of a system in transition. Our people have done this through a disciplined focus on execution by using our capabilities and insights to anticipate change and commit to providing solutions for emerging health care challenges.","With this as backdrop, since we last reported earnings, we've made some important moves in areas of strategic focus. On March 2, we announced our plan to acquire the Cordis cardiology business from Johnson & Johnson. And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of the specialty distribution business of Metro Medical, expanding our presence and reach in specialty business. I'll come back to each of these important initiatives in my segment remarks.","First, our Pharmaceutical segment.","Our Pharmaceutical segment had a very strong third quarter with revenues of $22.6 billion, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year third quarter. And our Pharmaceutical segment profit was up 25%.","The Pharmaceutical segment continues to operate with great efficiency, attention to detail and strong strategic position. Red Oak Sourcing, our joint venture with CVS Health, continues to operate extremely well. We can now report that suppliers representing nearly 100% of the total generic spend have transitioned into the venture. At time of great change, it is not just the scale which brings value to our customers, but also the combined knowledge of our 2 experienced organizations.","Our Specialty Solutions business continues to achieve extremely high growth rates. And earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of the specialty distribution business of Metro Medical, the largest privately owned specialty distributor in the U.S. This move strengthened our presence in the therapeutic areas of rheumatology, nephrology and oncology, expands our scale and positions us to provide more cost-effective services for our customers. For clarity, we expect to exceed the $5 billion specialty revenue figure for fiscal 2015, which we highlighted in our last earnings call, even without the contribution of the Metro Medical specialty business.","As you know, over the last few months, we've seen some important developments in the world of biosimilars, and we've said to you before, it's very difficult to make categorical predictions on the evolution of this new subset of products. We continue to believe that each product will have its own characteristics, driven by many factors, including: regulatory interchangeability; the disease which the drug addresses; the need for patient support; the location and mode of delivery; and of course, the competitive response. We feel well positioned to participate in each of these opportunities as they emerge, and the acquisition of Metro Medical expands our reach.","Turning to our Medical segment. We reported revenues for the quarter of $2.8 billion, an increase of 4% versus the prior year. Our segment profit was down 8% in an operating environment largely similar to that which we've outlined in prior quarters.","I'd like to take a few minutes to address this and give some perspective on the Medical segment's performance, positioning and role in Cardinal Health's growth plans.","This is the commentary I would more typically provided at year end. As our Medical numbers in the last few quarters have lagged below our high standards, I wanted to address it directly now.","We take great pride in being best-in-class in the distribution of traditional branded medical surgical products. The market forces have put pressure on prices in this legacy line of business. This is not new. In over recent years, we have been purposely building a range of new products and services that are strategically aligned with health care trends, are highly valuable to our customers, expand margins and build on our base in traditional distribution.","Why has this been a more difficult year for our Medical segment? Simply put, price erosion in that legacy branded med-surg distribution business, combined with the challenges in the Canadian market, have been more pronounced in this past year. And while we have seen uplift from the newer services and products, the uplift has not been large enough to offset those factors.","How have we been responding to this? We are relentlessly driving cost efficiency, while at the same time continuing to reposition our Medical segment portfolio to ensure we are bringing to market the products and services that meet the future needs of our customers in a rapidly changing environment. And I'd like to highlight a few of these moves.","We've expanded our consumable product line to position us to drive more Cardinal Health medical products and through more channels. Our move to acquire Cordis significantly enhances our scale, product line and capabilities in cardiology, building on our acquisition of AccessClosure and aligning with our overall strategy around physician preference items.","Together, they complement our moves in orthopedics and wound management to bring standardization and efficiency to medical devices, a major pain point for our IDN customers and a meaningful driver of profit growth in the coming years. More about Cordis in a few minutes.","Cardinal Health at Home, formerly AssuraMed, continues to grow significantly in excess of market growth. We have unique capabilities in the fulfillment and the complex administration of serving patients in the home. Our colleagues at Cardinal Health at Home interact with these patients every day. They are extremely well trained and totally committed to supporting the needs of these patients. We did complete one small home health tuck-in acquisition during the quarter. We continue to see great potential as more care is delivered in the home.","Our strategic partnership with Henry Schein is off to a good start. While still new, we are now able to bring the Schein physician practice capability to our IDN customers. We're beginning to ship products to Schein facilities and plans are to have the integration substantially completed during the June quarter. I had the opportunity in recent weeks to address the combined teams at the Schein's National Sales Meeting, and it was clear that the group is extremely optimistic about the opportunities in front of them.","To be clear, these strategic initiatives are not a departure from our traditional distribution. Rather, they draw upon our expertise, our considerable channel strength and the Cardinal Health name, to bring the additional products and services that our customers and patients need to thrive in this dynamic health care environment.","That leads to [ph] me going forward in our Medical segment. We don't expect major changes in the environment over the next few quarters, and we could see a bit of choppiness. But as we look forward and into the back half of FY '16, we would expect to see the new and growing business lines in the Medical segment and the increased utilization giving us a more sustainable uplift.","Going back to Cordis, which we announced on March 2, we are making excellent progress in our work to move towards closing. Leadership teams and organizational design have been defined in all key markets. And recently, we received early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, the first of a series of steps to close.","Finally, trying to continue this track record of double-digit growth, we continue to see great opportunities in this expansive market. It is very clear that the growth of the health care market in China will continue to outpace general economic growth, driven by demographics, lifestyle changes and strong government prioritization.","Overall, Cardinal Health is performing at a high level, generating strong cash flow and showing consistent growth. The repositioning of our portfolio over the last half decade has been driven by a clear perspective on how we see health care evolving. Most of our customers across multiple channels are experiencing new dynamics, as both public- and private-sector forces push them to deliver care more cost-effectively, in a more coordinated fashion, into emerging sites of care, in such a way as to bring the patient more squarely into the equation. Our ability to offer a broad and integrated set of solutions across the continuum of care and to continue to innovate around our customer base has enabled new opportunities for growth, at the same time, helped us to absorb the bumps that can occur in a system going through rapid change. I think it's an indicator of the overall strength of our portfolio that even through this transition, we expect to deliver non-GAAP operating earnings growth for this full fiscal year in the mid-teens.","There's no other health care company that has quite the range of tools we can bring to the market and do so at a time when comprehensive solutions are the need of the day. Put another way, we can address a larger percentage of virtually any customer's overall business than any other company in health care.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.","Michael C. Kaufmann","Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today to hear about our strong third quarter results.","My comments will walk through our third quarter consolidated financial performance as well as expectations for the quarter ahead as we close out our 2015 fiscal year. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share grew 18% to $1.19. Total company revenues were $25.4 billion, which was also an increase of more than 18%. Total company gross margin dollars were up more than 12% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Consolidated SG&A increased 9% versus the prior year, with the largest driver being acquisitions. Next, non-GAAP operating earnings in the quarter were $656.7 million, which is a 17% growth versus the prior year.","Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense came in at $32.7 million in the quarter. As a reminder, Q3 of the prior fiscal year included a $0.06 per share after-tax gain related to the sale of our minority equity interest in 2 investments.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate in the quarter was 36.5%, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding were about 334 million.","Moving to operating cash flows. We generated $658 million in the quarter. At March close, our cash balance was $3.2 billion, with $447 million of this held offshore. We remain committed to our previously stated balanced capital deployment policy of focusing on reinvesting in our business and maintaining our differentiated dividend, while pursuing strategic M&A and stock buybacks on an opportunistic basis.","Next, I'll review each segment's performance.","Let's start with the Pharmaceutical segment. Revenues were up 20% year-over-year to $22.6 billion due to the growth of existing and new customers across all business lines in the segment.","Segment profit was $567 million, an increase of 25% versus the prior year. This was due to the strong performance of our generics program, including the net benefit of Red Oak Sourcing as well as growth from our existing customers and contribution from new customers.","Segment profit margin rate increased by 10 basis points, driven by the performance of our generics program, which offset the impact of customer price changes and the dilutive impact of sales of branded hepatitis C therapies.","Clearly, the performance of our generics program has been excellent. Enhanced sourcing under Red Oak customer wins and growth of existing accounts have all been key drivers. Manufacturer price inflation or deflation, new item launches, penetration of existing accounts and advanced pricing analytics are also factors in determining our program's success. I remain confident we can balance all of these for continued growth in our generics program.","Besides the contribution from generics, our branded drug business continues to go well with strong performance under our fee-for-service agreements. As has been typical over the past several years, inflation tends to be a larger component in the third quarter versus other quarters. The rate of inflation was essentially the same as the prior year, in the low double digits.","As George mentioned, in our Specialty business, we closed the acquisition of Metro Medical earlier this month. Let me give you a few details.","Metro Medical has various business lines. We acquired their specialty distribution, specialty GPO, specialty pharmacy and private label medical surgical disposable products business. The Metro Medical Online and Metro Medical Partners pieces of the business were not included in the acquisition. This acquisition will provide us the opportunity to expand our Specialty distribution scale and deepen our reach into the rheumatology, nephrology and oncology markets. We have been working on this deal for several months and had already contemplated the bottom line impact in our FY '15 EPS guidance range.","Now let's move to our Medical segment performance.","Third quarter revenue grew 4% to $2.8 billion, primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions. The segment profit declined by $9.1 million to $101.5 million. This was a result of the decline in the contribution of national brand med-surg distribution and the continued impact of the previously communicated challenges in the business in Canada. These same drivers contributed to a margin rate decline of 50 basis points versus the prior year period.","Let me give you a few other highlights to consider.","First, revenues from our strategic accounts continues to significantly outpace our remaining book of business. In addition, top line growth from our higher-margin wraparound services is outpacing overall Medical segment revenues.","Our Cardinal Health at Home business has grown at or above market each quarter of this fiscal year.","And finally, we are continuing to build out the physician preference items strategy. In this space, our acquisitions of AccessClosure and Innovative Therapies are off to a good start and are performing better than the business case.","Our recent announcement of our intend to acquire Cordis, which we still expect to close before the end of the calendar year, will only accelerate our work in this space. Let me reiterate some key points surrounding this deal.","First, we will be acquiring Cordis for $1.944 billion in cash or approximately $1.6 billion, net of roughly $350 million in cash tax benefits. Next, we plan to finance the acquisition with debt and cash on hand. Our intent is to issue debt sometime in the next few months and take out the $1 billion bridge financing that we secured as a contingency.","From a non-GAAP EPS perspective, we expect slight dilution in FY '16 as a result of the 3 factors that we mentioned at the time of the announcement: first, FY '16 will only include a partial year of Cordis earnings; second, we expect approximately a full year of interest expense estimated at $0.07 to $0.08; and third, there will be $0.13 to $0.15 of unfavorable impact due to an inventory fair value step up.","Then in fiscal 2017, the first full year post close, we expect the transaction to be greater than $0.20 accretive and increasingly accretive thereafter. We still expect operational synergies of at least $100 million annually by the time we exit fiscal 2018.","Before I move to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, I'd like to add a few updates on China, which reports into both segments. Our businesses in China continued to perform well. We continued to see strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter, up 25%. Also, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition of a local distributor in northeastern China, which expands our local direct distribution to 11 cities.","Turning to Slide #6, you will see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related cost, which reduced our GAAP results by $0.15 per share.","Looking forward, we are increasingly confident in the upper half of our non-GAAP EPS range of $4.28 to $4.38.","Let me finish with the following updates around our corporate assumptions. We continue to expect our full year non-GAAP tax rate range to be between 36% to 37%. This obviously implies that our fourth quarter rate will be higher, likely between 38% and 41%, based on the timing and outcome of various discussions we are having with tax authorities.","We are expecting capital expenditures to come in at about $330 million and our full year amortization expectations increase to about $190 million based on the acquisitions we have completed as of March 31. We don't expect the Metro Medical acquisition to add a significant amount to our final number for the year.","In closing, we're pleased with our overall performance in the third quarter, recognizing that we've got some important work to do in Medical to shift the trajectory. We've taken great steps during the past several years to build a strong foundation for sustainable future growth. That's why, across the enterprise, I expect a solid finish to our fiscal year.","With that, let's begin Q&A. Operator, please take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Bob Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. As we think about the performance in Medical, George, it seems like volumes have been improving on the inpatient side. You've added some accretive margin deals. It sounds like private label is still growing, yet the business has struggled. And I know you mentioned Canada being an issue for the balance of the year. So I'm just curious if you can maybe give us some insight on when you think this business could really start to turn around.","George S. Barrett","Bob, thanks for the question. Yes, look, Canada has definitely been a tough challenge all year, and as you said, we tried to be pretty clear about the work that we need to do and are doing in the Med segment. I think we just have to get through some sort of short-term choppiness. I mentioned during the call that sort of the traditional -- the legacy lines of sort of traditional branded med-surg has been a large of the challenge, and it's really been largely re-pricing of some accounts. I think we'll start to see the benefit of all the initiatives that we've described begin to more sustainably feel like uplift as we get into the second half of '16. But I actually like our position. I think we're doing really good work. If you look underneath the numbers, over the last 3 years, for example, we've had very good growth of our private label products, a good contribution of margin from them. So it's really about this shift in the model where the legacy line is becoming a smaller component of the overall mix and those newer products and services are beginning to grow. So we've done some really important work there. We've made some big moves this year to sort of strengthen that, and feel good about that.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could just sneak one in on Specialty, I know in the quarter you acquired Metro Medical, just curious maybe if you'd give a little bit more on how that business specifically enhances your Specialty footprint. And then I know broadly, George, you've gotten this question in the past, but increasingly seems like Specialty is obviously in a very important channel for the wholesalers. And I'm just curious, how do you feel about your footprint even in light of the Metro Medical deal? And are there bigger deals out there that could really give you greater exposure to this important channel?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Bob, let me answer that, and I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the first part of the question again. But Metro Medical really just helps us expand our reach. We've been growing at a pretty hefty clip over these last couple of years. And I think our scale is now at a point where we really are a meaningful factor in the market. I think that's important, given some of the trends in health care, and Metro Medical just expands that reach in that footprint. So we're excited about it. Whether or not there are other opportunities out there, we continue to look at every opportunity that's in our areas of strategic focus. Obviously, Specialty is one. Whether or not you find the assets at the right moment at the right price is always a question for us. But this is clearly an area of priority, and so we'll continue to look for opportunities. But we're excited about the Metro Medical. Again, just sort of backing up. I wanted to make sure I highlight this on the Medical, just as a reminder. Our customers are really becoming much more complex. They're no longer a single line of activity. And so I do think that's part of what we've felt strongly about is that these complex systems need products and services across all of the lines of business. So that's really important at a time where you're seeing the change in incentives, which has been completely activity-based over the year, just a different kind of incentive system. I think the tools we really bring are going to become increasingly important. So just I didn't want to miss the opportunity to say that related to the first part of the question.","Operator","We'll go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A question on M&A. Post Cordis, what is your appetite for M&A? Obviously, you did Metro Medical, which is on the smaller size. But what leverage are you comfortable going up to? And when you think about the areas you're interested, obviously Specialty is one, but maybe if can kind of rank order them for us?","George S. Barrett","Yes. So first -- again, appetite is a -- we want to grow this business. We want sustainable competitive positioning, and we believe that there are key areas strategically that are aligned with where care is going. And we've been pretty clear about that. It's around generics. It's around specialty. It's around every opportunity to improve performance management for large integrated customers. It's the home, opportunities in China, which is a unique market. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. Obviously, we have a strong balance sheet. But again, we're going to be very disciplined about the moves we make, when we make them, how we make them, to make sure that we can execute, and that's always been a priority for us. But we feel well positioned, strong balance sheet. I don't know if Mike you want to add anything to that.","Michael C. Kaufmann","Yes. Ricky, I think -- again, it's going to depend and whether it's a strategic fit, whether the culture fits for us, the growth trajectory, all of those types of things of the acquisitions. But from a balance sheet standpoint, we have said that we would like to keep our debt ratio to 1.5 to 1.75 is the range that we're comfortable in. Could we at times make a decision to go slightly above that for the right type of acquisition and stretch ourselves some? Sure, we would be open to doing that. We're always going to want to be concerned about where our -- where the debt rating agencies see us, and that's an important thing for us to consider and how they view it. And so sometimes, the type of acquisition matters when we deal with those folks. And so -- and remember, it's the last thing, too, we like to keep about $1 billion to $1.5 billion of cash on hand just for our everyday working capital and needs because of the fluctuations in the business. So those are some of the things that we try to keep in mind.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. Obviously, in the prepared remarks, you talked about the strong branded inflation. I think it was in the low double digits. And we're hearing strong inflation on generics. Where do you think we are in the pricing cycle and kind of like the sustainability of the trend, kind of like across your portfolio? Because we're seeing it both on brand, generic and specialty.","George S. Barrett","Ricky, I'll start with it, but then I'll welcome Mike to join in. Predicting this going forward is always difficult. The branded side, as you've seen, has been, on average, which is interesting, relatively consistent for a while. But actually, inside that average, there's a lot of different rates. And so it's one of the things that makes it in a way hard to predict, but in some ways little easier because you have this smoothing affect. On generics, it is such a tough call because, as you know, it is an enormous product line that we call generics. And so the number of products that can move the needle can be relatively small, and you can talk about 50, 75, 100 products that move the needle. So it's really difficult for us to give a forward-looking guidance on what we see. We've done this in the past, and I probably do it today -- we talked about the environment and what are the conditions of the environment. And I'm not sure that those conditions have changed materially from last period, but we have seen some variance -- variation. Mike can touch on that.","Michael C. Kaufmann","Yes, I would agree with George. On the branded space, it's been pretty consistent over the last several years that branded inflation rate has stayed in that double digits -- low double-digits area, and we've not seen a lot of fluctuation there. I just wanted to really call it out, this quarter remind folks of the seasonality component and why the third quarter tends to be bigger than some of the other quarters. And again, we all know the majority of the fees are earned on the fee-for-service agreement, so inflation is a much -- on brand, is a much lower component of our margins than it used to be in the buy-and-hold period. But again, in the third quarter, it's important, so that's really why we call it out. On generics, it is important, but one of the things that we keep trying to emphasize is that in our mind, it probably gets a little bit too much attention at times because there are a lot of other levers in our generics program that are going to help us perform over the years. And we really believe confidently that even in a -- if generic inflation were to decline, there's a lot of other levers for us around our penetration, around our pricing and analytics capabilities, around new business that we won, et cetera, that we can still compete effectively and perform well.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Percher.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So med-surg, 2 questions. One would be your comment in the press release on national brand distribution. Is that meant to reflect your commentary on pricing erosion, or is there anything else meant by that? And then also relative to Canada, have we now reached a point where next quarter will anniversary some of those initial issues and customer departures or movement in-house? Does that help in the second half?","George S. Barrett","Yes. So really, Eric, what we're talking about primarily is really pricing on the traditional med-surg. It's probably not much more complicated than that. And a lot of that is actually repricing some meaningful accounts for us, which we were happy to have in the long run, important customers, strategic customers. I'm sorry, the second part of your question?","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Within Canada, it feels like it's been about a year since we first saw some of those issues. I know there were a couple of customers that moved in-house. Will we now anniversary that?","George S. Barrett","Yes, so here's what I would say, and I mentioned this earlier. I would say probably a couple of choppy quarters. And then I think we're taking some pretty significant actions in Canada to address some changes in that market, and I think then we'll start to feel a more normalized rate.","Michael C. Kaufmann","Eric, I would expect us to still see some pressures in Canada through the end of the calendar year. So it will still affect us for the first 2 quarters of FY '16. And then beginning in our Q3 of '16, we begin to see a more normal and leveling off in the Canadian business.","Operator","We'll go next to David Larsen with Leerink.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Can you guys talk a bit about biosimilars and what's sort of opportunity you're looking at? And maybe just touch on the different channels that biosimilars will flow through. If they ship to the member at home where they self-inject or if they ship to the doc office, are you better positioned in any one of those channels than the other?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Again, I'm not sure I can add that much to what I said in my earlier comments, but again, I'll just sort of highlight this. And we've -- I think, many of you have asked this over the years, something we've been anticipating in terms of biosimilars -- that we've always felt that there would be some uniqueness to each product. And as you said, the route of administration, which channel it goes through, whether or not there's substitutability, these are all things that will influence what kind of services the patient needs. We actually feel well positioned, regardless of route, is what I would tell you. So as you know, we've got a extremely strong position in hospitals. We've expanded our position in all kinds of clinics. We're very strong in pharmacy. We have got specialty pharmacy. So clinics are an area. And now, obviously, we've got some enhanced strength in the small physician practices. So I think, from our standpoint, we've got great reach across therapeutic areas, which is very important. And from a channel perspective, I think we're in a pretty good position, regardless of that route.","Michael C. Kaufmann","The only thing I would add to that, George, is that also from a services standpoint upstream to the manufacturer, we feel that we're in as good or better position than anybody in the industry to provide any type of services that they might need, whether it'd be specific cold chain or other type of transportation needs. Whether it'd be hub services, data and analytics, we know that we can provide all of the services too. So we really feel that we're in a great position, both upstream and downstream, on biosimilars.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","George and Mike, if you're willing, thinking about some of the puts and takes for next fiscal year, how do you feel about the outlook realizing it's early compared to some of your longer-term growth goals?","George S. Barrett","So again, John, it's a little early for us to be saying a lot about '16. We're finishing our budget process. Obviously, at year end we provide guidance. But in terms of our long-term goals, we still feel good about those. The organization right now has -- it feels like a lot of momentum, actually. And I think, if you go around Cardinal Health, I think you'd see a group that's very energized. We're very clear about our goals, very disciplined in managing to those. And we'll have a little bit of bumps in any part of the business, but the overall Cardinal enterprise feels good and on target to achieve the goals that we've set up.","Michael C. Kaufmann","No, I would agree. We do need to get through the budgeting process this summer. That's really important. Probably the only thing that we've really mentioned about next year that I can give you a quick update on was around the commodities. And we did say that, for FY '16, that they would be about $10 million to $20 million of benefit from commodities. We have updated that work, and we can still continue to believe that that's the right number for next year. I know that's only one small component that goes into it, but it is the only thing that we've really giving you any insight on.","George S. Barrett","I guess and the Cordis -- and the Cordis mechanics.","Michael C. Kaufmann","And then the Cordis mechanics that I've walked through, yes.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Very helpful. Just one quick follow-up on Red Oak. As you move into year 2, it sounds like you've pretty much finished your work with supplier recontracting. What happens next? Is there an opportunity for meaningful growth in year 2 as well?","Michael C. Kaufmann","Yes, I'm really excited about where we are in Red Oak. We -- I serve on the board of Red Oak and recently had a board meeting and continue to be incredibly impressed with the team. We've, again, been able to retain all of the key folks from both companies and have decades of generic buying experience on there, which -- again, to get through essentially 100% of the spend in this short a period of time has been exciting. We do expect there to be uplift in FY '16. A big piece of that will just because we'll have a full year of all of the benefits while we were ramping this year. But even on top of that, we do expect to continue to generate value. And as I met with the team, they're constantly looking at different ways to work with the manufacturers to try to create more incremental value for both parties.","Operator","We'll go next to Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And George, I just want to kind of come back and revisit this Medical segment issue a little bit further. You talked, obviously, a lot on the call about the pricing pressure within the segment. Is that repricing certain GPO customers that you got hit with? And is there anything else on the horizon that would impact the pricing as we go forward over the next 12 months? And I'm also kind of curious, could you talk about the overall pricing of the underlying inventory you're selling? Are you seeing price deflation on the products you're selling, or is that still somewhat inflationary? Is that impacting the profit margins at all either?","George S. Barrett","I am going to come back to the second part. And I'm not completely sure I understand the question, but we'll make sure we do and then Mike will address that. But this is really not a GPO issue, Glen, and so this is just individual accounts that happen to fall during a period of time where we're signing some long-term agreements. No single one of them, by the way, is big enough to call out or necessarily move the needle. It's just a general dynamic. What again I wanted to highlight during the call is that, over many years, the traditional, what we call, branded med-surg business is going through this kind of dynamic, and so that's really not new. So I don't want to make it sound like there is one big contract that was the key, which is some repricing in that aspect of the business we felt. And I hope that answers that part of it. The second part of the question, Mike, did you get?","Michael C. Kaufmann","Let me take a stab at it, and if I don't get it right, Glen, please just ask again. But I agree with George as far as the GPOs. We always work with them, but in tandem, we work individually with the hospitals. And if you take a look at the product portfolios, I don't think this is really necessarily a deflationary environment on all the items. You're going to see certain items that may go up and some they're going to go down, but I wouldn't say there's any one trend either way that is actually affecting this. This is just our ultimate net price to the customer themselves, not the items driving it.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Maybe if I can just ask one follow-up. I mean, could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on what the challenge is in the Canadian market? Because it kind of sounds like it's going to persist for another 2 to 3 quarters, and I think it'd be helpful if you'd kind of just remind us exactly what that issue is.","Michael C. Kaufmann","Really 2 things. One is similar to what we just described, some repricing of customers. And as we mentioned last time, there were a couple of customers that we did lose in Canada that we won't actually anniversary until the end of the calendar year. One of those brought in-house, the services they were doing, and one switched to a competitor. So that's really what's driving it is a loss of a couple of larger customers as well as some pricing and retention of some other customers, and those are really 2 big factors.","George S. Barrett","The other piece that I'd mention is, there's been some shifting of reimbursement dynamics around that market, and so again, that is a component of that pricing aspect.","Michael C. Kaufmann","And remember, those customer losses are not new ones. Those are the ones I mentioned last quarter that are out there. It just was going to take to the end of the calendar year for us to anniversary them.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI, Research Division","So I wanted to just touch base regarding Cordis. So obviously, you haven't closed the deal yet, but you do have very close relationships with some of your physician and hospital partners. You've got some key thought leaders in the field that you interact with on a regular basis. What's the dialogue been post the announcement now that, that's seasoned a bit with those individuals? And what other sort of things has it sparked in your mind as you think about kind of the long-term strategic value of the endeavor?","George S. Barrett","Yes. So this is -- it's been actually a really interesting period since the announcement. A couple of things happened, many of which we thought could happen, which is just a high amount of energy around this inside our organization. I think, the people that are going to be joining us from J&J are pretty excited about where this falls for us in terms of priority. We're getting great feedback from our advisory boards. As I think we've mentioned before, we've got really world-class advisory boards who are working with us. We've started to, as you might imagine hear from other players in the market, who recognize that we might be an interesting partner for them as we expand our commercial capabilities, both here and outside the U.S., in these medical products. So I think what we're seeing is a pretty high level of enthusiasm across the board. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to get to the finish line and the closing. But it's been really well received. And I think that one of the things that I would highlight is, people are now beginning to realize that it's not just about the product. And so that we are talking about a different service offering in terms of being able to bring the medical device and some wraparound services that help manage inventory, eliminate waste, prevent errors, these are all part of the strategy in helping in the physician preference area. So I think what's happening both internally and externally is that our excitement about joining those 2 components, the service component and the product component, are giving us a pretty good sense of optimism about the future on this.","Operator","We'll go next to Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm just wondering, can you give us maybe some color, George, around the size of Metro Medical? Obviously, you talked about it being in 2015 numbers, but maybe on a revenue basis, how big is this?","George S. Barrett","Lisa, unfortunately, I can't provide that information right now. I think what we -- as we come out of our year and we start guiding into next year, I think some of that will become a little bit more apparent. But at this point, I can't provide more information. I'm sorry.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, as we think about Red Oak and we think about relationships with manufacturers, there is a lot of talk about continued consolidation of generic manufacturers. Can you talk at all about your expectation, you or Mike, around Red Oak and how that will impact you going forward?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Well, let me just start and then Mike can speak more specifically to Red Oak. Lisa, as you know, consolidation is not really new to the industry, it's been happening for quite some time. It's something we're used to. It's a dynamic we understand. And it's one of the reasons that having scale is really important, and it's also a reason that's sort of the knowledge base [ph] of what each supplier's strategy is all about. But that actually matters, because ultimately what we're looking for in the best of situations is those win-win moments. So I think we understand the landscape well and we know the players well. And so consolidation -- so it can be a double-edged sword, but I think for us, we see the opportunity to work more closely with companies. We see that as an opportunity. Mike, I don't know if you want to sort of add to it more narrowly from the Red Oak perspective.","Michael C. Kaufmann","Probably the only thing I would add is that, first, I guess I would emphasize I really like where our relationships are with the manufacturers. They value us. They understand the simplicity and the speed of our model, and particularly, the transparency. And the feedback we're getting from manufacturers around those components has been incredibly positive. And what that leads to is us being willing to try new things with them. And we are also very focused on not only the large manufacturers but also smaller and medium-size ones that have really mentioned that they appreciate that they've been able to be part of the program. And so, again, consolidation is part of the industry. But we like where we're at. And we think, in certain situations, if we needed to, we can work with folks to try to create the right competitive environment to get the type of pricing we need.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I guess just within the Medical segment, I'm curious in relation to the Cordis acquisition. Is your plate going to be pretty full over the next year just on the integration of this fairly large asset? Or if, let's say, other medical manufacturing assets are potentially available for acquisition, would you have the bandwidth to do additional medical manufacturing M&A deals in this segment over the next years?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Thanks, Steve. Yes. So obviously, I'm going to answer this with some care. Let me just start with the basics. As I mentioned earlier, our balance sheet is strong. Our organizational capacity is very significant. But we always put a high priority on execution. And so we think about, when we look at acquisitions, not just the financial capacity to execute and integrate, but the organizational capacity to do that. So we're very mindful of that. I would also note that we have a very broad-based employee population. So for example, we can have a group of folks that are very deeply dedicated to the integration of one asset and literally another group whose lives are untouched by that. And so what we are mindful of as we look across opportunities externally is making sure that we're not doubling down on those people who are trying to do a one-to-one execution, execution of one deal. But always mindful of that, but I think we have a pretty talented diverse organization with a lot of capacity. But we'll always think about execution.","Operator","We'll go next to John Ransom with Raymond James.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just had a question about the independent pharmacy channel. Are you seeing any more signs of stress in that channel just given some of the fundamentals around generic inflation and reimbursement squeeze? And if so, are you approaching that marketplace differently than, say, you were 3 or 4 years ago?","George S. Barrett","John, let me start first, and then I'm going to turn it to Mike. Again, we'll probably have 2 angles on this. We've been doing really well providing value to these independent pharmacy customers. And so I think the key is recognizing that there are certain market dynamics and market pressures that they deal with, and what we do is focus on how do we relieve those pressures, how do we create value in that environment? So I think what's happened is we've become increasingly targeted on how we create value for those kinds of customers in this kind of environment. And our organization has done a really good job in terms of expanding our position there and growing some share, and I feel good about our position with how we're creating value. But certainly, there are pressures out there that they have to deal with. I think we're doing a lot to help them.","Michael C. Kaufmann","I mean, I can think of a couple of specific examples. First of all, obviously, Red Oak and our ability to be competitive from a generic programs and recognizing the need and how we price generics at different lifecycles of reimbursement, that's always important to do that. Our PSAO has been growing steadily, and we've added a lot of members. And we've been able to do some unique things with them and get out and market our PSAO and work with our customers to help them on their star ratings to make sure that they are the type of customers that the PBMs want to do business with, and we are incredibly excited about those. And then in other areas in the out front part of the store, we've been expanding our programs and opportunities there to work with the folks. And we really like where we're headed with some of our Cardinal private label lines and our opportunities to help them manage inventory, both on the out front and behind the counter. So we have a lot that we're doing. I wouldn't say that we're seeing any decline that we've seen in this. We continue to grow our share in that space. And that's how I feel. One thing, though, if you didn't know what I meant, and for those on the phone, about the PSAO, that's our third-party contracting arm where we work with third-party payers to -- on behalf of our retail independents to get them reimbursements.","John W. Ransom - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And my other question, just checking in on your other channel. You sell under a lot of IDNs. What are they asking for from you that they were not asking for 2 years ago? And is there any effect yet that you're seeing from the ACA in terms of what capabilities you need?","George S. Barrett","Yes. It's a really interesting question because I think what they're seeing is a -- I think, many of the big acute care and integrated systems are recognizing that in a world where there's probably some shifting in incentives, where you're looking at bundles of care in payments, where there are penalties for readmission, they're just beginning to look at each line more holistically. I think that one of the changes that we have seen, certainly you still have to be very, very competitive in each line, is that the institution at the enterprise level of the IDN is thinking holistically about how do we compete, how do we thrive in this new environment? And I think that's why our work across the enterprise is particularly resonating right now, because we're really not just able to -- we're not just talking about lines of business. We are talking about being able to address a huge percentage of their activity, and I think we're sort of the only one that can do this in quite that way.","Operator","We'll go next to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a couple of questions on the quarter. So first, on the Pharma segment. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the revenue growth of 20%? You called out growth from both new and existing customers, so maybe if you could break those 2 out or give us an idea. And any other relevant metrics, such as volume growth or other inflation, hep C so on and so forth?","Michael C. Kaufmann","Yes. So I can give you a little color. First of all, the hep C component of our growth is still less than 25% of the overall growth. I mean, it's an important driver, but it is less than 25%. New customers would be the largest component of our growth. And then growth on our existing customers would be next. Keep in mind, with branded drug inflation being in the low double digits, that's going to be a huge driver of overall top line revenue growth, particularly in a market where you haven't seen very large generic launches that would be taking away some top line volumes. So I think those would be the key drivers to help you understand that.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Useful. And then as a follow-up, on the branded side of the business. Has the non-fee-for-service, so the buy-and-hold portion of the business, remain the same as a percent of the entire business? And within it, have the mechanics changed at all in the past few quarters, maybe a couple of years, to alter the profitability profile in any meaningful way?","Michael C. Kaufmann","No, that's been really, really steady. Over an annual period, it's still averaging about 80% is noncontingent of our branded buy-side piece. And then -- but as I mentioned in the third quarter, it's a little bit more slanted towards inflation. But again, over a whole year period, it's still running 80%. The agreements continue to be about the same. Often, they renew very similar terms and conditions. We continue to tweak them, but this is an area that we continue to feel good about.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Hey, George or Mike, maybe this is more a J&J question, but can you give us any color on the Cordis kind of results, or, hopefully, post J&J controlled announcement, the wheels don't come off there? And maybe remind us of your budget plans there and what infrastructure you would want to put in place internationally to really maximize that opportunity?","George S. Barrett","Unfortunately, the first part of your question really is a J&J question, and I can't answer for them. Regarding the second, we have been really hard at work on really working across the globe on what that organization is going to look like. And I think, it all feels like it's going very well in the U.S. As you know, we have some cardiology assets here, and so that we've been looking at how we're going to coordinate and integrate those activities, have a very clear game plan. x U.S., I think we've got organizational design under control. I think we've got the leadership in all key markets. Looking about key positions, we want to make sure that we retain some of the great tradition of that existing Cordis, but we want to bring some of that Cardinal approach to it. And so I think what we're -- one of the things that I mentioned earlier, Bob, that I think is interesting is, as we go outside the U.S. and we talk to the organization -- again, recognizing that certain conversations we can't have at this stage as 2 separate companies, they're particularly interested in our service model in how we can help bring additional efficiency because of the medical device side of it. So I think people are beginning to realize that we can bring more than product skill. Again, short-term critical issue for us, I talked about execution earlier, we're sort of the Hippocratic Oath, \"do no harm.\" So where the businesses are performing very well -- and there are many, many markets where there are 1 or 2 in the market, we're going to make sure that we \"do no harm\" there and keep the business executing. So I hope that helps an answer.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe just a point to drill down. You're looking at the services side of things, obviously. But is there ever an R&D line item that you'll be breaking out with this and other assets that you have in place now requiring a bit more investment on that front?","George S. Barrett","That's a good question. In terms of how we break it out, I can't answer it fully yet. What I can tell you in strategy, in strategy, this is not going to be a big research-based business unit inside of us. They'll be development because -- and we do that today, by the way. As a medical device company today, we're doing D of D [ph] as in development all the time. But you should not expect us to be a research-based med device company in a big way. That's not really the game plan here.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Francis with RBC Capital Markets.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to go after the specialty piece a little different angle. Kind of looking at the fact that you guys are at a $5 billion revenue level or will be as you exit the year there, is the business now, either from a critical mass of revenue perspective or a service portfolio perspective, now at that place where you think you're big enough to grow the business organically through internal development efforts above the market rate? Or do you still need to deploy capital externally to get to the point where you are able to capture additional market share?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Actually, the answer is, we are growing it organically, quite rapidly. So that's the good news. I think we have the scale. We've got great talents. It's a really innovative group. We have got a pretty good group behind that driving new models for how to create value for our specialty customers and our suppliers. So I think we're actually getting very strong organic growth and we would continue to expect to, but again, we'll look for opportunities to deploy capital if we see opportunity. But we're getting very strong organic growth.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then as a quick follow-up, looking back at the med-surg business. You guys have been spending a lot of time trying to get the business repurposed and a little more focused on the ambulatory side of the business as well. Can you talk about trends that you're seeing in terms of actual utilization or actual volumes being pushed outside of the inpatient environment that might be starting to pay dividends for you in terms of the investments in the home health and other ambulatory environments?","George S. Barrett","Yes. So thanks, Dave. So there, the -- I would say, these trends in terms of care moving, home acute [ph] care to ambulatory settings is probably unambiguous. This is absolutely happening across the board. And getting actual exact numbers in this is difficult because I think our system is not use to tracking this. I don't mean Cardinal system, I'd say the -- those who track this kind of data. But when we talked to IDN customers and we looked at our data, it's pretty clear that more activity is being driven to different sites of care, and I think that plays to the strategy. It helps explain some of the moves that we've made, and I think it's really going to be, for us, as we go forward, a tailwind, because I think that, that is a natural byproduct of some of the changes in the incentive systems in the industry.","Michael C. Kaufmann","We've seen a lot of that with our at-home business already with those change in the dynamics that it continues to grow not only significantly but above market itself. So we've [indiscernible] mix there in our ambulatory surgery center business where we continue to have very large share. That's another area that we really like.","Operator","We'll go next to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Obviously, a lot of discussion on Medical. I guess maybe one last question on this topic, but maybe following up on the last question here. I think part of, George, when you talked about repurposing the Medical business, you also talked about having a more extensive dialogue with the c-suite of your hospital customers. And it was something maybe that the organization wasn't really in deep with previously. Can you talk about where you are in that progress to really kind of explain what Cardinal can do for them and for IDNs in general? And so, look, maybe like where we are at that stage, in what inning, and how much further can we get -- do we need to go before we can really drive that, I guess?","George S. Barrett","Yes, that's a hard question. And as you guys think about the \"what inning we are in,\" that's always a hard question because the system is going through this change. Let me highlight a couple of things. Again, as a reminder, I would say our largest customers across health care are becoming more complex, more integrated and their needs now cross more products and services than we've seen historically. So we have been, at the same time, aligning with that, and one of the things we did over the last year is to sort of create these strategic account teams. We've always had strength in our selling organization, selling lines of business. We will continue to do that, but I think a part of what we've been trying to leverage, and this is what you're touching on, is that need for the integrated system for that complex customer to think about a changing world and which are the partners who can help them. So again, as I think about changing from an industry which has been activity-based to one with different incentives to sort of a pay-for-outcome or a fee-for-outcome, I think all the tools that we bring, standardized consumables, private label and medical products, services that enable increased efficiencies, helping them navigate across their channels, our physician preference strategy, our work in the home, these are all valuable to them. And then you combine this with our pharmaceutical lines and our specialty, and I think we have sort of a unique set of offerings. We're trying to make sure that we are positioned to address that at the most senior levels of the organizations, because it's really now about competing in a world that looks in the future a little bit different than it did historically.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mike, I just wanted to touch on something quickly. I thought I heard you say in your prepared comments, but I might have gotten the notes wrong. Did you say the customer price changes were serving as a headwind in the drug distribution business? And if you did say that, can you put a little more color around what that meant?","Michael C. Kaufmann","Yes, it was one of the offsets. So we said the positives was the growth in new customers and the net benefits from Red Oak that were offsetting some of the customer price changes. And those wouldn't be anything more than the normal types of day-to-day renewals we see with all of our customers. So there's really nothing new there, no new news. It's just typical. It always tends to be one of our largest headwinds, and we're constantly working on the opposite side, obviously, to more than offset those.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. So just the kind of the normal pricing pressure that's not part of renewals?","Michael C. Kaufmann","Yes.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then maybe just, as we've talked about pricing pressure in the med-surg business, I guess, George or Mike, how should we think about how that pricing pressure impacts what will be the Cordis business? And is that business immune from that pricing pressure, or will that see pricing pressure as well?","George S. Barrett","Well, I'm always reluctant to say anything is immune from pricing pressure, that's obviously -- would be a big statement to make. But I think we're really talking primarily about something that is a dynamic that's been occurring over some time in, what I would call, the traditional legacy med-surg business. I really would not sort of connect that necessarily -- line of business. This is just a trend that we've seen for some time. And I think what we're seeing with the other lines of business is actually they are drivers in the opposite direction.","Operator","At this time, there is no further questions. I'll turn the call back to George Barrett.","George S. Barrett","All right. Well, thanks, all, for your questions and for being on this call. We appreciate you doing this. We look forward to getting a chance to talk to you and seeing many of you in the near future. Thanks again.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sally Curley, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Sally Curley","Thank you, Lisa, and welcome to Cardinal Health First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Call. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied.","Please refer to the SEC filings and the Forward-looking statements slide at the beginning of the presentation, which can be found on the Investor page of our website for a description of those risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures. Information about the measures is included at the end of the slides.","I'd also like to remind you of a few upcoming investment conferences and events. We will be webcasting our presentation at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston Conference on November 11 in Phoenix. And in addition, we will be hosting one-on-one meetings at the Bank of America One-on-One Conference in Chicago on December 11.","Today's press release and details for any webcasted events are -- or will be posted on the IR section of the website at cardinalhealth.com. So please make sure to visit the site often for any updated information. We hope to see many of you in an upcoming event. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George?","George S. Barrett","Thanks, Sally, and good morning, everyone. Our fiscal 2015 is off to a really good start. Our organization performed well across the board. And I'm proud of the work our people have done in positioning the organization to anticipate and address the evolving needs of a fast-changing market.","During Q1, we saw the growth in both Pharmaceutical and Medical segment profits. Our gross margin rate expanded by over 40 basis points to 5.6%. And we returned nearly $500 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Total revenues for the quarter were $24.1 billion, a decline of 2% versus last year's first quarter. This is the last quarter in which we will be comparing to a prior year period, which included sales to Walgreens. The declines in the Walgreens contract expiration was largely offset by sales growth from both new and existing customers.","Our first quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1, down from last year's $1.10, which included an $0.18 benefit related to tax settlements. Back in August, as we began our fiscal 2015 year, we provided a non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30. We are reaffirming that guidance today. I will note, however, that while we still expect the contribution to profit to be more back-half weighted, the strong start to the year is certainly an encouraging sign.","I'll provide a very quick overview of our first quarter, which Jeff will cover in greater detail during his remarks. I'd like to devote the rest of my time this morning to covering our progress on our strategic priorities.","Our Pharmaceutical segment reported revenues of $21.2 billion, down 3%. Revenue growth from both new and existing customers partially offset the Walgreens effect, as I noted earlier. Our Pharma segment margins continued to expand.","Pharmaceutical Distribution had an excellent beginning to the year. We continue to outgrow all markets, with the exception of chain drug, where, of course, Walgreens affected the numbers. And I'm happy to say, this is the last quarter where we will feel the Walgreens quarterly headwind.","Our Pharma teams continue to demonstrate a deep understanding of market dynamics and those tools, which can help our customers compete in this extraordinary market. Investments in analytics, reporting and dashboarding are giving customers needed visibility into their performance against critical metrics. Improving performance is essential to network access and a top priority for pharmaceuticals.","Specialty Solutions continues its strong performance, again, showing double-digit sales growth in the first quarter. And our Nuclear pharmacy business has made excellent progress after the dramatic market changes of the past few years. The introduction of Xofigo, a product used to treat metastatic cancers in bone, has been an important introduction for the radiopharmaceutical market and should increasingly contribute to our Nuclear performance.","Our Medical segment had a good start to the year. First quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, up 5%, and segment profit increased by more than 6%. This is good news in the context of an environment in which system-wide utilization has remained somewhat subdued.","Cardinal Health at Home, the former AssuraMed business, continues to perform well. We're particularly excited that our direct-to-patient business reported strong double-digit growth. We continue to see great opportunity here, enabled by an expanding product line and an increase in Cardinal Health brand of products for the home.","Overall, our Medical segment continues to demonstrate great balance, which is very valuable at a time with enormous and up and rapid change. Just as important, our Medical segment continues to innovate and explore new ways to bring value to a system hungry for solutions to new challenges. I will touch on these as I discuss our strategic priorities.","Finally, in relation to the quarter, I would note that China had an outstanding first quarter, with revenues up by more than 30%, as well as expanding operating margins. We continued to broaden our footprint, build the direct-to-patient pharmacy business and offer both distribution and a widening range of services aligned with our biopharma and medical device partners.","As I mentioned earlier on the call, I'd like to devote much of my time today to covering the progress we're making on our strategic priorities. Over the past few years, we have been intensifying our efforts in these priority areas. Each of these priorities aligns with the powerful changes occurring around health care.","Success in these areas continues to contribute to value for our customers, growth of our business and expansion of our margins. These priorities include: generic pharmaceuticals; solutions in the specialty pharmaceutical arena; growth in our product and service offerings to hospitals and health systems; increasing presence in ambulatory; and post-acute settings and growth in the Chinese market. So let me touch on each of these one by one.","First, generics. With close to 85% of all prescriptions being filled with a generic pharmaceutical, it has never been more important to be a market leader. From our perspective, this requires several ingredients: first, a solid base of customers who recognize the benefit of our model; second, significant scale; and third, the experience and know-how to source products from a complex and global supply network.","On the first, we now serve over 20,000 retail pharmacies, and nearly half of them use Cardinal Health as their primary source for generic drugs. As it relates to scale and experience, I'm extremely optimistic about the strategic and financial value of Red Oak, our generic sourcing joint venture with CVS Health. As you know, Red Oak Sourcing has been up and operational since early July. And I could not be more excited about the progress to date. Red Oak will be the largest purchaser of generic drugs for the U.S. market, the world's largest generic market.","The leadership team of Red Oak has worked incredibly hard to design a model, which is straightforward, simple, transparent for manufacturers, with a single point of decision-making and clear working terms. We've had an encouraging response from the manufacturers who appreciate the simplicity of the program and recognize the opportunity to work closely with us.","The group leverages the extensive knowledge of the Cardinal Health and CVS Health organizations about the global generic supply system. Having said this, any of you attending a Red Oak meeting would have difficulty identifying who was a former Cardinal Health employee and who came from CVS Health. At this stage, we can say that we fully expect to achieve our goals for the year. Although as we've mentioned, because of the transition out of each company's respective programs, the benefits of Red Oak's new agreement will ramp over time.","Turning to Specialty. As a health care system, we are at an important inflection point in the application of scientific innovation, which has been incubating over the past 2 decades. We are seeing the commercialization of pharmaceutical therapies, which leverage the convergence of the expansion of our understanding in human biology and the explosive access to big data. And the result is a flow of drugs, which offer both exciting new treatments for many of the challenging diseases of our time, as well as the promise for cures. It is in this context that our progress in Specialty should be viewed.","Although we typically don't break out our Specialty financials, I wanted to just give you a sense of our progress. We began the repositioning of our Specialty organization about 4 years ago, with a business of approximately $1 billion. Since that time, our run rate for annual revenue has grown to approximately $5 billion.","Our Specialty Distribution has shown consistent growth over the past few years. Further, we acquired Sonexus Health, a patient access and support hub in March of 2014. Feedback and momentum from customers has been very positive, and the asset fits very well into our overall biopharma offering.","In the new world of managing risk and improving the patient experience around quality, cost and outcomes, we are working with several major oncology practices on deploying new tools like our PathWare product to help them operate in this new environment. We continue to advance our position and our support of community oncologists and specialists.","Turning to health systems and hospital solutions. As healthcare goes through rapid changes, we continue to focus on providing scaled solutions for our acute care customers that enable them to deliver great patient care more cost effectively.","First, our physician preference item. We believe that there is an opportunity to help our acute-care partners by delivering what we refer to as evidence-based equivalents in some medical surgical categories that represent significant pain points for our customers. We have made tangible progress in this area, and I'd like to provide more color on this.","We see the trauma space as an area of low clinical differentiation and weak standardization. And with that in mind, we invested in a business called Emerge Medical last year. That product line has been increasing. In the past quarter, we assumed ownership of Emerge Medical to strengthen our position in orthopedics. This will allow us to launch a full line of trauma products late in this fiscal year and into early FY '16, while building credibility with key institutions over the coming months. The Emerge products were extremely well received at the Orthopaedic Trauma Association's Annual Meeting in Tampa just a few weeks ago.","About 6 months ago, we completed the acquisition of AccessClosure as a first step into the interventional cardiology area. AccessClosure has a simplified, standardized and more forward-looking go-to-market model, all built around the Mynx product line, which gives us great presence and credibility with interventional cardiologists.","Finally, consistent with our program to address physician preference items, we acquired this past quarter a company called Innovative Therapies, a negative pressure wound therapy company with a proven technology, and we are now launching over 250 products in advanced and traditional wound care. The combination of these acquisitions and the work that we've done these past few years gives us the foundation of a comprehensive program to help our customers deliver care in the most cost-effective way with the highest quality.","Beyond physician preference items, we continue to believe that healthcare has significant efficiency gaps. With this in mind, we focused on innovations that improve the efficiency of the overall supply chain. We've made several investments over the past 12 months to create new growth platforms.","We invested in an RFID technology called WaveMark, an inventory management solution to help both suppliers and customers optimize their supply chain and reduce inventory and labor costs. An example is an application targeted to tracking and tracing inventory flowing through a large customer's cath lab. We have launched this and several other initiatives under our umbrella of the Cardinal Health logistics solutions. Our customers have responded well as evidenced by the progress in this quarter.","As we move to alternate types of care like ambulatory and post-acute settings, you've heard us talk consistently about the importance of being able to serve patients across the continuum of care. We have a system in the U.S. that was built to treat acute illness, but a population increasingly suffering from multiple chronic illnesses. This requires a rethinking of the way and the place in which we deliver care.","We've made important moves to address these channels. First, our ambulatory service centers have a market leading position with increasing connectivity to our IDN customers and have grown solidly in the last few years. And we continue to take actions to cost -- to more cost effectively provide products and services to smaller physician practices.","Our acquisition of AssuraMed, now called Cardinal Health at Home, was a commitment to address a growing number of Americans who need care in the home. The acquisition has gone extremely well, and our direct-to-patient business continues to grow at double-digit rates.","Just a few comments about our progress in China. When we entered China in 2010 with the acquisition of Yong Yu, the business was a pharmaceutical-centric national distribution business, providing basic import, 3PL and warehousing functions with a fairly limited geographic presence.","Since then, we have made substantial progress in China, growing the business from approximately $1 billion in revenue in fiscal '11 to $2.6 billion in FY '14. We have developed a strong local presence in 10 regions, expanded DCs from 7 to 13 and completed 7 small tuck-in acquisitions. We opened our first direct-to-patient specialty pharmacy in China in calendar 2013. Identifying a niche, we could fill using our unique competencies in compliance and secure supply chain. Today, we operate about 30 of these specialty retail pharmacies.","Expanding beyond pharmaceuticals, we now handle a wide range of products for the Chinese market, including clinical trial material, medical devices and consumables, vaccines, diagnostics, biologics and blood products. We've added capabilities, including industry-leading compliance management, cold chain logistics in diagnostics and vaccine management, data analytics capabilities and hospital, pharmacy and retail channel services.","In summary, our organization is well aligned around all of our enterprise-wide priorities, and we're truly excited about the opportunities they represent.","I'd like to make a few quick comments about the Ebola situation, as a number of you have asked us about whether there has been any implications for our business. Let me start by saying that our organization responded quickly to the challenges confronting Liberia and other West African nations. Our donations of products and supplies have been substantial and our people have demonstrated great generosity.","As it relates to concerns here in the U.S. and the implications for our business, I would say that we would not expect a demand for safety-related products and supplies to have any material impact on our economics. We do anticipate some shortages of safety products, particularly those recently specified by the CDC, which, as you might expect, have experienced a sudden increase in demand. We will continue to work closely with all customers and manufacturers to help navigate the supply issues. As it relates the products we produce such as gloves, we are operating at full capacity.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff, since we last spoke, we announced the appointment of Mike Kaufmann to succeed Jeff as the Chief Financial Officer of Cardinal Health. Mike, Jeff and I have been working closely to map out the transition. Although Mike has not yet begun his new role, we want to do give him a chance today to say a quick hello, and introduce himself to those of you have not yet met him. Mike?","Michael C. Kaufmann","Thanks, George. I'm really excited to be moving into the CFO role. What you may not know about me is that while I've spent most of my 24 years here at Cardinal Health in sales, procurement and general management, I've also been a division controller and CFO for our Medical and Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses. I've also spent over 5 years in public accounting before I joined Cardinal. So in many ways, I'm going back to my roots.","George, Jeff and I are already working together on the transition. And with Jeff here through August, I'm confident it will be smooth. I look forward to meeting many of you over the coming months at the various conferences and events. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for his final earnings call as CFO.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, George and Mike. I share George's sentiment in welcoming Mike and look forward to passing him the CFO baton officially in a few weeks. As you can tell from George's remarks, we're off to a strong start and making very good progress on the key strategic initiatives that will drive our performance this fiscal year and beyond.","In my prepared remarks, I will first focus on outlining the drivers of the first quarter financial performance and then provide some insight into our expectations as we move through the remainder of fiscal '15. You can refer to the slide presentation posted on our website as a guide to this discussion.","Although non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1, down 9% versus the prior year, the first quarter of fiscal '14 included an $0.18 favorable impact related to the settlement of federal and state tax matters. Eliminating the tax elements from the prior year, non-GAAP EPS grew 9%. Revenues at $24.1 billion exceeded our expectations in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, the fiscal 2015 first quarter revenue grew a robust 13%. Gross margin dollars were up 6% for the quarter, and the gross margin rate expanded 42 basis points versus the first quarter of last year.","Total SG&A increased 6% versus the prior year, driven by increased acquisition-related expenses. Consolidated non-GAAP operating earnings were up 6% to $566 million. The non-GAAP operating margin rate increased 18 basis points versus the prior year to 2.35%.","Interest and other expense was essentially flat to last year. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the quarter was 36.5%. As I previously mentioned, in Q1 of last fiscal year, the tax rate was unusually low due to the favorable impact of certain settlements. Excluding those settlements, the fiscal 2014 first quarter non-GAAP effective tax rate would have been 37.3%, slightly higher than our tax rate in this fiscal year's first quarter.","Our first quarter diluted average shares outstanding were 340 million, 3.6 million shares favorable to the prior year's quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased $360 million worth of shares. And I'm confident we'll exceed the $500 million in share repurchase we mentioned in August as part of our FY '15 assumptions. As of the end of Q1, we had almost $1.4 billion of repo authorization remaining under our Board approval.","Moving to consolidated cash flows in the balance sheet. Operating cash flow in the quarter was relatively light, but largely as the function of timing as we saw some shift between quarters. As a reminder, OCF in Q1 of FY '14 was unusually high due to the accelerated nature of the wind down of the Walgreens contract.","At the end of this quarter just ended, we had $2.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet, which includes $447 million held internationally. Working capital days came in at 8.7 days. In comparison to the prior year, it's really meaningful this quarter, as last year's figures were skewed due to the Walgreens contract rollout.","Now let's move to segment performance, starting with Pharma. Pharmaceutical segment revenue declined 3% to $21.2 billion. As we mentioned, the quarter comparison includes 2 months of impact in Q1 of FY '14 related to the conclusion of the Walgreens contract. Excluding that impact, Pharma segment revenues grew 15% year-over-year, driven by growth in our existing customer base and new customers, as well as strong growth in our Pharma segment in China. In addition to China, Pharma revenues reflect increases across our generics, specialty and Nuclear businesses.","Pharma segment profit increased 4% to $451 million, with a margin rate up 14 basis points compared to the prior year's Q1. These solid results are due to growth in new and existing customers, as well as strong performance under our generics programs.","With respect to our generics programs, the net impact of the Red Oak JV was slightly accretive in the quarter, although it's still early in a ramp-up of the benefits we're expecting. And we did see a slight year-over-year increase in contribution from generic price increases in the quarter.","Overall, generic percent inflation was higher than last year's Q1, but originally consistent with Q4 of last year. As a reminder, we calculate generic deflation or inflation based on products that have been in the market for at least a year and based on weighted average selling price.","And finally, I want to note that the quarter includes benefit from resolution of some long-standing customer issues worth about $20 million.","Let's go down to the Medical segment performance. Revenue for the Medical segment increased 5% to $2.9 billion, driven by acquisitions and a net positive impact of customer growth. Within our strategic hospital accounts, we continue to see organic growth, with those customers increasing almost 4%. This is an indication that we're focusing on the things that are most important to this customer base. More broadly, we're seeing that overall utilization has stabilized to some extent, and there are pockets developed [ph] at usage within healthcare. However, it is not yet at a point where we would describe it as an uptick in overall market utilization.","During the quarter, Medical segment profit increased over 6% to $113 million. This increase is a result of profit growth in Cardinal Health branded products, as well as growth in services, partially offset by a decline in contribution from national brands. Our Canadian business continues to operate in a tough market environment, but we are implementing the operational and product mix changes necessary to adapt.","Finally, as George mentioned, we have now entered into 3 categories we were targeting for our Cardinal Health brand physician preference items. While we are pleased with this progress, we are still early -- we are still in the early stages of this medium-term driver and expect a gradual ramp during the course of the year. By now, much of the focus is on launching the products and positioning our organization for future growth in this area.","I'd also like to make a few comments on our China business, which spans both of our reporting segments. As we approach the 4-year anniversary of the initial Yong Yu acquisition, I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made, much of which George highlighted in his remarks.","China revenue saw strong growth again this quarter, posting a year-over-year increase of 34%, driven by new and existing customers. We continued to significantly outpace the healthcare market growth in China, while pursuing our strategy of a geographic expansion to the relevant population centers and expanding our capabilities to meet the needs of this unique market.","Turning to Slide #6, you'll see our consolidated GAAP results for the quarter. The $0.22 variance to non-GAAP results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs and litigation expenses. Litigation expenses increased due to a $27 million reserve related to the previously disclosed Florida DEA matter.","Looking to the rest of the fiscal year. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance we provided in August of $4.10 to $4.30. Reflecting this range are a few assumptions, which we think are worth updating from the expectations we had outlined when we spoke to you during our August earnings call.","First, we are incrementally more positive on the consolidated revenue growth for the full year, which we have previously described as up modestly. This is largely driven by pharma brand sales. Second, we have reduced our forecast for earnings contribution from new generic launches.","On a specific note, built into our original planned assumptions for our Pharma segment was a forecast for a generic Nexium launch in November of this year. However, given recent developments, we no longer expect any benefit in our fiscal 2015 from a generic Nexium launch.","Third, given what we have seen in the first quarter, our expectation for full year generic pricing has changed from slight deflation to slight inflation. However, our full year forecast for the earnings impact from generic price increase remains lower than the amount we realized last year. Finally, given recent oil price movements, we do forecast some benefit in certain of our commodity costs within the Medical segment in the second half of the year versus original expectation. However, that upside is partially offset by negative foreign exchange movements.","Most of the underlying corporate assumptions, shown on Slide 9, remain unchanged from our previous comments. However, I do want to mention a couple of items. We still expect the full year tax rate to be between 36% and 37%. As we said previously, this will likely fluctuate quarterly due to the unique items affecting individual periods.","Also, note that we are increasing our assumption for acquisition-related intangible amortization to approximately $184 million or $0.35 per share. This change is due to a few smaller acquisitions that closed during the quarter. It has no impact on our non-GAAP earnings. So when you add it all up, and recognizing the fact that we're only 1 quarter into the year, our full year guidance range has not changed.","One final comment about the evolution of earnings over the course of the year, a pattern which has not really changed substantially from our original expectations. We continue to expect the year to be quite back-half loaded from an operating earnings growth standpoint, driven by a few factors. As I stated previously, the benefits in the Red Oak Sourcing entity will ramp over time. Further, we'll be investing upfront to accelerate the growth of Cardinal Health brand physician preference items over the medium term.","Bottom line, there are a number of puts and takes to the year. However, overall, I feel good about our organization's ability to respond to a rapidly changing environment and how we are positioned coming into the first quarter.","In closing, I'd like to say that after almost 40 earnings calls, more than 150 sell-side events and 1,700 or so investor meetings, I'm certainly ready to sleep a little more. As I've said to some of you in person, I've always considered investor relations to be one of the most gratifying parts of my role. I view investors and analysts as my customers, and I've appreciated the back and forth and relationships we've enjoyed over the past decade. And I take pride that your confidence and investments in Cardinal have been rewarded over the years.","To all of our Cardinal employees, you'll still see me around through next summer. I look forward to working with Mike as we transition him into the CFO role and to continue to work closely with George and my China colleagues until my retirement next August. This is my last earnings call as your CFO, so let me just say what a privilege it has been to serve you in this role for the past 9.5 years. We've been through a lot together, and you created a great company of which we can be very proud. Thank you, all.","So with that, I'll say goodbye for now. Operator, let's begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was curious if you think the Canadian business was weak as a protest to your leaving the company.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I'm sure that had a big piece to play in it, yes, Ross.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just -- yes, there was a lot of assumption changes, it seemed like, on the generics side. We know about some of the pushouts and obviously, we've all been tracking inflation. I mean, as you look at the performance in the Pharma business, I mean, x lag, obviously, the growth was pretty spectacular. As you sort of break down your thoughts more so on the profit side for the quarter, obviously, not much you can give on the number side, but just more anecdotally, where do you feel like you really sort of excelled on margin dollars? And where are you hoping for a little bit better performance in the year? Obviously, we know Red Oak is going to come in, but I'm curious just more so on the line items.","George S. Barrett","Let me just start. I think part of the driver for us is a focus on key priorities, and that really influences the mix of our product lines and services. And so as we look across the business, those areas where we're growing, I think, are higher value areas for our customer base. And as a result, they tend to be higher-margin businesses for us. So again, I think we're doing very well in generics. That customer base is expanding. Our specialty business continues to grow. On our medical side, again, utilization was okay. Obviously, we\u2018re still seeing it to be somewhat subdued. But I think we're really doing well with our strategic accounts and then, again, with key products in those accounts that are really important drivers for us and important value drivers for them. So I think it's largely about a very clear focus on priorities and mix. Jeff, I don't know what we might want to add to that.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. I mean, if you look at -- I'll start with Pharma. If you look at each of the different businesses within the Pharma business, you got the core Pharma Distribution, Nuclear, specialty and the China piece that's relevant to Pharma, they all outperformed our expectations for the quarter. So I'd say, really, across the board, we're pretty pleased with the results. But I think you touched on the one area that wasn't a disappointment, but I think we're still not seeing the full potential from yet, and that's the Red Oak JV. As we've always said, there's going to be a ramp-up over time. Q1 was largely about setting up the JV, starting the discussions with the manufacturers and starting to sign up manufacturers. But as we've always expected, the actual benefit that will flow through to us will come over time. So I'd say that's the one piece that was largely missing from Q1, but that was as expected.","George S. Barrett","Yes, it's important. That is what we anticipated. So again, not just one that didn't happen, I think that's key, is that we know that, that flows as the year goes.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","On the...","George S. Barrett","And just -- yes, go ahead.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","No, I was going to say, on the Medical side, obviously, we're pleased to see some of the profit growth for the quarter, particularly in a utilization environment that still really hasn't ticked up yet. I think the one area that we're -- again, this is not a disappointment, just something that we knew was going to happen. We're still investing in our physician preference item rollouts. And it's more of an investment story right now than it is a profit story, but that's expected. We want to make sure that we're properly positioned and we have the right portfolio of products and the right sales force and organizations supporting it, et cetera. So we're going to see those benefits more towards the latter part of this fiscal year and heading into next year. So again, not a disappointment, just something that really wasn't a significant driver for us in the quarter.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And just quickly, it seems like you picked up the tuck-in M&A activity strictly in the Medical side. You've got sort of a differentiated strategy there. What's the pipeline look like? And do you feel like you're filling in a lot of the holes? You moved into wound care, you've got some stuff in ortho now. What else is sort of left?","George S. Barrett","Well, I mean, I think now it's executing. As Jeff said, these are major initiatives for us that we've always described as sort of midterm drivers, Ross. So I think the positioning on orthopedics is really good. By the end of this year, we're going to start to see some of that flow through the system. The move into cardiovascular, interventional cardiology, I think, was really exciting for us. It's doing well, and that bag will begin to fill. And then as we think about wound care, that's a really interesting area for us. And as I mentioned, we are talking about 250 launches that are sort of in process. So I think now, it's more about rolling it out, executing, and we're really excited about these programs.","Operator","And we'll go now to Lisa Gill from JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Jeff, just let me say that I wish you well in your retirement, and I really enjoyed working with you over the years and the last 40-plus earnings calls. So my first question, really, George, just to follow up on what you're talking about around PPI products and clearly, tuck-in acquisitions. But do you see any bigger opportunities in the market? This is clearly a place that the Cardinal has differentiated themselves on the med-surg side. I think I heard you earlier talking about continuing to take action to deliver products to physician offices. Do you feel like you have what you need in order to deliver to physician offices? Or do you need to make an acquisition to continue to grow that business?","George S. Barrett","So there are 2 parts to that question. The first one is really around our PPI program. And again, I think for us, we like where we are. We'll continue always to look for opportunities to accelerate those programs. So we've got sort of a dual responsibility now. One is to make sure that we're doing the right strategic things to get the bag position to sell with good coverage, and the second part is really about execution and making it happen. So I think we've got a great foundation now, but we'll continue to look at opportunities, both organically to drive the program, new products and whether or not there may or may not be opportunities externally. The second part is really about the physician's office. And here's what I'd say. I would say, again, there are sort of 2 stories to it. Part of the physician office business, as you know, is increasingly affiliating with the IDNs, and we've had obviously an enterprise-wide relationship with many of those IDNs and tend to be stronger there. We've been less strong in those independent practices, and we continue to look at various ways to strengthen that part of our business. But I think, overall, as I look -- if I draw a continuum of our business, we feel pretty strong in the continuum of care, but we'll continue to look at ways to strengthen any pockets of -- new pockets where we're not quite as strong.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, really, what I'm looking for is, as we think about Cardinal, you've got a lot of cash spinning on your balance sheet, your business is running very well, should we expect to see you do a larger acquisition this year? I mean, that's really what I'm looking at. So I was trying to figure out different places where you could potentially add to your business. But really, the core of my question is, should we expect Cardinal to do something bigger in this fiscal year?","George S. Barrett","Yes, I know. I totally understand the question, Lisa. I think you know it's a hard one to answer. I think you should expect Cardinal to deploy its capital efficiently and I hope, very smartly. So when we see opportunities externally that we think drive our strategies, we are not going to be shy about pursuing them, but we also see obligation to make sure that we're returning cash to shareholders. If those opportunities aren\u2019t appearing in the right way strategically as it relates to acquisitions, then we'll look very carefully at how we deploy capital. Jeff, any -- do you want to...","Jeffrey W. Henderson","An example of that is what happened in the first quarter, right? We were building up cash, and those significant opportunities were executed during Q1. So we found an opportunity to use that cash to buy back shares, and that's sort of our -- will be our ongoing approach to it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from George Hill from Deutsche Bank.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And Jeff, I'll continue with pats on the back. Nice work. And it's been a pleasure working with you.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, George.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I ask -- one thing I'd like to revisit is Red Oak. I'm kind of surprised to hear that it's been accretive this early in the JV. I guess, what I would -- I'd ask a couple of things is -- could you provide -- I don't know if you can provide any more color on the accretion, but I assume it was accretive net of the payment to CVS. And then the other comment, George, that you made was that manufacturers appreciate kind of how simple and streamlined the program is. I guess, is there any color that you can give us on how Red Oak might be -- or how you guys perceive Red Oak to be differentiated from any of the other procurement programs?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","[indiscernible], George. Again, thanks for the nice words. We did not expense any of the payment to Cardinal Health in the first quarter. That payment, from a cash standpoint, will flow for the first time in Q2 of this year, and we'll begin expensing it on a monthly basis starting in October. So there was no expense related to that payment in Q1. So the benefit that we saw largely flow to the bottom line, although I would describe those benefits as relatively minimal at this point.","George S. Barrett","George, I'll sort of touch on the second one. Again, I'm going to be careful because, obviously, this is -- the work that we're doing here in Red Oak and the relationships with the manufacturers is quite proprietary and sensitive. I would just say this. There's a lot of change happening in the system that could be very disquieting for people. We recognized early on that a key to our relationship with manufacturers was to be very, very clear about terms and conditions, about where the decisions were going to be made, about -- there are so many mechanical parts in a generic program, moving parts. And we realized that if we could make that very, very simple, that, that would be appreciated. And that has some value to the manufacturers. And so what I would say, without going too far into it, is that we've had a huge number of meetings already. We're getting very good and very positive feedback that people know what we're trying to do, they understand it. And I would say, people -- and they're really cooperative in working with us, and they've expressed some support for the way we've approached this and just the simplicity of the program.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up there would be is it seems like if you've looked at the other procurement situations that have taken place in the industry, the ramp that seems to come from these JVs or whatever we want to call them actually winds up being pretty quick. I would just ask, is that your assumption as well is that Red Oak will ramp pretty quickly and we should -- if we think about by the end of fiscal '15, exiting the year, we should probably see pretty close to the full annualized benefit?","George S. Barrett","Well, let me start first, and then I'll turn it to Jeff. This is George. I probably would not comment on anybody else's programs and the speed at which they can achieve that. It's just not my place. I think for us, I'm incredibly proud of the work that's been done in less than a year to get this thing rolling. You would be astonished at how many moving parts there are. So great work has been done. As we've said, we do expect to start to see a more rich benefit as the year unfolds. But Jeff, a little...","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. George, I like the way you described it, as getting to a more normal run rate by the end of this fiscal year is a fair comment and consistent with what I've said previously. That doesn't mean there won't be incremental benefits that we\u2019ll go for in FY '16 and '17 and beyond. That definitely will be the case. But again, characterizing it as reaching a more normal run rate by the end of fiscal '15, I think is fair.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Eric Percher from Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Strategic priority commentary, and I wanted to drill in a little bit on specialty, where you talked about moving from $1 billion to $5 billion today. I guess, my first question is, is the $5 billion really specialty distribution, specialty pharmacy, hub services outside of specialty flowing through the traditional wholesale business? And then could you talk a bit about where you focused and grown in those different components of the specialty business?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Thanks, Eric. It's -- this is George. It's a little bit of all of the above. First of all, and again, I'm just -- we're talking really about run rate. It's been encouraging. I think the good news about the way we've approached this -- we've had a pretty methodical approach to our specialty business, and most of this is organic, as you know. I think we've seen each of the little subsegments of our specialty work, whether that's our services to biopharma or distribution as pieces that we need to drive. Obviously, from a revenue standpoint, distribution is always going to carry more weight. But I think in general, we're pretty encouraged by the progress. And I think the addition of this patient hub for us, while it's very early, I think, is really an interesting value driver as it relates to the work that we can do to provide to pharma companies, and thinking about where they're going, how they're trying to increase those touch points with patients in the system. So I would say, generally speaking, we're pretty encouraged by what's happened through most of those sub-businesses and encouraged by the run rate, much of it organic.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Let me just add to that. We've always said that achieving success in specialty is going to be dependent on really 2 factors: number one, getting to critical mass and size so that we're relevant to the manufacturers and to the docs and the payers. I think now, with a $5 billion run rate, we can definitely say we're relevant, and then we have a significant share now of the specialty market. The second piece was, as we gained relevance from a size standpoint to start wrapping services -- or continue to wrap services around that volume, that we can profitize with the manufacturers, et cetera. And that has also happened as well and was accelerated clearly last January with the purchase of Sonexus, which really helped to round out the toolkit that we have now that we can sell as services to the players in specialty. So I do feel very good about the positioning we've achieved over the last couple of years.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So it's felt like some of your positioning was that you didn't need to have a massive footprint but enough to be relevant to manufacture. So it sounds like you're feeling that you've reached that in Sonexus, and the hub services will be the test case for your ability to have relevance. And I guess, the way I would throw a question on there is, how do you think that your assets differentiate from others when manufacturers are deciding which hub to go with?","George S. Barrett","So it's a great question, Eric. Here's what I'd say. This is going to be a story of defining services that are very uniquely targeted to a biopharma company and the patient population that they are addressing. And so I'd love to tell you that there's a broad answer to that. It's really a sort of \"you've seen one, you've seen one\" kind of answer. We're very targeted. We actually have a innovation center that is -- all they do is software solutions that address unique needs of some of our customer base. This would be one of those customer bases. So I don't know if I could do a comparative analysis for you rather than say our team is very targeted. And we certainly have the presence in the market to allow us to do the things that we like to do and have those touch points. So -- but very -- honestly, very targeted, very customer-centric, practice-centric work.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee from Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And congrats, Jeff. Good luck with everything going forward.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, Charles.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a -- actually, a question on Nuclear. This quarter, you talked pretty positively about it. I believe a little -- you talked kind of positively about it last quarter. Can you tell us the shape of this business at this point? If I recall, years ago, I mean, this was something like maybe almost a $2 billion business with something like 20% EBIT margins. Can you kind of give us a sense of the financial health of this? And one time, you talked about how much you liked it. How does it stand now in relation to some -- all the other priorities as you look forward?","George S. Barrett","So Charles, let me just start, and then I'll turn it over to Jeff to give you color on the financial aspects of it. But here's what I'd say. The business had been through, I think I described it, really significant change over the couple of years. It\u2019s really the market has gone through this significant change, primarily around the utilization. Our hope is that those changes have essentially worked their way through the system, and those are beginning to stabilize. That's good news for us. The second element of -- so one is that, while it's not -- you're not seeing a big increase. What we've seen is some stabilizing. The second element, which is exciting, is the development of new technologies. And so I'd use Xofigo just as an example. So we're not just now seeing radiotherapeutic, but radiopharmaceuticals, and I think there some opportunities there, and we're excited about the potential. But it's -- the market has been through a really major multiyear kind of reset. Jeff, do you want to give any more color on that?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. As a reminder, we wrote down a goodwill on this business over a year ago now really because the core business itself was not growing. And in fact, we're shrinking due to some of the issues we talked about previously. I think one has given us some renewed optimism about the business -- really has been some of these new launches, like the Xofigo launch that George referenced. I'd say we're hopefully optimistic now about the Nuclear business, and we see some particular product areas where there's potential to grow over time. But I would not describe the Nuclear business as one of our more significant strategic growth drivers going forward. It's good margin as long as we can continue to grow it. With these new products, it will be a good contributor to the bottom line and it is margin accretive. But it probably won't be a business that you'll hear us talk a lot about going forward. Unless, of course, some of these areas that George referenced begin to really, really take off and hopefully, they will, and we'll let you know when that happens.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And is this related to the biomarkers area? Is that where we should expect really the growth of this -- this start of the business turns around? Is that the spot you'd focus on?","George S. Barrett","I think that may be an element of what we're describing. But I also think -- if I were to describe the biggest change, again, assuming that the core market is not going to go through a massive change, I think, to me, the biggest development is the potential commercialization of, let's say, 2 things. One is, if there's some real breakthroughs on the Alzheimer's side, the diagnostic piece becomes much more exciting. And the second is seeing some products that are actually not diagnostics, but are actually therapies. Those are the things that probably are most present in our mind.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Jeff, it's been a pleasure. I wanted to shift over to Medical, where revenue came in at the high end of your low- to mid-single digit range for the year. Several med tech companies this quarter have been citing improved volumes. Your largest competitor on the acute side talked about it, one of the best environments they've seen in a while. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing within the marketplace? I know you commented briefly on it in the prepared remarks. But just curious, from a volume standpoint, demand standpoint, how that market has been trending and probably, more importantly, how you're contemplating the progression of that market into your fiscal '15 guidance?","George S. Barrett","Yes, thanks. I'll take this. We've obviously heard a lot of commentary on different companies. And actually, we're hearing quite different things, and I think there's a good reason for that. I would say this. Because of our really broad reach, we have a relatively good line of sight on the system. And so what we'd say from a system perspective, utilization is somewhat flat to slight -- maybe slightly up, although I would say it's early to describe that as a trend overall. What's noteworthy, and this is why you may be hearing different perspectives, is that it's not one-size-fits-all. We are seeing some systems and some hospitals showing disproportionate growth in relation to others. And we're seeing some shift in channels, so some utilization that was, for example, happening in the acute care centers moving to ambulatory centers. And so you have this interesting dynamic, which is an overall system number, but some shifting on how and where it's done. And so that partly explains, I think, [indiscernible] you might be hearing things. We certainly believe, over the long haul, both through access to healthcare, insurance and demographics, we're going to see a lift. I would say, right now, in the short term, it's still relatively modest. Yes, I think that's the way I'd characterize it. One other thing worth noting again, which is, as we look at, for example, the hospital system, make sure we distinguish utilization from now compensation for what was uncompensated care, so there's a number of moving parts. And I would just encourage everybody to look at all the individual pieces.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just a follow-up on inflation, just given how important it is to the business. I know you guys guided for moderation in generic inflation for fiscal '15. But this quarter, it sounds like you said inflation was consistent. I'm just wondering, have you started to see any signs of the actual moderation in the marketplace? And George, even longer term, obviously having sat on the other side of this equation, how prolonged can this inflationary environment go in your view from a high level? I mean, are we talking quarters, are we talking multiyear? Any perspective there would actually be really helpful.","George S. Barrett","Yes. Well, that's a really -- there are 2 parts to the question, and the last part is really hard to answer. I just think, historically, we see cycles. That's not unusual. The question is how long those cycles last, and they depend on a lot of different things. They depend on how many companies are beginning to resolve technical issues, which would allow them back in the market. So I think it's -- but I wish I could give you a good answer on the prognostication on that cycle. What I can say in the short term is it is pretty much, Jeff would agree, as we saw, for example, in the last...","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Last quarter.","George S. Barrett","Last quarter.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","But it was better than what we had originally modeled for Q1. And that's the reason why we've changed our overall assessment for the year, now looking at slight inflation versus a slight deflation that we had talked about back in August.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Jeff, I know we'll miss you. Enjoy your extra sleep time. And Mike, welcome. Welcome to the role. I'm looking forward to working with you more closely beyond just the once-a-year card [ph] at Dublin Day. So I have 2 follow-up questions. The first one is around specialty. At $5 billion run rate, based on our assumptions, I think Cardinal now accounts for about 8% of the specialty market. So can you help us better understand whether this is more concentrated around some specific drug therapies where you have higher share? And also, as we think of new drug launches in kind of like in the coming years, should we assume that you're now in a position to gain your fair share, i.e. that 8% across the different drug categories?","George S. Barrett","Well, let me -- I'll start. First, let me say this. Again, I would say, I think we're well positioned. We've got significant presence across the business. I think there are always going to be individual products that are -- that have distinct service contracts. That's probably true for our competitor as well. I think we're positioned to participate in any part of this specialty area. One thing that I probably should point out, I didn't get a chance to -- or didn't in the last question related to this, is that I do think that we've done a very good job. And this may be a bit of a unique positioning for us, of -- in a world, again, where there is a lot of issue around risk management, of connecting the payer perspective with about pharma company and the patient. And I think we've worked pretty carefully at that intersection, and we've got some creative solutions. But I would say, in terms of our overall positioning, we can compete broadly. I'm not sure there is a single area where we would not play and certainly hope to take our fair share as the growth in the system continues.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 follow-up questions on the numbers. So Jeff, first of all, just to clarify on your guidance regarding inflation, do you now expect additional inflation for the remainder of your fiscal year? Or is the change to your view just based on the calculated inflation that you saw in the September quarter?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","It's a little of both, Ricky. Obviously, what's happened already is -- it's happened. So let's just take [ph] into the numbers. And I think what happened in Q1 slightly changed our view for the rest of the year, so it's a little of both.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the -- you had a very nice sequential improvement in distribution operating margins. Can you just kind of like walk us through what contributed to that? I mean, obviously, Red Oak is probably part of it, but you kind of like highlighted that Red Oak was relatively modest. So is there anything else that we should be aware of?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. I think your assessment of Red Oak being relatively modest is an accurate one. It wasn't a big contributor to sequential margin expansion. I really would point to the continued strong performance of our generic portfolio overall, really independent of Red Oak. We continue to grow our sales very, very nicely. And really, all aspects of our generic program are really hitting on all cylinders, which will make the addition of the Red Oak benefits even more exciting to see as we get towards the back half of this year. I think the continued growth in specialty, Nuclear, China, all higher-margin areas have improved our mix, and that has driven sequential improvement. And then on the Medical side, obviously, having Medical grow this quarter, given there's a higher-margin part of the overall consolidated business, improves our mix as well. And I think the contribution from preferred products and services, which, as you know, are our higher-margin elements within Medical, also contributes as well. So there's no one thing I'd point to. It was really indeed the continued growth and success that a lot of our various strategic initiatives that we've been pushing for some time are continuing to drive a shift in product and customer mix that's very favorable to us.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dave Francis from RBC Capital Markets.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'll add my congratulations and hope to see you on another trip down to Vanderbilt sometime soon.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Thanks, Dave.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","As it relates -- if I can go back to George's question earlier on Red Oak and timing of the benefits there, if I could ask a little bit differently, George, can you walk us a little bit through kind of the process for whether it's simple annual contracts being renegotiated? Or what is it in terms of the mechanics of getting the Red Oak piece up and running that allows you to so quickly recognize the benefits of that relationship, moving them into the income statement?","George S. Barrett","So again, I'll try to give you some color without providing answers that would make us uncomfortable given our proprietary relationships with our suppliers. We started working on this right away, identifying the teams with a clear sense of what we wanted to do. And so in a way, it was just a discipline of putting the teams together, identifying the right talent. We've got tremendously capable people working in this and then the support of 2 companies from the back office perspective. What we had to do was to really do a full analysis of the market, every product line, every supplier, all their capacities, what their pipelines look like. And so the Red Oak team, I think, has done all of them. But I would describe it as serious analytics work to identify what the opportunities were and how to work with each manufacturer. And each of those relationships is very, very distinct, and so we work very hard at making sure that everybody feels like they're in the tent, both big companies and small. And the Red Oak teams have been having meetings, really, since early July with all those manufacturers. And so the progress has been really gratifying. I'm extremely proud of this team, but I\u2019m impressed by what I've seen. And they're working their tails off. This is incredibly hard work. As I've said, I don't think anybody can ever appreciate how many moving parts there are, how many products themselves, how many manufacturers, kind of multiple products. And so I think just doing this work and doing the analytics to support a simple program was enormous. It's hard to give more color than that, but I...","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Well, and I guess, my question is kind of more to, as you look at both your and CVS' contractual relationships with the manufacturers, it sounds like the -- just structurally speaking, things are on a relatively short calendar such that you are in a position, as a combined purchasing entity, to restructure those agreements and begin to recognize the benefits more quickly than we might've otherwise thought. Is that fair to say?","George S. Barrett","I think all of us are phasing out. We get -- we all had obligations and commitments and existing product relationships. So I think that is all flowing through. And I think we can say that, as we work through the year, we'll look like, one, a sourcing entity, and I think manufacturers will see that. I do see us that way. And yes, I think we'll see the benefit as it unfolds during the year.","David K. Francis - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, if I may ask. Appreciate the color relative to your expectations on Nexium in the fiscal year. More broadly speaking, as it relates to other generic launches going forward and understanding that Nexium has some specific circumstances surrounding it, are you guys seeing anything differently from either an FDA perspective or a manufacturing perspective that might create a more drawn-out process relative to other larger products going through a generic launch process? Or is Nexium and perhaps some of the others out there that we've seen some delays where those are just one-off kind of situations. Is there some there something more endemic there?","George S. Barrett","I think they're largely one-off stories. I think actually FDA has been talking about increasing their cycle times, speeding up their cycle time, so I'm not sure we're seeing an endemic situation at all. These tend to be very unique issues that may or may not have legal issues or manufacturing issues, but I think what we would say is these are largely one-off dynamics that we're describing.","Operator","And we will take our next question from David Larsen from Leerink Partners.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So excluding Walgreens, the revenue growth, I think, of 13% year-over-year looks very good. Can you maybe just touch on -- in the Pharma division, we're hearing about some significant wins you're picking up. What's going on in the market that's maybe new this year versus last year? And from a Pharma Distribution point of view, what are you doing that's different than some of your competitors?","George S. Barrett","Again, always a little reluctant to do a lot of comparative analysis with our competitors in this call. But here's what I'd say. I think our group has a very clear sense of how we create value. I think we become increasingly immersed in the needs of our customers, and I think we demonstrate that in a very consistent way. Again, not a comment on anyone else, I just think our team is doing an extremely good job of, I think, increasingly being recognized as a company who sort of gets it, understands the dynamics of the system as they're exchanging. And we seem to be feeling a good kind of momentum in the way that we are interacting with customers and the things that they seek from us. So it's hard to describe more than that. Other than that, I think our work is -- it's really good. I watched it very closely. For example, when I went to our RBC, our retail business conference, and I watched the kind of interaction that we're having with our customers, the kind of service offerings that we have and their response to that. Now I'd say generally, it's quite positive.","David Larsen - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So each client is unique. Can you go the extra mile to basically meet each of those unique needs? Okay. And then just one other question. I think you said you aren't expecting any benefit from Nexium in fiscal '15. I thought that, that was going to originally launch in November of '14. So to not have any benefit for the next 3 quarters, that's a fairly conservative approach, right?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","I'm not sure I'd consider it conservative. I guess, I would consider it a fairly realistic view from our standpoint of how that's going to play out. Maybe we\u2019ll be wrong, maybe it'll go earlier, but again, I'm not sure I'd necessarily characterize it as conservative.","George S. Barrett","Yes. I mean, again I would say, just based on the data that we've received to date, the original expectation we had, which was late fall launch, we've taken that out of our assumption. And I think probably the more cautious assumption, as Jeff said, is appropriate.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Kreger from William Blair.","Roberto Fatta","This is actually Robbie Fatta in for John today. Going back to the physician preference items that were discussed at length earlier, in the past, you guys have quantified the percent of revenue and\/or earnings that these items comprise. Are you willing to quantify that today? Or perhaps what kind of growth rates you've been seeing of late?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. I'll characterize it though, not just physician preference items, but all preferred products. So in this latest quarter, preferred products made up low 20s in terms of revenue and approaching 39% in terms of percent of gross profit of the Medical segment.","Roberto Fatta","Great. And secondly, on utilization, we talked a little bit about the medical utilization. Have you seen any changes in script consumption this year?","George S. Barrett","Yes. I think, again, the data that we're seeing from certainly IMS and others is fairly favorable. So yes, that's probably a little bit of a different story on the drug side in terms of our overall utilization as compared to the procedural utilization we're seeing, yes.","Operator","And we will go now to Steve Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And Jeff, congrats, again, on your retirement. Now I know you already discussed generic inflation a bit at this point obviously. But I guess, as we analyze this, it does seem now that generic inflation may be moving beyond just product supply shortage situations. And it seems to be happening now in a wider basket of older products. And in fact, I think some observers now suggest that maybe generic inflation on a growing number of products on the list price is actually in response to the generic procurement JVs that are being formed in the supply channel as the manufacturers try to offset some of the greater volume discounts. So I guess, I'm just kind of curious to get your thoughts on those particulars within the overall generic inflation picture.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Okay. Yes, a fair question. It's hard to know, again, the drivers for a generic inflation. I think, again, you have to remind yourself that each product is a market, its own market. And so I think, in general, what we look at when we look at products is how many players are in a market. We look at who they are and what their historical patterns are. And that's, I think, the best you can do in analyzing it, whether or not it's in relation to any consolidation of purchasing. I'm not sure I would necessarily say that's the cause because we've been seeing this kind of inflation now for a relatively extended period. So there are probably multiple factors in this. And so we tried to analyze it the best we can, but I would say multiple factors probably.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I mean, does it feel like that was evolving maybe beyond just product supply shortage situations though? Is that kind of a safe [indiscernible]?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. Well, probably yes. It probably is a little bit less debt-driven today than I might have said 1 year ago. That's fair.","Operator","And we'll go now to Garen Sarafian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Jeff, again, congrats on the retirement. And Mike, we all look forward to working with you. There's one -- to just quickly ask on specialty, to touch back on it. As you -- so thank you for the additional visibility, very much appreciate it. So now that you've reached critical mass, I'm just curious to get your view of what the specialty market growth rate as you define the basket, at what rate it's growing. And if you think the next few years that you guys can grow above or at that rate. Just any sort of visibility would be helpful.","George S. Barrett","Yes. I don't know if I can actually give you the exact market growth rate because it's defined so differently. Clearly, what we're seeing as it relates to the new product flow, what's in Phase III trials, we should expect a continued growth in products that we tend to call specialty products. And we get started -- our program -- we get started very early. In drug development, we are looking at every product that's in process. We work sort of in every one of the niches in specialty. And so what I would say is, we expect significant growth in the market. I can't give you an exact number. We feel pretty confident that we will be able to grow our business consistent with that market. And again, starting from a smaller base, I think the growth rates could be a little bit more accelerated. But we're feeling very good about our positioning and our ability to compete in any one of these areas as products start to flow through the FDA and into the market.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And do you think there are any more assets that you could consider through M&A that, for any reason, didn\u2019t qualify a few years back?","George S. Barrett","We've said this before. I'm not -- we continue to look. All of our strategic priorities are areas where we think we have an opportunity to really add value. And so we're doing that obviously organically in terms of our own internal work and our internal investment. But in every one of these areas, we'll continue to look for opportunities externally that we think adds strategic value and where we can execute. So we will not take our foot off the gas pedal at looking at those opportunities. As you know, they don't come up every day. And so we'll pursue this dual strategy of driving organic growth, building our capabilities, using our increasing scale and looking for opportunities externally.","Operator","And we'll go now onto Glen Santangelo from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, just wanted to ask about the Medical segment. I think this is an area that has been a focus for you since you became CEO. And it feels like the company's been constantly investing in this area. And I would say, I think it's fair to say that the profit margins in the segment are probably not where you'd like them. And if we go back to Analyst Day, you laid out some pretty aggressive assumptions over the next several years in terms of the profit margins in that segment. So maybe could you opine on kind of where you think we are at this point and what you see as the keys to success to be able to improve the profit margins in that division?","George S. Barrett","Yes. So generally, as Jeff mentioned earlier, the profit margins in that segment tend to be higher than the profit margins in our Pharma segment. So a, it is accretive to the work in our Medical business is accretive to our margin rate. Number two, we have been seeing some really encouraging work that's affecting our margins, and it really has to do with the mix of products and services that we provide, and that is a huge range of products and services. The areas that we are prioritizing tend to be areas that are actually accretive to our margin rate, and we'll continue to drive those. So we've talked about the consumables area. That's -- those are positive to us. Our growth in the direct-to-patient work that we're doing through Cardinal at Home, that is beneficial to our margin rate. Honestly, it's a midterm driver that we've talked about in terms of preferred products or physician preference items that is accretive to our margin rates. So what I would say is, these are all, for us, priorities because they're really needed, they address real pain points in the system, but they're also beneficial to us in terms of our overall mix and profit. So I'm pretty excited about the work that we're doing and the recent moves we've made, particularly to build that foundation, and the physician preference items is probably a good news story. I don't know if Jeff wants to add.","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. I mean, the goal we gave in Investor Day last December was to achieve a 5.75% operating margin or segment profit margin in Medical in FY '17. And I would say, we've taken the steps to remain on track to achieve that. It's not going to be one smooth ride, right? It's going to be quarters where we need to invest to accelerate certain areas. And there will always be certain parts of the business that may have a blip. In this particular quarter, again, that was probably our blip from an operating perspective given the marketing -- or the market conditions there. But the general trajectory we're on remains on target for the 5.75% that we set for ourself.","George S. Barrett","Okay. And maybe if I can just follow up with one question on the Pharmaceutical segment. Jeff, I jumped on the call late, but I thought I heard you say within your prepared remarks that, that segment benefited from a resolution of some long-standing customer issues of about $20 million. Was that a one-time event in this quarter? And could you maybe give a little bit more color and clarity what that was about?","Jeffrey W. Henderson","Yes. I would describe it as -- well, first of all, we're always resolving customer issues, right, that's between us and our customers, disputes, et cetera, that need to be resolved over time. This particular one in Q1 was relatively large, approximately $20 million, so I'd describe it is one-time-ish given the size of it. And all I'll say about it is, for some time now, we've had certain issues that ultimately got resolved in the quarter. And as a result of that, we were able to pull it through to the bottom line.","Operator","And we will take our final question today from David Toung from Argus Research.","David H. Toung - Argus Research Company","My question is about the physician preference items. And I think, Jeff and George, you talked about investing in it, and you're expecting some better contribution in the back half of the year. Can you just talk a little bit more about these investments and sort of what is it? Is it on the clinical side or is it on the marketing side? And also, if you could just address sort of the customer uptake of these physician preference items or -- I'm not sure. Is it preference items or is it medical devices?","George S. Barrett","So let me do a little defining. These physician preference items are medical devices, so it's just a subset of medical devices, David. So largely, the investment is in a couple of areas: building out the infrastructure and sales force, make sure that we can do what we need to do to get the products in and out of the system. We had some development costs. These are not what I would call research costs in the classic sense. These are more sort of development, making sure that the product line is positioned the way we want. And so for example, just expanding that emerged product line requires some costs. We've got launch activities associated with some of these wound management products. So I think we're a little bit in that stage, but we're pretty excited about the flow of products. And I would say, the customer response is very positive right now. And as Jeff said, we're looking towards the back half with some greater sense of enthusiasm about the flow.","David H. Toung - Argus Research Company","Sure, that's great. Yes, did you have more to say?","George S. Barrett","I'm sorry?","David H. Toung - Argus Research Company","Did you have more?","George S. Barrett","Yes. Just one piece I would add. Since the AccessClosure acquisition has occurred, I would say that the uptake on the product line coming out of AccessClosure has actually been very positive. So again, it's early on negative pressure wound, ortho is just building, but I would say, on that cardio, it's already beginning to show some good results.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the conference over to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks.","George S. Barrett","Well, listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us in what I know is a really busy day for all of you, and it's a bit of a long call. So thanks, again, for your time, and we'll see you all very soon. Thanks.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference, and we do thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sally Curley. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thank you, Kyle, and welcome to this morning's call to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings. With me today are Chairman and CEO, George Barrett, and CFO, Mike Kaufmann. George and Mike will have some prepared comments, and then we'll move into Q&A.","Before I turn the call over to George, since we will be making forward-looking statements, we need to remind you that the matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to the SEC filings and the forward-looking statements provided at the beginning of the presentation found on the Investor page of our website for a description of risks and uncertainties.","We will be ending today's conference call promptly at 9:45 AM. To more efficiently get through our question-and-answer queue, we are limiting each individual to one question with one follow-up. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available if you have additional questions.","Thank you and I'd now like to turn the call over to Cardinal Health Chairman and CEO, George Barrett. George.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Sally, and good morning to everyone joining us on today's call. We had a fairly full conversation with you just two weeks ago, so my commentary this morning will be relatively brief, and I'll let Mike walk you through the numbers.","The quarter came in largely as we expected. Our value proposition is resonating with our customers and our business partners, customer retention is high, and unit growth is solid. As I mentioned on a recent call, the performance in most of our lines of business is strong, and I'd like to highlight a few. Our Specialty Solutions group continues to grow at a good clip well into the double digits. Or Medical\/Surgical business has been performing very well, with help coming from new customers, the strength of our consumables portfolio, and the value of our supply chain services.","In addition, our naviHealth and post-acute activities are extremely attractive to a market going through significant changes, and are also growing at a pace faster than we had originally modeled. Most important, we are seeing that the value of our portfolio is fueling a more broad-based interest in Cardinal Health. With the provider system increasing in complexity, reconfiguring itself, and wrestling with new payment models, we feel confident that we can bring added efficiency, quality, and safety to virtually any system. And the value that we create in serving these providers increases our critical role in helping pharmaceutical, biotech, medical, and lab manufacturers bring their products to the patients they ultimately serve.","Having said this, we have highlighted these past months, and reinforced two weeks ago, the dynamics we've been experiencing around pharmaceutical pricing, particularly in generics, and the impact it has had on our Pharmaceutical segment. There is little for me to add to my commentary from our call on April 18. In summary, we are experiencing pricing deflation in generics, some heightened reimbursement pressures which affect our customers, and a scarcity of new generic launches in the near term. It's these factors, plus some company specific discrete items, which largely informed the fiscal 2017 and early 2018 outlook we provided.","One quick note about our Cordis business. We've said before that we expected our transition activities to cause some lumpiness in our Cordis numbers, which Mike will address. But overall, we were encouraged by our commercial momentum on a global basis. We've recently added some products to our bag which will offer our customers even greater value. We are building a platform off of which we can offer additional products and services globally once we fully integrate the Patient Recovery business we plan to acquire from Medtronic.","I'd like to provide an additional comment specific to our recent conference call. We faced an interesting dilemma two weeks ago. We were extremely pleased to be able to bring our negotiations with Medtronic to the finish line. This is a business that has been on our radar for many years. At the same time, we began to see our early numbers for fiscal 2018 roll-off. And while we always challenge ourselves to improve our numbers as we go through our planning process, we did not want to give you the good news about the acquisition without sharing the important facts that we were seeing in the current market. This has always been our approach with you. We are an organization that will take the necessary actions to improve and adapt to set ourselves up for the long-term.","Our people are competitive, focused, and committed to serving our customers and their patients. And the near-term disturbance in market conditions will not deter us from our obligation to be accountable for performance and our commitment to our customers. We will continue to invest in and drive those activities which differentiate us in the marketplace as a creator of sustainable value.","It is with this in mind that I'm even more excited about the acquisition of Medtronic's Patient Recovery business. As we said two weeks ago, these product lines are natural extensions to the work that we're doing across the continuum of care; from acute care, to surgery centers, to long-term care, into the retail setting, and even to the consumer. These are product areas and channels with which we have enormous experience.","I won't repeat all of the many reasons why we are thrilled about this transaction, but let me summarize by saying that the addition of these businesses increases our scale, our balance, and our relevance to all of our customers. These are products used every day in our global healthcare systems, and this acquisition will leverage all of the tools that we've built over the years to be the daily touch point to the providers of care and their patients.","I'd like to make one more observation about this acquisition. Some of you have asked whether this transaction represents a departure from our Pharmaceutical Distribution business, and the answer is no. As I mentioned earlier, we've had our eye on this business for a long time, and we believe that adding these product lines to our existing portfolio will provide additional value to our customers and to you, our shareholders.","Let me be clear on this. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution business is an important and valued part of an integrated portfolio. While market conditions can from time to time affect any business, we are confident in the value that our best-in-class distribution business provides today and into the future.","I'll finish by reiterating that our portfolio of product and service offerings is strong, valuable to our customers, and increasingly well-balanced. And we are extremely positive about the opportunities in front of us.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike, who'll walk you through the financials.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, George, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. In my comments this morning, I'll first provide some context around our third quarter performance. Then, I'll review the expectations we detailed a couple of weeks ago for our full fiscal year. At this time, we don't have any updates to our FY 2018 or FY 2019 early thoughts we provided on April 18, so I won't say anything more, other than our leadership team has a strong sense of optimism and accountability. We are managing the company with discipline and for the long-term.","Please note that, with all of my comments, I'll begin with GAAP, and then provide the comparable non-GAAP figure. The slide presentation on our website should be a helpful guide throughout this discussion, as it includes our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation tables.","Starting on slide 4 with our consolidated company results, our third-quarter GAAP diluted EPS was $1.20 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.53, an increase of 3% and 7%, respectively. Note that both the GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer outstanding shares as compared to the prior year. Total company revenues grew 4% versus the prior year to $31.8 billion.","Consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin dollars increased by 2% and 1%, respectively. GAAP gross margin rates were down 8 basis points for the quarter, while non-GAAP gross margin rates were down 15 basis points, primarily due to generic pharmaceutical pricing.","Consolidated company SG&A increased 5% from the prior year. Since we have lapped our significant acquisitions, the growth is mainly driven by the costs associated with our pharma IT system refresh, new Medical segment business wins, and Cordis infrastructure expense, partially offset by assumptions around incentive compensation. As you would expect, we continue to be disciplined in our expense management. Both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings declined in the quarter versus the prior year by 8% and 4%, respectively.","Moving below the operating line, net interest and other expense was $41 million, a 7% decrease over the prior year. This decrease was driven by deferred compensation income, which has an equal offset in SG&A expense, so there is no net impact to EPS from this favorable variance. For the third quarter, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.3%, down 4.6 and 4.3 percentage points, respectively, versus the prior year. This improvement was due to a few favorable discrete items in the quarter.","Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 318 million, 13 million fewer shares than the third quarter in the prior year. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares and, as of the end of the quarter, had $443 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program.","During the quarter, we had net operating cash outflows of $198 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance, including short-term investments, of $1.6 billion, with $514 million held outside the United States. While we don't typically provide cash flow forecast or guidance, we do expect to generate significant cash in the fourth quarter. Consequently, as we shared with you on April 18, about $1.6 billion of cash on hand will be used during the first quarter of FY 2018, when we expect to close the purchase of the Patient Recovery business from Medtronic.","Next I will cover segment performance, beginning with this Pharmaceutical segment. Revenues grew 3% to $28.4 billion due to performance from the Specialty Solutions business and growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. Segment profit for the quarter decreased 7% to $611 million. This decrease was driven by generic pharmaceutical pricing, the final quarterly impact of the loss of Safeway, and the investment in our pharmaceutical IT platform. This was partially offset by solid performance from Red Oak Sourcing.","During the third quarter, we began to see planned incremental expenses associated with the first few phases of our pharma IT refresh project. This multiyear project is on-time and on-budget. It will enable us to maintain the excellent service our customers have come to expect from Cardinal Health, provide us with the ability to expand in a cost-efficient manner, and better facilitate our ability to go-to-market as an integrated enterprise.","Finally, our Pharma segment profit margin rate of 2.15% for the quarter was down 25 basis points versus the prior year, largely due to generic pharmaceutical pricing. A couple of other points to note on the quarter, our Specialty Solutions and China businesses saw double-digit bottom-line growth.","Now, I'll move to our Medical segment results. Revenues for the quarter grew a robust 9% to $3.4 billion, driven by contributions from new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased 16% to $148 million, reflecting solid performance from naviHealth, supply chain services, and Cardinal Health consumable products.","The quarter was unusual, in that we saw a decline in Cordis profit. This decline was mostly related to increased SG&A expenses to support our investment in an international infrastructure. This investment will benefit us as we integrate the Patient Recovery business. The increased SG&A expense was partially offset by the net impact of the Cordis inventory adjustments.","Let me explain the third quarter inventory adjustments in more detail. First, this year benefited from the absence of the inventory step-up which we recorded in the prior year. This benefit was largely offset by an increase to an inventory reserve in the quarter \u2013 in the current year. This reserve is an estimate based on information often provided by third parties, including under-the-transition service agreements and from various service providers. During the period, we received more detailed information for this reserve and have adjusted it accordingly.","As both George and I have mentioned in the past, the exit from the transition service and manufacturing agreements could result in some lumpiness to the Cordis earnings, but we fully expect this to diminish as we move forward. We expect Cordis to return to growth in the fourth quarter and are working hard to ensure we have the right infrastructure for the long-term to support our customers and their patients. Segment profit margin rate increased 26 basis points to 4.34% due to the same factors I just mentioned on the segment profit dollars.","Turning to slide number 7, you will see our consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliation for the quarter. The $0.33 variance to non-GAAP diluted EPS results was primarily driven by amortization and other acquisition-related costs.","I'll now update you on our assumptions for the fiscal year. We expect full year 2017 revenue growth to be in the mid to high single-digit percentages, which is a change from our previous outlook of high single-digit growth. One item of note, the actual closing date for the Medtronic transaction we announced on April 18 involves multiple parties, including regulators. Because of this and other factors, we need to quickly be ready to execute the best possible financing to secure attractive terms associated with the acquisition. This means that we could issue debt in the fourth quarter and, if we do, we would see up to $0.05 of financing cost, which is not included in our current fiscal 2017 EPS guidance. We will let you know when we access the debt market and be transparent on the incremental costs.","To reiterate, as we shared with you on April 18, we expect our full year non-GAAP EPS to be at the bottom of our $5.35 to $5.50 range, and this served as the base for our fiscal 2018 early outlook.","Moving on to slide 10 of the presentation, the corporate assumptions around tax rate, shares, and CapEx will be at the low-end of the range, and acquisition-related intangible amortization will now be about $389 million, or $0.81 per share, which does not affect our non-GAAP earnings.","You can turn to slide 11 to see our Pharma segment assumptions for the full fiscal year. We now expect mid to high single-digit percentage revenue growth for 2017, a change from our previous outlook of high single-digit growth. This is largely related to the loss of brand sales associated with the retail network changes at CVS\/pharmacy, which they disclosed in late 2016. Additionally, we now expect full year Pharma segment profit to decline low double digits versus the prior year.","Note, this tightening of the range is primarily due to the previously mentioned generic market pricing, which, while less deflationary than what we saw earlier this year, is still lower than we modeled for the second half of the year. All other Pharma segment assumptions remain unchanged.","On slide 12 you can see there is only one change to our Medical segment assumptions, which is we now expect a high single-digit percentage increase in revenues versus the prior year, up from our previous assumption of mid to high single-digit growth.","Let me close with this. I am confident we are well-positioned and are working on the right things at the right pace for both the near term and long term.","Thanks. And with that, operator, let's go to the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question with Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. You guys guided generic deflation down low double digits for the year. I'm curious if maybe you could just talk a little bit about what you saw in the quarter relative to deflation, and then maybe how that plays into what you're expecting to see in the fourth quarter.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks for the question. As far as the deflation goes in the quarter, we're not going to specifically comment on quarter by quarter deflation rates, other than, as you know, we did update to be \u2013 that deflation for the entire year we now expect to be in the low double digits. So, again, as I emphasized before, it's definitely lower than we had modeled in the second half, but it's improving.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. And then, I guess, if we think about the moving pieces that drive the deflation metric, as you guys have it, next year thinking about it getting back into the mid-single digits, could you just talk about what factors will play into that improvement off of what you're expecting this year? Is it really just a comp issue, or do you have visibility into how that metric will actually improve in fiscal 2018?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. A couple things. First of all, I think one of the biggest things to think about how it will improve next year is if you actually have to break down the individual items and take a look at where the various items are going. And as you do that, what we see in that is there's a very small subset of items that have deflated significantly this year, items you probably might be aware of over the last couple of years at launch that had limited competition, either because they were hard to make or there was raw material issues or those types of things, that were relatively high priced towards the beginning of the year, or higher priced in terms of generics go, and then they deflated significantly during the year.","And what we believe is that subset, that small subset of items which are very material, have really reached probably near the bottom of where they'll be. And so the impact of those items we don't see reoccurring next year, and that has a significant impact on the overall deflation rate for next year. And then when you combine that with all of the other efforts that we have in terms of pricing, sourcing, working with our customers on penetration and things like that, that's why we feel confident about where the overall deflation rate's headed.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Appreciate the comments.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. So on the Medical business, can you just expand a bit on sort of your experience so far in Cordis and how that's gone versus plan? And then, how the new Medtronic business, as that comes in, will both enhance your ex-U.S. strategy as well as your bundle in the U.S., and how you think maybe that could also further synergize your Cordis presence?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Ross, good morning. It's George. Thanks for the question. I'll start, and then Don Casey, our Medical segment CEO, is here with us, so I'll let Don weigh in a little bit. But, by and large, the thing that Mike just described on Cordis has been the hardest part, which is basically ramping up the international infrastructure. Commercially, we're actually feeling very good about the way we're positioning; we're seeing some really interesting growth, particularly outside the U.S., and we're also seeing what we always like to see, which is some demand from our global operations for other services that Cardinal has to offer. And that's always been part of our thesis.","On the commercial side, some things that we see that are very optimistic. I think building up that infrastructure has been one that has taken a little more time than we expected, but we want to get it right. And, as we said, we're building a platform now, and maybe Don could talk a little bit about that.","Don M. Casey - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, and two questions. The first is, how has Cordis impacted our bundle in the U.S., and it's been very positive. I mean, we get a tremendous amount of interest from people that are very familiar with what we would consider kind of our base Cardinal Health businesses, our base brands, which tend to be a little bit more commodity-oriented now that we're moving into something like Cordis, where we can deliver value. It, one, enhances our 360 Program, which we think is important, and that's had particular resonance among our strategic accounts.","Ex-U.S., we're very excited. Look, we built a platform, and George said it very well: it's taken us a little longer, and we've been very careful to create something that we could build a significant foundation on. It's taken us, A, a little bit more time and a little bit more money. But as we looked at the Patient Recovery business that we're getting from Medtronic, we think we're going to be able to slide that right on top of the foundation we've built. And that scale is going to be important in a couple ways.","First, it gives us a lot more critical mass, particularly in Asia and EMEA. We believe that critical mass will allow us to have a comprehensive bundle that will be very relevant to a lot of the acute care customers there. So, we're very optimistic that the foundation we built for Cordis is going to pay dividends as we bring the Patient Recovery business on top of that, when we're able to close the business, hopefully sometime in the first quarter.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And can you just quickly update us on where you are with Kaiser, and how maybe your enhanced relationship there has helped you think through \u2013 obviously, they're a pretty dynamic organization \u2013 helped you think through what you could bring, from a distribution bundle perspective, to other potential key large IDNs in the U.S.?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, Ross, let me start, and then maybe Don will jump in. I want to be careful here, because I never want to speak for a customer. What I can say is, they are, as you mentioned, an incredibly interesting organization. We've built a business model that's really around creating value through efficiency and safety, the ability to standardize, the ability to drive cost, and the ability to actually support that through some of our clinical activities, particularly in post-acute. And I think that overall portfolio is beginning to resonate with a lot of customers. And I think a very \u2013 instead of (25:21) speaking for Kaiser, use them as an example of a highly complex integrated system, I think we're able to create real alignment with their strategies of, how do they make sure that they're treating patients in the right way, in the right setting, at the right cost. And I think that's part of the alignment strategy for us. I don't know if you want to add to that, Don.","Don M. Casey - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Just briefly, George. It's been very interesting. The conversations were \u2013 that we were six months ago, we \u2013 let's make sure that we're able to get this business up and running. It's, again, as George said, a highly complex organization that represented a significant challenge for us. We've met that challenge. We're actually delivering better customer service than they've ever experienced, and now they've begun to sit there and say, these trucks are moving into our facilities, what else can you put into them? And it's really changed the complexion of the conversation to how is this a basic distribution agreement, to how does this become a strategic asset that we can look to become much more efficient as they look to expand their own operating horizons.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, guys.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Ross. Operator, next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. George, I wanted to go back on the generic pricing, and I think last quarter you talked about the sell-side margin for \u2013 sorry, the last call you talked about the sell-side margin pressure. And just wanted to get a sense on what you're seeing currently and whether what \u2013 the actions that you took in terms of revising the guidance down just a short while ago was really sort of maybe a trailing impact of now we've settled out or can you talk about the forward environment, how it looks to you? Thanks.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Right. Thanks, Charles. As you know, this is a hard one to answer. As Mike said, there are things in our control and things that are not. We're doing the things in our control, as Mike said, around sourcing and pricing strategies, et cetera. How the market behaves is more out of our control. Here's what we've done as we modeled this. We try to take sort of exit rates, and we use those based on the real data and the best information we can get from sort of market condition and the feel of what we're seeing in the market and that's basically how we model.","We talked, I think late in the year or early in the calendar year, about some shifting away from the very steep rates that we saw early in the fall. That did look a little better. As Mike said, it has been a bit better than it was last fall, but not I would say a full recovery, sort of the way I would say it. So we've tried to take that data we're seeing, use it real-time, use the experience that our teams have, and then just try to do some basic forward modeling. But always a little hard \u2013 lot of moving parts here and it's always a little hard to get it perfect.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Then \u2013 just a follow up then. Apart from what \u2013 the things that are in your control, if you think about the competitive market for customers, can you talk about how that pricing \u2013 is it fair to say that all your clients are now \u2013 been level-set to the sort of the new prevailing rates, including clients that may not have been up for renewal in the near term?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Right. So let me start with the basics. Again, we've said this before. As you know, this is always a competitive market. I do think that from time-to-time you see activities that seem a little bit more aggressive, and then those tend to stabilize. So, I can't speak for other companies. Everybody has their own renewal cycle. I would say we have limited exposure to major renewals. And most of what happens in the market moves across the system fairly quickly, so that's probably the best way to characterize it.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Cherny with UBS.","Allen Lutz - UBS Securities LLC","This is Allen in for Mike. Thanks for the question. On generic deflation, in some of the drug classes that have matured recently or undergone significant pricing pressure, are you guys seeing manufacturers rationalize production or exit markets entirely? And then, can you talk about how this compares to the past five years or so?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. So let me start. Again, trying to describe the manufacturers when there are this many is, as you can imagine, difficult. It's really each company has its own product line and its own strategy. I think we would expect on some kinds of products, where you wind up with many, many, many competitors, it's not unusual that companies will drop out. So if you wind up as a 12th launch \u2013 with a 12th launch in a product, it's not unusual that one or two players may say, look, we'd rather use our capacity directed in other areas. So I don't know that I could characterize that we've seen a ton of this, but I do think as we think about the nature of the industry, we'll see that from time to time. And we fully expect on given products where there's very mature products with lots of competition that you might see companies come in and out of those markets.","Allen Lutz - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. So, the first question is about the discrete items. George, in your prepared remarks I think you talked about company specific discrete items, which largely impacted fiscal 2017 and (30:46) headwinds in fiscal year 2018. So, can you just help us and give us more detail on what were these items in 2017? And were they included in guidance before or were they incorporated into kind of like the updated outlook that you provided us last week?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, Ricky, good morning. Let me turn it over to Mike actually, and this is really primarily references that we made a few weeks ago on 2018. But, Mike, if you want to...","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ricky. As you can imagine, back on April 18, while we weren't completely closed with the quarter, we had very good line of sight into what the quarter was going to look like. So when I talked about those discrete items, I was taking into account what we expected to see for really the entire full year. So those were given with the knowledge of what was going in the third quarter, so there would be no update \u2013 I'll go through the details, but there would be no update to those four discrete items just because of the actual results in the Q3 are what we see happening in Q4.","Those four items were, first and foremost, the largest was tax and reserve adjustments. And, as you can see, in this quarter this year we mentioned as one of the drivers for the quarter that tax was a positive for us versus the prior year. And we knew that when we gave you some insight a few weeks ago that that would be the largest. So of the greater than $0.50 of discrete items we expect to incur this year that we'll not incur next year, tax and some reserve adjustments that I've talked about was the biggest one.","The second bucket \u2013 and the next three are all similar in size \u2013 would be compensation. You heard me mention that today. So that will be an adjustment year-over-year. Investments in the business where we were very disciplined this year, particularly early on in the year as we knew how things were shaping up to be, very careful in that area and to manage our SG&A expense. And then in P-Mod, which is our Pharma Distribution IT refresh project, we know and have known that as we roll this out, that we're going to be incurring some incremental expenses over the next couple of years, particularly next year is a larger year for us in P-Mod expenses. And so those are the four that add up to the greater than $0.50, with the tax and reserve adjustments being the largest","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then my follow-up is one on brand, one on generic. Mike, I think you talked about the impact to the revenue line from loss of brand sales associated with CVS. So just trying to understand if there is any pull-through also to the profit line. And then on the generic deflation level, your gross profit in the quarter still grew year-over-year. So at what level of generic deflation year-over-year gross profit starts to decline?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. As far as the brand one related to the CVS piece, again, this was all contemplated in the guidance that we had. We had some insight into that, and is low-margin brand sale. And it doesn't really have any pull-through impact to us on generics as far as it goes to CVS. So we feel very comfortable that all of that sales decline is already modeled into our outlook for 2017, as well as our early thoughts on 2018.","As far as generic deflation goes, I'm not sure what more I can talk about on that other than, again, we see it getting better. We feel like we're positioned incredibly well with Red Oak Sourcing and our pricing teams, and it's definitely getting better. Not quite as good as we modeled, but definitely getting better.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks very much. Good morning. George, when we spoke back two weeks ago, one of the things I think you highlighted on the drug distribution side was this idea of renegotiating some contracts specifically around penetration on the generic side. Is that something that's ongoing? You just made comments that you don't have any large renewals this year, but is that something that happens on an ongoing basis? And how should we think about how that will impact the business and the margins going forward?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Lisa, let me let Mike jump in on this one.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Lisa. A couple things on that. I think, we always have a portion of our contracts that are renewing every single year. And when we talk about renewals, we're really talking about those large renewals that are out there and to your point. So there's always independents that are renewing and other acute hospitals and stuff. And so we're constantly looking at our contracts and trying to make sure that they're fair to both the customer and to us. And so where customers are looking for improved branded pricing or improved generic pricing, we're, of course, going to look at things like, okay, then you need to commit to higher percentage of your generics from us. You're going to need to buy more OTC, HBA products from us. You may need to accelerate your terms and pay faster. And so we constantly look, as we model, to make sure we're doing all the right things to pull the levers to be fair to both the customers to meet their needs in the marketplace as well as making sure that we protect our profitability.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, Lisa, I'd just add. We have a pretty comprehensive approach to thinking about the mix and the portfolio, and they are very tailored to the customer. And so I think our team does a pretty good job of really understanding the customer needs here.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Is there a way to think about where penetration is today on generic purchasing and where it potentially could go? When we think about stabilization, my execution would be, in that independent market, that there's less stabilization if you have, obviously, more places that you can buy product. So the more you can lock your customer in on the penetration side, the more stable it will become. So how do we think about where it is today and where it potentially could go as you think about all the other elements that Mike talked about in those conversations?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Lisa, why don't I start just very broadly, generic penetration rate actually varies a fair amount across classes. We think classes tend to be pretty steady. So there are areas \u2013 so, for example, a chain drug tends to be very high. Independent pharmacies have been growing significantly in recent years in their penetration rate. I would say that institutional area is still little bit lower in overall generic penetration rate. And so we're thinking about each of these areas and where there's opportunities.","The other thing that we've talked about in the past is that we still have in the system some purchasers of generic drugs that do a hybrid of buying directly and through a channel partner, and we see those as opportunities. We think we're an extremely efficient sourcer of products and our value proposition downstream is very broad and comprehensive. And so, for us, that's another lever that we think about all the time, which is how do we basically create the incentive and encourage all those players to source their generic through us.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Larsen with Leerink.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Mike, what did you see for brand inflation this past quarter, and what are your expectations for brand inflation for fiscal 2018, please?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. So brand inflation, just a couple comments. As I mentioned earlier, I did say it was just a little bit less than where we expected it to be within the range of the 7% to 9% that we gave in the last quarter. And so it's still tracking within that range, but again, a little lower than we had originally modeled for the quarter in the second half. And that being said, it's a small driver for the second half of the year. And quite honestly, we have been at \u2013 over 85% of our branded agreements are now non-contingent to inflation. I would expect that, if not by the end of FY 2018, definitely during the year, or by the end, we will be at closer to 90%, if not even slightly over 90% by the end of the year.","So, I think what we're \u2013 we're seeing a couple things. One, we're making ourselves less and less dependent upon it. And because it's already gone down from low double digits to more high single, I think the risk of it going significantly lower in the future, I think, is lower also. And so I don't see that as a big driver, one way or the other, for 2018 and, honestly, even probably 2019 and those years going forward, unless there's dramatic changes in the environment.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then you said that generic deflation has improved. Can you give any more color around that, like when exactly did you sort of start seeing this improvement? Was it like in the March of 2017 timeframe? And then, we say things have improved, but we're now expecting sort of double-digit deflation for the full year. Can you put any numbers around \u2013 to go from 11% to say 9% in March? Any more color would be really helpful. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. A couple things. Remember, when we're talking about an entire year rate of low double digits, and it was significantly lower in the first half of the year, so, as you could imagine, what we'd expected it to improve a little bit more, to average out to low double digits for the year. And so, again, it is improving, and the low double digits is an average for the entire year. And you do remember, probably back on one of the other quarter calls, we said we started seeing it get better in the December quarter. There was a lot of noise in there for launches. And, as I said, we see it getting better in the second half, just not as good as we had modeled.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, George and Mike. Just related to a prior question, so on branded manufacture contracting, when trends had begun to moderate a few quarters back, there was the possibility to go back to have a candid two-way dialogue to make the contracts more of a win-win. So have you gone back to successfully update some of those contracts to reflect current trends with any sizable drug partners since then? If there's any sort of a metric you can provide as to what percent has been completed or not.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Hi, Garen. It's George. I'll start, and then let Mike jump in. I think we're going to be careful about describing, in too much detail, any of our proprietary conversations with our manufacturer partners. But you should assume that we are pretty regularly in dialogue with all of our manufacturer partners, and we've worked closely together for years and when there's some shifting around, I think we work hard to make sure that we're getting compensated for the work that we do. And I think those conversations are productive. I don't know if you want to...","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I would add is, my whole comment around going from 85% to at least 90% is all around the success of those agreements, and we're already seeing that rate increase. So you can assume that we've been able to work through some of the conversations with some of the manufacturers, and are continuing to have very productive dialogue with other manufacturers, and that's what's leading to us being able to increase from over 85% to 90% timeframe.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, that was (43:08) useful. And then as a quick follow-up. Related to marketplace M&A, asking in sort of new generic terms, when one of your larger pharmacy clients that purchases both generics and brands from you acquires a substantial asset, set of stores, whatever you want to call it, how do those contracts evolve? Do they simply flow through the current contract typically, or are contracts typically set up where there's a mechanism that initiates a new contract conversation? Anything you could elaborate on there, in generic terms?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yes, Garen, and it's probably going to be disappointing, because it's hard for us to give specifics about these relationships, but it varies all across the board. There are sometimes where the \u2013 built into the agreement is just an extension of what we're doing. Sometimes there's some discussion that has to take place, given a new portfolio and a new mix. So, each story is its own story, I would say. And again, for us to try to characterize this generally would be a mistake.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Operator...","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Willoughby with Credit Suisse.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, George. On the naviHealth upside, what drove that, and how do you get paid for that? Why isn't it a bit more predictable? And then a quick one for Mike. Just, you mentioned a better fourth quarter cash flow experience. But why didn't the working capital accounts, inventories, receivables, payables, trend as well as we'd hoped for in the third quarter? What was the setback there?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Bob, I'll take the first part of it, and turn it over to Mike. I think the naviHealth value proposition is so clearly aligned with what's happening in care. We have an aging population, so the post-acute area is a particular hot button. We know that there's a huge percentage of Medicare spend that occurs in the post-acute setting. So our ability to reduce costs, reduce readmission, reduce time of stay, those are powerful drivers, I think. And almost independent of any short-term policy issues, we know that that's valuable. And I think that's part of what's been steering the attention to naviHealth.","Part of the business model is very steady and predictable on a per-patient per-month basis. Some of it has to do with, what I'll say, gain sharing or savings programs. And so there's going to be some natural \u2013 again, when you use the word lumpiness, it's of course a technical term of Art here (45:35). But there is some natural bumpiness to this, because you have to \u2013 basically you reconcile after a period of time on the share and on the savings that you've created. So some part of that model has that dynamic, but it is a really exciting part of our portfolio and we're thrilled to have it.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah. And as far as working capital goes, Bob, there's nothing fundamental that's changed in the net working capital. In other words, no big vendor term changes or customer mix changes or anything. It's more just the timing around some inventory builds related to some of the IT changes that we're doing and a few other projects that we have going on that we think we'll work through here in the fourth quarter and see significant cash flow in the fourth quarter. But no fundamental changes going on in the net working capital.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","George, is there a new business number or a backlog number, anything like that, for naviHealth we can point to?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Bob, that's a great question. We've never provided that. It just hasn't been part of our public disclosures. All I can say is broadly, the demand for our work in naviHealth is substantial; and at times, I wish we could keep up with it. So we're working really hard to build out the capabilities to make sure that we can support the interest in that kind of, I'm going to say, predictive analytics to help drive patients to the right side of care and to manage them effectively.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","And again, even if there was, just because the agreements take time for the results to pop out, we might indicate what's in the pipeline, but it would still be hard to predict what the savings are until you actually work through the process with the customer.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Bob. Kyle, next question?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.

Looking at the Medical business [Technical Difficulty] (47:41) and they're running high-teens margins and what Medtronic has said about the impact [Technical Difficulty] (47:48) those margins even expanded. When I back out the inventory cost and look at the [Technical Difficulty] (47:54) contribution. And so I know that acquisition cost...","Sally J.

If you're on a cell phone, we're getting kind of every other word.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Guys, well, let me put it simply. The Medical Patient Recovery businesses, is there an expectation for cost and transition services that's going to weigh on the margin relative to what we saw at Covidien?","George S.

So I think one of the things that has been a great learning on the Cordis thing is, particularly in the international operations, the work that we need to do to ensure that there's no disruption to the patients. So I think we've done that work, and as we did the business planning and the modeling for this acquisition, we took all the learnings from that international work that we did with Cordis, and it was applied into our model. So we feel very good about that.","The second thing I would just add is that on the international side, we are building out those capabilities to support Cordis. And so, as Don said, I think we'll start to see a framework that we can roll business onto internationally. I guess, the third point would be, proportionally, more of the Patient Recovery business is actually in the U.S., and that's riding on a system that we know and use every day with our consumables business. We will have some transition agreements on the Patient Recovery business, but I think we've modeled those very carefully. Mike, you want to add something to this?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, just a couple things. Related to the transition service agreements, transition manufacturing agreements, we actually have them going both ways. And so both companies are highly invested in each other's success here. So I think that will be an important thing as we work through those, and I think that's important. A couple other learnings is, on the Cordis piece, the U.S. piece has gone really well, in terms of infrastructure, has gone right according to plan. And remember that this Patient Recovery business is largely U.S., and so we feel really good about our back office capabilities in the U.S.","And as George mentioned, ex-U.S, we are definitely going to be able to leverage what we're doing with Cordis on the Patient Recovery business. And then just two other quick things is, I think we've done a very nice job in managing the R&D mix in terms of expenses and managing that. Don and team have been able to manage that well, really held onto sales momentum and actually created some. And just to wrap it up, from my point is that we did mention too, that the Cordis business would return to growth in Q4.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","One thing I might want to add, just to make sure we're totally clear on this. So there are costs associated with the transition agreements, but I think what we're saying is we've built those in. So I don't want to suggest there's cost. Transition agreements temporarily create some costs, but I think we've modeled those very effectively and we've taken all the learning from the Cordis to make sure we're doing that very well outside the U.S.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. George or Mike, the sell-side pricing pressure that you guys have talked about the last couple of quarters for generics, have you seen any of that bleed into either traditional brand or specialty?","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","No, I wouldn't think so. I would say that the repricing has been normal in the brand and specialty. It's hard. The only reason you heard a little bit of a hesitation is they're all kind of bid as one basket, right? And so if you just look at a customer who was buying brand from us in one year to the next, I wouldn't say there's been anything unusual at all from any erosion on that. That tends to be \u2013 it flows right off of the WACC manufacturer price, whereas the generics is more of a market price that adjusts up and down on a daily basis. So they're very different markets, but no, nothing of concern in the brand or specialty market that I would call out.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. And then a question for Don was in Medical. Once you complete the Medtronic asset purchase, does that sort of complete your sort of shopping list to build out a cardinal brand, or are there other categories where you have a high level of interest in adding?","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Don, give a go and I'll jump in.","Don M. Casey - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Look, once we complete this, it's going to take us a little while to digest this business and really make sure we're optimizing this and Cordis, and that's going to take us a fair amount of time, talent, and treasure to get that done. Once we are finished that, we'll put our head up and see where we want to go. But right now, we feel very good about the fact that we've built a really strong group of products, of services, that are really putting together a pretty compelling offer that's winning in the marketplace. So we're going to focus on making sure we do a great job on integrating the Patient Recovery business, and then we'll go from there.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, John.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Steven Valiquette with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, George and Mike. So I do hate to beat the generic questions to death, but just a high-level question on the sequential flow of generic drug profits from the March quarter to the June quarter. Your phrase that generic pricing is worse than expected, but getting better is still, I think, turning some of us off a little bit. I guess the question is, if we were to isolate just your generic drug profits for the upcoming June quarter versus the March quarter just reported, in your budgeting do you expect directionally that those generic profits would be down sequentially? Could they still be flattish sequentially, or could they even be up? Because you keep talking about the \"generic pricing getting better.\" So maybe the sequential conversation might help us out a little bit. Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","That's hard to do. Let me see if I can help a little bit. Again, the low double digits is an annual rate, and so if you start with a higher double digits number in the first half of the year, you have to see second half has to be better, and again, we are seeing it better than the first half, but not quite as good as what we had expected. Again, if you just take a look at the curve is \u2013 what we're saying is better means it's less steep on the curve, and so the declines are less in the second half.","Now we've always, historically, typically get deflation and we've just seen over the last few years some unique sets of items seeing significant inflation that have offset that. So I think it's hard to just look at the deflation as one single component. To me, the key is that curve being less steep, but at the same time, using Red Oak and our customer mix and our other initiatives to continue to drive down costing even more so that we can begin to either maintain or grow our margins. That to me is one of the keys that we're clearly working on.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And one quick follow-up. I think I heard a comment from you guys about the CVS revenues being a little bit softer and that prompted a little bit lower revenue outlook for the Pharma segment. But did that get worse as the March quarter progressed, the CVS revenues and prompted you to lower the revenue guidance now from them or are you just sort of playing catch-up on some trends that have been in place since January? Thanks.","Michael C. Kaufmann - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Yeah, that's really the news that CVS had given at late in calendar 2016 around some of the contract changes that they had. And so we saw that hit us early right in the quarter, and so we saw the impact in the March quarter, we projected it into our Q4 and through next year. So this all contemplated in everything that we've given you in terms of brand sales and our impact on the revenue line and the bottom line, and so it is low-margin brand sales and so we don't see it having a significant impact to it. But again, everything that it does have and any impact is already contemplated in all of the 2017 and 2018 guidance that we've given to you guys.","Sally J. Curley - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Steve. Kyle, is there anybody else?","Operator","We have no further questions in queue. I would now like to turn the conference back over to George Barrett for any additional or closing remarks.","George S. Barrett - Cardinal Health, Inc.","Thanks, Kyle. Thanks all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking to all of you in the coming days and weeks. And with that, have a good day. We'll talk soon.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect."]}}
